I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And today on the show, reshaping evolution - can breakthroughs in altering and controlling our genes herald the next scientific revolution? And it's not just for humans, but for animals, too. Take a little creature named Elizabeth Ann. RYAN PHELAN: Elizabeth Ann is the most beautiful black-footed ferret. ZOMORODI: She has dark eyes, little pink ears and white whiskers. And she's also kind of a genetic miracle. PHELAN: She was cloned from a cell line that had been preserved 30-plus years ago. That's what's amazing about her. ZOMORODI: Ryan Phelan is the co-founder and executive director of Revive & Restore. PHELAN: We're a nonprofit based in California. And our mission is to enhance biodiversity by trying to bring biotechnology to conservation. ZOMORODI: That means using a wide range of genetic editing and engineering tools to rescue a species that would otherwise go extinct, which almost happened to the black-footed ferret. PHELAN: The black-footed ferret lived all across the American prairie, all the way from the borders of Mexico to the Canadian border. And they live synergistically with the prairie dog in those prairie dog burrows. And, in fact, a prairie dog is its primary source of food. And, of course, the prairie dogs have been considered varmints by many cattle ranchers, which is unfortunate because they actually do improve the grasslands. But cattle ranchers, you know, decades ago got it in their mind that these prairie dogs were competing with the cattle, and they wanted to remove them from the landscape. And so as prairie dogs started to disappear, so did the black-footed ferrets. ZOMORODI: And things got so bad for the black-footed ferret that at one point it was thought to be completely extinct, right? PHELAN: Well, actually, Manoush, it was twice thought to be extinct. ZOMORODI: Oh. PHELAN: And so, you know, this is a species that was first on the brink of extinction in the, you know, mid-1800s, and then they thought they were gone. And then they found small populations, and those disappeared. And then it was declared extinct when - if you could believe it - a cattle rancher's dog brought in a dead ferret. ZOMORODI: No way. PHELAN: Yeah. They - the ranchers looked at what he had in his mouth and he went, oh, my God; it's a black-footed ferret. So they, you know, started hunting around on their property, and they found - I think it was something like - 18 different individual ferrets. And they brought them into captivity. And U. S. Fish and Wildlife ever since, as part of an endangered species program, has been breeding those ferrets in captivity and then releasing them very successfully back into the wild. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: I mean, it's amazing. So it dwindles down to this one 18-member colony - these little ferrets who then are taken in and bred in captivity. And, I mean, is that the story - like, yay, we saved the black-footed ferret - or not that simple? PHELAN: Well, they - you know, they did save the black-footed ferret. But here's the rub. Of those 18 ferrets that were brought into captivity, only seven of them went on to breed. And what that means is even though over 10,000 ferrets have been born and bred in captivity and released into the wild, all the ferrets that are out there today are basically siblings or half siblings. And we all know that that is not great for the gene pool. ZOMORODI: No. PHELAN: (Laughter) And what's interesting to me about the black-footed ferret is it is in many ways emblematic of what happens to endangered species all over the globe. Once you get these small, fragmented populations, the genetic diversity decreases. And when you start to lose genetic diversity, you decrease their resilience in many ways. It can cause fitness problems. It can cause breeding problems. ZOMORODI: And that brings us back to Elizabeth Ann - because cloning is a way around this problem of not having enough ferrets in the gene pool. PHELAN: Yes. So reaching back into time, 30 years ago, we actually discovered something really unique. What we learned when we looked at the genomics of the cell line that was, you know, presciently banked by the San Diego Frozen Zoo back in 1985 was that one of these ferrets, which was actually named Willa, had at - when we did the sequencing, we learned she had three times more genetic variation than any other living ferret. So Elizabeth Ann is a genetic twin of Willa. And Willa never had any offspring. And since the cloning of Elizabeth Ann, we've done further studies. And with new levels of genomic sequencing, we've learned that Elizabeth Ann, this adorable young ferret, has ten times more genetic variation than any living ferret today. That makes her an eighth founder. And that means that her offspring will carry new genetic variation that will help the species in their long-term survival. ZOMORODI: I mean, Ryan, just put it in context for us. How big a deal is it that she is the world's first successfully cloned black-footed ferret? PHELAN: Well, I think for conservation, it's a huge deal. It's a milestone for conservation. Cloning has not been used for conservation purposes to actually increase the genetic variation before. They - it has been done in a couple of species for the purpose of seeing if you could actually clone from a frozen cell line. But it was never done as specifically as we are doing, saying these are unique genes, and it's going to be part of a breeding program. That's the profound part of it. ZOMORODI: Here's Ryan Phelan on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PHELAN: Now, these genetic rescue stories could not have happened without the collaboration of multiple partners and the tools of biotechnology. Emerging technologies of genetic engineering hold the promise of helping species adapt to climate change, solve wildlife disease problems and even help solve invasive species problems. But very often, these technologies never get out of the starting gate because the fear of unintended consequences absolutely stymies even the most basic innovation at the get-go. Probably there's no more urgent need to overcome some of this reluctance to use these technologies than in the case of coral. Coral, as many of you know, are the most diverse and rich ecosystems in the world. And yet, sadly, 50% of the Great Barrier Reef has been lost already to climate change and environmental degradation. Estimates predict that by 2050, we could lose as much as 90% of the coral in the world. There is hope. Scientists around the world are utilizing new technologies to crowd preserve even living coral fragments that can be transplanted onto artificial reefs. This is just the beginning of some of the work that is pioneering and can happen. I'm most excited about the use of the new technologies for developing stem cells. Now, these stem cells could be used to actually genome edit in thermal resilience to warming oceans. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Ryan, let me see if I understand this because I think your example might give some people pause. You are talking about engineering coral using something like CRISPR to maybe splice out or add a gene that would make it more resistant to warming waters, make it survive. I mean, that is basically changing the fundamental DNA of a coral species and then putting it back into the ocean. PHELAN: Well, it could be, Manoush. That is certainly the engineering approach to it is - would be to use something like a CRISPR technology. And it could be that, you know, you're basically turning on a gene that exists but has been knocked out for some reason over time. But I think other scientists right now are saying we can also use genomics to understand which coral do better and literally transplant them - physically transplant them from one area of a reef to another where they could do better. So you know, there's kind of gradations of intervention. And obviously, you want to do the least intervention possible with the least risk. ZOMORODI: Yeah. Can we talk about the potential downsides? - because there are some people who would say, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We humans have intervened enough. Some people might say, you know, survival of the fittest is how it's worked for millennia. Other people might say, you know - (laughter) I don't know - look at \"Jurassic Park. \" The dinosaurs may not behave the way you want them to. So what do you hear that the fear is about? PHELAN: Well, I think very often when people hear about anything really innovative, you get a knee-jerk response of, you know, why? You know, what could possibly go wrong here? And you know, it's just sort of an inherent kind of knee-jerk reaction that I think, unfortunately, really puts a lot of innovation at risk because you're not looking at what could possibly go right. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PHELAN: This question comes up so often with any innovation in science. We decided to actually identify just how often, when humans intervene, did they cause the disasters that people fear so much. And yes, your classic stories of humans intervening in nature and causing disasters like intentionally releasing the poisonous cane toad to Australia. Back in 1935, the sugarcane industry brought this invasive, poisonous cane toad in to solve their problem with beetles in their crops. It didn't do much for the beetles, and instead, since 1935, it has continued to work its way across Australia, leaving nothing in its wake and killing native species all along the way. These disasters stoked the minds of people about fear of intervention, and yet they happened in an era when there was little regard for the overall environmental ecosystem. And they were done, in some cases, even with profit motivation in mind. They weren't done for conservation benefit. And sadly, we never hear about the success stories. So when we looked at the research about what *****PHELAN: *** happens when conservation intend to intervene in nature, we found a very different story. All across the globe, for over a century, scientists have been introducing and reintroducing plants and animals with no environmental harm. There have been literally thousands of introductions of native species back into their range that have been incredibly successful across the board. And I think often, these introductions happen completely out of sight and without public acknowledgement that they're even going on. We take it for granted. But, you know, it's a highly curated natural world out there today. And most of it is incredibly successful. ZOMORODI: So speaking of a highly curated natural world, there's been some controversy over something that's called de-extinction, where scientists are working to actually bring species back after they've gone extinct, like the woolly mammoth, which is another project that Revive and Restore has been involved in, right? PHELAN: We were involved at the get-go of the big, audacious idea of the woolly mammoth. And we've been working over the last eight years with Dr. George Church. And he has just recently formed a company called Colossal. It is a for-profit venture to bring the woolly mammoth back and to bring woolly mammoths back to Siberia, with the idea that the cold-adapted Asian elephant could actually help mitigate some of the effects of climate change. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)PHELAN: The idea is to use a surrogate species as the scaffold and to then change traits incrementally, genetically through CRISPR technology so that you get more and more the traits of the original species that you're trying to, quote, \"de-extinct. \" But, Manoush, the truth is the work that we do at Revive and Restore is really trying to help save those species that are moving towards extinction and to bring them back from the brink of extinction. ZOMORODI: So if somebody listening is saying, like, we humans have screwed up enough things. We think that we are like gods. I mean, that phrase, I know, is very familiar to you. PHELAN: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: What do you say to them? PHELAN: I say that, you know, we have been playing with nature too much. You know, that's why we have the challenges that we have with climate change. We just haven't been doing it with the best intention. And we can now do it with intention. We can now do it in a way that we can help minimize the risk and maximize the benefit of our interventions. ZOMORODI: There are some environmentalists who say, if we think we can use new technologies like those you've described in the gene toolbox, to save species, to bring some back, then people are going to think that they can keep living the way they're living and not try and stop global warming, stop releasing so much CO2 because we think, oh, well, we'll just use more technology to fix it. PHELAN: Oh, Manoush, I hear that so often. ZOMORODI: Do you? PHELAN: I do. And it's often referred to as the moral hazard. You know, if you makes something sound like a simplistic solution, then we'll let, you know, everything go to hell in a handbasket. I don't think that's true. I think that people understand that when we intervene in nature, we also need to do everything we can to protect nature. These are tools of biotechnology - are ones that you don't want to have to deploy. If we could have healthy coral all by itself and reverse all the trends that we see with climate change, that would be an ideal world. But the truth is it's not going to happen overnight, no matter how hard we work. I think people can understand that we can use new tools, and we can protect species. And it is an important narrative to get out there that people need to stop thinking about inaction and to start thinking about action. ZOMORODI: That's Ryan Phelan.

And you've been listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   It's the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And today on the show, reshaping evolution - can breakthroughs in altering and controlling our genes herald the next scientific revolution? And it's not just for humans, but for animals, too. Take a little creature named Elizabeth Ann. RYAN PHELAN: Elizabeth Ann is the most beautiful black-footed ferret. ZOMORODI: She has dark eyes, little pink ears and white whiskers. And she's also kind of a genetic miracle. PHELAN: She was cloned from a cell line that had been preserved 30-plus years ago. That's what's amazing about her. ZOMORODI: Ryan Phelan is the co-founder and executive director of Revive & Restore. PHELAN: We're a nonprofit based in California. And our mission is to enhance biodiversity by trying to bring biotechnology to conservation. ZOMORODI: That means using a wide range of genetic editing and engineering tools to rescue a species that would otherwise go extinct, which almost happened to the black-footed ferret. PHELAN: The black-footed ferret lived all across the American prairie, all the way from the borders of Mexico to the Canadian border. And they live synergistically with the prairie dog in those prairie dog burrows. And, in fact, a prairie dog is its primary source of food. And, of course, the prairie dogs have been considered varmints by many cattle ranchers, which is unfortunate because they actually do improve the grasslands. But cattle ranchers, you know, decades ago got it in their mind that these prairie dogs were competing with the cattle, and they wanted to remove them from the landscape. And so as prairie dogs started to disappear, so did the black-footed ferrets. ZOMORODI: And things got so bad for the black-footed ferret that at one point it was thought to be completely extinct, right? PHELAN: Well, actually, Manoush, it was twice thought to be extinct. ZOMORODI: Oh. PHELAN: And so, you know, this is a species that was first on the brink of extinction in the, you know, mid-1800s, and then they thought they were gone. And then they found small populations, and those disappeared. And then it was declared extinct when - if you could believe it - a cattle rancher's dog brought in a dead ferret. ZOMORODI: No way. PHELAN: Yeah. They - the ranchers looked at what he had in his mouth and he went, oh, my God; it's a black-footed ferret. So they, you know, started hunting around on their property, and they found - I think it was something like - 18 different individual ferrets. And they brought them into captivity. And U. S. Fish and Wildlife ever since, as part of an endangered species program, has been breeding those ferrets in captivity and then releasing them very successfully back into the wild. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: I mean, it's amazing. So it dwindles down to this one 18-member colony - these little ferrets who then are taken in and bred in captivity. And, I mean, is that the story - like, yay, we saved the black-footed ferret - or not that simple? PHELAN: Well, they - you know, they did save the black-footed ferret. But here's the rub. Of those 18 ferrets that were brought into captivity, only seven of them went on to breed. And what that means is even though over 10,000 ferrets have been born and bred in captivity and released into the wild, all the ferrets that are out there today are basically siblings or half siblings. And we all know that that is not great for the gene pool. ZOMORODI: No. PHELAN: (Laughter) And what's interesting to me about the black-footed ferret is it is in many ways emblematic of what happens to endangered species all over the globe. Once you get these small, fragmented populations, the genetic diversity decreases. And when you start to lose genetic diversity, you decrease their resilience in many ways. It can cause fitness problems. It can cause breeding problems. ZOMORODI: And that brings us back to Elizabeth Ann - because cloning is a way around this problem of not having enough ferrets in the gene pool. PHELAN: Yes. So reaching back into time, 30 years ago, we actually discovered something really unique. What we learned when we looked at the genomics of the cell line that was, you know, presciently banked by the San Diego Frozen Zoo back in 1985 was that one of these ferrets, which was actually named Willa, had at - when we did the sequencing, we learned she had three times more genetic variation than any other living ferret. So Elizabeth Ann is a genetic twin of Willa. And Willa never had any offspring. And since the cloning of Elizabeth Ann, we've done further studies. And with new levels of genomic sequencing, we've learned that Elizabeth Ann, this adorable young ferret, has ten times more genetic variation than any living ferret today. That makes her an eighth founder. And that means that her offspring will carry new genetic variation that will help the species in their long-term survival. ZOMORODI: I mean, Ryan, just put it in context for us. How big a deal is it that she is the world's first successfully cloned black-footed ferret? PHELAN: Well, I think for conservation, it's a huge deal. It's a milestone for conservation. Cloning has not been used for conservation purposes to actually increase the genetic variation before. They - it has been done in a couple of species for the purpose of seeing if you could actually clone from a frozen cell line. But it was never done as specifically as we are doing, saying these are unique genes, and it's going to be part of a breeding program. That's the profound part of it. ZOMORODI: Here's Ryan Phelan on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PHELAN: Now, these genetic rescue stories could not have happened without the collaboration of multiple partners and the tools of biotechnology. Emerging technologies of genetic engineering hold the promise of helping species adapt to climate change, solve wildlife disease problems and even help solve invasive species problems. But very often, these technologies never get out of the starting gate because the fear of unintended consequences absolutely stymies even the most basic innovation at the get-go. Probably there's no more urgent need to overcome some of this reluctance to use these technologies than in the case of coral. Coral, as many of you know, are the most diverse and rich ecosystems in the world. And yet, sadly, 50% of the Great Barrier Reef has been lost already to climate change and environmental degradation. Estimates predict that by 2050, we could lose as much as 90% of the coral in the world. There is hope. Scientists around the world are utilizing new technologies to crowd preserve even living coral fragments that can be transplanted onto artificial reefs. This is just the beginning of some of the work that is pioneering and can happen. I'm most excited about the use of the new technologies for developing stem cells. Now, these stem cells could be used to actually genome edit in thermal resilience to warming oceans. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: Ryan, let me see if I understand this because I think your example might give some people pause. You are talking about engineering coral using something like CRISPR to maybe splice out or add a gene that would make it more resistant to warming waters, make it survive. I mean, that is basically changing the fundamental DNA of a coral species and then putting it back into the ocean. PHELAN: Well, it could be, Manoush. That is certainly the engineering approach to it is - would be to use something like a CRISPR technology. And it could be that, you know, you're basically turning on a gene that exists but has been knocked out for some reason over time. But I think other scientists right now are saying we can also use genomics to understand which coral do better and literally transplant them - physically transplant them from one area of a reef to another where they could do better. So you know, there's kind of gradations of intervention. And obviously, you want to do the least intervention possible with the least risk. ZOMORODI: Yeah. Can we talk about the potential downsides? - because there are some people who would say, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We humans have intervened enough. Some people might say, you know, survival of the fittest is how it's worked for millennia. Other people might say, you know - (laughter) I don't know - look at \"Jurassic Park. \" The dinosaurs may not behave the way you want them to. So what do you hear that the fear is about? PHELAN: Well, I think very often when people hear about anything really innovative, you get a knee-jerk response of, you know, why? You know, what could possibly go wrong here? And you know, it's just sort of an inherent kind of knee-jerk reaction that I think, unfortunately, really puts a lot of innovation at risk because you're not looking at what could possibly go right. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PHELAN: This question comes up so often with any innovation in science. We decided to actually identify just how often, when humans intervene, did they cause the disasters that people fear so much. And yes, your classic stories of humans intervening in nature and causing disasters like intentionally releasing the poisonous cane toad to Australia. Back in 1935, the sugarcane industry brought this invasive, poisonous cane toad in to solve their problem with beetles in their crops. It didn't do much for the beetles, and instead, since 1935, it has continued to work its way across Australia, leaving nothing in its wake and killing native species all along the way. These disasters stoked the minds of people about fear of intervention, and yet they happened in an era when there was little regard for the overall environmental ecosystem. And they were done, in some cases, even with profit motivation in mind. They weren't done for conservation benefit. And sadly, we never hear about the success stories. So when we looked at the research about what ***** PHELAN: *** happens when conservation intend to intervene in nature, we found a very different story. All across the globe, for over a century, scientists have been introducing and reintroducing plants and animals with no environmental harm. There have been literally thousands of introductions of native species back into their range that have been incredibly successful across the board. And I think often, these introductions happen completely out of sight and without public acknowledgement that they're even going on. We take it for granted. But, you know, it's a highly curated natural world out there today. And most of it is incredibly successful. ZOMORODI: So speaking of a highly curated natural world, there's been some controversy over something that's called de-extinction, where scientists are working to actually bring species back after they've gone extinct, like the woolly mammoth, which is another project that Revive and Restore has been involved in, right? PHELAN: We were involved at the get-go of the big, audacious idea of the woolly mammoth. And we've been working over the last eight years with Dr. George Church. And he has just recently formed a company called Colossal. It is a for-profit venture to bring the woolly mammoth back and to bring woolly mammoths back to Siberia, with the idea that the cold-adapted Asian elephant could actually help mitigate some of the effects of climate change. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) PHELAN: The idea is to use a surrogate species as the scaffold and to then change traits incrementally, genetically through CRISPR technology so that you get more and more the traits of the original species that you're trying to, quote, \"de-extinct. \" But, Manoush, the truth is the work that we do at Revive and Restore is really trying to help save those species that are moving towards extinction and to bring them back from the brink of extinction. ZOMORODI: So if somebody listening is saying, like, we humans have screwed up enough things. We think that we are like gods. I mean, that phrase, I know, is very familiar to you. PHELAN: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: What do you say to them? PHELAN: I say that, you know, we have been playing with nature too much. You know, that's why we have the challenges that we have with climate change. We just haven't been doing it with the best intention. And we can now do it with intention. We can now do it in a way that we can help minimize the risk and maximize the benefit of our interventions. ZOMORODI: There are some environmentalists who say, if we think we can use new technologies like those you've described in the gene toolbox, to save species, to bring some back, then people are going to think that they can keep living the way they're living and not try and stop global warming, stop releasing so much CO2 because we think, oh, well, we'll just use more technology to fix it. PHELAN: Oh, Manoush, I hear that so often. ZOMORODI: Do you? PHELAN: I do. And it's often referred to as the moral hazard. You know, if you makes something sound like a simplistic solution, then we'll let, you know, everything go to hell in a handbasket. I don't think that's true. I think that people understand that when we intervene in nature, we also need to do everything we can to protect nature. These are tools of biotechnology - are ones that you don't want to have to deploy. If we could have healthy coral all by itself and reverse all the trends that we see with climate change, that would be an ideal world. But the truth is it's not going to happen overnight, no matter how hard we work. I think people can understand that we can use new tools, and we can protect species. And it is an important narrative to get out there that people need to stop thinking about inaction and to start thinking about action. ZOMORODI: That's Ryan Phelan.

NABIHA SAKLAYEN: Imagine you're having some strange symptoms, and you don't really know what they are. ZOMORODI: This is Nabiha Saklayen. SAKLAYEN: You're feeling a lot of tremors. Your muscles are stiff. You're having difficulty thinking and understanding. And you go to your doctor because you want to know what's going on. ZOMORODI: And they run tests - a whole host of them. They order neurological exams, look at your family history, measure your agility, muscle tone, balance. And then. . . SAKLAYEN: And then you find out that you have Parkinson's disease, which is devastating news. And I've had family members who've had to go through that. And it's a very, very tough moment to realize you have something that's going to completely change your life, and you might have these symptoms forever. ZOMORODI: Today, your doctor would review your options with you - medications you can take, lifestyle changes to make, how to manage a disease which has no cure. SAKLAYEN: But. . . ZOMORODI: But Nabiha is working towards a different outcome. SAKLAYEN: What if I told you there is a different future ahead for us? What if your doctor, instead of saying, OK, we're going to be treating your symptoms, your doctor actually says, no, we're going to be able to cure this disease? And the way that works is you drop off a blood sample. Those blood cells are shipped off to a cell factory to generate brand new neurons that are customized just for you. You come back the next week, and a surgeon transplants those neurons into your brain, and you just received a cure for Parkinson's. ZOMORODI: OK, wait, let me see if I get this right. Take some blood cells, turn them into new neurons, put them in the right places in the damaged part of the brain, and you can essentially cure Parkinson's. SAKLAYEN: Exactly. Yeah. ZOMORODI: I mean, Nabiha, I got to say, it sounds like science fiction. SAKLAYEN: It does sound like science fiction, but what's amazing is, most of the pieces of the puzzle have been figured out. We know how to make patient-specific cells. We know how to transplant them into the right part of the brain. We've seen these transplants happen in patients. And the results are very, very promising. And now we just have to figure out manufacturing. How do we make these cells in a fully automated way, make them super cheap? And that's what I'm working on with my team. ZOMORODI: For years, we've heard that stem cells may eventually cure diseases and treat illnesses - that by genetically engineering them, they could fix our ailing bodies. Now, though it's still early, promising new technologies are getting us closer, in labs like those at Nabiha's company, Cellino. SAKLAYEN: We're automating the generation of personalized human cells. And these cells can be used for a range of therapeutic applications. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SAKLAYEN: And because they're 100% your cells, your immune system is extremely unlikely to reject or attack those cells. ZOMORODI: Nabiha Saklayen picks up this idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SAKLAYEN: In fact, the body has no idea that these cells were actually made in a cell factory. All of this is possible because of a breakthrough at the intersection of biology, laser physics and machine learning. We'll start with biology. The human body is an absolute miracle. Trillions of cells are working in synchronicity to pump blood, secrete dopamine and let me see and speak to you right now. But as we age, our cells age, too. That's why our skin starts to sag, our cartilage wears away and your five-mile run might turn into a 20-minute walk. Yes, we're all getting older. Our bodies are ticking time bombs. But stem cells could offer a solution. ZOMORODI: All right. So stem cells - remind us, why are they so useful? SAKLAYEN: Yes. Stem cells are these very special cell types that have the code in them to become any cell type in the body. In our natural state of existence, we don't have absolutely 100% pure stem cells in the body anymore because they've evolved into becoming different subsets of cells in the body. But it's possible now to generate really high-quality stem cells for each and every patient, for each and every adult, that look very much like embryonic cells. ZOMORODI: Scientists can make stem cells. SAKLAYEN: Absolutely. They're called induced pluripotent stem cells, and these stem cells open up the possibility to generate neurons on demand, heart cells on demand, skin on demand, hair on demand. You name it. You can make any cell type. . . ZOMORODI: Wow. SAKLAYEN: . . . Where we know the biology of how to change the stem cell to the target cell type. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SAKLAYEN: Now, unfortunately, stem cells are notoriously difficult to engineer. One fundamental problem relates to how they're made, which involves taking a patient's blood cells and adding chemicals to those blood cells to turn them into stem cells. Now, during this chemical process, you never end up with a perfect set of stem cells. In fact, you get a very messy plate of cells going in different directions - towards the eye, brain, liver. And every random cell must be removed. Until recently, the main way to remove cells was by hand. I remember the first time I visited the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. I watched a highly skilled scientist sitting at a bench, looking at stem cells, evaluating them one at a time and removing the unwanted cells by hand. It's a slow, tedious and artisanal process, which is why generating a personalized stem cell bank today costs about $1 million. Right now, there are phase one/two clinical trials - one that's already launched in the U. S. - for personalized iPSC-based therapies. All of these groups have made enough patient-specific stem cells and therapies and derived tissues ***SAKLAYEN: *** by hand. And that's maybe 10, 15 or 20 patients. ZOMORODI: That's it. SAKLAYEN: That's it. Right. So when you think about a phase three trial, you may need hundreds of patients, and there literally aren't enough scientists that can make those cells by hand. And, of course, it becomes very, very expensive. Running a phase three clinical trial would cost $300 million, which is not. . . ZOMORODI: Wow. SAKLAYEN: . . . Feasible in most instances. ZOMORODI: OK. And this is where, presumably, your work comes in, Nabiha. SAKLAYEN: Yes. So when I came into the biology space - so just a quick background. I'm a physicist by training. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SAKLAYEN: When I started my Ph. D. , I joined a laser physics lab because lasers are the coolest. But I also decided to dabble in biology. I started using lasers to engineer human cells. And when I talked to biologists about it, they were amazed. Here's why - scientists are always looking for ways to make biology more precise. Sometimes cell culture can feel a lot like cooking. Take some chemicals, put it in a pot, stir it, heat it, see what happens, try it all over again. In contrast, lasers are so precise. You can target one cell in millions at precise intervals every second, every minute, every hour. I realized that instead of doing this tedious process of stem cell culture by hand, we could use lasers to remove the unwanted cells. And to automate the entire process, we decided to use machine learning to identify those unwanted cells and zap them. Here's how it works - take some blood cells, put it in a cassette, add chemicals to those blood cells to turn them into stem cells, like always. Now, instead of having a human look for those unwanted cells and remove them by hand, the machine identifies the unwanted cells and zaps them with a laser. As you can see, this entire process happens by machine. The computer decides when and how often to prune the cells and uses a fully automated system to run the process. After repeated pruning, you end up with a perfect culture of your stem cells ready to be banked and used at any time. ZOMORODI: Nabiha, we talked about how, hypothetically, a brain with Parkinson's could be repaired using stem cells - IPSCs. But to be clear, stem cells are already being used to treat leukemia and other types of blood cancers. I've also read about them being used to restore a patient's eyesight in clinical trials. So so far, it seems pretty promising. SAKLAYEN: Yes. And just this past month, there's been an amazing result that was put out into the world by the Vertex team where they tested one patient with a dose of new insulin-producing cells. And this patient is not having to use insulin injections anymore. So that has happened in the past month, and it's tremendous. And now it's all about figuring out what is the right format for the specific cell therapy, how many cells should be transplanted, how to get around the immune evasion problems and how to manufacture these cells in a scalable and cost-effective way. That's what we need to figure out. But we're going to do all of that in the next 10 years. I have so much confidence we are as an industry. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SAKLAYEN: Perhaps you have longevity in mind. That is certainly a possibility. In the future, we might use these exact same stem cell banks to generate entire new organs, new tissues, new skin, new bone. This technology also has the potential to revolutionize personalized pharmaceuticals. Today, taking medicine is, to some degree, trial and error. You don't really know if the drug is going to work for you until you put it in your body. But what if we had a miniature human replica of you with your cells? Eye cells, brain cells, heart cells, muscle cells, blood cells on a chip - a miniature human replica of you. We could take the drugs, test them on the cells in the lab first to see how it works. If it works, fantastic, go ahead and take the drug; if it doesn't, pharmacists can order up custom drugs just for you. ZOMORODI: You know, there was a time that if you were diagnosed with smallpox, I mean, that was it. It was fatal. But now, of course, smallpox is gone. It's been eradicated. In the future, do you think that - is that how we're going to think about diseases like Parkinson's and diabetes? If or when we have these stem cell treatments, will these illnesses be so easy to cure that a diagnosis won't really feel as devastating or life altering as it does now? SAKLAYEN: I do think there is a possibility to create a world where these diseases don't feel as burdensome as they are today. However, I do want to mention, also, this brings me back to a lot of thoughts I have about accessibility in health care and how do we make these cell therapies accessible? It really comes down to how cheap can we make these advanced therapies? You know, getting a cell therapy could be just as expensive as buying insulin or taking penicillin or taking painkillers. That would be what is my aspirational goal for the future. But we have so much, so much work to do to get there because making cells is so complex. But I am very optimistic we're going to get there because what's happening right now in bioengineering is many different disciplines are coming together and trying to solve these big problems in new and creative ways.

SAKLAYEN: That's it. Right. So when you think about a phase three trial, you may need hundreds of patients, and there literally aren't enough scientists that can make those cells by hand. And, of course, it becomes very, very expensive. Running a phase three clinical trial would cost $300 million, which is not. . . ZOMORODI: Wow. SAKLAYEN: . . . Feasible in most instances. ZOMORODI: OK. And this is where, presumably, your work comes in, Nabiha. SAKLAYEN: Yes. So when I came into the biology space - so just a quick background. I'm a physicist by training. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SAKLAYEN: When I started my Ph. D. , I joined a laser physics lab because lasers are the coolest. But I also decided to dabble in biology. I started using lasers to engineer human cells. And when I talked to biologists about it, they were amazed. Here's why - scientists are always looking for ways to make biology more precise. Sometimes cell culture can feel a lot like cooking. Take some chemicals, put it in a pot, stir it, heat it, see what happens, try it all over again. In contrast, lasers are so precise. You can target one cell in millions at precise intervals every second, every minute, every hour. I realized that instead of doing this tedious process of stem cell culture by hand, we could use lasers to remove the unwanted cells. And to automate the entire process, we decided to use machine learning to identify those unwanted cells and zap them. Here's how it works - take some blood cells, put it in a cassette, add chemicals to those blood cells to turn them into stem cells, like always. Now, instead of having a human look for those unwanted cells and remove them by hand, the machine identifies the unwanted cells and zaps them with a laser. As you can see, this entire process happens by machine. The computer decides when and how often to prune the cells and uses a fully automated system to run the process. After repeated pruning, you end up with a perfect culture of your stem cells ready to be banked and used at any time. ZOMORODI: Nabiha, we talked about how, hypothetically, a brain with Parkinson's could be repaired using stem cells - IPSCs. But to be clear, stem cells are already being used to treat leukemia and other types of blood cancers. I've also read about them being used to restore a patient's eyesight in clinical trials. So so far, it seems pretty promising. SAKLAYEN: Yes. And just this past month, there's been an amazing result that was put out into the world by the Vertex team where they tested one patient with a dose of new insulin-producing cells. And this patient is not having to use insulin injections anymore. So that has happened in the past month, and it's tremendous. And now it's all about figuring out what is the right format for the specific cell therapy, how many cells should be transplanted, how to get around the immune evasion problems and how to manufacture these cells in a scalable and cost-effective way. That's what we need to figure out. But we're going to do all of that in the next 10 years. I have so much confidence we are as an industry. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SAKLAYEN: Perhaps you have longevity in mind. That is certainly a possibility. In the future, we might use these exact same stem cell banks to generate entire new organs, new tissues, new skin, new bone. This technology also has the potential to revolutionize personalized pharmaceuticals. Today, taking medicine is, to some degree, trial and error. You don't really know if the drug is going to work for you until you put it in your body. But what if we had a miniature human replica of you with your cells? Eye cells, brain cells, heart cells, muscle cells, blood cells on a chip - a miniature human replica of you. We could take the drugs, test them on the cells in the lab first to see how it works. If it works, fantastic, go ahead and take the drug; if it doesn't, pharmacists can order up custom drugs just for you. ZOMORODI: You know, there was a time that if you were diagnosed with smallpox, I mean, that was it. It was fatal. But now, of course, smallpox is gone. It's been eradicated. In the future, do you think that - is that how we're going to think about diseases like Parkinson's and diabetes? If or when we have these stem cell treatments, will these illnesses be so easy to cure that a diagnosis won't really feel as devastating or life altering as it does now? SAKLAYEN: I do think there is a possibility to create a world where these diseases don't feel as burdensome as they are today. However, I do want to mention, also, this brings me back to a lot of thoughts I have about accessibility in health care and how do we make these cell therapies accessible? It really comes down to how cheap can we make these advanced therapies? You know, getting a cell therapy could be just as expensive as buying insulin or taking penicillin or taking painkillers. That would be what is my aspirational goal for the future. But we have so much, so much work to do to get there because making cells is so complex. But I am very optimistic we're going to get there because what's happening right now in bioengineering is many different disciplines are coming together and trying to solve these big problems in new and creative ways.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And I want to go back about 10 years to Berkeley, Calif. , specifically to a lab on the UC Berkeley campus run by a woman named Jennifer Doudna. JENNIFER DOUDNA: I've always investigated fundamental questions about the nature of modern biology, in particular on molecules of RNA. These are chemical cousins of DNA that do lots of interesting things in cells and viruses. ZOMORODI: So Jennifer was studying RNA molecules, and that led her. . . DOUDNA: To investigate a rumored bacterial immune system called CRISPR. ZOMORODI: CRISPR, or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats. DOUDNA: Wow. Impressive. ZOMORODI: Did I get it? DOUDNA: Yes. ZOMORODI: OK, thank you. DOUDNA: You did. ZOMORODI: Thank you. I have been working on that. I'm really glad you came up with the acronym. DOUDNA: (Laughter) Well, I didn't, but the field did. Yeah. ZOMORODI: OK. So you've probably heard of CRISPR at some point, but you may not know the whole story. Around 2011, Jennifer started collaborating with a French professor named Emmanuelle Charpentier, and they began looking into CRISPR, this naturally occurring phenomenon in bacteria. DOUDNA: Correct. It's an adaptive immune system that bacteria employ to protect themselves from viral infection. And we began studying an enzyme, a protein called CRISPR-Cas9, which could be incredibly useful for detecting RNA and DNA molecules and for cutting them up. ZOMORODI: She and Emmanuelle found that this CRISPR-Cas9 molecule destroys viruses by cutting up their DNA and altering their genome. Their discovery was huge. DOUDNA: And this led to a breakthrough, really a finding that this system could be harnessed as a tool, as a technology, for manipulating DNA sequences in a programmable fashion. And it was through that work that we realized that this system could in fact be deployed as a genome editing tool. ZOMORODI: Meaning they could use CRISPR-Cas9 to target and alter specific genes. DOUDNA: It was basically immediately clear that this was an extraordinary breakthrough technology. ZOMORODI: OK. So we should be clear scientists have been working on gene editing for a long time, but there had never been a tool quite like this, right? The analogy I always hear is that it is basically - that you can cut and paste DNA. Is that right? DOUDNA: I actually love that analogy for genome editing because it really is, in fact, what genome editing is all about. So we can think of the genome, which is the DNA found in a cell that has all of the instructions for making a cell or a whole organism, and we can think of that information like the information in a book or, maybe better, an encyclopedia. And what scientists have been trying to do now for decades, honestly, is to understand the information content of the genome, particularly the human genome. And what CRISPR does is to give scientists an incredibly precise and programmable tool for altering the code to identify and cut specific DNA sequences. And we can control which sequences it's cutting. We can decide how to program it and have it go to that place in the genome, just like you might thumb to a page in a book volume and, you know, change a word or a paragraph or move things around. And it actually is cutting and pasting information in the DNA. ZOMORODI: Do you remember what it looked like when you sort of connected the dots? Were you like, whoa, I have to sit down or I need a whiskey? Like, what went through your mind on a non-scientific level, on a purely human emotional level? DOUDNA: Well, a great little vignette that comes to mind was an evening in those days when I was - you know, I had just come home from the lab and, you know, we had just gotten the data that showed how this worked. And I was at home. I was - you know, I was cooking spaghetti in my kitchen for my young son, and I just suddenly burst out laughing because I thought, this is so crazy, you know, that we started working on this thing, didn't really know where it was going, and it certainly wasn't a popular area of science at the time. Most people had never heard of CRISPR. And yet we had uncovered this just absolutely extraordinary molecule whose chemistry was going to probably change the world. ZOMORODI: Unlocking the mysteries of the genome has been a holy grail for scientists. And with CRISPR and other tools, humans have invented mechanisms to change evolution. But only recently have scientists begun to deploy these tools. And this next chapter is complex. There are so many questions. Will genetic treatments become everyday procedures? Should they be used to eradicate disease, revive extinct species, even help us live longer? And how can we make sure these tools work for the benefit of all humankind? And so today on the show - reshaping evolution because we are on the precipice of the next scientific revolution, one that could profoundly change humanity in exciting and frightening ways over the next century. Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier's work earned them the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2020. And now their development of the CRISPR-Cas9 molecule is being tested in over a dozen clinical trials. DOUDNA: Everything from sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, which is another blood disorder, disorders of the eye, liver disease, heart disease and muscular dystrophy. So it's just mind-boggling to think of a technology going from initial publication in an academic research journal to being widely deployed for so many different applications. ZOMORODI: Can we go back to the blood disorder, sickle cell disease? My understanding is that a person's red blood cells are misshapen, and so that means they can't carry enough oxygen. DOUDNA: That's right. And that's why it's referred to as sickle cell disease because when you look under a microscope, the cells have a classic sickled shape, and people with sickle cell disease make a form of the protein called hemoglobin that carries oxygen in the blood that is prone to aggregation, prone to sticking together and forming aggregates that lead to these sickled shape of the cells. ZOMORODI: And so how does CRISPR work to fix it? DOUDNA: To treat sickle cell disease at its source, what's done is to remove what are called blood stem cells from an affected individual. These come out of the bone marrow. And they are cells that have the potential to develop into new red blood cells. And to ensure that they don't have the sickle cell trait, CRISPR can be used to either change the DNA of the affected gene, or they can actually suppress the effects of the sickle cell gene mutation. And that's what's done. So the CRISPR is used to make those changes in blood stem cells, and then the edited cells are infused back into the patient where they can repopulate the bone marrow and effectively replace the red blood cells with corrected cells. ZOMORODI: So just to be clear, you're saying that there could be a family that says, you know, we have passed down sickle cell to generation after generation, and we want it to end with us. DOUDNA: Well, that's right. It could, you know, and it's extraordinary. And even today, you know, this is something that is already being used in patients in these trials. Victoria Gray, she was actually the first U. S. patient to receive a CRISPR-based therapy for her sickle cell disease. And, you know, she's showing that this type of approach can actually work quite well in terms of treating a disease at its source. And I think that's really what CRISPR offers, is that kind of a cure, really, for genetic disease. And I think it just paves the way for future applications of this technology as well because, of course, when you start to see success and, you know, begin to see how patients' lives are being impacted beneficially by this technology, it's highly motivating to - you know, to carry it forward and see it used in other diseases. But I think one has to think about the fact that, you know, what we're talking about here is effectively changing evolution. You know, it's changing us at our core and going back to the instruction manual that makes us who we are and making changes there. When we talk about it in the context of a disease like sickle cell disease that is so debilitating, it certainly seems like this might be something that some families might want to consider eventually, especially if the technology is vetted carefully and shown to be safe. And by the way, we're not there yet. But I think the broader issue really is equity, access to technologies. Who decides about something like that, something as profound as that? Who pays for it? Who has access to it? I think it gets complicated quickly. ZOMORODI: Yeah. I mean, it goes from stopping a fatal disease to maybe optimizing for IQ or even, you know, being thin and tall and having a particular eye color, I suppose. DOUDNA: I mean, in a most extreme case, you could imagine that someday, couples, you know, go to an in vitro fertilization clinic, and they receive a menu, right? And they can decide what types of traits they want for their children. ZOMORODI: Yeah, you actually brought that up back in 2015 in your TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DOUDNA: Imagine that we could try to engineer humans that have enhanced properties, such as stronger bones or less susceptibility to cardiovascular disease, or even to have properties that we would consider maybe to be desirable - designer humans, if you will. Right now, the genetic information to understand what types of genes would give rise to these traits are mostly not known, but it's important to know that the CRISPR technology gives us a tool to make such changes once that knowledge becomes available. This raises a number of ethical questions that we have to carefully consider. And this is why I and my colleagues have called for a global pause in any clinical application of the CRISPR technology in human embryos, to give us time to really consider all of the various implications of doing so. ZOMORODI: That was more than six years ago, but not everyone stuck to a moratorium. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Overnight, an astonishing claim - a scientist in China saying he created the world's first genetically engineered babies. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: A line has been crossed that should not have been crossed. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: It's very disturbing. It's inappropriate. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Oh, this is huge. ZOMORODI: In a moment, more from Jennifer Doudna about the ethical implications of CRISPR. On the show today, reshaping evolution. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. We'll be right back. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. On the show today, reshaping evolution. We were just talking to Nobel Prize-winning biochemist Jennifer Doudna, whose work on CRISPR marked a new chapter in our ability to alter our DNA. In 2015, Jennifer called for an international moratorium on applying CRISPR to human embryos, at least until the scientific community considered all the ethical implications of gene editing. DOUDNA: That was definitely a motivation at that time, was to call to the attention of everyone, to just be aware that this technology does have the potential to create these very profound, you know, kinds of changes in human beings. What happened next was that there was an announcement in 2018, which was actually - actually happened at the second international summit on the topic of human genome editing, of a project in China in which two embryos had been edited using CRISPR and then were implanted to create a pregnancy that resulted in the birth of twin girls with edits to their DNA. ZOMORODI: And do you remember what your reaction was after he presented his research? DOUDNA: Well, it was pretty horrifying. You know, it was just kind of shocking to see the way that the work had been performed. It - just really an example of unethical behavior on the part of a scientist, you know, just rushing forward with something before it had been tested to be safe and also without properly understanding how to explain and consent with patients, you know, to explain to them what was actually happening to the embryos that they were using in the study. And so I think it really did galvanize the international community to realize that this type of work really shouldn't be happening right now. And there has been a concerted effort on the part of not only scientific organizations but also by the World Health Organization and the United Nations to get involved in this conversation. ZOMORODI: OK, so you've got governments and NGOs talking. But of course, there's the other party that we're not talking about yet, which is private enterprise. There are a lot of companies who are hoping to make money off of this technology. You've started several companies that are developing CRISPR-Cas9 treatments. But should we be worried - because companies are not always known for taking the moral high ground, right? DOUDNA: You're right - that I think this is always something that needs vigilance. One has to - you know, you can't relax. You have to remember, you know, there's always the risks that go along with a technology like this. But companies play an incredibly important role in all of this because, generally, this is not something that academic labs have the funding or the resources to do, and that's where companies come in. ZOMORODI: So how do you balance your business interests with your ethics? DOUDNA: I think it begins at the beginning. You have to start with creating a culture in your team that focuses on ethical use of the technology and on the, you know, benefit that can be created by developing it in the context of the company. And we've - you know, certainly, I've been proud of the teams that I've been involved with as a founder that I think, in each case, these are people who I like, I trust. I think we have aligned values, core values, in terms of both doing excellent science and doing it with an eye towards ethics and appropriate use of a powerful tool. ZOMORODI: Your biographer, Walter Isaacson, has said that your invention of CRISPR heralds the beginning of a next great innovation revolution. What do you think he means by that? DOUDNA: There's a lot of evidence that we're entering an era in biology in which we have increasingly, at our fingertips, a collection of tools that allow manipulation of biological systems in controllable ways. Those capabilities will advance, you know, the kinds of things that have only been dreamt of in biological systems to a point where we can actually achieve them. Imagine that someone gets a diagnosis for something. Maybe it's even pre-diagnosis. It's - they've gone to a company like 23andMe or Color Genomics, and they have their DNA sequenced. And the result comes back that they have susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease in the future. Today, that's kind of, you know, information that's not directly actionable. Whereas imagine in the future, it's possible to use a technology like CRISPR to change those genetics so that that person is - no longer has that susceptibility. That would be extraordinary if we get to that point. Will we get there in 30 years? I don't know, but I think it's entirely possible that we will. ZOMORODI: That's biochemist Jennifer Doudna.

There are a lot of companies who are hoping to make money off of this technology. You've started several companies that are developing CRISPR-Cas9 treatments. But should we be worried - because companies are not always known for taking the moral high ground, right? DOUDNA: You're right - that I think this is always something that needs vigilance. One has to - you know, you can't relax. You have to remember, you know, there's always the risks that go along with a technology like this. But companies play an incredibly important role in all of this because, generally, this is not something that academic labs have the funding or the resources to do, and that's where companies come in. ZOMORODI: So how do you balance your business interests with your ethics? DOUDNA: I think it begins at the beginning. You have to start with creating a culture in your team that focuses on ethical use of the technology and on the, you know, benefit that can be created by developing it in the context of the company. And we've - you know, certainly, I've been proud of the teams that I've been involved with as a founder that I think, in each case, these are people who I like, I trust. I think we have aligned values, core values, in terms of both doing excellent science and doing it with an eye towards ethics and appropriate use of a powerful tool. ZOMORODI: Your biographer, Walter Isaacson, has said that your invention of CRISPR heralds the beginning of a next great innovation revolution. What do you think he means by that? DOUDNA: There's a lot of evidence that we're entering an era in biology in which we have increasingly, at our fingertips, a collection of tools that allow manipulation of biological systems in controllable ways. Those capabilities will advance, you know, the kinds of things that have only been dreamt of in biological systems to a point where we can actually achieve them. Imagine that someone gets a diagnosis for something. Maybe it's even pre-diagnosis. It's - they've gone to a company like 23andMe or Color Genomics, and they have their DNA sequenced. And the result comes back that they have susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease in the future. Today, that's kind of, you know, information that's not directly actionable. Whereas imagine in the future, it's possible to use a technology like CRISPR to change those genetics so that that person is - no longer has that susceptibility. That would be extraordinary if we get to that point. Will we get there in 30 years? I don't know, but I think it's entirely possible that we will. ZOMORODI: That's biochemist Jennifer Doudna.

We're talking about long COVID. Patients who have it report a wide range of symptoms that persist for weeks or months after they've recovered from an initial COVID infection. Those symptoms can include fatigue, brain fog, problems with breathing, depression, even hair loss. According to researchers at the University of Michigan, as many as 100 million people around the world have or have had long COVID. But doctors still don't know a lot about the condition. That's where our next guest comes in. Resia Pretorius is professor of physiological sciences at Stellenbosch University in South Africa. She and her colleagues have been analyzing blood samples from long COVID patients since early 2020. And they've noticed many samples had something in common, microclots. So could these tiny blood clots help researchers better understand long COVID and possibly even develop ways to treat it? Professor Pretorius is with us now to tell us more. Professor, welcome. Thank you so much for talking with us. RESIA PRETORIUS: Hello, Michel. MARTIN: So your research suggests microclots could turn out to have a key role when it comes to understanding long COVID. Could you just tell us a little bit more about what they are and, you know, how that might explain some of the symptoms that long COVID patients experience, especially the ones we hear the most about, like fatigue and brain fog? PRETORIUS: Sure. When we speak about long COVID and microclots, I think we should just step back a second and speak about acute COVID. We have noted - we and others have noted that the vascular system and clotting is not working properly during acute COVID. So the dilemma with long COVID is that the percentage of individuals, up to 30%, never really get over the presence of these clotting abnormalities or physiological abnormalities when they are not infective anymore - so when they get over the normal five to 10 days of acute COVID. So during long COVID, these clots then just continue to be present. MARTIN: Do you have any sense of why these microclots aren't breaking down like blood clots typically do in healthy individuals? PRETORIUS: Inside the microclots that are present in these individuals' blood in circulation, there are various entrapped molecules, inflammatory molecules, that actually prevent the breakdown of the microclots. So although the body's trying very hard to break down these clots with the normal physiological processes, molecules entrapped in the microclots actually prevent it from breaking down. Now, that is a massive issue because if these microclots are in circulation, it damages the vasculature, or your blood vessels, and in that process, prevents the cells to receive enough oxygen, causing then a failure of the coagulation system of oxygen to your cells. And that can be linked to all of the lingering symptoms that have been noted in long COVID. MARTIN: Do you think your research could allow labs to start detecting long COVID in patients' blood and help doctors diagnose the condition? And one of the reasons I ask is that when we've interviewed people who've had long COVID, one of the things that they talk about is that people don't believe them. And they struggle with this sense of shame, which is, you know, almost as devastating for some people as the condition itself. So do you think that it's possible that the work would help people kind of home in on a diagnosis that people would accept, that - not just the medical community would accept but that people - regular people would accept or employers would accept so that people don't feel that they're constantly fighting this sense that they're malingering, for example? PRETORIUS: That is exactly one of the major dilemmas that the millions of people suffering from long COVID all face daily. They are really severely ill. And if they go to a pathologist or their clinician and they do regular blood tests, all of the blood tests normally come back in the healthy levels. And therefore, many of the clinicians themselves say that these individuals suffering from long COVID, it is all psychological. And that is a major dilemma. Just because we have not yet have a easy, available diagnostic marker for long COVID does not mean that the disease does not exist. So that is one of the most important key factors. So what we are - we and others, not only in South Africa, but a whole team of researchers and interested clinicians are working very hard to get the diagnostic where we can detect microclots in circulation. Only when we have got diagnostics, we can think about going into treatment regimes. MARTIN: And, of course, treatment then is something that we would be very interested in. Does your research indicate some possible ways to treat long COVID? Is there anything you can tell us about that? PRETORIUS: So one of the dilemmas with any treatment, whether you're talking about long COVID or acute COVID or any other condition, for that matter, is that the general clinical fraternity only believes data that comes from clinical trials. And currently, there is no proper clinical trials that is focused on long COVID. We are working on that with a group of U. S. A. researchers, as well as U. K. researchers. And we're trying to get trials going to see what conditions work and what conditions do not work. That is the most important thing that is needed. But for that to happen, obviously we need funds, and we need very big infrastructure to be able to do clinical trials. MARTIN: And that leads me to my next question, which is, as we said earlier, it's estimated that millions of people have or have had long COVID. And with this current variant, this current surge fueled by this latest variant, it just seems logical that that number could rise. So much of the world's attention has been focused on vaccines - and certainly, rightly so - and then after that, of course, therapies. And rightly so. But do you think it's time for the world's kind of research, attention and resources to perhaps pivot to long COVID? PRETORIUS: Absolutely. So as you mentioned, the focus have been, rightly so, on keeping people out of the hospital. And our health care facilities have really been under extreme stress. The dilemma is that many of the long COVID patients are at home, so they're not seen or heard of. And they're struggling on their own. So I think that's so, so important to focus our attention now on research and turning it to these very, very ill patients because if we do not do that in a few months' time, our economy will see the consequences and have a severe impact on our economies worldwide. MARTIN: That was Resia Pretorius, professor of physiological sciences at Stellenbosch University in South Africa. We reached her via Skype. Professor Pretorius, thank you so much for sharing this expertise with us today. PRETORIUS: Thank you very much for asking me.

S. greenhouse gas emissions increased last year. And that's a problem because to address climate change, the country's emissions need to go down each year instead. NPR's Jeff Brady reports, there's also new information showing the last seven years where the Earth's hottest on record. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: The global temperature last year reached 1. 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service. That's getting close to the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1. 5 degrees. The U. S. contributed to more warming as Americans got vaccines and the economy recovered. KATE LARSEN: What was dismaying for us was to see that emissions bounced back even faster than the overall economy. BRADY: Kate Larsen with the research firm Rhodium Group says to meet Paris goals, the U. S. needs to reduce climate warming emissions about 5% a year. Last year, they went up more than 6%. Part of that is because 2020 levels were down a lot as people stayed home at the beginning of the pandemic. Then in 2021, Larsen says the U. S. used more electricity. LARSEN: Coal generation in the electric power system bounced back really rapidly - a 17% increase from 2020. That's the first time we've seen a rise in coal-fired generation in the U. S. in the last seven years. BRADY: Coal emits more carbon dioxide per megawatt of electricity than natural gas, but it was cheaper last year as gas prices rose. So utilities chose to fire up coal generators to meet demand. Larsen says transportation emissions also were up mostly because a lot more freight was shipped around the country - also because people are traveling more than in 2020. Tiernan Sittenfeld with the League of Conservation Voters says the country needs policies to push emissions back down again. TIERNAN SITTENFELD: We must meet the climate test that the president has committed to, that science and environmental and racial justice require of cutting climate pollution in half by 2030. BRADY: That's only eight years from now. And the country isn't even halfway to meeting the goal. That's why Sittenfeld and other environmental groups want Congress to pass a large budget bill dubbed the Build Back Better act.

And lots of scientists are hoping to use this powerful $10 billion instrument. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on a recent effort to make sure that every researcher gets a fair shot. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Space telescopes are a rare, precious resource, and NASA wants to get the best science out of them, the best bang for its buck. So if an astronomer has an idea for where to point a telescope to study black holes or planets in other solar systems or whatever, there's a way to submit a proposal. NEILL REID: Anyone from across the world can lead a proposal, can be on a proposal - Australia, China, Japan, Russia anywhere. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That's Neill Reid. He's with the Space Telescope Science Institute. It's the science operations center for the iconic Hubble Space Telescope and now the new James Webb Space Telescope. He says the demands to use space telescopes is so high, the majority of proposals get rejected for Hubble every year. REID: We typically get something like a thousand, 1,100 proposals. And only the top 20% of those proposals will actually make it through to the telescope to get time. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Reid says a while back, someone asked him, does the institute know if there's any difference in the acceptance rate for Hubble proposals led by women and proposals led by men? REID: We didn't at that point because we don't actually collect that information. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So Reid and his colleagues did the best study they could, just using the gender suggested by the name of each proposal's lead scientist. That person is called the principal investigator, or PI. REID: And we came up with an answer that there was this systematic difference. Proposals led by male PIs do better than proposals led by female PIs. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The difference wasn't huge, but it was consistent for every year they looked, going back 16 years. Clearly, something was going on. The institute brought in a consultant, Stefanie Johnson of the University of Colorado. She and her research partner sat in on the committees that evaluated and ranked proposals to use Hubble. And what they noticed is that a lot of the discussion centered on who was making a proposal. STEFANIE JOHNSON: There might be a question about it like, oh, you know, this seems really good, but can they actually do this? Like, are they sure? A lot of times, there's someone who will speak up in the room and say, you know, I know this person. They will figure it out because that's who they are. GREENFIELDBOYCE: This means certain people got an extra leg up. So Johnson and her colleagues recommended making the review process completely blind. The evaluation committees wouldn't get to see any names, and all proposals would be written in a way that made it impossible to know who the proposal was from. The institute surveyed the astronomy community to see what it thought of this potential change. LOU STROLGER: And you can imagine the knee-jerk reaction was actually pretty polar. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Lou Strolger works at the Space Telescope Science Institute. He says about half of the astronomers who responded were in favor of the idea. These tended to be younger people and women. The other half had objectionsSTROLGER: They ranged from, you know, this will totally upset how good science is done to, you know, you'll basically fool yourself into, you know, giving time to people who don't know what you're doing. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Still, the institute plowed ahead. In 2018, it did its first truly blinded review for Hubble proposals. Astrophysicist Priya Natarajan of Yale University was there. She says occasionally, someone would try to guess who was behind a proposal. PRIYA NATARAJAN: But the buy-in from the community was so tremendous that there would be other people on the panels who would say, oh, no, no, come on. Let's stick to the science. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And sticking to the science had a real impact. That year, for the first time ever, the acceptance rate for proposals led by women was higher than the acceptance rate for proposals led by men. NATARAJAN: I was stunned that there was an effect right away. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And when reviewers were finally allowed to see who had submitted a proposal that they had just deemed worthy of telescope time, Lou Strolger says they never objected that the person wasn't up to the job, although they often were surprised. STROLGER: There were some, oh, that was not at all who I thought it was sort of reactions. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Data from the last few years suggest that this process continues to help narrow the gap between acceptance rates for men and women.

Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF KARTELL'S \"SILVER SCREEN\") A MARTINEZ, HOST:   Now that the James Webb Space Telescope has finished unfolding itself in space, it'll undergo months of fine tuning to get it ready to, you know, do some science. And lots of scientists are hoping to use this powerful $10 billion instrument. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on a recent effort to make sure that every researcher gets a fair shot. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Space telescopes are a rare, precious resource, and NASA wants to get the best science out of them, the best bang for its buck. So if an astronomer has an idea for where to point a telescope to study black holes or planets in other solar systems or whatever, there's a way to submit a proposal. NEILL REID: Anyone from across the world can lead a proposal, can be on a proposal - Australia, China, Japan, Russia anywhere. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That's Neill Reid. He's with the Space Telescope Science Institute. It's the science operations center for the iconic Hubble Space Telescope and now the new James Webb Space Telescope. He says the demands to use space telescopes is so high, the majority of proposals get rejected for Hubble every year. REID: We typically get something like a thousand, 1,100 proposals. And only the top 20% of those proposals will actually make it through to the telescope to get time. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Reid says a while back, someone asked him, does the institute know if there's any difference in the acceptance rate for Hubble proposals led by women and proposals led by men? REID: We didn't at that point because we don't actually collect that information. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So Reid and his colleagues did the best study they could, just using the gender suggested by the name of each proposal's lead scientist. That person is called the principal investigator, or PI. REID: And we came up with an answer that there was this systematic difference. Proposals led by male PIs do better than proposals led by female PIs. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The difference wasn't huge, but it was consistent for every year they looked, going back 16 years. Clearly, something was going on. The institute brought in a consultant, Stefanie Johnson of the University of Colorado. She and her research partner sat in on the committees that evaluated and ranked proposals to use Hubble. And what they noticed is that a lot of the discussion centered on who was making a proposal. STEFANIE JOHNSON: There might be a question about it like, oh, you know, this seems really good, but can they actually do this? Like, are they sure? A lot of times, there's someone who will speak up in the room and say, you know, I know this person. They will figure it out because that's who they are. GREENFIELDBOYCE: This means certain people got an extra leg up. So Johnson and her colleagues recommended making the review process completely blind. The evaluation committees wouldn't get to see any names, and all proposals would be written in a way that made it impossible to know who the proposal was from. The institute surveyed the astronomy community to see what it thought of this potential change. LOU STROLGER: And you can imagine the knee-jerk reaction was actually pretty polar. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Lou Strolger works at the Space Telescope Science Institute. He says about half of the astronomers who responded were in favor of the idea. These tended to be younger people and women. The other half had objections STROLGER: They ranged from, you know, this will totally upset how good science is done to, you know, you'll basically fool yourself into, you know, giving time to people who don't know what you're doing. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Still, the institute plowed ahead. In 2018, it did its first truly blinded review for Hubble proposals. Astrophysicist Priya Natarajan of Yale University was there. She says occasionally, someone would try to guess who was behind a proposal. PRIYA NATARAJAN: But the buy-in from the community was so tremendous that there would be other people on the panels who would say, oh, no, no, come on. Let's stick to the science. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And sticking to the science had a real impact. That year, for the first time ever, the acceptance rate for proposals led by women was higher than the acceptance rate for proposals led by men. NATARAJAN: I was stunned that there was an effect right away. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And when reviewers were finally allowed to see who had submitted a proposal that they had just deemed worthy of telescope time, Lou Strolger says they never objected that the person wasn't up to the job, although they often were surprised. STROLGER: There were some, oh, that was not at all who I thought it was sort of reactions. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Data from the last few years suggest that this process continues to help narrow the gap between acceptance rates for men and women. And it may have improved fairness in other ways, too. Strolger says there's been a dramatic rise in approvals for first-time users, astronomers who have never used Hubble before. STROLGER: It went from something like a dozen per year to, you know, 50 per year. GREENFIELDBOYCE: All of this convinced NASA officials to adopt this approach for other space telescopes, too.

These were remains of Homo sapiens, early humans. That collection is known as Omo 1. AILSA CHANG, HOST:  The contents of Omo 1 were initially thought to be around 200,000 years old, already some of the oldest human bones ever unearthed. But scientists have debated their precise age. TIM WHITE: To understand how humans evolved in Africa, you need a time frame. And to construct that time frame, one needs to have accurate dating techniques. Unfortunately, we are just beyond the range of radiocarbon or C-14 dating. So you have to employ other techniques to determine the true age of these fossils. CHANG: That's Tim White, professor of integrative biology at UC Berkeley. One of those techniques involves determining the age of the environment where the bones were found - in the case of Oma 1, a layer of volcanic ash. CELINE VIDAL: There was a bit of controversy because the way Oma 1 was first dated was using an ash layer that was supposedly found just below. But it wasn't found where the fossils were actually found. It was found a bit further away. SHAPIRO: Celine Vidal is a volcanologist at the University of Cambridge, and she says that the ash layer above Oma 1 was fine like flour. That's hard for scientists to date. CHANG: But in a new analysis, Vidal and her colleagues found that the volcanic ash had the same chemical fingerprint as a massive volcanic eruption over 233,000 years ago. VIDAL: That relies on the principle that every eruption has a unique chemical fingerprint, a unique chemical signature. So when it's possible to analyze a signature of an ash layer and if it correlates with the signature of an ash layer somewhere else and we know the age of one of the deposits, then we can guess indirectly the age of the deposits it's correlated with. CHANG: Since Oma 1 was under that ash, Vidal thinks the bones are at least 33,000 years older than previously thought. The study was published in the journal Nature. Here's Tim White again. WHITE: At what point did these people expand from Africa? What is their technology? What was the environment that they occupied? What was Africa like in those days? All of that depends on a strong geological framework but especially on a chronological framework. And that is what this new work has provided for one of the more complete skeletons from this time period. SHAPIRO: In other words, if these human remains are much older than we thought, the story of humanity might be, too.

They're really, really far away - over 5,000 light years. KIPPING: The moon is pretty alien compared to any moon in the solar system. GREENFIELDBOYCE: For one thing, it's weirdly bigger than Earth - like, 2 1/2 times the size. KIPPING: We're not sure if it's rocky. We're not sure if it's gaseous.

They don't want to do that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Yet humans did it early in their history. For example, at one site in Tanzania, a volcanic eruption over 3 1/2 million years ago covered the landscape with ash and preserved all kinds of tracks that had been left in the mud.

That's bigger than most modern nuclear weapons. As NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports, researchers are starting to piece together what caused the explosion. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: In 2015, an entirely new island rose from the Pacific Ocean. It was created by a powerful underwater volcano to the north of Tonga's main island. Jim Garvin is chief scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. He says the process of growing the island created something else. JIM GARVIN: It produces layers - we call them reservoirs - of liquid rock under a solid rock crust. BRUMFIEL: That liquid rock, or magma, flowed through tubes and channels and vast underground caverns. In December of last year, a huge amount spewed towards the surface. The island expanded. But beneath the waves, Garvin believes something else was happening. GARVIN: The plumbing system underwater changed. BRUMFIEL: And then this past weekend, he thinks it changed again. Liquid seawater flowed suddenly and forcefully into the chambers filled with liquid magma. GARVIN: When you put a ton of seawater into a cubic kilometer of liquid rock, things are going to get bad fast. BRUMFIEL: A huge explosion. (SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION)BRUMFIEL: That's what one Twitter user recorded from an island in Fiji over 250 miles away, and the sound went a lot farther than that. MICHAEL POLAND: People in Alaska heard it. So it was a humongous explosion, no doubt about that whatsoever. BRUMFIEL: Michael Poland is a geophysicist with the U. S. Geological Survey. He says this may have been one of the loudest events on planet Earth in over a century, but the eruption itself wasn't all that big. POLAND: The amount of magma that came out was relatively small, especially when you compare it to the size of the explosion that it created. BRUMFIEL: To be clear, the explosion blew to bits the island that the volcano had made just a few years before. The tsunami and ash cloud that followed have done a huge amount of damage to Tonga, which is now in the midst of a massive humanitarian emergency. But really big volcanic eruptions can change the climate of the entire Earth. Poland doesn't expect that to happen in this case. Nevertheless, he does think there will be a lot of interest in the blast. He says it could teach scientists more about what happens when Earth and sea collide. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF BONOBO'S \"7TH SEVENS\") A MARTINEZ, HOST:   NASA scientists have put an estimate on the force of the volcanic eruption near Tonga over the weekend - 10 megatons. That's bigger than most modern nuclear weapons. As NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports, researchers are starting to piece together what caused the explosion. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: In 2015, an entirely new island rose from the Pacific Ocean. It was created by a powerful underwater volcano to the north of Tonga's main island. Jim Garvin is chief scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. He says the process of growing the island created something else.

NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on a new study that examined babies' views on sharing saliva. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Did you ever see that \"Seinfeld\" episode where Elaine likes a guy and wants to ask him out on a date? (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SEINFELD\")JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS: (As Elaine Benes) But then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water.

If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs. He'd just crave my germs. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It's only funny because it's true. ASHLEY THOMAS: And the question is sort of, well, how do you know that? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Ashley Thomas is a researcher at MIT. THOMAS: Is it something that you know because of years and years of experience with these types of interactions? Or is it something that even infants and toddlers, who have very little experience with these types of interactions, also know? GREENFIELDBOYCE: To find out, she and some colleagues tested babies and toddlers. The kiddos watched videos of puppet shows. In one, a woman rolls a ball back and forth with a blue, fuzzy puppet. Then another woman feeds the puppet. THOMAS: By taking a bite of an orange slice and letting the puppet take a bite of the orange slice and then taking another bite of that same orange slice. GREENFIELDBOYCE: At the end of the video, the puppet is between these two women and starts to cry. (SOUNDBITE OF BABY CRYING)GREENFIELDBOYCE: And it turns out infants and toddlers looked first and looked longer at the woman who'd shared food and saliva. It's like they expected her to do something. That was intriguing, but maybe what mattered was sharing food, not saliva. So the researchers did a study with no food. This time, two different puppets interacted with one woman. The woman shared saliva with only one of the puppets. THOMAS: The saliva-sharing interaction involved the woman putting her finger in her mouth, putting her finger in the puppet's mouth and then putting her finger back in her mouth. GREENFIELDBOYCE: With the other puppet, she just touched its forehead and touched her own forehead. Later on, when the woman appeared to be unhappy. . . THOMAS: We find that they expect the puppet who had had that mouth-to-mouth interaction to be the one to respond to the woman's distress. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The researchers report these findings in the journal Science along with the results of another experiment in older children. Five-to-7-year-olds were told about a kid who was sharing stuff - food, toys. And they were asked who the kid was more likely to share with, a friend or a family member. For stuff that could easily be divvied up, there was no difference. THOMAS: But when it comes to saliva-sharing items, like sharing an ice cream cone or using the same spoon, then kids think that the kid is more likely to share with family. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Of course, older kids are often explicitly told not to swap saliva with others, especially during this pandemic. But how do babies get clued into all this? Alan Fiske is an anthropologist at UCLA. He believes babies are born primed to understand certain basic kinds of human relationships. In one of them, people are socially and functionally equivalent, and saliva sharing signals that. ALAN FISKE: It is a way of connecting bodies or making bodies the same in some respect. And that's the crucial thing. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says there's other ways to make bodies feel the same, like close cuddling or sex or even ritually becoming blood brothers, so there's nothing magic about spit.

ROSIE BRENNAN: You know, it's a wide-ranging sport of endurance, strength, power, kind of all of it wrapped into one on snow. DIAZ: To do this, Brennan really needs that perfect snowy condition. BRENNAN: You know, obviously, we need snow on the whole course to ski.

They say if greenhouse gases are not seriously reduced, virtually none of the previous 21 cities that hosted the Winter Olympic Games could reliably do so again. Daniel Scott is one of the researchers at the University of Waterloo. DANIEL SCOTT: Under the high-emissions scenario, it's a very different outcome. To end late century, we're left with one climate-reliable location, being Sapporo, Japan. DIAZ: By reliable, he means a cold enough location that offers prime safe conditions for winter athletes to compete in. Athletes and their coaches have started to notice the changes. Here's Brennan again. BRENNAN: You know, I think the thing that we see now is with warmer weather, there's less snowfall. So we're much more reliant on man-made snow, and man-made snow doesn't act the same as natural snow. It tends to be much firmer. It gets icier faster. It's a faster surface. DIAZ: And that poses a risk for more injuries. Climate change isn't just affecting Winter Games. Last summer's games in Tokyo saw extreme heat and heavy rains.

But as NPR's Jon Hamilton reports, the brain science behind that decision is pretty complicated. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: Without water, most animals die pretty quickly. But Yuki Oka, a biology professor at Caltech, says the act of drinking water can also prove fatal. YUKI OKA: The animal needs to minimize the ingestion time because that's the most vulnerable time. HAMILTON: Take too long at the watering hole, and a predator may eat you. So animals and people have evolved the system to make sure we drink enough water, but not too much. It has a whole series of checkpoints. Oka says the first one is passed when water reaches your mouth. OKA: That already gives your brain refreshing feeling. HAMILTON: But then your brain needs to know how much you're drinking. And Oka says it can't wait until water gets absorbed, which can take 15 minutes or more. OKA: So the body has an additional checkpoint, which is gulping. HAMILTON: Swallowing acts like a meter, letting your brain know how much fluid is entering the body almost immediately. Still, Oka says, the brain takes a trust-but-verify approach to this information. OKA: So there's a second checkpoint in the intestine to make sure that you drank water. That takes place after a couple of minutes. HAMILTON: The intestine also moves water into the bloodstream, where there is yet another checkpoint, and that is the subject of Oka's latest study, which appears in the journal \"Nature. \" His team used mice to study the vessels that carry blood from the intestine to the liver, and they found cells there that transmit messages up the vagus nerve to the brain when an animal has been hydrating. But here's where the system gets really complicated. These cells weren't sensing the water directly. Oka says they were responding to a hormone that's produced when the intestine contains more water, making the contents less salty. OKA: So the change is now translated into hormonal signal to tell the brain that we are drinking water. HAMILTON: Within a few minutes - why so complicated? Oka says it may be a way to make the system more sensitive to subtle changes. Christine Browning, a professor at Penn State College of Medicine, says it makes sense that the brain wants to know what's happening in the bloodstream. CHRISTINE BROWNING: It's an obvious checkpoint to have. It's an obvious sensory point to look at whatever is then circulating. HAMILTON: Browning says, of course, the brain has lots of other ways to monitor hydration. BROWNING: There's then going to be changes in blood pressure and in plasma volume, and those can be sensed as well. HAMILTON: The brain even has areas that directly monitor how watery our blood is, and all of these inputs affect how thirsty we feel. Browning says complexity and redundancy in the thirst system are to be expected given the life or death nature of our dependence on water. BROWNING: That's great from a survival standpoint. It just makes it a little bit difficult when we're trying to figure out exactly the neural mechanisms involved in these apparently very simple responses. HAMILTON: Browning says there's still lots to learn. Jon Hamilton, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   It feels so simple - when we are thirsty, we drink.

Browning says complexity and redundancy in the thirst system are to be expected given the life or death nature of our dependence on water. BROWNING: That's great from a survival standpoint. It just makes it a little bit difficult when we're trying to figure out exactly the neural mechanisms involved in these apparently very simple responses.

NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Astronomer Carl Sagan used to say, we are made of star stuff. He meant it literally. The burning cores of stars forged elements like carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. But what about the heaviest elements on the periodic table - ones like gold, platinum, uranium, plutonium? ANTON WALLNER: These are the elements where we are still in a mystery, and we do not know exactly where they are produced and how much is produced in different sites. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Anton Wallner is a physicist with the Australian National University. He led an international team that's been trying to get clues about how these elements are made by looking for specimens that arrived on Earth relatively recently. He says a massive star explosion or collision will spew out a slew of elements. Those can find their way to our planet and get incorporated into certain rocks. WALLNER: So the idea is that we have samples which collected these extraterrestrial particles over the last thousands or millions of years. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The sample in this study was a rock from nearly a mile beneath the Pacific Ocean. It was hauled up by an oil exploration company.

After all, we're talking about hundreds of atoms here. But, you know, we should be grateful for that because they're freshly made from exploding stars. GREENFIELDBOYCE: What kind of star explosion isn't clear. What the researchers saw in the rock had to have been produced by something more than just the typical death throes of massive stars, which are known as supernova explosions. It looks like more rare events must be involved, too, like maybe collisions between neutron stars. Those are super-dense stars as small as a city, yet with more mass than our sun.

They've arrived at Chimp Haven in Louisiana, which is a retirement home for research chimps from the National Institutes of Health. It's the biggest such facility around, with 300 chimps living there. And this is a meaningful retirement. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on these two new arrivals. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The two chimps are in their mid-30s, a male named Huey and a female named Pancake. For 20 years, they lived together at a biomedical research center in Texas. UNIDENTIFIED VETERINARIAN: Good morning. Good morning. Hey, guys. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Huey and Pancake are now hanging out in a building at Chimp Haven called the welcoming center. This is where newcomers to the sanctuary stay for a period of adjustment and quarantine. UNIDENTIFIED VETERINARIAN: Good morning. You want to come see me? GREENFIELDBOYCE: The sanctuary recorded these sounds of a veterinarian going in to check on them and them checking out the vet. (SOUNDBITE OF CHIMPANZEE MAKING KISSING NOISES)UNIDENTIFIED VETERINARIAN: Yeah. Good morning to you too. Good morning to you too, Pancake. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That was Pancake making little kissy noises. Amy Fultz is a co-founder of Chimp Haven, who is thrilled to have them there. She's known Huey and Pancake for over 25 years. She met them in the early 1990s when she worked at the research facility where they lived. AMY FULTZ: I think we've all aged, obviously, in different ways. Both Pancake and I have put on a little bit of weight (laughter), and Huey's way more devoted to Pancake than I recall - very attached to her. But that makes sense after 20 years of them being together. GREENFIELDBOYCE: As a species, chimps are very closely related to humans, and while the National Institutes of Health used to support invasive biomedical research on chimps, animal rights groups raised ethical concerns. The NIH reduced this kind of work and finally ended it altogether in 2015. The agency then shifted to moving chimps from the research facilities where they'd been living to Chimp Haven. Fultz says it's been a real effort to bring the NIH animals in. FULTZ: Since about 2017, we've averaged about 36 chimpanzees a year. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The arrival of Huey and Pancake means that Chimp Haven now has all of the chimps that the NIH says are currently eligible to go to the sanctuary. There's 85 or so remaining at research facilities. The vast majority have chronic progressive health problems, like heart disease or diabetes. James Anderson works for the NIH. He says those conditions make these chimps too frail to ever move. JAMES ANDERSON: The transfer process can be quite dangerous - not just the physical stress of anesthesia, putting the animal on the truck, but also the social readjustment of entering a new community. And that can go on for months after arriving at the sanctuary. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So sick chimps can just stay put. Living in large enclosures with access to the outdoors, Anderson says they're well cared for. ANDERSON: The caretakers there have known them, in many cases for decades. There are social programs for them. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says there are nine chimps that are probably healthy enough to be relocated, but they aren't eligible to go to the sanctuary because they are socially bonded to another sicker chimp that can't be moved. So those animals need to stay where they are. ANDERSON: Until the frail one passes. And then we'll reconsider, OK, can they move now? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Some animal welfare groups want even more of the chimps still at research facilities to go to the sanctuary. They suspect that many of the ones deemed too frail would actually do just fine. Kathleen Conlee is with the Humane Society of the United States. She says medical summaries on those chimps often say there's a concern that the stress of moving could cause a heart attack. KATHLEEN CONLEE: Chimpanzees are notorious for cardiac problems anyway. So you can be a completely healthy chimpanzee at 16 years old and die from a heart attack, quite frankly. So, you know, to us, that's not a reason to keep them sitting in the labs. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Conlee points out that the larger social groups and more natural settings found in the sanctuary could benefit chimps' health and well-being. Even older chimps can live for a long time, like Ladybird, a 61-year-old female who moved to Chimp Haven a decade ago. CONLEE: Chimp Haven just has the expertise to provide that higher level of welfare. And, you know, in addition to the welfare of the chimps is the cost. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Care for chimps is significantly cheaper at Chimp Haven, which raises some of its own funding. The Humane Society of the United States, along with other plaintiffs, has sued the NIH over some of the chimps deemed ineligible to go to the sanctuary. That litigation should play out in the coming months. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF ON OUR OWN CLOCK'S \"DUNE DANCE\") STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   Two chimpanzees have just retired.

But the old saying is incompatible with climate change. Natural gas cooking faces scrutiny, and a study out today shows that gas stoves may leak climate-warming greenhouse gases even when the stove is turned off. Jeff Brady joins us from NPR's climate team. Hey there, Jeff. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: You are apparently talking about the stove in my house. So what's going on here? BRADY: Well, you know, it's not obvious why a gas stove that's off might leak. It's not obvious at first, but just stick with me a little bit here. INSKEEP: OK. BRADY: Scientists at Stanford University measured emissions from gas stoves in 53 California homes. They were looking for methane; that's the main ingredient in natural gas. It's also a potent greenhouse gas. Researchers measured how much methane is leaked each time you turn the knob in that second before the gas lights on fire. They also measured how much unburned methane is released during cooking. And they measured how much methane is released when the stove is off. Stanford professor Rob Jackson says most of these leaks come from loose connections. ROB JACKSON: Simply owning a natural gas stove and having natural gas pipes and fittings in your home leads to more emissions over 24 hours than the amount emitted while the burners are on. BRADY: And Jackson says in this study, it didn't matter if the stove was old or new or what brand it was, the presence of leaks was consistent. INSKEEP: Which is amazing. It means that I'm just kind of living with a lot of gas, even if I never cooked anything. But how big a problem is this in relation to climate? BRADY: Well, you know, compared to something like coal-fired power plants, this is a relatively tiny amount of greenhouse gases. And there are no health risks here that - to speak of. But the U. S. has a goal of zeroing out greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Jackson says if you add up the more than 40 million gas stoves in the U. S. , the amount of leaked methane every year has about the same climate-warming effect as the carbon dioxide from a half million cars. Now, the EPA says buildings account for more than a tenth of the country's greenhouse gas emissions. That's why some climate activists want to switch to electric - want people to switch to electric stoves. That's part of a broader campaign to stop natural gas use in buildings. The thinking is that since Americans care about the cooking stove, changing that to cleaner electricity and, you know, then maybe bigger sources of emissions in homes may get switched, too, like the furnace, the water heater and clothes dryerINSKEEP: How are natural gas utilities responding to these campaigns to get gas out of the house? BRADY: This is an existential threat for gas utilities because energy modelers say it's hard to find cost-effective ways to reach net zero emissions if gas still gets burned in individual homes and offices. And those utilities, they're trying to find cleaner replacements, things like so-called renewable natural gas from agriculture and using hydrogen produced with renewable energy. Also, those utilities are getting laws passed to preserve their business. Twenty states now have laws on the books that prevent cities from banning gas hookups in new buildings, and that's been a trend as local governments try to meet their own climate targets in places like Seattle, Berkeley and New York. INSKEEP: If you keep the gas stove, can you at least cut down on these leaks? BRADY: Yeah. And really, all it takes is a wrench. Rob Jackson at Stanford says you can pull out your stove, check to make sure all the gas connections are nice and tight, and that'll at least reduce the leaks. But Jackson says he's among those concluding that the only way to ensure there are no leaks is to switch to an electric stove. And he says his research has convinced him it's time for him to do that.

From member station KUNM, Alice Fordham reports. ALICE FORDHAM, BYLINE: In a sunny classroom in Pojoaque Valley Middle School, north of Santa Fe, a class of lively eighth graders is doing a reading exercise, and a National Guardsman in uniform paces around, peering over their shoulders. It's his second day as a substitute teacher, and his arrival caused quite a stir. JOSHUA VILLALOBOS: I went to one of my classes, and I saw him there. I was kind of shocked at first. FORDHAM: Student Joshua Villalobos says during the omicron wave, many teachers have been absent. JOSHUA: It's pretty stressful now that there's COVID around in school, and there's a bunch of cases going around, and some people have to get quarantined. FORDHAM: He's OK with having a soldier teaching. He doesn't want school to close again. He didn't learn much remotely, and coming back was hard. JOSHUA: I was kind of nervous 'cause, like, we got there. I didn't talk to nobody. None of us really knew each other. And, like, if the teacher calls on me, I wasn't really going to know what she's talking about 'cause I didn't learn anything. AUSTIN ALT: One person from each table, collect the papers. FORDHAM: The newly minted substitute teacher, Austin Alt, is 25 and has never taught a class in his life. He usually works as a lab technician. After a background check and a few hours of online training, his first assignment was band class. ALT: I was anxious. I didn't know what to expect. The kids were very comforting, welcoming me in and very respectful and such. They showed me a lot about learning music as well, so it was a learning experience on both ends. FORDHAM: He volunteered after watching his younger brothers struggle with remote learning. ALT: The online stuff just doesn't get to them correctly. And then it's also hard because some people don't have the internet. FORDHAM: More kids live in poverty here than in almost any other state. School principal Mario Vigil says the poorest children really suffer when schools close. MARIO VIGIL: It was very difficult for our students to be home alone. We have families who are working-class families who have one, possibly two, sometimes three jobs, and they're busy working and putting food on the table. FORDHAM: But keeping school open is getting harder as more teachers retire or quit, ground down by remote learning and by dealing with students affected by loneliness, hardship or grief. VIGIL: We're asking them to be counselors. We're asking them to be teachers. We're asking them to be caretakers. It's taxing for teachers, and I can see how our teachers are getting burnt out. FORDHAM: New Mexico now has a shortfall of more than a thousand teachers. Still, not everyone thinks minimally trained volunteers are the solution. Some say what's needed is real professionals, and there are plans to recruit more teachers. Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham has proposed a big pay rise for educators. New Mexico ranks 32nd nationwide in average salary for teachers. But right now, during this crisis, Lujan Grisham has volunteered to be a sub herself and encouraged state employees, as well as the National Guard, to join her. (SOUNDBITE OF SCHOOL BELL RINGING)FORDHAM: After class, kids run to get on waiting buses. Students Hannah Sarmiento and Anaadaly Firro (ph) say they like the new substitute.

JOSHUA: It's pretty stressful now that there's COVID around in school, and there's a bunch of cases going around, and some people have to get quarantined. FORDHAM: He's OK with having a soldier teaching. He doesn't want school to close again. He didn't learn much remotely, and coming back was hard. JOSHUA: I was kind of nervous 'cause, like, we got there. I didn't talk to nobody. None of us really knew each other. And, like, if the teacher calls on me, I wasn't really going to know what she's talking about 'cause I didn't learn anything. AUSTIN ALT: One person from each table, collect the papers. FORDHAM: The newly minted substitute teacher, Austin Alt, is 25 and has never taught a class in his life. He usually works as a lab technician. After a background check and a few hours of online training, his first assignment was band class. ALT: I was anxious. I didn't know what to expect. The kids were very comforting, welcoming me in and very respectful and such. They showed me a lot about learning music as well, so it was a learning experience on both ends. FORDHAM: He volunteered after watching his younger brothers struggle with remote learning. ALT: The online stuff just doesn't get to them correctly. And then it's also hard because some people don't have the internet. FORDHAM: More kids live in poverty here than in almost any other state. School principal Mario Vigil says the poorest children really suffer when schools close. MARIO VIGIL: It was very difficult for our students to be home alone. We have families who are working-class families who have one, possibly two, sometimes three jobs, and they're busy working and putting food on the table. FORDHAM: But keeping school open is getting harder as more teachers retire or quit, ground down by remote learning and by dealing with students affected by loneliness, hardship or grief. VIGIL: We're asking them to be counselors. We're asking them to be teachers. We're asking them to be caretakers. It's taxing for teachers, and I can see how our teachers are getting burnt out. FORDHAM: New Mexico now has a shortfall of more than a thousand teachers. Still, not everyone thinks minimally trained volunteers are the solution. Some say what's needed is real professionals, and there are plans to recruit more teachers. Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham has proposed a big pay rise for educators. New Mexico ranks 32nd nationwide in average salary for teachers. But right now, during this crisis, Lujan Grisham has volunteered to be a sub herself and encouraged state employees, as well as the National Guard, to join her. (SOUNDBITE OF SCHOOL BELL RINGING) FORDHAM: After class, kids run to get on waiting buses. Students Hannah Sarmiento and Anaadaly Firro (ph) say they like the new substitute. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT #1: I kind of thought he was going to be, like, strict. He was actually kind of fun. FORDHAM: Life with no school was hard. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT #2: Very depressing. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT #1: Kind of sad 'cause we didn't get to see our friends. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT #2: It's, like, very depressing. FORDHAM: And they hug and walk off together across the snowy schoolyard under the clear blue sky. For NPR News, I'm Alice Fordham in Pojoaque.

They're getting paid to capture a powerful greenhouse gas that's released from cow manure. But critics say these payments actually bankroll polluters. NPR's Dan Charles explains. DAN CHARLES, BYLINE: High Plains Ponderosa Dairy in southwest Kansas has thousands of cows. The dairy's general manager, Greg Bethard, says they stay comfortable inside their barns. GREG BETHARD: Where they're - got, you know, fans and cooling in the summertime, and they're warmer in the wintertime. But because of that, when our cows poop, it goes on the concrete, and we collect it all. CHARLES: The manure goes into big storage ponds called lagoons, where bacteria feed on it and release a gas called methane. That's the main ingredient in the fuel we call natural gas. It's also an important greenhouse gas heating up the planet. But now High Plains Dairy is building big tanks for the manure, so-called digesters that will capture the methane, and they'll send it to a natural gas pipeline just a few miles away. BETHARD: So our gas is going to be injected into the pipeline and make its way to California. CHARLES: It has to get to California in order to be part of a lucrative transaction - methane cuts in Kansas cancelling out pollution in California - because California is imposing tough new limits on greenhouse gas emissions from the state's oil and gas companies, and one way those companies can meet the cap on emissions is by paying for cuts in greenhouse emissions somewhere else, like at High Plains Ponderosa Dairy. BETHARD: It's just another source of income for us. CHARLES: The way it works is California issues pollution-reduction credits to the dairy based on how much methane it captures, and then California's oil and gas companies can buy those credits to cancel out their emissions in the state. There's a somewhat different federal program that also awards credits. And together, those credits will likely be worth tens of millions of dollars a year to the dairy and a partner that's actually building the digester, although the price of those credits does go up and down depending on demand. BETHARD: If you take today's value and extrapolated it out, yes, there's profits to be made, but I still think long term our primary income source is still going to be milk. CHARLES: An economist at the University of California, Davis, Aaron Smith, decided to look into the economics of this last year. AARON SMITH: I had heard people saying, well, this is kind of a big deal. And I sort of put off looking into it for a while 'cause I thought, how big of a deal, really, could it be? CHARLES: But once he looked at the numbers, he was stunned. Revenue from the pollution-cutting credits amounted to a 50% boost over what a farm would earn just by selling milk. Smith says it's so much these credits might actually encourage dairies to expand - adding more cows, producing more manure. And remember; those cows also burp out a lot of methane as they digest grass, and that methane can't be captured. It all seems contrary to the goal of California's emission-trading system. SMITH: If you have a program that creates incentives to generate more pollution, then you're not going to get the benefits that you want. CHARLES: Smith says he's seen no evidence that these credits are persuading dairies to expand, but considering the numbers, he says, it certainly could happen. And some environmental justice groups are mobilizing to stop it. Brent Newell, an attorney with one of those groups, Public Justice, wrote a petition to California's air pollution regulator demanding that it stop giving dairy or beef or hog farms credits for capturing methane. BRENT NEWELL: The solution is not to commodify it so that cows and hogs are pooping money. CHARLES: Newell says these credits mainly benefit the biggest polluters, the biggest farms and those that store manure in lagoons. NEWELL: And it harms the health and welfare of communities that experience all the air and water pollution that's associated with the factory farm system. CHARLES: California's regulators recently denied Newell's petition, though. They say the current system is working, encouraging farmers to capture methane. But they promise to study the criticisms and decide whether the program needs tweaking. Dan Charles, NPR News.

To talk about the study and the role climate change is playing, we're joined by a member of NPR's climate team, Nathan Rott. Hey, Nate. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Leila. FADEL: Good morning. So 1,200 years - I can't quite wrap my head around that amount of time. ROTT: Yeah. I mean, it's the driest period since the year 800 A. D. , which, to give you a sense, is around the same time that Charlemagne was being crowned emperor of Rome and Mayan civilization peaked in Mesoamerica - so a little before our time. And we might actually be in the driest period in even longer. Researchers looked at tree ring data collected from thousands of sites across the Southwest. I talked to Park Williams, a bioclimatologist, very cool title, at the University of California, Los Angeles. He led the study, which was published in the journal Nature Climate Change. PARK WILLIAMS: Yeah, very old trees, as well as deadwood that's on the ground, wood preserved at archaeological sites - you know, trees that Native Americans may have chopped down in the 1100s and used as beams in their homes. ROTT: And the data they got from that only gave them a clear view of moisture levels dating back to the year 800, which is why it could be longer. FADEL: Wow. There must have been other major droughts in all that time. Did they find any that came close to what's happening now? ROTT: Yeah. So the researchers found four other megadroughts, four other, you know, multi-decade periods of extreme dryness, and the closest comparison they found to today was a drought that occurred in the late 1500s. That drought lasted 23 years. Ours is now 22, you know, old enough to buy a beer. And Williams says what's discouraging is that it does not seem to be letting up. WILLIAMS: At the same time that the most comparable megadrought was kind of petering out, this drought of the 2000s is ramping up and becoming more intense or as intense as it ever has during its 22-year life so far, indicating that this drought is nowhere near done. ROTT: Which is something we're seeing with low reservoirs and snowpacks in the West right now. FADEL: So let's get into that. What does this megadrought look like right now? ROTT: So it looks like the nation's two largest reservoirs sitting about a third of their total capacity, groundwater reserves that are being sucked dry, states, cities, farmers that are cutting back on their water use. There's more to the Western water picture than, you know, the Colorado River, but it's the water source for roughly 40 million people, entire cities like Las Vegas. And the Colorado River has been on a downward trajectory for a really long time. I talked to Jack Schmidt, a watershed ecologist at Utah State University, about this recently, and he compared the Western water picture to a bank account. You know, we had water saved in reservoirs and aquifers, but for the last two decades, we've been using more than we actually get. JACK SCHMIDT: It's unfortunately a joint account. And everyone agrees that total expenditure out of the checking account needs to go down, but right now, everyone's looking at the other person to say you spend less, not me. FADEL: But aren't some states taking some steps to cut water use? ROTT: They are. You know, California, Nevada, Arizona - they've all voluntarily agreed to leave more water in Lake Mead, and there are larger discussions happening on the Colorado River watershed. But one of the key takeaways from this study is that water use is going to have to really change in the future because of climate change. The study's authors say roughly 40% of the current megadrought is attributable to human-caused climate change, and that's just going to get worse at this point. FADEL: NPR's Nathan Rott, thank you. ROTT: Yeah. Thank you. LEILA FADEL, HOST:   Depleted water tables, devastating wildfires - it's clear there's a severe drought in the western U. S. In fact, scientists call it a megadrought. But new research shows just how extreme the situation has become. The American Southwest is the driest it's been in 1,200 years. To talk about the study and the role climate change is playing, we're joined by a member of NPR's climate team, Nathan Rott. Hey, Nate. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Leila. FADEL: Good morning. So 1,200 years - I can't quite wrap my head around that amount of time. ROTT: Yeah. I mean, it's the driest period since the year 800 A. D. , which, to give you a sense, is around the same time that Charlemagne was being crowned emperor of Rome and Mayan civilization peaked in Mesoamerica - so a little before our time. And we might actually be in the driest period in even longer. Researchers looked at tree ring data collected from thousands of sites across the Southwest.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: On the show today - ideas about rest because after you've spent a day working hard, sometimes all you want to do is close your eyes and turn off your brain. But, of course, it's not quite that simple. DYLAN SELTERMAN: Well, you hit the nail on the head. We are definitely very active, at least mentally, when we sleep. Parts of our body get a rest, but our minds are doing a lot of work. ZOMORODI: This is Dylan Selterman. He's a psychologist and associate professor at Johns Hopkins, and he's something of an expert on dreams and what they mean in our lives. SELTERMAN: You'd be surprised how often I hear the teeth-falling-out-of-the-mouth dream. I get that a lot from people. ZOMORODI: Oh, I have that one. SELTERMAN: Yep. I've had a lot of, like, \"Star Wars\" dreams. . . ZOMORODI: Oh. SELTERMAN: . . . Where I'm in another universe, holding a lightsaber. And I know it's very dorky. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). About a decade ago, when Dylan was working on his dissertation, he collected people's stories about their dreams, over 800 of them, to try and understand how those dreams affected them when they were awake. SELTERMAN: So we recruited a sample of young adults and asked them to keep a log of their dreams for two weeks. And we found that about 20 to 25% of the time, people were dreaming about romantic encounters. Most of those dreams had to do with their significant others, but people did dream about other partners. They dreamt about their exes. They dreamt about new partners they may have met. And we found that when people have those dreams, it is associated with their behavior and their feelings with their romantic partners the next day. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2, BYLINE: I dreamt I was at a carnival with my girlfriend. She kept beating me at the whack-a-mole game, even though I thought I was winning by a lot. In the end, she won a big teddy bear as a prize, which is apparently what she wanted, so I was happy. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3, BYLINE: We were watching \"Saw II. \" I was so scared of the movie, I kept ducking my head into his shoulders and squeaking when the gory parts appeared. He laughed and comforted me. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4, BYLINE: I remember being called constantly by my girlfriend checking up on me, and it got to the point where we got into a fight because I told her she didn't trust me, and I ended up getting beyond drunk and hooking up with some random girl. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5, BYLINE: A girl left a message on my boyfriend's Facebook page. I found out he called her, they were talking, and he told her that he loves her. How could he do this to me? He just says, I don't know. And I keep yelling and crying until finally waking myself out of the dream. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Oh, Dylan, all we want to know is, what does it mean? What does it all mean? (Laughter). SELTERMAN: Well, I wouldn't go as far as to say that every single thing that happens in everyone's dream has a meaning, but I think when it comes to especially the dreams that are very social, that they have a lot of important messages for us. ZOMORODI: Here's Dylan Selterman on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK)SELTERMAN: If you have this type of dream and you wake up and your partner's sleeping in the bed right next to you, what might you say? What might you do in that situation? What we're seeing in these dreams is a lot of the same kinds of behaviors that people would exhibit with their romantic partners in their waking lives. There's kissing. There's affectionate behavior. There's comforting. That being said, not all dreams are sunshine and roses. When people have these types of dreams with arguments or conflict or betrayal or jealousy, they have more conflict with their partners the next day, and that's controlling for the previous day's conflict, so it's not part of some day-to-day mechanism. There's something unique about the dream. When people have an infidelity dream, when they're cheating on their partner, they're hooking up with someone else, they feel significantly less love and closeness the next day. Why? Why do dreams have this association? Why do they have this effect? The short answer is we still don't know. Dreams are one of the big unsolved mysteries of science. There are several competing theories that might explain what's going on here. Patrick McNamara proposed a theory that dreams evolved in order to facilitate social attachment bonds, especially between parents and children and romantic partners. But what about all those conflict dreams? That would kind of suggest the opposite, that it is almost hurting the attachment bonds. And there's another theory that might address this, which is more along the lines that dreams evolved in order to help us solve problems, in order to see difficult issues from a new perspective and maybe come to conclusions or have solutions that we wouldn't otherwise be able to see, to adapt to emotionally difficult situations. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: I am so curious. Tell me more about how these dreams, I mean, especially the negative ones, affected people's moods the next day, even their behavior. SELTERMAN: I mean, anyone can have a dream about someone who's not their significant other. But if the relationship is strong, then they might wake up and say, well, I definitely don't want to do that in real life, so I'm going to make an extra effort to be connected to my partner and pay attention to their needs. On the other hand, if the relationship's not going well, maybe that would prompt people to think, I need to move on from this person. A few of my participants, a handful of them, told me that they broke up with their significant others because of the dreams that they were having during the study. ZOMORODI: Wow. SELTERMAN: It wasn't an incredibly large number, but it was enough that a few of them went out of their way to tell me that during the debriefing process. ZOMORODI: So this theory that negative dreams might be preparing you to solve problems - to be clear, it's not just relationship problems, right? If, you know, a quarter of the time we dream about our partners, the other three-quarters of the time we could be dreaming about any number of stressful scenarios. SELTERMAN: I'm so glad you brought that up. So let's back up a little bit to March of 2020 because I remember seeing a lot of people post online that they were having very vivid and intense dreams during those initial lockdowns. And I was having them, too. And I think part of the reason for that is our dreams and our minds, to some extent, are working overtime to try to make sense of this crazy, new world that we found ourselves in where everything was turned upside down. I had a dream where I touched a surface and then touched my face, and in the dream, I was really distressed because I thought that I had infected myself. So I woke up the next day, and I was much more vigilant about washing my hands before touching my face. So I think that people were having those types of dreams to prepare themselves for the new world we found ourselves. ZOMORODI: Yeah. SELTERMAN: And I'm thinking especially about the general research on cognitive reframing and that kind of emotional work that we put into our general mental health. We take experiences that might be negative and try to extract something positive from them. So that same logic can be applied to our dreams. Just because you have negative emotion in dreams does not mean that we should try to stop those types of dreams from happening. ZOMORODI: What do you mean by that? How could that be positive when I think that I've, like - when I first had a newborn, I used to have the dream that I'd forgotten where I put my baby. That was a terrifying one. SELTERMAN: Yeah. ZOMORODI: Another dream that I have that I've heard many people have is of a tsunami wave - these things that we all seem to dream that are very upsetting. SELTERMAN: Right. Well, a possibility is that our minds are thinking about possible things that could happen. And in the dream, it could be more symbolic. It could be more abstract. So maybe this tsunami is just one of many types of problems that we could face, and we are just going over what might happen and how to prepare for it. So if it's a natural disaster, if it's COVID, if it's another problem that we're facing in our lives, who are the people we can depend on? What are the resources we need? How would I prepare for this disaster? And then using that after you wake up to live a healthier life. And we do see this kind of thing happening in people's dreams. What some therapists call dream work - if someone is having a recurring nightmare, to put yourself back into the dream, so to speak, while you're awake, but instead of replaying it exactly, imagine it differently. Imagine that you respond with strength and resilience instead of fear. What would that look like behaviorally? So when it comes to those types of things, I like reframing exercises for dreams, and I like them for waking life as well. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK)SELTERMAN: Here's some research by Rosalind Cartwright that shows when you look at women who are suffering from depression after going through divorce, they are actually less depressed - they're more mentally healthy - in the future at a follow-up if they dream about their ex-partner, if they dream about their former spouse. This might seem counterintuitive. You might be thinking, well, how can you get over someone if you're dreaming about them? Rosalind Cartwright calls these dreams that work, that those people who incorporated the thing that stressed them out into their dream were better off, even if the dream content was negative. Dreams have this incredible power to help us heal. As Bob Stickgold said, when you sleep, your brain is figuring it out and holding onto relevant information and throwing out the rest. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: You know, on the one hand, Dylan, I am grateful to my brain for preparing me for whatever problems might be looming. But on the other hand, I just want to wake up feeling rested. And from all the anecdotes that you've provided and the research that (laughter) you've shared, that is just not what's happening. Our dreams are not allowing our minds to truly rest. Or that's what it feels like. Am I wrong in thinking that that's what we should be yearning for? SELTERMAN: Well, it could also be the case that we just need to redefine what we call rest. Maybe rest is something that is more active than passive. I think about this in terms of physical exercise whenever I'm doing a workout and the person leading the workout says, remember to do active recovery. Stretch, hydrate, and make sure you're doing the things that are essentially helping that rest and recovery process. But it's never sitting back and doing nothing and lounging on the couch; it's a much more active process than that. And I think with dreams, you could think about it the same way. It is an active rest. It's a way to help us feel refreshed and also get things done. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK)SELTERMAN: If you get anything from this talk, I want you to take this home - that dreams are worth your time. They're an important piece of your life and worth paying attention to - that dreams represent this great, untapped reservoir of information and insights that you can gain about yourself, about your relationships, about your work, about your physical health. So start tonight. Keep a dream journal. Put a pad of paper and a pen next to your bed. And when you wake up, write down whatever it was that was in your head while you were asleep. You might be surprised at what you find. Your dreams might be trying to tell you something really important. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)ZOMORODI: That's Dylan Selterman. He's an associate teaching professor at Johns Hopkins University. You can see his full talk at ted. npr. org. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   It's the TED Radio hour from NPR.

Why do dreams have this association? Why do they have this effect? The short answer is we still don't know. Dreams are one of the big unsolved mysteries of science. There are several competing theories that might explain what's going on here. Patrick McNamara proposed a theory that dreams evolved in order to facilitate social attachment bonds, especially between parents and children and romantic partners. But what about all those conflict dreams? That would kind of suggest the opposite, that it is almost hurting the attachment bonds. And there's another theory that might address this, which is more along the lines that dreams evolved in order to help us solve problems, in order to see difficult issues from a new perspective and maybe come to conclusions or have solutions that we wouldn't otherwise be able to see, to adapt to emotionally difficult situations. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: I am so curious. Tell me more about how these dreams, I mean, especially the negative ones, affected people's moods the next day, even their behavior. SELTERMAN: I mean, anyone can have a dream about someone who's not their significant other. But if the relationship is strong, then they might wake up and say, well, I definitely don't want to do that in real life, so I'm going to make an extra effort to be connected to my partner and pay attention to their needs. On the other hand, if the relationship's not going well, maybe that would prompt people to think, I need to move on from this person. A few of my participants, a handful of them, told me that they broke up with their significant others because of the dreams that they were having during the study. ZOMORODI: Wow. SELTERMAN: It wasn't an incredibly large number, but it was enough that a few of them went out of their way to tell me that during the debriefing process. ZOMORODI: So this theory that negative dreams might be preparing you to solve problems - to be clear, it's not just relationship problems, right? If, you know, a quarter of the time we dream about our partners, the other three-quarters of the time we could be dreaming about any number of stressful scenarios. SELTERMAN: I'm so glad you brought that up. So let's back up a little bit to March of 2020 because I remember seeing a lot of people post online that they were having very vivid and intense dreams during those initial lockdowns. And I was having them, too. And I think part of the reason for that is our dreams and our minds, to some extent, are working overtime to try to make sense of this crazy, new world that we found ourselves in where everything was turned upside down. I had a dream where I touched a surface and then touched my face, and in the dream, I was really distressed because I thought that I had infected myself. So I woke up the next day, and I was much more vigilant about washing my hands before touching my face. So I think that people were having those types of dreams to prepare themselves for the new world we found ourselves. ZOMORODI: Yeah. SELTERMAN: And I'm thinking especially about the general research on cognitive reframing and that kind of emotional work that we put into our general mental health. We take experiences that might be negative and try to extract something positive from them. So that same logic can be applied to our dreams. Just because you have negative emotion in dreams does not mean that we should try to stop those types of dreams from happening. ZOMORODI: What do you mean by that? How could that be positive when I think that I've, like - when I first had a newborn, I used to have the dream that I'd forgotten where I put my baby. That was a terrifying one. SELTERMAN: Yeah. ZOMORODI: Another dream that I have that I've heard many people have is of a tsunami wave - these things that we all seem to dream that are very upsetting. SELTERMAN: Right. Well, a possibility is that our minds are thinking about possible things that could happen. And in the dream, it could be more symbolic. It could be more abstract. So maybe this tsunami is just one of many types of problems that we could face, and we are just going over what might happen and how to prepare for it. So if it's a natural disaster, if it's COVID, if it's another problem that we're facing in our lives, who are the people we can depend on? What are the resources we need? How would I prepare for this disaster? And then using that after you wake up to live a healthier life. And we do see this kind of thing happening in people's dreams. What some therapists call dream work - if someone is having a recurring nightmare, to put yourself back into the dream, so to speak, while you're awake, but instead of replaying it exactly, imagine it differently. Imagine that you respond with strength and resilience instead of fear. What would that look like behaviorally? So when it comes to those types of things, I like reframing exercises for dreams, and I like them for waking life as well. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK) SELTERMAN: Here's some research by Rosalind Cartwright that shows when you look at women who are suffering from depression after going through divorce, they are actually less depressed - they're more mentally healthy - in the future at a follow-up if they dream about their ex-partner, if they dream about their former spouse. This might seem counterintuitive. You might be thinking, well, how can you get over someone if you're dreaming about them? Rosalind Cartwright calls these dreams that work, that those people who incorporated the thing that stressed them out into their dream were better off, even if the dream content was negative. Dreams have this incredible power to help us heal. As Bob Stickgold said, when you sleep, your brain is figuring it out and holding onto relevant information and throwing out the rest. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: You know, on the one hand, Dylan, I am grateful to my brain for preparing me for whatever problems might be looming. But on the other hand, I just want to wake up feeling rested. And from all the anecdotes that you've provided and the research that (laughter) you've shared, that is just not what's happening. Our dreams are not allowing our minds to truly rest. Or that's what it feels like. Am I wrong in thinking that that's what we should be yearning for? SELTERMAN: Well, it could also be the case that we just need to redefine what we call rest. Maybe rest is something that is more active than passive. I think about this in terms of physical exercise whenever I'm doing a workout and the person leading the workout says, remember to do active recovery. Stretch, hydrate, and make sure you're doing the things that are essentially helping that rest and recovery process. But it's never sitting back and doing nothing and lounging on the couch; it's a much more active process than that. And I think with dreams, you could think about it the same way. It is an active rest. It's a way to help us feel refreshed and also get things done. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK) SELTERMAN: If you get anything from this talk, I want you to take this home - that dreams are worth your time. They're an important piece of your life and worth paying attention to - that dreams represent this great, untapped reservoir of information and insights that you can gain about yourself, about your relationships, about your work, about your physical health. So start tonight. Keep a dream journal. Put a pad of paper and a pen next to your bed. And when you wake up, write down whatever it was that was in your head while you were asleep. You might be surprised at what you find. Your dreams might be trying to tell you something really important. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) ZOMORODI: That's Dylan Selterman.

And one of the truest, deepest forms of rest comes to some animals every winter. MATTEO CERRI: When we talk about hibernation, what we really mean is to do what squirrels or bears or hamster, bats - that all these animals do in winter when they don't have enough resources, enough food or water. ZOMORODI: Matteo Cerri is a professor at the University of Bologna, where he studies hibernation. CERRI: They change what they need from the environment by entering this very, very special state. So it's a bit more like a standby on a TV screen or on a computer. ZOMORODI: And to put their body on standby, Matteo says that animals first have to find the right spot. CERRI: So what you're looking for is a place where you could be safe from predators, potentially invisible to the rest of the environment - where you can just wait, a place where you can be cozy and safe. ZOMORODI: Then the body, heart, lungs, brain slow down to a creep. And there's a word for it. CERRI: Yes. We call that torpor. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CERRI: So torpor is the technical word that refers to a low metabolic state. And sometime I say to my students, it's like a metabolic austerity. You don't spend anything more than what is strictly needed to exist. You could think of hibernation - or torpor, more correctly, as the natural state that may be the closer to death without actually, you know, going over. ZOMORODI: OK. So those are the basics of hibernation. But here's the thing about Matteo. CERRI: I'm actually working on - try to replicate or simulate hibernation for human use. ZOMORODI: Yeah, human hibernation. Matteo is studying whether it would be possible to put people into this extreme state of torpor. CERRI: I will say, there is a clear path to try to reach this goal. ZOMORODI: OK. Matteo, I understand why animals would hibernate. But you think that there are reasons why humans would want to hibernate? CERRI: That's absolutely what we're thinking is a basket full of resources for medicine, for space travel. And it could really exploit a different state of the body, a different physiology that we are starting now to unraveling and understanding in deeper detail, and could lead to, potentially, disruptive application. I know disruptive is a hype word. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). CERRI: And maybe it's counterproductive to say it. But I really think it will be disruptive. ZOMORODI: Well, yeah, it definitely sounds disruptive. But - OK, so let's start with space travel. You are working with the European Space Agency on this problem, figuring out how astronauts could travel years - even decades - into deep space, which would be really hard on the human body. CERRI: Yeah. Having a trip that lasts, let's say, a decade in space, you have to imagine yourself - you are in a very confined space, night and day, every time, every minute, every hour. So that is pretty stressful. And then there are other problem. Your strength, the structure of your body - some muscle will become weak because of the lack of gravity, and as well for your bone. If they will not be able to keep you standing against the gravity of another planet, how are you going to stand or walk? Then there is the problem of radiation. So the amount of radiation you would get for this kind of trip, there's just too much, unless we find some way to reduce this damage or protect ourselves from the damage. ZOMORODI: OK. So that's a lot of problems. But you think hibernation could do that, could work as protection? CERRI: That's absolutely right. First thing, obviously, you don't need that much food and water and resources when you're hibernating. And you don't produce much biological waste as well. So all of that is cleaner. Your muscle and your bone will probably preserve much of their structure and their strength. And finally, hibernation gives cell an interesting defense against radiation. It doesn't reduce, apparently, the damage radiation do to tissues. But he help tissue repair those damage in a much better way than if we were not hibernating. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Wow. That is fascinating. But I don't think that many of us have plans to travel to Mars anytime soon. CERRI: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: I will say, though, you are making me fantasize about going into hibernation for my next long-haul flight. Is that possible? Could we, maybe, one day, put ourselves into a state of hibernation and wake up in a different time zone feeling pretty good? CERRI: That would be great. That would be fantastic. I hate long flights. So - I had a friend. He's, like, a trader in the stock market. He was asking me, could we go into torpor when the market goes down. . . ZOMORODI: (Laughter). CERRI: . . . And wake up when the market goes up? So it will all depend on how easy and risky the technology would be. But why put a limit to our hope? ZOMORODI: When we come back, we get a little more grounded - how hibernation could be used more immediately in medical treatments. On the show today, rest. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. Stay with us. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and we were just talking to hibernation expert Matteo Cerri. Matteo says there are a few intriguing stories that make researchers believe humans can hibernate or be put into a state of torpor, including a story published in 1800 about an entire village in Russia that would sleep through the winter. CERRI: There is a Russian term for this winter sleep. It's called lotska. I don't know if I pronounce it correctly. And apparently, those peasants and villagers were gathering together in this large house in the center of the town to sleep the winter off together - just sleeping there, waiting for spring to come. ZOMORODI: I mean, that's - whether it's true or not, that is a beautiful story. It's like a fairy tale. But there is a famous story from the neurologist Oliver Sacks about a man that he called Uncle Toby, right? CERRI: Yes, definitely. Oliver Sacks - he was visiting a family for - you know, on-site for some other question. And he noticed this person, like - he said, like, icy frozen - still alive though - with temperature - body temperature of 69 Fahrenheit. So about 20 Celsius. ZOMORODI: Yikes. Cold. CERRI: Yes - and ask what happen to him. And they say, well, this is Uncle Toby. And seven years ago, he just stopped. He lives with us. We take care of him. We feed him, we shave him, we dress him, but he just stands there. So he suspected hyperthyroidism as a possible cause of this strange behavior and proposed to treat him with thyroid hormone - at the time was available. And the family agree, and Uncle Toby actually - he woke up. So he was given a drug and he wake up, and he doesn't remember the seven years that were passed. But then - and that would be a good ending story. But the story actually is not - it's sad in its end, because Uncle Toby had cancer - small cell lung cancer - and the cancer woke up with him. And then it killed him in a few months. ZOMORODI: So does that mean that when Uncle Toby was in this sort of stupor that maybe - not only did he go to sleep, but maybe the cancer went to sleep during that time? CERRI: Yes, that is exactly the point. The idea is that the cancer in Uncle Toby had found a way to leave both. So a provocative hypothesis would be that the cancer actually produced something that unlocked the ability of the brain to enter torpor. And then therefore the body entered torpor, and therefore the cancer stopped growing because that what happened in torpor. The cancer usually stopped growing. And they both stay that way. And once we awake Uncle Toby, we also wake the cancer, and the story ends. ZOMORODI: So when we hear that story, does it tell us something about the way that putting humans into hibernation or torpor might be used when it comes to treating something as aggressive and active as mutations in cells, cancer? CERRI: It could be. It could be used for this kind of clinical condition. Even more pressing would be for someone waiting for an organ transplant. There are about 50 people pretty much every day between the - within Europe and the United States die because of lack of organ. So if you could suspend them, you know, slowing their down metabolism down, then you increase their chances to potentially find an organ. But in the case of Uncle Toby's story, the important part for us is that there seems to be a way in which the brain can be made - induce hibernation, can be reactivating this old state, even in humans. And so it would be feasible. That's what we hope for. ZOMORODI: I mean, do you imagine wings of hospitals filled with patients who are resting in a state of torpor, waiting for their cancer treatment or waiting for an organ transplant? Is that something that might happen? CERRI: Yes. Yes, that's what I envision. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: So how would we do this? Whether, you know, it is for space travel or for medicine or any number of purposes, like, how would you put people into this state of hibernation? CERRI: So, so far, the greatest results were to induce into a state that very much resemble hibernation animal that are not able to enter hibernation or torpor. And we call - I call, personally - this state synthetic torpor. ZOMORODI: Oh, so you induce this in animals in the lab. CERRI: Yes. And we were able to do it by silencing the activity of a little group of neurons in the very old part of our brain. In the past 10 years, there have been amazing discovery in the field. We have now a better idea of the brain network that control torpor. We have uncover other hotspot that could be target for inducing torpor. So a lot of exciting thing happen in the - really, in the last 10 years. ZOMORODI: So can we talk about waking up? What it - I had the pleasure of having a routine procedure earlier this week where I was put under general anesthesia, and it is just the weirdest thing coming out of it. You're like, wait, where was I for (laughter) the last half hour? What would waking up from this state of torpor hibernation be like? CERRI: It's the most dangerous part, I would say, of hibernation. And. . . ZOMORODI: Oh. CERRI: . . . And there is really little that we know about how this animal wakes up. The Arctic ground squirrel, his brain is at minus 1 Celsius. How is this brain able to bring the body back to normal? And that's still quite unknown. But what we see is definitely for, especially for the brain, is the most plastic state I've ever seen as a neurophysiologist. So synapses get form and reform is a neuro storm (ph) of molecules, of active brain molecules. So it could be something about, like, dreaming or it could provide you sensation of dreamlike state, my guess. Maybe is even pleasurable - we don't know - or maybe not. But after you wake up, I would say you will also be very, very sleepy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CERRI: You need to sleep after hibernation. The reason why - still mystery. Like, the entire time you spent in torpor was sleep deprivation. ZOMORODI: So you need to rest after your big rest. CERRI: Oh, yeah. It's hard to tell that hibernation is rest. It's suspension. You are retiring from the game of life for a little bit of time. ZOMORODI: That's neurophysiologist and hibernation researcher Matteo Cerri. If you speak Italian, you can watch his TED Talk at ted. com. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   On the show today, rest. And one of the truest, deepest forms of rest comes to some animals every winter.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)CRAIG RICHARD: I remember walking in the door, and they would walk me over to that chair where you lean back. ZOMORODI: This is physiologist Craig Richard. RICHARD: And they put your head, the back of your head, into the sink, and they turn on some warm water. (SOUNDBITE OF WATER RUNNING)ZOMORODI: Craig used to love going to the hairdresser. RICHARD: And they start running that water through your hair. (SOUNDBITE OF HAIR DRYER)RICHARD: And then they start running their fingers through your hair. And that moment right there is just - I would want that to last a long time. (SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS)RICHARD: They then walk me over to the chair, and they'd sit me down. (SOUNDBITE OF SPRAY BOTTLE SPRAYING)RICHARD: But then they'd start teasing my hair a little bit and saying, well, what do you want to do? Do you want it shorter? Do you want it like this? (SOUNDBITE OF BRUSH RUNNING THROUGH HAIR)RICHARD: And then they would start cutting it. (SOUNDBITE OF SCISSORS OPENING AND CLOSING)RICHARD: I'd hear the snip, snip, snip of the scissors. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RICHARD: And then all that would just put me in this deep state of relaxation. I would feel these brain tingles. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RICHARD: And I have a confession because you're only hearing my voice right now; you're not seeing me. I am a bald man, but I don't miss my hair. What I miss is going to the hairdresser for that stimulation of ASMR that would happen. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: ASMR, you may have heard of it before - those videos on YouTube of people whispering or making crinkling noises that millions of people watch to relax. Craig spent the last several years researching why some people love these sounds. RICHARD: ASMR stands for autonomous sensory meridian response, which is just a complicated word for a feeling that is deeply relaxing. But it also has these signature brain tingles, which feel light and sparkly. The triggers for this relaxing feeling can be a sound. . . (SOUNDBITE OF RATTLING)RICHARD: . . . Can be voices. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WHISPERING)RICHARD: . . . Can be light touch, can be movements. . . (SOUNDBITE OF CRINKLING)RICHARD: But what's common to all these triggers of ASMR is that they must be gentle, low volume if they're sounds and non-abrupt. And it's usually a moment of positive personal attention, which means that you're interacting with someone who is kind and caring. This could be between a hairdresser and a client, a health professional and a patient, romantic partners or even best friends. ZOMORODI: So tell me - how on Earth, Craig, did you discover this world of research, and when did you find out that these sensations were actually something neurological going on? RICHARD: Yeah. I was listening to a podcast in my kitchen and the episode was about this term that I had never heard before - autonomous sensory meridian response. And I'm a physiologist, and this sounded like physiology, but I'd never heard of it, so I was very skeptical. And I was about to delete the episode until they gave the example of Bob Ross. They said people who experience ASMR tend to feel deeply relaxed and feel these brain tingles when they watch the TV show, Bob Ross' \"Joy Of Painting\" and my eyes lit up. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE JOY OF PAINTING\")BOB ROSS: Hello. I'm Bob Ross, and I'd like to welcome you to the 29th \"Joy Of Painting\" series. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: For those who aren't familiar, Bob Ross has become kind of a kitschy icon. But back in the '80s, he was this guy with big hair on public television who would paint a landscape in real time on camera. But there was something tantalizing about him. RICHARD: He had a gentle voice, he had a kind disposition, and he had a skill that he was teaching you. It fits the perfect scenario of what we refer to as an ASMR scenario. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE JOY OF PAINTING\")ROSS: And we'll take this old brush and just making little X's, little crisscross strokes. We'll just very quickly drop in just a little warm part in the sky here. RICHARD: It's a gentle person making gentle sounds, and somehow, that's helpful to you or you perceive that moment as caring. And Bob Ross had the most caring, loving, gentle personality. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE JOY OF PAINTING\")ROSS: What's so fantastic about this is that anybody can put a little masterpiece on canvas with just a little bit of practice, a vision in your mind, and off you go. All right. RICHARD: And when I watched him as a kid, I would just put a pillow on the floor, and I would end up falling asleep as his. . . ZOMORODI: (Laughter). RICHARD: . . . Voice and the sounds of his paintbrush on the canvas just washed over me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: When we think about feeling rested, we often think of getting a good night's sleep or taking a nap. But there are so many different ways we can rest. So today on the show, ideas about slowing down and why rest is crucial to our survival. We'll explore tips to avoid burnout. CELESTE HEADLEE: Our emotional health responds beautifully when we allow our bodies to rest. ZOMORODI: How what we dream at night impacts us during the day. DYLAN SELTERMAN: Yeah, we are definitely very active, at least mentally, when we sleep. ZOMORODI: And why scientists are pursuing a radical new form of rest - human hibernation. MATTEO CERRI: It's a suspension. You are retiring from the game of life for a little bit of time (laughter). ZOMORODI: But first, let's get back to Craig Richard and how he learned about the now-popular relaxation technique ASMR. Here he is on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK)RICHARD: Now, I'm a physiologist. I'm a researcher. I'm a data nerd. I was so excited to read about the science of ASMR (laughter). In 2013, there wasn't a single peer-reviewed research study. What I did find were plenty of forums discussing this blissful sensation. And they all reported the same response that I felt - they were deeply relaxed, they felt comforted, they felt calmed, and they had these light, sparkly brain tingles. And I also noticed that every scenario they described was always when they were receiving positive personal attention from a kind and caring individual. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: So, Craig, I mean, nowadays, these videos are all over YouTube. People are known as ASMR artists and they create these scenarios that might involve sounds or whispering, like a bookkeeper writing and moving around papers. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: . . . Create a record for your business and. . . ZOMORODI: . . . Or an eye exam. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GIBI ASMR: Hi, I'm Dr. Gibi. It's nice to see you. ZOMORODI: So for people who experience ASMR and watch these videos, why is it so enjoyable for them? Is it just watching someone talking to you, calming you down? Is it the sounds? Is it a combination of those? RICHARD: It's the combination. It's the context - to tell you this is a safe and helpful moment, so don't run away. And it creates this positive personal interaction between you and someone in a video, which of course, can't be a real interaction. But our brains still process it, at least perhaps subconsciously, as if that person is right there with us. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK)RICHARD: I recently published a brain scan study with Bryson Lochte and other researchers from Dartmouth College. And we saw that the brain regions that are activated while people are watching ASMR videos like these are the same brain regions that are activated when people are receiving positive personal attention from a kind and caring person in the real world. Now, there's plenty of unanswered questions still, like what might be the brain chemicals that are causing this amazing sensation? One likely candidate is the neurohormone oxytocin, and you might have heard of this as the love hormone. It's already well known that your oxytocin levels in your brain increase when anyone gives you positive personal attention in a kind and caring way. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: For as many people who love ASMR, there are also some people who hate it, right? I mean, I have listened to some of them where I'm like, just speak up, stop with the whispering already. I can't hear you. (LAUGHTER)ZOMORODI: And I'm guessing that there are some people listening to us and thinking, like, this is just plain weird. What on Earth are you both talking about? How do you explain it to people who are just thinking, this is bizarro niche internet silliness? RICHARD: Hmm. Well, in a way, it is all that for some people. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). RICHARD: I mean, it is. But it's also very powerful, and it's effective for a lot of people who have ASMR responses. So usually, a lot of the skepticism comes from people who don't experience it. But we do have to be careful because that, in a way, was how people responded to migraines when migraines were first reported. Just because you can't see it and you don't experience that extreme pain in your head doesn't mean it's not real for someone else. So right now, yes, it's weird, but there's more and more science coming out, there's more and more studies that are confirming it is helping people to decrease their stress. It is helping people to fall asleep. And it may be helpful for people who have clinical disorders, such as anxiety and insomnia. ZOMORODI: It's interesting to hear you say that. I mean, it's been a heck of a few years. There's been a lot to be stressed out about. People are looking for ways to put their minds and their bodies at rest, and they are struggling to find it. Does - has it always been thus? Or are we at a particularly tough moment where we need to use every single tool that's available to us, and if they sound a little weird - you know what? - that's OK? RICHARD: I guess if we were to think of our bodies like a computer - if you're always running your computer with lots of programs and it's doing a lot of activities, it will overheat, and it will shut down. We do need to find things to help us lower our stress. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RICHARD: And this is what is driving the popularity of ASMR. These aren't curious videos; they're effective videos for a lot of individuals. It's not going to work for everyone, but it's another tool in the toolbox. Whether it's ASMR videos, it's mindfulness, it's meditation, it's medication, it's good to have this large selection of things that can help calm our brains down. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: That's Craig Richard. He's a professor at Shenandoah University and hosts the podcast \"Sleep Whispers\". You can hear his full talk at ted. com. Today on the show, Part 3 of our series - Work, Play, Rest. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. We'll be right back.

Its mission is to hunt for evidence of microbes that may have once lived on the Red Planet, and that's looking promising. During its first year, Perseverance has already collected samples that might hold those signs of life. From member station WMFE in Orlando, Brendan Byrne reports. BRENDAN BYRNE, BYLINE: Seven months after its launch from Florida, Perseverance punched the Martian atmosphere at a blazing speed. A parachute slowed the vehicle way down until a rocket-powered crane fired its engines and gently lowered the car-sized rover onto the surface. And it did it all by itself. Due to communication delays, engineers back here on Earth weren't able to control or even monitor the landing in real time. RICK WELCH: And, you know, it is a nail-biting experience. There's no doubt about it. BYRNE: NASA's Rick Welch, deputy project manager for the mission, says after breathing a sigh of relief, engineers quickly put Perseverance to work, work that was decades in the making. One of the mission's main objectives is to collect samples of rocks and dirt and stash them on the surface of Mars so that a future mission could pick them up and bring them back to Earth to study, says Welch. WELCH: That's really the major reason of wanting to collect and return samples because we could really understand Mars much better by getting those samples here on Earth. BYRNE: Perseverance is the first NASA rover sent to search for signs of ancient life. Previous missions like Curiosity worked to confirm Mars once contained water and organic molecules, which are key to hosting life as we know it. Perseverance is searching Jezero Crater, where scientists think there might have been an ancient lake fed by Martian rivers. Confirming ancient life on another planet would be an extraordinary finding, and astrobiologists like University of Florida's Amy Williams will require extraordinary evidence to support those claims. AMY WILLIAMS: I think that having samples returned is the only way that I and I'm sure many other astrobiologists would be truly convinced that we had found evidence for life on Mars. BYRNE: So far, the rover has collected six samples and can collect up to 40. NASA and the European Space Agency are partnering to build a mission that will bring those samples, stored in tubes, back to Earth. If all goes well, scientists will get their hands on those samples in 2031. In the meantime, Perseverance has already broken ground in other ways. The rover brought with it a tiny aircraft called Ingenuity. The helicopter started as a tech demonstration. Engineers weren't even sure they could fly something in Mars' thin atmosphere. Now it's helping the rover spot new places to explore, says NASA's planetary science division director Lori Glaze. LORI GLAZE: It really is game changing, and even with Perseverance, the helicopter is able to fly over areas that are too rugged for the rover to traverse. So we're able to see these high-resolution images in areas that the rover can't actually reach and thinking forward to maybe future exploration. BYRNE: Ingenuity is helping navigate Perseverance to a key target - a geologically rich river delta where scientists hope to peel back the layers of Martian history, history written in the rocks by ancient water. The rover is also helping plan for future human missions to Mars, like taking fabric samples that could one day be used by Mars-bound astronauts and exposing them to the planet's harsh atmosphere. Another experiment called MOXIE is working to convert that atmosphere into oxygen that could potentially be used for fuel or life support, says Glaze. GLAZE: I mean, it's pure enough that you could breathe it. BYRNE: Perseverance is putting a lot of ground under its six wheels thanks to rugged new tires and a self-driving computer. And it's beaming back images every day so the rest of us here on Earth can follow along on the next leg of its Martian journey. For NPR News, I'm Brendan Byrne in Orlando.

MICHAELEEN DOUCLEFF, BYLINE: Hi, Ayesha. RASCOE: So I understand that several countries are already starting to roll out fourth doses, including Sweden and Chile. Do people here in the U. S. need a fourth dose? DOUCLEFF: Yeah. So right now, the data suggests that for the general population, people don't need a fourth dose. And here's why. Last week, a study came out of Israel looking specifically at what a fourth dose does. How much does it help? It's a preliminary study, and it's pretty small. It included only about 700 people. But it found that quite clearly that a fourth shot of either Pfizer or Moderna doesn't add much protection against infection beyond the third dose. Specifically, it increased protection by only about 10- to 30%, and that protection will likely wane over time. RASCOE: So a 10- to 30% increase - why would the fourth shot not boost protection like the third shot did? Why isn't it the more the better? DOUCLEFF: Yeah. I was talking to Jenna Guthmiller about this. She's an immunologist at the University of Chicago. She said, you know, this vaccine really isn't designed to stop omicron, stop omicron infections. It's designed to stop the original variants of the virus that circulated two years ago and are very different than omicron. JENNA GUTHMILLER: We know that this virus is way more likely to cause an infection just because it's more infectious, right? And so what used to work for something like, you know, the alpha variant and even to a certain degree with the delta variant is perhaps not the same thing that's going to be necessary for omicron. DOUCLEFF: In other words, no matter how many shots you throw at it - four, five, six - it's just not going to stop infections. RASCOE: OK. Well, for people who may be looking for a little hope, the fourth dose isn't going to stop infections, but what about preventing severe disease and hospitalizations? Like, would a fourth shot at least help with that? DOUCLEFF: Yeah. So first off, three doses for healthy people under age 65 or so are still doing a good job of preventing what you said, severe disease and death. But a recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that this protection may wane just a little bit over time. We're talking about a decline after four months from about 90% to 80%. RASCOE: OK, so a drop in protection of about 10% - that doesn't sound like a huge amount, but for some people, could that be a problem? DOUCLEFF: Yeah, you know, that right there is really the key. So for people who are at high risk of severe disease to start off with, losing even a small fraction of protection could be a problem. These are people who are over age 65 or who have health problems like heart disease or obesity, which put them at higher risk, or people with compromised immune systems. Akiko Iwasaki is an immunologist at Yale University. She says these people will likely benefit from an additional dose. AKIKO IWASAKI: Their immune response is not as robust as a healthy young person, and then that is probably the first target group that would require such a booster. DOUCLEFF: But she says when that booster will be needed isn't it known right now and depends on just how quickly this immunity is waning in this group. Hopefully we'll have data on that in the next month or so. RASCOE: OK, so I hear you, but some people may be wondering, is there any harm in getting a fourth shot? DOUCLEFF: You know, that's a really good question, and probably not for the fourth shot. But some immunologists say there could be harm in getting many shots in a short period of time. This is all speculative, but in the lab, sometimes researchers do see negative effects with other vaccines. Parts of the immune system can kind of start slowing down a bit. And one immunologist told me that you could actually make your immune response worse with too many shots. RASCOE: Well, that's NPR's Michaeleen Doucleff. Thank you. DOUCLEFF: Thank you. AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:   Scientists now know that the potency of the COVID booster shot wanes quickly.

That's according to new research published today. NPR's Rebecca Hersher reports that pollution is exacerbating melting caused by global warming. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: The study focuses on part of Antarctica that's relatively easy to get to. The West Antarctic Peninsula extends like a finger up toward South America. Alia Khan is a glaciologist at Western Washington University. She's been to the peninsula multiple times, and it sounds gorgeous. ALIA KHAN: Big icebergs that have broken off of the ice sheet and are floating in the ocean, lots of penguin rookeries. HERSHER: More and more people are visiting - nearly 75,000 tourists during the 2019-2020 season, plus scientists, like Khan, who arrive on ships and planes, drive around, use electrical generators that run diesel or gasoline, all of which releases exhaust full of tiny black soot particles. And those particles coat the snow. They're too small to see, but altogether, they make a big difference. KHAN: It's like wearing a dark T-shirt on a hot day - a black T-shirt versus a white T-shirt. It absorbs a lot more of that incoming solar radiation. HERSHER: Khan and colleagues estimate that the heat trapped by soot pollution is causing an extra inch of snowpack shrinkage each summer in Antarctica. Their study was published today in the journal Nature Communications. Now, any snowmelt is bad news these days because climate change is already driving catastrophic amounts of melting. An extra inch of lost snow each year is not going to be the thing that causes an ice sheet to collapse. But it's still important to rein in soot pollution in Antarctica before it gets out of control like it already has in the Arctic.

A separate competing theory holds that the pandemic came from a laboratory leak, but the new studies present physical evidence that the virus emerged in the market. NPR's Michaeleen Doucleff is here to tell us about this research. Hi there. MICHAELEEN DOUCLEFF, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: This is the seafood market we've been talking about from the very beginning of this pandemic, right? DOUCLEFF: Yes. SHAPIRO: All the way back in September 2019. DOUCLEFF: Yes, the Huanan seafood market. This was the site of the first large COVID outbreak. That part is not controversial. Perhaps thousands of people were infected there, and that market has hundreds and hundreds of stalls packed close together. And people there sold all kinds of meat - frozen, fresh and live wild animals. SHAPIRO: So what's new here? These studies have physical evidence. What is it? DOUCLEFF: Yeah. So these studies are preliminary. They haven't been peer-reviewed. But one thing they show is photographic evidence that at least two types of wild animals were sold there that could easily catch SARS-CoV-2 and shed it into the air. These are raccoon dogs and red foxes. And until this study, there had been doubts about whether animals like this - you know, that could be actual sources of the virus - were in the market. SHAPIRO: So photographs of animals that can easily spread the virus - anything else? DOUCLEFF: Yeah. So these animals - also there's proof that they were held in cages in or near one stall in particular at the market, a stall where scientists actually found a lot of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces. Michael Worobey led two of these studies. He's an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona. He says inside this stall, the virus was found on very specific surfaces, including machines where animals were butchered. MICHAEL WOROBEY: The samples were very animal-y (ph) - for example, a feather remover, a cart of the sort that we see in photographs that are used for transporting cages but, best of all, a metal cage in a back room. SHAPIRO: Best of all is a choice of words there. So we're talking about very early in the outbreak, animals in the market, genetic samples from where they were held showing the virus was there. Like, how are they connecting these dots? DOUCLEFF: Yeah. And he also - they also show that these conditions existed for years. Worobey says about five years before the pandemic, one of his colleagues was actually taken to this exact stall because people were concerned about what could potentially be growing or created there. WOROBEY: Very much told this is the kind of place that has the ingredients for cross-species transmission of dangerous pathogens. SHAPIRO: But just to rule out any other possibilities, is it possible that a person could have brought it into the market and spread it to those animals and to other people there? DOUCLEFF: Yeah. So these papers addressed that one, too. One of them looks at the genetics of the virus found in the market, and it shows that two different variants jumped into people at almost the exact same time. And it shows that these variants, one of which went on to spread all around the world, couldn't have actually evolved in people. SHAPIRO: So does this end the lab leak theory? Does this rule it out? DOUCLEFF: You know, I was talking to Jeremy Kamil about this question. He's a virologist at Louisiana State University Health Shreveport and not involved in this research. He says these studies, along with several others published recently, are really tipping the scales toward an animal origin. JEREMY KAMIL: Absolutely pushing it that way. It doesn't exclude other hypotheses entirely, but a number of the things that it doesn't exclude are other related - like, to the wildlife trade. Like, could people who were trafficking in these animals and bringing them to Wuhan have been infected and brought it to the market? DOUCLEFF: He says, you know, the picture is really becoming clearer and clearer that the pandemic most likely started in the market and came from an animal.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN: (Speaking Russian). BRUMFIEL: Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the U. N. Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva, Switzerland, watched the Russian president's statement. PAVEL PODVIG: He basically said because of the - all this hostile or aggressive statements and aggressive policies, we should start this special mode of combat duty. BRUMFIEL: It's unclear what a special mode of combat duty actually is. Podvig says a follow-up from the Russian Ministry of Defense implied it may just mean upping the staffing levels of facilities that support nuclear weapons. PODVIG: They just added a few more people. BRUMFIEL: When it comes to nuclear weapons, Russia has a lot of options. Hans Kristensen is with the Federation of American Scientists. HANS KRISTENSEN: We estimate that they have about 4,500 or so nuclear warheads in their military stockpile. BRUMFIEL: Many of those warheads are not intercontinental world-ending weapons but smaller, so-called tactical nuclear weapons. KRISTENSEN: They were developed for the purpose of fighting a limited regional battle - sort of, you know, a nuclear war in a very small area. BRUMFIEL: These battlefield weapons can be launched on the same missiles Russia is currently using to bombard Ukraine, though right now there's no indication the nukes have been pulled out of storage. Russia officially says it would only use nuclear weapons if the nation's very survival was at risk, but not everyone thinks its nuclear rules are so clear-cut. Olga Oliker is with the International Crisis Group. OLGA OLIKER: A lot of people have questioned whether the bar for Russian nuclear use is as high as its official statements say. BRUMFIEL: In 2018, the Pentagon's own Nuclear Posture Review warned Russia might use a battlefield nuke to, quote, \"de-escalate a conflict on terms favorable to Russia. \" In other words, Russia might detonate a smaller weapon to get its opponents to back off. Oliker thinks such action would only happen in a direct war with NATO forces. In the current conflict. . . OLIKER: I think it's very unlikely that Moscow is just going to lob a nuclear weapon at something, you know? Obviously, it's been a week where a lot of people's assumptions have been challenged, but I'll cling to this one for a while. BRUMFIEL: So why, then, is Putin rattling his nuclear saber? JEFFREY LEWIS: Putin has had a pretty bad news week. BRUMFIEL: Jeffrey Lewis is at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. LEWIS: The Ukrainian army is fighting back, which he didn't expect. The Russian army is performing dreadfully. They are indiscriminately shelling civilian areas. Those things all make him look weak, and the best way to push those headlines down a little bit is a nuclear threat. BRUMFIEL: But Lewis says there is plenty of nuclear risk. Putin has already miscalculated in his invasion of Ukraine. LEWIS: What would happen if the Russian warning system had a false alarm in the middle of a crisis like this? Would Putin know it was a false alarm, or would he jump to the wrong conclusion? BRUMFIEL: Even if the short-range battlefield nukes are still on the shelf, thousands of Russian and American longer-range missiles are ready to launch in just minutes, and that threat hangs over everything as the conflict in Ukraine drags on.

KRISTENSEN: They were developed for the purpose of fighting a limited regional battle - sort of, you know, a nuclear war in a very small area. BRUMFIEL: These battlefield weapons can be launched on the same missiles Russia is currently using to bombard Ukraine, though right now there's no indication the nukes have been pulled out of storage. Russia officially says it would only use nuclear weapons if the nation's very survival was at risk, but not everyone thinks its nuclear rules are so clear-cut. Olga Oliker is with the International Crisis Group. OLGA OLIKER: A lot of people have questioned whether the bar for Russian nuclear use is as high as its official statements say. BRUMFIEL: In 2018, the Pentagon's own Nuclear Posture Review warned Russia might use a battlefield nuke to, quote, \"de-escalate a conflict on terms favorable to Russia. \" In other words, Russia might detonate a smaller weapon to get its opponents to back off. Oliker thinks such action would only happen in a direct war with NATO forces. In the current conflict. . . OLIKER: I think it's very unlikely that Moscow is just going to lob a nuclear weapon at something, you know? Obviously, it's been a week where a lot of people's assumptions have been challenged, but I'll cling to this one for a while. BRUMFIEL: So why, then, is Putin rattling his nuclear saber? JEFFREY LEWIS: Putin has had a pretty bad news week. BRUMFIEL: Jeffrey Lewis is at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. LEWIS: The Ukrainian army is fighting back, which he didn't expect. The Russian army is performing dreadfully. They are indiscriminately shelling civilian areas. Those things all make him look weak, and the best way to push those headlines down a little bit is a nuclear threat. BRUMFIEL: But Lewis says there is plenty of nuclear risk. Putin has already miscalculated in his invasion of Ukraine. LEWIS: What would happen if the Russian warning system had a false alarm in the middle of a crisis like this? Would Putin know it was a false alarm, or would he jump to the wrong conclusion? BRUMFIEL: Even if the short-range battlefield nukes are still on the shelf, thousands of Russian and American longer-range missiles are ready to launch in just minutes, and that threat hangs over everything as the conflict in Ukraine drags on.

Recently, researchers reported that they believe the Spinosaurus may be the largest-ever carnivore in history, and that finding builds on the work of paleontologist Nizar Ibrahim, who in 2014 found the fossils that proved the Spinosaurus hunted its prey in rivers 97 million years ago. Here he is on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)NIZAR IBRAHIM: These dragons from deep time are incredible creatures. They're bizarre. They're beautiful. And there's very little we know about them. I've been on a quest to uncover new remains of a giant predatory dinosaur called spinosaurus. A few bones of this animal have been found in the deserts of Egypt and was described about a hundred years ago by a German paleontologist. Unfortunately, all his spinosaurus bones were destroyed in World War II. So all we are left with are just a few drawings and notes. From these drawings, we know that this creature, which lived about 100 million years ago, was very big. It had tall spines on its back, forming a magnificent sail. And it had long, slender jaws, a bit like a crocodile. But that was pretty much all we knew about this animal for the next hundred years. My field work took me to the border region between Morocco and Algeria, a place called the Kem Kem. It's a difficult place to work in. You have to deal with sandstorms and snakes and scorpions. And it's very difficult to find good fossils there. But our hard work paid off. We discovered many incredible specimens, the largest dinosaur bone that had ever been found in this part of the Sahara. We found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs, medium-sized predatory dinosaurs and seven or eight different kinds of crocodile-like hunters. These fossils were deposited in a river system. The river system was also home to a giant car-sized (unintelligible), a monster sawfish. And the skies over the river system were filled with pterosaurs, flying reptiles. It was a pretty dangerous place, not the kind of place where you'd want to travel to if you had a time machine. So we're finding all these incredible fossils of animals that lived alongside spinosaurus, but spinosaurus itself proved to be very elusive. We were just finding bits and pieces. And I was hoping that we would find a partial skeleton at some point. Finally, very recently, we were able to track down a dig site where a local fossil hunter found several bones of spinosaurus. We returned to the site. We collected more bones. And so after a hundred years, we finally had another partial skeleton of this bizarre creature, and we were able to reconstruct it. We now know that spinosaurus had a head a little bit like a crocodile, very different from other predatory dinosaurs, very different from T. Rex. But the really interesting information came from the rest of the skeleton. We had long spines, the spines forming the big sail. We had leg bones. We had skull bones with paddle-shaped feet, wide feet - very unusual. No other dinosaur has feet like this. And we think that may have been used to walk on soft sediment or maybe for paddling in the water. We also looked at the fine microstructure of the bone, the inside structure of spinosaurus bones. And it turns out that they're very dense and compact, so that's useful for buoyancy control in the water. We CT scanned all of our bones and built a digital spinosaurus skeleton. And when we looked at the digital skeleton, we realized that, yes, this was a dinosaur unlike any other. It's bigger than T-Rex. And yes, the head has fish-eating written all over it. But really, the entire skeleton has water-loving written all over it - dense bone, paddle-like feet. And the hind limbs are reduced in size. And again, this is something we see in animals that spend a substantial amount of time in the water. So as we fleshed out our spinosaurus, I'm looking at muscle attachments and wrapping our dinosaur in skin. We realized that we are dealing with a river monster, predatory dinosaur bigger than T-Rex, the ruler of this ancient river of giants feeding on the many aquatic animals. So that's really what makes this an incredible discovery. It's a dinosaur like no other. And some people told me, wow, this is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery. There are not many things left to discover in the world, right? Well, I think nothing could be further from the truth. I think the Sahara is so full of treasures. And when people tell me there are no places left to explore, I like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter Roy Chapman Andrews. And he said, \"always there has been an adventure just around the corner. And the world is still full of corners. \" That was true many decades ago when Roy Chapman Andrews wrote these lines, and it is still true today. Thank you.

We now know that spinosaurus had a head a little bit like a crocodile, very different from other predatory dinosaurs, very different from T. Rex. But the really interesting information came from the rest of the skeleton. We had long spines, the spines forming the big sail. We had leg bones. We had skull bones with paddle-shaped feet, wide feet - very unusual. No other dinosaur has feet like this. And we think that may have been used to walk on soft sediment or maybe for paddling in the water. We also looked at the fine microstructure of the bone, the inside structure of spinosaurus bones. And it turns out that they're very dense and compact, so that's useful for buoyancy control in the water. We CT scanned all of our bones and built a digital spinosaurus skeleton. And when we looked at the digital skeleton, we realized that, yes, this was a dinosaur unlike any other. It's bigger than T-Rex. And yes, the head has fish-eating written all over it. But really, the entire skeleton has water-loving written all over it - dense bone, paddle-like feet. And the hind limbs are reduced in size. And again, this is something we see in animals that spend a substantial amount of time in the water. So as we fleshed out our spinosaurus, I'm looking at muscle attachments and wrapping our dinosaur in skin. We realized that we are dealing with a river monster, predatory dinosaur bigger than T-Rex, the ruler of this ancient river of giants feeding on the many aquatic animals. So that's really what makes this an incredible discovery. It's a dinosaur like no other. And some people told me, wow, this is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery. There are not many things left to discover in the world, right? Well, I think nothing could be further from the truth. I think the Sahara is so full of treasures. And when people tell me there are no places left to explore, I like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter Roy Chapman Andrews. And he said, \"always there has been an adventure just around the corner. And the world is still full of corners. \" That was true many decades ago when Roy Chapman Andrews wrote these lines, and it is still true today. Thank you.

This process is called carbon sequestration, and our next speaker says it could be used to solve the biggest problem that our planet faces. ASMERET ASEFAW BERHE: The health of the soil system is extremely important part of addressing the climate crisis. ZOMORODI: This is Asmeret Asefaw Berhe. BERHE: I'm a professor of soil biogeochemistry at the University of California Merced. ZOMORODI: Asmeret has been studying dirt for decades. BERHE: The hook for me happened when I realized how important soil is in regulating life as we know it in the Earth's system. ZOMORODI: And the more Asmeret learned about soil, the more she realized that we humans were squandering its superpowers. Here she is on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BERHE: Climate change happening because of the increasing amount of greenhouse gases we keep releasing to the atmosphere. You all know that, but what I assume you might not have heard is that one of the most important things our human society could do to address climate change lies right there in the soil. Human actions are now releasing 9. 4 billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere. But the concentration of carbon dioxide that stays in the atmosphere is only increasing by about half of that. And that's because half of the carbon we keep releasing into the atmosphere is currently being taken up through a process we know as carbon sequestration. So in essence, whatever consequence you think we're facing from climate change right now, we're only experiencing the consequence of 50% of our pollution. But don't get too comfortable. The ability of these natural ecosystems to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and sequester it in the natural habitats is currently getting compromised as they're experiencing serious degradation because of human actions. We treat soil literally like dirt. We haven't been taking care of the soil, even though soil has actually been making our lives possible. ZOMORODI: In a moment, more from Asmeret Asefaw Berhe on the climate change solution that's right beneath our feet. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. We'll be right back. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. On the show today - What Lies Beneath. We were just talking to Asmeret Asefaw Berhe, a soil scientist at the University of California. BERHE: I love soil in all forms. I think soil is just beautiful. ZOMORODI: Asmeret says that soil is one of our best tools for fighting climate change because it can store vast amounts of carbon. Here she is again on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BERHE: There is about 3,000-billion metric tons of carbon in the soil. That's roughly about 315 times the amount of carbon that we release into the atmosphere currently, and there's twice more carbon in soil than there is in vegetation and air. Think about that for a second. There's more carbon in soil than there is in all of the world's vegetation, including the lush tropical rainforests and the giant sequoias, the expansive grasslands, all of the cultivated systems and every kind of flora you can imagine on the face of the Earth - plus, all the carbon that's currently up in the atmosphere combined and then twice over. Hence, a very small change in the amount of carbon stored in soil can make a big difference in maintenance of the Earth's atmosphere. But soil's not just simply a storage box for carbon, though. It operates more like a bank account. And the amount of carbon that's in soil at any given time is the function of the amount of carbon coming in and out of the soil. Carbon comes into the soil through the process of photosynthesis when green plants take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and upon death, their bodies enter the soil. And carbon leaves the soil and goes right back up into the atmosphere when the bodies of those formerly living organisms decay in soil by activity of microbes. One of the things that makes soil such a fundamental component of any climate change mitigation strategy is because it represents a long-term storage of carbon. Carbon that would have lasted maybe a year or two if it was left on the surface can stay in soil for hundreds of years, even thousands and more. ZOMORODI: So soil has this amazing capacity to store carbon. But we humans have been messing with the soil, and in your talk, you say that half of the world's soils are considered degraded. Is that one of the reasons why we have a warming planet, because we've damaged the soil so it can't take in as much carbon as it used to and as much as we need it to? BERHE: Yeah. So human actions - in particular, the way we've changed land use and land cover globally, including through deforestation and intensive cultivation practices - they typically contribute about 15% of the CO2 that we keep releasing into the atmosphere every year. So. . . ZOMORODI: Wow. BERHE: . . . It's a big portion of the CO2 we keep releasing into the atmosphere. Carbon that would have stayed in the soil system is not staying, is rather going back into the atmosphere as greenhouse gases because we keep cutting down the trees, we keep over-tilling the soil and disturbing the soil to a point where its ability to hold on to that carbon is diminishing. And since the, you know, human community started engaging in agriculture in a large-scale manner, we've released on the order of about 120 billion metric tons of carbon that was in soil into the atmosphere. ZOMORODI: Oh, wow. BERHE: Yeah. So and this - the fastest rate of loss has been happening in the last 200 years since the Industrial Revolution. So remember that the most important ways we use soil as human community is for supporting plant productivities, but we also build the infrastructure, right? It's where we build our roads and bridges and everything, and those are the part of the processes that are responsible for the large-scale degradation of soil globally. Close to half of the soils in the world right now are considered degraded, meaning their ability to support plant production and to support life is compromised. ZOMORODI: So that means, like, all the rainforests that have been cut down and all the millions of heads of cattle that are grazing on plains - all of that means that the soil underneath is not as rich as it once was. BERHE: Yeah. And all of these intensive deforestation and grazing practices, in particular over-grazing beyond the capacity that the land can support - all of that compromises the physical stability of soil, the chemical nature of soil, including provision of the nutrients that are needed to support the microbial communities. So this is why it becomes really important to think about managing soils in a climate-smart way. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BERHE: Fortunately, I can also tell you that there is a solution for these two wicked problems of soil degradation and climate change, and the solution lies in simultaneously working to address these two things together through what we call climate-smart land management practices. And we can accomplish this by putting in place deep-rooted perennial plants, putting back forests whenever possible, reducing tillage and other disturbance from agricultural practices, including optimizing the use of agricultural chemicals and grazing, and even adding carbon to soil whenever possible from recycled resources such as compost and even human waste. This kind of land stewardship is not a radical idea. It's what made it possible for fertile soils to be able to support human civilization since time immemorial. In fact, some are doing it just right now. There's a global effort underway to accomplish exactly this goal. This effort that started in France is known as the 4 per mille effort, and it sets an aspirational goal to increase the amount of carbon stored in soil by 0. 4% annually, using the same kind of climate-smart land management practices I mentioned earlier. And if this effort's fully successful, it can offset a third of the global emissions of fossil-fuel-derived carbon to the atmosphere. But even if this effort's not fully successful but we just start heading in that direction, we still end up with soils that are healthier, more fertile, are able to produce all the food and resources that we need for human populations and more, and also soils that are better capable of sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and helping with climate change mitigation. I'm pretty sure that's what politicians call a win-win solution. ZOMORODI: Wow. OK, so if we could reduce our CO2 buildup by a third just by focusing on soil, Asmeret, why aren't we talking about that in the same breath as how we're going to save our oceans or making sure that the polar ice caps don't melt away? BERHE: I think in some ways it's because we had grown so accustomed to take soil for granted. And part of this is because the group of people that are affected and the group of people who have been addressing it have been two distinct groups, right? And I personally feel it's important to highlight the human element of this discussion because, in many ways, a lot of the impacts of climate change are going to be felt by, economically speaking, the least fortunate amongst us - the folks who live in poor nations, you know, small island nations near the equator in coastal margins. But their voices and especially until recently had not been part of our climate conversation. And the fact that climate change has become a threat multiplier - i. e. it's actually exacerbating the problem of food and nutritional insecurity, water insecurity in many parts of the world - had not gotten enough attention in our discourse. ZOMORODI: So you're saying that, you know, if there was more diversity in the people who are calling attention to all these climate change problems we have and the potential solutions that more people might understand the role that soil plays, which would in turn help us all. BERHE: Exactly. Yeah. In many cases, it's like whenever we have more diversity in science, we end up addressing societally relevant questions, right? ZOMORODI: Yes, that is correct. (LAUGHTER)ZOMORODI: You know, I'm sitting here, and I'm thinking about how rarely I actually touch soil. I live in a city. I go to the park all the time. But when was the last time I actually felt the dirt? Not recently. BERHE: Yeah. Yeah, I think that's true, right? Human communities evolve in agricultural societies, where they were intimately aware of the land around them, its properties, and they knew what it could support and what it couldn't. And they work the land, literally speaking, to support their livelihood. Many of us in modern times don't have that connection, and in many ways, we've lost the connection to a point where soil is just the stuff beneath the asphalt or the concrete that we step on every day, right? It's not even the thing we experience, unless we're out hiking in the trail somewhere or in a park. And so that connection is lost. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BERHE: We all can have a role to play here. We can start by treating the soil with the respect that it deserves - respect for its ability as the basis of all life on Earth, respect for its ability to serve as a carbon bank and respect for its ability to control our climate. And if we do so, we can then simultaneously address two of the most pressing global challenges of our time - climate change and soil degradation. And in the process, we would be able to provide food and nutritional security to our growing human family. Thank you.

FADEL: The meetings came a week after Russian forces stormed Europe's largest nuclear power plant. And a new analysis from NPR shows that the battle was far more dangerous than previously reported. Joining me to discuss is NPR science and security correspondent Geoff Brumfiel. Hi, Geoff. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila. FADEL: So tell us about this analysis. What did you find? BRUMFIEL: Right. So the plant is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. And remarkably, the entire attack by Russian forces, pretty much, was livestreamed on its YouTube channel. FADEL: Wow. BRUMFIEL: Someone put up over four hours of grainy security footage. So together with NPR's Meredith Rizzo, Alison Hurt and Tien Le and a researcher at the Centre for Information Resilience, a guy named Leone Hadavi, we pulled it apart to really try and find out the story of what happened that night. And what we discovered was not good. This firefight caused damage throughout the plant and put critical systems at risk. Basically, it was a lot worse than we thought. FADEL: OK, explain that because I have to say when I heard attack on a nuclear power plant, that already sounded really bad, incredibly dangerous. BRUMFIEL: Yeah. I mean, good point. You know, and the thing was that immediately after the attack, a lot of the focus was on this building next to the nuclear plant. It was a training center. And I think that kind of gave people the impression that the plant itself didn't take fire or didn't take much fire. But we identified at least six other locations that appeared to take damage. And these were all across the site, including near the reactors and other sensitive equipment. Some of the stuff - if it had been hit harder, it could have triggered a nuclear emergency or maybe even a meltdown. FADEL: OK, that sounds terrifying. Give me an example of what other equipment you're referring to there. BRUMFIEL: Sure. So a short video from the plant turned up on the social media platform Telegram the day after the attack. And it shows what could be a Russian shell on the ground in sort of this enclosed walkway site. Now, this walkway was about 250 feet, maybe a little less from the Unit 2 reactor. And on the other side is the facility that handles radioactive waste for the plant. Tom Bielefeld is a nuclear security expert. He told me that if that building had been struck, it could have potentially contaminated the entire facility. TOM BIELEFED: The situation that we saw here could have gone wrong, much more wrong than it did. BRUMFIEL: And these parts of the plant are the real problem. The reactors themselves are sealed away in these big, heavy metal containers that take a lot to damage them. But there are power lines, transformers, cooling systems, backup generators. I mean, the list goes on and on. They're critical to safety. They're vulnerable. Some of them did get hit that night. Fortunately, there was enough redundancy that it didn't matter. There was no meltdown, at least not this time. FADEL: Not this time. So, Geoff, where does this go from here? BRUMFIEL: Well, I think the point of doing this was to show this is a really dangerous situation, still. I mean, as you mentioned up there at the top, neither side is willing to back down. Ukraine relies on nuclear for half of its electricity, and it's planning to defend its remaining plants. And Russia, meanwhile, is continuing its advance. Its forces are now quite near another nuclear plant, the South Ukraine Nuclear Plant. And so unless these two sides can reach some sort of agreement, we may have a repeat of what happened at Zaporizhzhia. And this time, we might not be so lucky.

You know, and the thing was that immediately after the attack, a lot of the focus was on this building next to the nuclear plant. It was a training center. And I think that kind of gave people the impression that the plant itself didn't take fire or didn't take much fire. But we identified at least six other locations that appeared to take damage. And these were all across the site, including near the reactors and other sensitive equipment. Some of the stuff - if it had been hit harder, it could have triggered a nuclear emergency or maybe even a meltdown. FADEL: OK, that sounds terrifying. Give me an example of what other equipment you're referring to there. BRUMFIEL: Sure. So a short video from the plant turned up on the social media platform Telegram the day after the attack. And it shows what could be a Russian shell on the ground in sort of this enclosed walkway site. Now, this walkway was about 250 feet, maybe a little less from the Unit 2 reactor. And on the other side is the facility that handles radioactive waste for the plant. Tom Bielefeld is a nuclear security expert. He told me that if that building had been struck, it could have potentially contaminated the entire facility. TOM BIELEFED: The situation that we saw here could have gone wrong, much more wrong than it did. BRUMFIEL: And these parts of the plant are the real problem. The reactors themselves are sealed away in these big, heavy metal containers that take a lot to damage them. But there are power lines, transformers, cooling systems, backup generators. I mean, the list goes on and on. They're critical to safety. They're vulnerable. Some of them did get hit that night. Fortunately, there was enough redundancy that it didn't matter. There was no meltdown, at least not this time. FADEL: Not this time. So, Geoff, where does this go from here? BRUMFIEL: Well, I think the point of doing this was to show this is a really dangerous situation, still. I mean, as you mentioned up there at the top, neither side is willing to back down. Ukraine relies on nuclear for half of its electricity, and it's planning to defend its remaining plants. And Russia, meanwhile, is continuing its advance. Its forces are now quite near another nuclear plant, the South Ukraine Nuclear Plant. And so unless these two sides can reach some sort of agreement, we may have a repeat of what happened at Zaporizhzhia. And this time, we might not be so lucky.

S. was averaging more than half a million COVID cases a day, it was hard to be optimistic, but Dr. Bob Wachter was. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)BOB WACHTER: I think the likeliest outcome for February and March is that we'll be in pretty good shape. This virus being milder than the prior variants could turn out to be very good news. KELLY: That is what Wachter, who chairs the Department of Medicine at UC San Francisco, what he told me at the start of January. Well, we played that back for him. . . WACHTER: (Laughter). KELLY: . . . Eight weeks later. WACHTER: Usually, when people play a clip, it's usually something you got wrong. So that was kind of nice. KELLY: Wachter's prediction, based on how omicron had moved through South Africa, was right. Now in the U. S. on the cusp of spring, new cases and rates of hospital admissions have plunged to lows not seen since last summer. At Wachter's own hospital in San Francisco. . . WACHTER: Four to six weeks ago, we had about 125 COVID patients in the hospital. Today, we have about 20. KELLY: So what happened? Well, omicron moved really fast. Thousands of people did die each day in January and February, but that rate has fallen dramatically, and many people remain protected, Wachter says, by vaccination, prior infection or both. WACHTER: And obviously, the mother of all curveballs is the possibility of a variant that's better at its job than omicron. But I think the next several months are going to be fine - lower case loads, relatively little stress on our health care system, nowhere near what we were seeing a couple of months ago. KELLY: CONSIDER THIS - in the U. S. , this third pandemic spring will be different. We'll explain new thinking about risk from the CDC, a new emphasis on flexibility as more workers return to the office and new concerns about an outbreak in China. From NPR, I'm Mary Louise Kelly. It is Tuesday, March 15. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. The headlines out of China this week are a reminder that the pandemic is not over. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Breaking overnight - a sell-off in Hong Kong as major Chinese cities lock down to combat a COVID outbreak. We'll take you live to Beijing. KELLY: That is how the week started, with four Chinese cities imposing lockdown measures, including Shenzhen. That is a major tech and finance hub and home to 17 million people. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: The city has shut down public transit and has ordered all nonessential businesses to suspend production or have employees work from home for a week. KELLY: That followed a raging outbreak in nearby Hong Kong, which now has some of the highest daily mortality rates in the world. So what's driving these outbreaks? Well, a few things. Both Mainland China and Hong Kong have been following a zero-COVID strategy, trying to avoid new cases completely. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: On Saturday, party officials reaffirmed their commitment to China's zero-COVID policy. KELLY: But that has left a lot of people with no immunity from prior infection. China also has an elderly population who are not well vaccinated, and the country has its own vaccine, one seen as less effective than ones developed in the U. S. and Europe. For policy experts, all this is a reminder of the need, even as things improve in the U. S. , to keep up global public health efforts, investing in surveillance, buying medicines and vaccines, both to help with outbreaks elsewhere and to be prepared for future variants. ZEKE EMANUEL: And we have to remember that delta and omicron that we've just suffered from, they came from overseas. KELLY: Zeke Emanuel at the University of Pennsylvania spoke to NPR this week. EMANUEL: We have an urgent need from our own self-interested standpoint to continue our work to fight COVID overseas. KELLY: But soon the government won't be able to do that as well the Biden administration warned Tuesday. That is because Congress has failed to authorize billions of dollars in new COVID spending. Without that money, the White House also warned it'll have to wind down a testing and treatment program for uninsured people starting next week. But Republicans in the Senate say they won't authorize more funding until they see records of how prior COVID funding has been spent. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: The situation in the U. S. is, of course, very different from China. Here, cities, states and schools have been rolling back mask mandates. By some estimates, as many as 80% of Americans have had prior infection, which could offer them some protection from serious illness in the future. And after two years, more Americans are headed back to work. As NPR's Tovia Smith reports, companies and their employees are figuring it out as they go. TOVIA SMITH, BYLINE: Driving into downtown Boston, it's almost like the old days, with no open parking spaces on the streets anymore and even challenges finding a parking garage. SAMRAWIT EMBAYE: Yeah, it's full right now. SMITH: It's actually full. EMBAYE: Yeah, really. KELLY: Seeing life return to the heart of Boston's financial district is a thrill for garage attendant Samrawit Embaye. EMBAYE: If you see people come in, you feel like you are living real life (laughter) and make you happy. MAUREEN MCLALLEN: Hi, Denise (ph), how are you? DENISE: Good, thanks. How are you? MCLALLEN: Good. SMITH: It's legal secretary Maureen McLallen's second day back to work in one of Boston's tallest skyscrapers. After two years working from home, returning to the office is like a homecoming. MCLALLEN: Everybody was hugging each other. Oh, it's just such a blessing to be back. I missed everybody. SMITH: It's good for the firm, too, McLallen says, because she'll be a lot more productive working in person with the attorney she supports. MCLALLEN: It's hard doing email, but if I can actually go into his office and I'll stand there and go OK, I'll tap my foot, I need the answers, he has to answer me. SMITH: For McLallen, the upsides far outweigh even her hour-long commute and having to get up three hours earlier to shower and dress. MCLALLEN: I have to get used to wearing heels again. I'm in my flats right now. PRAGADISH KALAIVANAN: Definitely, it's been an ordeal. SMITH: Twenty-seven-year-old marketing analyst Pragadish Kalaivanan doesn't think it's worth it to come back to the office, where he's often less productive. KALAIVANAN: Like this morning, I think we spent about half an hour discussing coffee alternatives like these mushroom blends and, like, these cacao alternatives (laughter). SMITH: Working from home, he says, allows him better focus and flexibility. KALAIVANAN: Sometimes I don't feel like working, maybe, in the afternoons, and I used to take a quick nap at home. And I would work, like, after dinner, when I want to do it, when I'm most creative because it's part of my job. SMITH: Kalaivanan's firm is one of a growing number adopting a hybrid model. Companies from American Express to Meta and Citigroup, who are calling more workers back on-site this month, are also allowing some remote days. They're all too aware that requiring workers to come in every day may actually end up pushing them out the door. Attorney Brian Palmucci, in Boston for a court appearance, is among those happy to just meet people on Zoom instead of in-person. BRIAN PALMUCCI: I'm kind of an introvert, so, you know, less human interaction sometimes can be a good thing. SMITH: Plus, he says, COVID is still a concern. PALMUCCI: I have two young kids, and I think the long-term health ramifications of COVID are unknown. And so it's a risk I'm not willing to take. SMITH: But Andy Waugh, managing director at a large insurance broker, says coming back at least part-time is critical, especially for young and new workers. It's important, he says, for training, for employee advancement and for company culture. ANDY WAUGH: How we operate, what our ethos is, how to do their jobs, how to treat clients - they've got to learn all that, and they won't see it from their kitchen. SMITH: For now, Waugh says, coming in is still optional. Just about a third showed up for Day 1 and far less for Day 2. But even that is a boon for the restaurants and cafes in town, which have been struggling. At one nearby place, assistant manager Cesar Jordan says business spiked 30% in a week. CESAR JORDAN: We are happy for that because we're hiring a lot of people back. Like, we can give them opportunities. SMITH: And those employees, Jordan says, are more than happy to commute into the city for work. MARY LOUISE KELLEY, HOST:  NPR's Tovia Smith. Now, as more people shift back to office work, the CDC is shifting the way it talks about COVID risk. Specifically, the agency has changed the way it measures COVID levels in a given area, signaling a change in how the U. S. plans to navigate the pandemic. As NPR's Will Stone reports, there are questions about how helpful the change will be. WILL STONE, BYLINE: It was like the CDC was painting its COVID map with an entirely new palette. Gone were the huge patches of bright red, indicating high levels across much of the U. S. Instead, there was an inviting mix of green and yellow - a sign of low or medium COVID levels. Madison County, Iowa, underwent this transformation from red to green that left Cindy Watson totally confused. She's 61 and a professor of math and science. CINDY WATSON: And if I'm confused, holy cow, everybody else has got to be really confused. STONE: The change in color came with a change in guidance. Americans in low and medium counties could now shed their masks. WATSON: And all of a sudden the CDC said, hey, you can unmask. OK, based on what? STONE: Cindy Watson is right to be confused, says Jessica Malaty Rivera, who's an epidemiologist at the Pandemic Prevention Institute. JESSICA MALATY RIVERA: That is a perfect example of a situation that is not actually low risk. STONE: This is what happened - the CDC adjusted how it calculates the level of COVID in different communities. Before, counties were ranked by the number of infections. Now it's mostly tied to hospital admissions and how many beds are filled with COVID-19 patients. Cases do get factored in, but the CDC has raised the threshold substantially. A county can be green if it has under 200 cases per 100,000 people in the past week, which is a lot higher than it was before. Here's Rivera again. MALATY RIVERA: It's honestly shocking. What it looks like is quite literally a changing of thresholds in order to justify a policy that I think assumes way too much risk. STONE: But the CDC says there's good reason to shift the focus to severe disease and keeping hospitals from being overwhelmed. After all, cases don't mean what they did two years ago. Vaccines and immunity from prior infections are keeping many people who catch the virus out of the hospital. And there's another goal to make things simple and clear for Americans. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GRETA MASSETTI: Knowing the COVID-19 community level in your area. . . STONE: That's a CDC scientists pitching the new map in a recent informational video, but some experts say this is not the best way for an individual to gauge their risk of catching the virus. JEFF DUCHIN: CDC is putting a lot of weight on preventing hospitalizations, and that's really important. STONE: Dr. Jeff Duchin, the health officer for Seattle and King County. DUCHIN: However, different individuals may put more weight than CDC did on simply preventing infection. STONE: This is why Duchin thinks the CDC guidance is better suited for public health agencies like his, not the average person who's just trying to figure out, how worried should I be going to the grocery store or the gym? For that, cases do matter a lot, and hospital numbers aren't a real-time reflection of disease. They tend to trail infections by about a week. Josh Salomon is an infectious disease modeler at Stanford. He says it could take a while for a county to move into the high-red category. JOSH SALOMON: What I worry about is that this switch is going to be too late to prevent a lot of illness and death. STONE: Because it's only in the red that the CDC tells people to take meaningful action, like wearing a face mask. Up to that point, people who are at high risk, like the immunocompromised, have to decide for themselves whether to take extra precautions. SALOMON: It really does continue to shift the emphasis of protection as being an individual-level response as opposed to a collective responsibility. STONE: But Dr. Jay Varma at the Weill Cornell Center for Pandemic Prevention and Response says this kind of transition happens all the time in public health. JAY VARMA: I am OK with the decision to shift from a primarily collective responsibility to an individual one, as long as government continues to do its part. STONE: Meaning people who do want to be cautious need resources, like tests, high-quality masks and clear messaging. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLEY: NPR's Will Stone. And for more on that changing CDC guidance, including a look at how the agency's old maps look next to the new ones, there's a link in our episode notes. You can also find a story there from NPR's Allison Aubrey about the fight in Congress over new COVID spending. It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. I'm Mary Louise Kelly.

Idaho Governor Brad Little signed the bill into law today. NPR's Sarah McCammon has been following this. She joins us now. Hey, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hey, Juana. SUMMERS: So we've heard a lot about what has been happening in Texas since last September, when that state banned most abortions. Tell us, what does this new Idaho law do? MCCAMMON: Well, like the one in Texas, it bans most abortions around six weeks, before many people realize they're pregnant. And like Texas, this Idaho law also relies on ordinary citizens to enforce it by filing lawsuits against abortion providers. I talked to Mistie DelliCarpini-Tolman, the Idaho state director for Planned Parenthood, about what this would mean there. MISTIE DELLICARPINI-TOLMAN: Unfortunately, we don't even have to guess about what this will look like because we've kind of been watching what's been happening in Texas. So we already know what this looks like. MCCAMMON: And, Juana, what it looks like is many patients traveling out of state for abortions if they have the means to do so and facing some really difficult decisions if they don't. SUMMERS: Now, the Idaho law is modeled after the law in Texas, but they are not exactly the same, are they? MCCAMMON: Right. Idaho's law narrows the scope of who can sue. Those people include the patient, certain members of the patient's family, including parents and siblings, also the person who impregnated the patient and some of his family members. So it's not just anyone, you know, like the Texas law. But Shaakirrah Sanders, a law professor at the University of Idaho, says, in practice, this is a distinction without a difference. SHAAKIRRAH SANDERS: If there are 10 siblings and parents, all of those people can sue you. And so you can see how one lawsuit could pretty much wipe out an entire clinic. MCCAMMON: Penalties for doctors who violate this law are twice as high as those in Texas, starting at $20,000 as well. SUMMERS: Wow. OK. As you mentioned, this law does allow certain family members to file lawsuits against abortion providers, and there's been a lot of concern about what that could mean, particularly in situations involving sexual assault. Sarah, what can you tell us there? MCCAMMON: Yeah. This came up during the legislative debate in the Idaho House last week. I want to play an exchange. Here's Representative Ned Burns, a Democrat, questioning one of the bill's co-sponsors. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NED BURNS: I understand that someone who has committed a rape would not be able to sue if an abortion were to take place. Would a family member of said rapist be able to sue? Would they have standing? STEVE HARRIS: If it is the parents, siblings, aunts and uncles, grandparents, then yes. MCCAMMON: Now, that second voice was Republican Representative Steve Harris, a co-sponsor of the bill. It also says that a rapist cannot sue an abortion provider under this law for terminating a pregnancy. But as we heard, it doesn't preclude that person's family members from doing so. And the Idaho law does contain an exception allowing abortions in cases of rape or incest, unlike the one in Texas, but that's limited. It's only if the victim reports the attack to law enforcement, which many victims don't. And in a statement today, Governor Brad Little expressed concerns about that and asked the legislature to address any unintended consequences. But he did sign the bill into law, nonetheless. SUMMERS: Sarah, what else are you hearing from people who support this legislation? MCCAMMON: Well, I spoke to Carol Tobias with National Right to Life, which has been promoting this kind of legislation around the country. And simply put, she wants pregnant people to continue these pregnancies regardless of the circumstances, and that includes rape. CAROL TOBIAS: I think we need to do everything possible to save lives. And we would encourage anybody to take steps necessary to protect that life. SUMMERS: Sarah, in the couple of seconds we have left here, what's next? Any chance this law could be blocked in court? MCCAMMON: Well, it's set to take effect in about 30 days. Reproductive rights groups are weighing all of their options. But as we saw in Texas, court challenges to this type of legislation can be really difficult because of the unusual way the law is written. Meanwhile, several other states are considering similar proposals. SUMMERS: That is NPR's Sarah McCammon. Thank you, Sarah. MCCAMMON: Thank you.

But at the same time, a new COVID variant has been spreading across the country. BA. 2 is a subvariant of omicron, the variant behind the biggest spike yet of the pandemic just a couple of months ago. So how should we be thinking about COVID as we enter yet another new phase in the pandemic? To help us answer that, we called Bill Hanage. He's an epidemiologist and a professor at Harvard's T. H. Chan School of Public Health. Dr. Hanage, welcome. BILL HANAGE: Thanks for having me on the show. KURTZLEBEN: Of course. So first of all, let's start with some basics. Tell us more about this BA. 2 variant. How does it differ from the original omicron variant? And is it more contagious? Does it cause more severe illness? HANAGE: Well, the first thing to remember is that BA. 2 is a different subvariant of BA. 1, which is the original omicron. They're both omicron. It's just they're different flavors of it. But BA. 2 is actually quite divergent from the virus that was causing a lot of disease here a couple months ago. It's very different indeed. We don't really understand where these two came from. My own bet is on a long-term infection in an immunocompromised host. But because BA. 2 is really quite different, we have to be watching it very closely because we are still learning about its epidemiological properties. And among those properties, it does appear to be more transmissible, even more transmissible than the omicron that we've seen to date. KURTZLEBEN: I want to bring this down to the individual level because there are a lot of people listening who have had their two vaccination shots plus a booster, but they got that last shot, at this point, several months ago. So should those people be more worried as we have this new variant moving among us and as there's the potential for booster effectiveness to wane? HANAGE: The booster effectiveness certainly does seem to wane against infection. It seems to be pretty well preserved against severe illness. Now, I want to put a small caveat on that, which is that because things are changing very, very quickly, we might be waiting a couple of weeks to actually get really secure data on this. But right now, it doesn't look like BA. 2 is much more serious in terms of the disease it causes. than BA. 1 But the best thing that you can do as an individual, and in particular if you're over 65 years of age, is to make sure that you're fully up to date with your shots, that you've been boosted. That's the very best thing that you can do in the face of a virus like this. KURTZLEBEN: One more thing I want to ask about boosters - what do you think about the reports that the Biden administration might be considering approving additional boosters for people over 50 or just for the population in general? HANAGE: I think that a fourth booster is probably on the cards and probably on the cards for people who are - who really need it, who are going to be the older folks. Even beyond BA. 2, we can expect that there's going to be more virus in the fall and the winter. And because those people might have immunity that has waned a little bit, we might want to give it a bit of a fill-up in order to help it get through another difficult period of the virus. For people as a whole, in general, I think that three shots is probably about as much protection as you're likely to get. But as I say, check back with me in a few months. KURTZLEBEN: And sort of along those same lines, people who are more vulnerable or immunocompromised people, does BA. 2 make you think that perhaps we should be taking more precautions on their behalf? HANAGE: I think that that's certainly true, that we should not forget that there are a lot of people in the United States who have conditions that predispose them to more serious infection if they become infected. And if you see a very large surge coming into your community, then certainly you should think about your neighbors because even though you might be cool with being infected, they might not be. And so this is something which - you know, you're looking out for your community. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings me perfectly to one other thing I wanted to ask you because, you know, many states, businesses, workplaces across the country are relaxing their mask mandates, relaxing restrictions that have been in effect for quite a while. I'm wondering, what is your advice to people listening? How - should they keep wearing their masks? What kind of precautions should they be taking? HANAGE: I think it depends on the situation that you are in and depends on how much virus there is in the community at the time. You know, if there is very little infection, then wearing a mask in a lot of circumstances may not be particularly helpful unless, that is, of course, you're in a particular group who's very concerned about infection. And you can have one-way masking. KF-94s and N95s are very good, and people may want to use them because they don't want to get infected. And there's a lot of reason people might not want to get infected. They might not want to be having - missing their vacation which is coming up, just for example. So it's roughly the same message as it has always been. Look at what's going on outside your front door. How much viruses are in the community? What are the consequences of you or somebody you're in contact with getting sick? Are they in a vulnerable group? Is it something they can do to wear a mask, which is a really easy thing to do? Seriously, are you really going to the grocery store to feel the fresh air on your face, or are you going onto public transport to feel the fresh air on your face? I understand that these are things that people can feel - you know, people have different attitudes to. But then what you can do is make the contacts that you do make the special ones, the important ones, the things that really matter to you. And those things, we can get much, much of that back, even in the face of a virus like this. KURTZLEBEN: To wrap this all together, a final, really big question - what do you think comes next in this pandemic? HANAGE: Right now, BA. 2 is becoming the majority of the virus population in the U. S. What that means is that we're going to see a bump in infections. How large that bump is going to be, well, that depends on how much people are trying to stop it. It depends on how many people have some immunity already because they were infected with BA. 1. It also depends on - in terms of its consequences, on how many people are vaccinated and boosted. The United States is not very well vaccinated and boosted. The U. K. rode out its early omicron wave really quite well. We cannot say the same for the U. S. Between two and three times as many people, corrected for population, lost their lives. You really should be boosted. KURTZLEBEN: That was Bill Hanage, associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard's T. H. Chan School of Public Health. Dr. Hanage, thank you so much for speaking with us today. HANAGE: Thanks for having me.

Chan School of Public Health. Dr. Hanage, welcome. BILL HANAGE: Thanks for having me on the show. KURTZLEBEN: Of course. So first of all, let's start with some basics. Tell us more about this BA. 2 variant. How does it differ from the original omicron variant? And is it more contagious? Does it cause more severe illness? HANAGE: Well, the first thing to remember is that BA. 2 is a different subvariant of BA. 1, which is the original omicron. They're both omicron. It's just they're different flavors of it. But BA. 2 is actually quite divergent from the virus that was causing a lot of disease here a couple months ago. It's very different indeed. We don't really understand where these two came from. My own bet is on a long-term infection in an immunocompromised host. But because BA. 2 is really quite different, we have to be watching it very closely because we are still learning about its epidemiological properties. And among those properties, it does appear to be more transmissible, even more transmissible than the omicron that we've seen to date. KURTZLEBEN: I want to bring this down to the individual level because there are a lot of people listening who have had their two vaccination shots plus a booster, but they got that last shot, at this point, several months ago. So should those people be more worried as we have this new variant moving among us and as there's the potential for booster effectiveness to wane? HANAGE: The booster effectiveness certainly does seem to wane against infection. It seems to be pretty well preserved against severe illness. Now, I want to put a small caveat on that, which is that because things are changing very, very quickly, we might be waiting a couple of weeks to actually get really secure data on this. But right now, it doesn't look like BA. 2 is much more serious in terms of the disease it causes. than BA. 1 But the best thing that you can do as an individual, and in particular if you're over 65 years of age, is to make sure that you're fully up to date with your shots, that you've been boosted. That's the very best thing that you can do in the face of a virus like this. KURTZLEBEN: One more thing I want to ask about boosters - what do you think about the reports that the Biden administration might be considering approving additional boosters for people over 50 or just for the population in general? HANAGE: I think that a fourth booster is probably on the cards and probably on the cards for people who are - who really need it, who are going to be the older folks. Even beyond BA. 2, we can expect that there's going to be more virus in the fall and the winter. And because those people might have immunity that has waned a little bit, we might want to give it a bit of a fill-up in order to help it get through another difficult period of the virus. For people as a whole, in general, I think that three shots is probably about as much protection as you're likely to get. But as I say, check back with me in a few months. KURTZLEBEN: And sort of along those same lines, people who are more vulnerable or immunocompromised people, does BA. 2 make you think that perhaps we should be taking more precautions on their behalf? HANAGE: I think that that's certainly true, that we should not forget that there are a lot of people in the United States who have conditions that predispose them to more serious infection if they become infected. And if you see a very large surge coming into your community, then certainly you should think about your neighbors because even though you might be cool with being infected, they might not be. And so this is something which - you know, you're looking out for your community. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings me perfectly to one other thing I wanted to ask you because, you know, many states, businesses, workplaces across the country are relaxing their mask mandates, relaxing restrictions that have been in effect for quite a while. I'm wondering, what is your advice to people listening? How - should they keep wearing their masks? What kind of precautions should they be taking? HANAGE: I think it depends on the situation that you are in and depends on how much virus there is in the community at the time. You know, if there is very little infection, then wearing a mask in a lot of circumstances may not be particularly helpful unless, that is, of course, you're in a particular group who's very concerned about infection. And you can have one-way masking. KF-94s and N95s are very good, and people may want to use them because they don't want to get infected. And there's a lot of reason people might not want to get infected. They might not want to be having - missing their vacation which is coming up, just for example. So it's roughly the same message as it has always been. Look at what's going on outside your front door. How much viruses are in the community? What are the consequences of you or somebody you're in contact with getting sick? Are they in a vulnerable group? Is it something they can do to wear a mask, which is a really easy thing to do? Seriously, are you really going to the grocery store to feel the fresh air on your face, or are you going onto public transport to feel the fresh air on your face? I understand that these are things that people can feel - you know, people have different attitudes to. But then what you can do is make the contacts that you do make the special ones, the important ones, the things that really matter to you. And those things, we can get much, much of that back, even in the face of a virus like this. KURTZLEBEN: To wrap this all together, a final, really big question - what do you think comes next in this pandemic? HANAGE: Right now, BA. 2 is becoming the majority of the virus population in the U. S. What that means is that we're going to see a bump in infections. How large that bump is going to be, well, that depends on how much people are trying to stop it. It depends on how many people have some immunity already because they were infected with BA. 1. It also depends on - in terms of its consequences, on how many people are vaccinated and boosted. The United States is not very well vaccinated and boosted. The U. K. rode out its early omicron wave really quite well. We cannot say the same for the U. S. Between two and three times as many people, corrected for population, lost their lives. You really should be boosted. KURTZLEBEN: That was Bill Hanage, associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard's T. H. Chan School of Public Health.

BILL HANAGE: Right now, BA. 2 is becoming the majority of the virus population in the U. S. What that means is that we're going to see a bump in infections. CHANG: Bill Hanage is an epidemiologist and a professor at Harvard. BA. 2 is why case rates are inching back up in places like LA. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: That COVID subvariant spreading through LA County. . . CHANG: And Chicago. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Over 20% of the cases in Midwestern states. . . CHANG: And Boston. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: BA. 2 is now causing more than half of new cases in the Northeast, including here in Massachusetts. CHANG: The expectation from public health officials is, just like in many European countries, BA. 2 will soon become the dominant variant here. HANAGE: But right now, it doesn't look like BA. 2 is much more serious in terms of the disease it causes. CHANG: Of course, protection from that disease depends on prior infection, vaccination or both. The thing is protection - it wanes over time. So on Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration authorized use of a second booster dose of Pfizer and Moderna for any American over the age of 50 or for certain people who are immunocompromised. That fourth dose - it can be given four months after an initial booster. JEFF ZIENTS: However, if the science shows that fourth doses are needed for the general population later this year, we will not have the supply necessary to ensure shots are available, free and easy to access for all Americans. CHANG: That's Jeff Zients of the White House COVID task force. He issued a warning this past week. ZIENTS: We should be securing additional supply right now. Many other countries are already doing so. CHANG: CONSIDER THIS - a new coronavirus variant is on the rise and so is global demand for more vaccines. But in the U. S. , Congress hasn't agreed to pay for them yet. From NPR, I'm Ailsa Chang. It's Tuesday, March 29. It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. BA. 2 has been in the U. S. since around mid-December. And it's not a big concern right now, but CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told NPR this month that public health officials do expect cases to rise just as they have in other countries overseas where BA. 2 has already taken hold. ROCHELLE WALENSKY: With some waning immunity and with a decrease in prevention strategies and mitigation - more opening up - they are starting to see a slight increase in cases. And we are carefully watching for that as well. CHANG: Watching is one thing. Acting is another. And lately, the Biden administration has warned it can't act as aggressively against BA. 2 and future variants without more funding from Congress. WALENSKY: We use those resources to monitor for variants, not just here but across the globe, looking at how well our vaccines work over time in these long-term studies and really the impact of long COVID, studies that we anticipate we will need to follow in - for not just months but years. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: To do all that - to stockpile vaccines and medicines, to keep certain treatment plans going, the White House told Congress it needed $22. 5 billion. But as of Tuesday, lawmakers were still trying to agree on a plan to authorize that spending, even as nearly 700 people a day continue to die from COVID-19 in the U. S. And as NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin reports, some hospital officials across the country are getting worried. SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: How does all of this look from where Dr. David Zaas sits in Charleston, S. C. ? DAVID ZAAS: It's been a really difficult two years for hospitals, and I think this is one additional threat. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Zaas is the chief clinical officer of the Medical University of South Carolina, a network of 14 safety net hospitals around the state. That means they treat a lot of low-income and uninsured patients. He says even in nonpandemic times, running a safety net hospital is a tight-margin business. Add to that. . . ZAAS: The decrease in surgeries as well as the increasing costs from supply chain and labor that have really challenged hospitals and the unpredictability - right? - of the different COVID waves. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: One federal resource he says has been essential is the Provider Relief Fund. Until last week, it reimbursed hospitals and other health centers for testing and treatment of uninsured patients with COVID-19. ZAAS: We've had now $9. 8 million for uninsured COVID patients that is now going away. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: He says they'll still provide the care. They're just not sure how they're going to pay for it. Even if you're not too concerned about hospital budgets or uninsured patients, you might want to think about the ripple effects. If someone who's uninsured is afraid to get tested for COVID-19 because of the risk of getting billed for it, they might just not get tested even if they're sick. They might also keep going to work, maybe serving your food or driving your Uber. Zinzi Bailey, an epidemiologist at the University of Miami Medical School, says all of those hidden cases can drive more spread. ZINZI BAILEY: Bigger surges, different variants. And, you know, we do not have this thing under control. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Still, the funding remains stalled in Congress. Republicans have argued they want a more detailed accounting of where past pandemic spending has gone. The White House retorts that it's provided 385 pages worth of details to lawmakers. They point to lots of other critical pandemic fighting tools that are in danger without more funding. For instance, the federal government wouldn't be able to buy more treatments or have enough free boosters for everyone. And it would be harder to track new variants or do research on next-generation vaccines. Health officials warn the fund for the uninsured shutting down is just the beginning. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: That is NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. Speaking of tracking new forms of the coronavirus, BA. 2 is not the only one out there that scientists are keeping an eye on. There's another one - a mixture of the omicron and delta strains that some people are calling deltacron. It's really rare, we're told, and in its current state, it seems unlikely to cause a problem. But its creation gives scientists insight into how and why the COVID-19 virus changes so quickly. Here's NPR's Michaeleen Doucleff. MICHAELEEN DOUCLEFF, BYLINE: Officially, Scott Nguyen is a bioinformatician at Washington, D. C. 's Public Health Laboratory. But he and a handful of other scientists around the world have an interesting side hobby. They are. . . SCOTT NGUYEN: Variant hunters. DOUCLEFF: Nguyen and his colleagues hunt for new coronavirus variants. NGUYEN: I think that's a pretty cool way to describe it. DOUCLEFF: They searched through millions of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, looking to find mutants that could shift the course of the pandemic. For instance, back in November, one hunter found. . . NGUYEN: A very weird set of spike mutations coming from South Africa. That became omicron. DOUCLEFF: Now, Nguyen has detected another intriguing variant. It was first found in France but has also shown up in other parts of the world. It's a combination of delta and omicron. As one scientist put it, this variant has the head of omicron stuck onto the body of delta. NGUYEN: So the body of the virus is still delta, but a good chunk of it is - of the spike at least - is omicron. So, yes, that's the best way to describe it. DOUCLEFF: Yeah, that's just kind of remarkable. There's just some intrinsic imaginary sci-fi element to this. NGUYEN: Yeah, definitely. Definitely. It's kind of surprising in a way - like, hey, the virus really could do this and do it very well as well. DOUCLEFF: So how does the variant do this? How does it create this Frankenstein hybrid? Shishi Luo is a bioinformatician agent at Helix. It's a genomics company that has also been hunting for new variants. She says for these variants to arise, a person had to be infected with both omicron and delta at the same time. SHISHI LUO: They were exposed in a short enough time frame that they had both of them in this system. DOUCLEFF: Which means they were, like, infected twice, right? LUO: Yeah. And also, this is purely hypothetical, but omicron happened around Christmas and New Year's, where there are a lot of social gatherings. So you can imagine you go to one social gathering. Maybe you got exposed to delta. You go to a different social gathering. You got exposed to omicron. And they both got into the same cell at one point. And then this happens. DOUCLEFF: When two variants are inside the same cell at the same time, she says they can end up doing a special process in which one variant, when it's replicating, actually steals a chunk of genes from another variant. It's called recombination. Here's the problem with recombination. Dr. Mike Ryan at the World Health Organization says this process is the reason coronavirus has evolved so quickly, and it's how dangerous strains of the flu are made. MIKE RYAN: That is how we generate pandemics of influenza. It's through viral recombination. So we have to be very cautious. We have to watch these recombinant events very, very closely. DOUCLEFF: Because although this deltacron variant is rare, recombination is a process where the virus can take its most successful parts and combine them quickly into a supervirus. And there are other deltacrons out there. Shishi Luo and her colleagues have already found a handful in the U. S. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: That was NPR's Michaeleen Doucleff.

GREENFIELDBOYCE: More information, like what this early star is made of, should come from planned observations with the James Webb Space Telescope, which launched late last year.

This year was supposed to be a post-COVID turnaround for resorts. But labor shortages and persistent drought means many are still struggling. As NPR's Kirk Siegler reports, drought raises anxiety about climate change and whether ski resorts have a future. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Interstate 70, which connects Denver to the famous ski resorts of the Colorado Rockies, is a parking lot. SUVs with ski racks choke the thoroughfare alongside scores of idling semi trucks. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SEMI TRUCK SPUTTERING)SIEGLER: . . . Belching out smog in the pristine high country everyone is escaping the city to get to. ERIN WALTON: There's more and more people and more and more traffic. And it's just - ugh (ph). SIEGLER: Skier and reluctant driver Erin Walton. WALTON: There's too many contradictory things happening all at - you know? It just - honestly, it kind of makes us sad about the future of skiing and what it's going to mean for people, for the environment. SIEGLER: That is the irony of burning fossil fuels to get to skiing that's dependent on cold, snowy winters. And then there are the jet-setters. Farther west at the tiny Aspen Airport, a line of private jets queues along the runway. I'm looking at one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11 private jets just right here. These are big planes. These look like they could be commercial airline jets. Aspen, where old hippies and extreme skiers share the slopes with celebrities and royalty, is a familiar punching bag. And the Aspen Ski Company's vice president of sustainability, Auden Schendler, is used to the shots. AUDEN SCHENDLER: If you're saying greed drives our industry, you're essentially attacking capitalism as a whole. We're not going to eliminate capitalism, but we could fix it. What does that look like? It would look like, for example, a national carbon tax. We're advocating for that. SIEGLER: Schendler and company executives also convinced this valley's utility to disconnect from fossil fuel electricity. And they were the only resort to join a lawsuit defending the Biden administration's freeze on new oil and gas leasing on public land. SCHENDLER: Call us hypocrites. Call us whatever you want if we're not doing that work. But don't tell me you're using carbon, therefore, you can't talk. That's what the fossil fuel industry wants us to do is to not do anything and not change the system. SIEGLER: Getting off the Aspen Mountain gondola, skiers are greeted by a dystopian exhibit. Here, where tourists usually snap photos of the stunning vistas of the Elk mountains, there's a gondola car lying tilted on the snow. SCHENDLER: It looks like you took a gondola cabin and put it on a hot street and it melted like a scoop of ice cream. SIEGLER: It's meant to alarm Aspen's powerful and moneyed guests into action. SCHENDLER: I've always been concerned that warming would end the ski industry. It will. And by the way, yeah, we'll be the last resort standing because you and I are at 11,000 feet right now. But that doesn't help us. If the mom-and-pop ski resort in Jersey goes away, those are our future clients. SIEGLER: Is the melted gondola gimmick working? Jacob Phillip, who's visiting from California, didn't notice. JACOB PHILLIP: You know, there's a lot of concerns that I have right now in life in the United States, in life in Los Angeles where we live. You know, whether my ski season gets a little bit shorter because of climate change is, you know, probably, you know, maybe makes the top 200 - I don't know - makes the top 150. SIEGLER: Phillip's ski season is already about a month shorter. The temperature has risen by three degrees Fahrenheit in the Colorado Rockies since 1980. What does that mean? Here's Ashley Perl, who's in charge of the city of Aspen's climate response. ASHLEY PERL: In my lifetime here in Aspen - so since 1980 - we've lost 30 frozen days. So we have 30 more frost-free days than we used to. SIEGLER: The shortening winter here is so alarming that city leaders recently cited the climate crisis as one reason for temporarily banning all new residential construction. A perennial controversy is that many of this town's workers have to commute in to build and maintain luxury, energy-sucking homes that are empty most of the year. PERL: Our workforce comes from a long way away to keep this town running. That comes with emissions from traffic. And our visitors come on their private jets, which has a lot of emissions associated with it. And that's always been the dichotomy of Aspen. SIEGLER: But with the affordable housing crisis colliding with climate anxiety, things have felt especially tense here this winter. TIM MOONEY: It's very scary for a lot of people. SIEGLER: Tim Mooney has also lived in Aspen for most of his life. MOONEY: Skiing is going to change. The planet is going to change. And the guys who are stealing all the money that have the private jets that live in the castles aren't going to give a [expletive] because they have staff, and they can go to wherever the weather is. SIEGLER: Mooney says the ultra-wealthy will just go somewhere else when climate change ends skiing in Colorado, leaving locals to worry about the future of their snow-dependent towns.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PETER MARKS: I want to welcome everyone and thank everyone for joining the meeting today. KELLY: On Wednesday, an FDA advisory committee met to talk about the future of COVID boosters. You're hearing Peter Marks, the agency's top vaccine scientist who pointed out many Americans haven't gotten an initial booster dose even as a second one is authorized for some, and many more are waiting to see if they can get one soon. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARKS: And so what we'll be doing is having a variety of presentations relevant to the broad discussion of boosters. KELLY: A broad discussion of big questions. ANTHONY FAUCI: What about as we get into the fall and the winter? The entire population, will they or will they not require a fourth boost? KELLY: Or Dr. Anthony Fauci told NPR this week, boosters could be given once a year like the flu shot. FAUCI: That is certainly possible. KELLY: Or there could be a threshold after a number of boosters where immunity stays strong enough, long enough. FAUCI: That you will not need that regular a boost. I have to emphasize, we don't know the answer to that right now. KELLY: Then there's the possibility of another variant emerging. FAUCI: There are a lot of moving parts here. We have to take it, you know, point by point, month by month, you know, segment of the year by segment of the year to determine what the proper approach would be to keep this under control and to protect our citizens. KELLY: CONSIDER THIS - there are way more questions than answers about the future of the pandemic and what role vaccines will play in that future. But we do have some answers based on what we know in the present. From NPR, I'm Mary Louise Kelly. It's Wednesday, April 6. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. In the U. S. , the future of vaccines isn't the only unknown. There's also how the government will pay for those vaccines. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Mr. Rubio. Mr. Rubio - no. KELLY: On Tuesday afternoon, a $10 billion COVID funding package was blocked by Senate Republicans. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Miss Murkowski - no. KELLY: . . . Who say they will not vote to authorize the money unless they get something they want. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Mr. Cotton. Mr. Cotton - no. KELLY: What they want is a continuation of a Trump-era policy that permitted immigration officials to expel asylum-seekers and migrants for public health reasons. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Miss Collins - no. KELLY: In the U. S. , with many places under no COVID restrictions at all and key COVID metrics continuing to fall, the Biden administration wants to lift those immigration restrictions in May. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Mr. Cruz - no. KELLY: Republicans do not. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHRIS MURPHY: On this vote, the yeas are 47, the nays are 52. Three-fifths of the senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in the affirmative, the motion is not agreed to. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: That means Congress will likely leave for Easter without an agreement to fund the purchase of more vaccines, tests and research into new treatments and new variants. FAUCI: And we are really in quite difficult need to continue not only the production and the distribution of countermeasures but also the research. KELLY: Dr. Anthony Fauci told NPR more funding is needed to invest in things like the development of a pan-coronavirus vaccine, something that would protect against the virus that causes COVID-19 and others that may emerge in the future. FAUCI: But that will likely come in multiple stages, the first stage being developing a vaccine that would be equally as protective against any of the variants we know of and those that we don't even recognize. KELLY: Of course, scientists haven't come up with a one-size-fits-all vaccine like that yet, which is why that FDA advisory committee met on Wednesday to talk about all the variables on the table for booster doses. As of when we are recording this on Wednesday, the committee seemed focused on understanding when and how a formal decision to make variant-specific vaccines would need to be made. FDA's Peter Marks said the specifics of changes to current vaccines would be the subject of a separate, future committee meeting. The bottom line - still a lot of unknowns. Ahead of the FDA meeting, I spoke about what we do know with NPR health correspondent Rob Stein. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise. KELLY: So I want to start just laying out where things stand, which is that last week, the FDA authorized a second booster, which would amount to a fourth shot for people age 50 and older and for some people with particular health problems. Is that the writing on the wall that eventually everyone is going to need to line up and get yet another shot? STEIN: You know, Mary Louise, no one knows for sure. And many experts think we should be focusing on vaccinating the unvaccinated and boosting the unboosted instead of just giving more shots to vaccinated people. But others say there's a pretty good chance that's where we're going to be headed, probably by the fall, because, you know, the virus isn't going away. Whatever immunity people have from their shots or infections could very well continue to fade. And yet another surge could easily hit the country next winter. I talked about this with Dr. Peter Marks. He's the FDA's top vaccine scientist. MARKS: That's when we'll probably have a fair amount of waning immunity in combination with likely further evolution of the virus, along with people going back inside. STEIN: Where the virus spreads more easily. So Marks says that the country must start planning now for whether everyone needs a shot and, if so, what kind of shot exactly. MARKS: We could basically wait until another wave comes along and then try to deal with it. But I think we know that doesn't work because we can't manufacture and deploy vaccines fast enough. KELLY: Right. So, Rob, they're talking about this constant game of catch-up. And I guess that prompts the question of how you get out of that. How are they going to go about making a shot that will at least try to get us ahead of the game and provide real protection? STEIN: Yeah, that's a very good question. And that's a really tricky part of this. No one knows what version of the virus will be dominant by the fall or winter. It could be omicron, especially the omicron subvariant called BA. 2 that's taking over now and threatening another wave even sooner, or it could be an entirely new variant that we haven't seen before. So while one option may be that everyone just gets the same vaccine again, Marks thinks that's probably not the best option. MARKS: There is a certain diminishing return by giving the same vaccine over and over. And second of all, we have had enough evolution of this virus that it would make sense to want to try to cover some of the genetic diversity that has been introduced into the mix. STEIN: By instead giving people a new vaccine that specifically targets omicron, or maybe one of the other variants, or that combines at least two different strains into one vaccine, that could provide even broader protection against some other new variants that might emerge. Here's Dr. Marks again. MARKS: By this fall, we may be onto a new variant. It could be sigma. It could be tau. There may be something new circulating that we'll have to deal with, and we're going to have to make a good guess at what (laughter) may be most effective. STEIN: Just like we do with the flu vaccine every year. KELLY: Oh, my God, Rob. The thought of sigma and tau and all the rest that. . . STEIN: (Laughter) I know. KELLY: . . . May be in the pipeline. But to his point, there is precedent for this. We already adapt the flu vaccine every year. Is that in the pipeline for COVID? STEIN: Yeah. Yeah. Those so far - you know, there's an omicron version of the vaccine that hasn't looked all that promising so far in early testing. But scientists are waiting for more data about that shot and about other new versions of the vaccine that combine strains, you know, like omicron and the original strain or omicron and beta or maybe delta and omicron this time around. KELLY: That's NPR health correspondent Rob Stein. Thank you, Rob. STEIN: You bet, Mary Louise. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: Well, whatever the future of the pandemic holds, public health officials are hoping to get early glimpses of it in the murky depths of wastewater treatment plants. The idea, embraced by the Biden administration, is to enlist those plants to test sewage for coronavirus and spot new outbreaks before they become big outbreaks. Colorado is one place that has signed on to the strategy. John Daley filed this report from Denver. JOHN DALEY, BYLINE: It was two years ago, right at the start of the pandemic. An engineer named Pieter Van Ry woke up and read an article in Popular Mechanics. It explained that the new coronavirus could be detected in human feces. PIETER VAN RY: At the end of that article, it said, if you have a wastewater facility and you're interested in participating in the study, please contact us. DALEY: Actually, he did have such a facility. Van Ry directs South Platte Renew, a treatment plant serving 300,000 people southwest of Denver. Over the years, he's heard the wisecracks. VAN RY: Yeah. Your number two is our No. 1. There's a lot of good ones out there. DALEY: At the plant, Van Ry and his team showed me how it works. They opened a hatch down to a dark stream where the effluent flows in. VAN RY: So this is essentially where it comes in - one from essentially Englewood, one from Littleton. DALEY: Let's just say the odor was not like a dozen roses. Oh, yeah. Smells like waste. VAN RY: Yeah (laughter). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Oh, yeah. DALEY: Whew. The team siphons off wastewater fluid once a week and sends samples to a lab. Van Ry says the samples showed exactly, wave by wave, what the virus was doing over the last two years. VAN RY: Really, what it tells me is that it was spreading rapidly through the community. DALEY: The technique caught on. Now the CDC wants to tie together all this wastewater testing to create a national surveillance system. Colorado now has more than three dozen sites. Most of the samples get sent to a state-run lab, where they test for viral RNA unique to the coronavirus. Epidemiologist Rachel Jervis says, with wastewater, you don't need to rely on people to take a COVID test and report the results. RACHEL JERVIS: Whereas with COVID wastewater, we found that up to 50% of people will shed COVID virus in their stool regardless of whether or not they have symptoms. DALEY: The state then sends the data to the CDC. But for now, coverage is uneven. According to its website, more than a dozen states aren't part of the network. Still, backers say, along with clinical testing, it can give an early warning sign. (SOUNDBITE OF MANHOLE COVER THUDDING)DALEY: Lots of colleges have been early adopters of this tool. CORINNE LENGSFELD: So this manhole is in one of our sidewalks. DALEY: That's Corinne Lengsfeld, a mechanical engineer at the University of Denver. And what is that down there? KEITH MILLER: That's sewage right now. DALEY: This is Keith Miller. He's a biochemist at the school. MILLER: Well, it's everything right now. So there's - it's a heavy load - right? - because they're taking showers right now, so there isn't a lot of solids. DALEY: This testing helped monitor student health in the fall of 2020. Lengsfeld says back then, at one site, wastewater samples were off the charts. LENGSFELD: It was a million virus units per one liter. DALEY: So a lot. LENGSFELD: It's a lot. DALEY: So it's like holy (laughter). . . LENGSFELD: Holy Toledo (laughter). DALEY: That information convinced school officials to have everyone in one dorm do rapid nasal testing, according to Miller. MILLER: That's what wastewater testing is. It's the one that's going to give you the biggest picture first. DALEY: When they followed up with that quick testing, they IDed 10 infected students and moved them to an isolation dorm. Lengsfeld says without that, perhaps a hundred more students might have caught it. LENGSFELD: It works. I mean, it definitely is a case study, I think, of exactly how to control spread. DALEY: The CDC hopes the wastewater monitoring could help flag future surges and identify hotspots. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: Reporter John Daley in Denver.

I talked about this with Dr. Peter Marks. He's the FDA's top vaccine scientist. MARKS: That's when we'll probably have a fair amount of waning immunity in combination with likely further evolution of the virus, along with people going back inside. STEIN: Where the virus spreads more easily. So Marks says that the country must start planning now for whether everyone needs a shot and, if so, what kind of shot exactly. MARKS: We could basically wait until another wave comes along and then try to deal with it. But I think we know that doesn't work because we can't manufacture and deploy vaccines fast enough. KELLY: Right. So, Rob, they're talking about this constant game of catch-up. And I guess that prompts the question of how you get out of that. How are they going to go about making a shot that will at least try to get us ahead of the game and provide real protection? STEIN: Yeah, that's a very good question. And that's a really tricky part of this. No one knows what version of the virus will be dominant by the fall or winter. It could be omicron, especially the omicron subvariant called BA. 2 that's taking over now and threatening another wave even sooner, or it could be an entirely new variant that we haven't seen before. So while one option may be that everyone just gets the same vaccine again, Marks thinks that's probably not the best option. MARKS: There is a certain diminishing return by giving the same vaccine over and over. And second of all, we have had enough evolution of this virus that it would make sense to want to try to cover some of the genetic diversity that has been introduced into the mix. STEIN: By instead giving people a new vaccine that specifically targets omicron, or maybe one of the other variants, or that combines at least two different strains into one vaccine, that could provide even broader protection against some other new variants that might emerge. Here's Dr. Marks again. MARKS: By this fall, we may be onto a new variant. It could be sigma. It could be tau. There may be something new circulating that we'll have to deal with, and we're going to have to make a good guess at what (laughter) may be most effective. STEIN: Just like we do with the flu vaccine every year. KELLY: Oh, my God, Rob. The thought of sigma and tau and all the rest that. . . STEIN: (Laughter) I know. KELLY: . . . May be in the pipeline. But to his point, there is precedent for this. We already adapt the flu vaccine every year. Is that in the pipeline for COVID? STEIN: Yeah. Yeah. Those so far - you know, there's an omicron version of the vaccine that hasn't looked all that promising so far in early testing. But scientists are waiting for more data about that shot and about other new versions of the vaccine that combine strains, you know, like omicron and the original strain or omicron and beta or maybe delta and omicron this time around. KELLY: That's NPR health correspondent Rob Stein. Thank you, Rob. STEIN: You bet, Mary Louise. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KELLY: Well, whatever the future of the pandemic holds, public health officials are hoping to get early glimpses of it in the murky depths of wastewater treatment plants. The idea, embraced by the Biden administration, is to enlist those plants to test sewage for coronavirus and spot new outbreaks before they become big outbreaks. Colorado is one place that has signed on to the strategy. John Daley filed this report from Denver. JOHN DALEY, BYLINE: It was two years ago, right at the start of the pandemic. An engineer named Pieter Van Ry woke up and read an article in Popular Mechanics. It explained that the new coronavirus could be detected in human feces. PIETER VAN RY: At the end of that article, it said, if you have a wastewater facility and you're interested in participating in the study, please contact us. DALEY: Actually, he did have such a facility. Van Ry directs South Platte Renew, a treatment plant serving 300,000 people southwest of Denver. Over the years, he's heard the wisecracks. VAN RY: Yeah. Your number two is our No. 1. There's a lot of good ones out there. DALEY: At the plant, Van Ry and his team showed me how it works. They opened a hatch down to a dark stream where the effluent flows in. VAN RY: So this is essentially where it comes in - one from essentially Englewood, one from Littleton. DALEY: Let's just say the odor was not like a dozen roses. Oh, yeah. Smells like waste. VAN RY: Yeah (laughter). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Oh, yeah. DALEY: Whew. The team siphons off wastewater fluid once a week and sends samples to a lab. Van Ry says the samples showed exactly, wave by wave, what the virus was doing over the last two years. VAN RY: Really, what it tells me is that it was spreading rapidly through the community. DALEY: The technique caught on. Now the CDC wants to tie together all this wastewater testing to create a national surveillance system. Colorado now has more than three dozen sites. Most of the samples get sent to a state-run lab, where they test for viral RNA unique to the coronavirus. Epidemiologist Rachel Jervis says, with wastewater, you don't need to rely on people to take a COVID test and report the results. RACHEL JERVIS: Whereas with COVID wastewater, we found that up to 50% of people will shed COVID virus in their stool regardless of whether or not they have symptoms. DALEY: The state then sends the data to the CDC. But for now, coverage is uneven. According to its website, more than a dozen states aren't part of the network. Still, backers say, along with clinical testing, it can give an early warning sign. (SOUNDBITE OF MANHOLE COVER THUDDING) DALEY: Lots of colleges have been early adopters of this tool. CORINNE LENGSFELD: So this manhole is in one of our sidewalks. DALEY: That's Corinne Lengsfeld, a mechanical engineer at the University of Denver. And what is that down there? KEITH MILLER: That's sewage right now. DALEY: This is Keith Miller. He's a biochemist at the school. MILLER: Well, it's everything right now. So there's - it's a heavy load - right? - because they're taking showers right now, so there isn't a lot of solids. DALEY: This testing helped monitor student health in the fall of 2020. Lengsfeld says back then, at one site, wastewater samples were off the charts. LENGSFELD: It was a million virus units per one liter. DALEY: So a lot. LENGSFELD: It's a lot. DALEY: So it's like holy (laughter). . . LENGSFELD: Holy Toledo (laughter). DALEY: That information convinced school officials to have everyone in one dorm do rapid nasal testing, according to Miller. MILLER: That's what wastewater testing is. It's the one that's going to give you the biggest picture first. DALEY: When they followed up with that quick testing, they IDed 10 infected students and moved them to an isolation dorm. Lengsfeld says without that, perhaps a hundred more students might have caught it. LENGSFELD: It works. I mean, it definitely is a case study, I think, of exactly how to control spread. DALEY: The CDC hopes the wastewater monitoring could help flag future surges and identify hotspots. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KELLY: Reporter John Daley in Denver.

S. have died from a bird flu virus this year either directly or as a result of culling to prevent its spread. Unlike previous avian flus, this one is affecting wild birds also, and that could keep the virus in circulation for a long time. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The last time a deadly new bird flu showed up here seven years ago, it really hit poultry farms. BRYAN RICHARDS: In 2014-2015, we saw, I think, somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 million domestic poultry affected. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Bryan Richards says that virus didn't infect many wild birds. This time, it's different. RICHARDS: We've got wild bird detections in 32 states. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Richards is the emerging disease coordinator at the U. S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center. He says this virus came across the Atlantic a few months ago probably carried by migratory birds. RICHARDS: It can kill some waterfowl, but I think there's pretty clear evidence that some waterfowl likely are not affected by it. And therefore, they're perfect transport mechanisms for taking it very long distances. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Since this virus arrived, it's killed birds that belong to more than 40 species - mostly ducks and geese, but also scavengers like black vultures and bald eagles that presumably eat the carcasses of birds killed by the virus. David Stallknecht is a bird flu researcher with the University of Georgia. He says there have been large die-offs of ducks in Florida and snow geese in the Midwest. DAVID STALLKNECHT: This outbreak in the wild bird population is a lot more extensive than we saw in 2014-2015. Just a lot more birds appear to be affected. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So far, he hasn't seen indications that any species will lose so many birds that it will become threatened. But the spread of this virus in wild birds suggests that this outbreak may not burn itself out like the last one did. Ron Fouchier is a flu expert at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands. RON FOUCHIER: There's a chance that the virus will stick around, and this will become a long-term problem. FOUCHIER: He says that's what this virus has done in Europe where it arrived a few years ago and never left. It's been causing massive die-offs in wild birds and continues to strike poultry flocks, resulting in the deaths of more than 17 million poultry birds since December. Fouchier says there's only been one known human infection, a farmer in the United Kingdom who lived in close quarters with ducks that got this flu. That person tested positive but didn't have any symptoms. FOUCHIER: We haven't seen any other farmers or veterinarians or other people being infected. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Still, since this bird flu arrived in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been keeping a close watch. Todd Davis works on animal-to-human diseases at the agency. He says bird flu viruses related to this one have sickened and even killed people during past outbreaks in other countries. That's why public health officials here have been monitoring the health of more than 500 people in 25 states who have had contact with sick or dead birds. C TODD DAVIS: Because humans have no prior immunity to these viruses typically, if they were to be infected and spread the virus to other humans, then we could have another pandemic virus on our hands. And so that's our primary concern. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Besides testing any people who show flu-like symptoms, they're also closely tracking genetic changes in the virus, looking for anything that would suggest it might become more of a threat to people.

A new Stanford University study looked at just how much energy it requires. The study found that Americans use well over the necessary amount. NPR's Laura Benshoff is here to unpack what those findings mean for climate change. Hey, Laura. LAURA BENSHOFF, BYLINE: Hey there. ESTRIN: Hi. So first of all, what is the measure of a good life? I guess you could call that a philosophical question. But seriously, how did the researchers measure the amount of energy needed to live a good life? BENSHOFF: They looked around the world at the building blocks for a long and healthy life using the United Nations' goals - so things like having enough food, access to electricity, life expectancy and happiness - and at how much energy that takes. And what they found is that the magic number is about 75 gigajoules of energy per person per year. And one gigajoule is roughly the amount of energy contained in eight gallons of gasoline. So for comparison, Americans use 284 gigajoules a year per capita, nearly four times that sweet spot. ESTRIN: OK. So we know that scientists have been warning that Americans' energy habits need to change in order to avoid the worst outcomes of climate change. So what does this new research say about what kinds of habits that we need to change? BENSHOFF: I'm going to let the lead author, Stanford environmental scientist Rob Jackson, answer that one. ROB JACKSON: The world can't support 7 or 8 billion people living at a level of consumption that we have in the United States. It's not possible regardless of whether everything is clean, green infrastructure. BENSHOFF: So there's a lot of focus on changing where energy comes from. That's what he's referring to - switching from coal and gas to renewable sources, for example. But this study emphasizes the demand side and these kinds of overlooked but really important tools for reducing energy demand, such as conservation and efficiency. And the study makes the case that as Americans, we really can trim that demand and not actually be any worse off. ESTRIN: OK. So what can Americans do to use less energy? BENSHOFF: There are things people can do, there are things the government can do and there are things that the government can help people do. For example, transportation is the biggest contributor to carbon emissions in the U. S. and the second biggest user of energy. Jackson says on the individual level, people can choose to take fewer car trips, fewer plane trips. But another expert I spoke with, Sarah Ladislaw, works with the group RMI to sort of speed up the clean energy transition in the U. S. And she says the government can make those decisions easier by investing in different modes of transportation. SARAH LADISLAW: More sort of bus rapid transit or metros but also, like, more bike paths and places to walk. And all of that is policies that are designed to try and enable people to make those better decisions. BENSHOFF: She says it's exciting that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act has funds for these things. Another area to reduce our energy demand is at home. The International Energy Agency estimated that Americans can cut our home energy consumption by between 16- and 20% by changing behaviors, like hanging clothes to dry or cooling our homes room by room. And Ladislaw says this is another area where governments can incentivize people and businesses to make an upfront investment in more efficient home systems that will lower our energy demand over time. ESTRIN: So if the U. S. is using too much energy, what does this research tell us about places in the world where people don't have enough energy? BENSHOFF: There's a real equity issue here, and helping people around the world get access to dependable, safe energy is baked into global climate change plans even as hyper-consuming countries need to cut back. This research shows that we can get there without all turning into hyper-consuming Americans, basically. ESTRIN: NPR's Laura Benshoff, thanks. BENSHOFF: Thank you so much. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DANIEL ESTRIN, HOST:   Living a happy, healthy life takes energy. A new Stanford University study looked at just how much energy it requires. The study found that Americans use well over the necessary amount. NPR's Laura Benshoff is here to unpack what those findings mean for climate change. Hey, Laura. LAURA BENSHOFF, BYLINE: Hey there. ESTRIN: Hi. So first of all, what is the measure of a good life? I guess you could call that a philosophical question. But seriously, how did the researchers measure the amount of energy needed to live a good life? BENSHOFF: They looked around the world at the building blocks for a long and healthy life using the United Nations' goals - so things like having enough food, access to electricity, life expectancy and happiness - and at how much energy that takes. And what they found is that the magic number is about 75 gigajoules of energy per person per year. And one gigajoule is roughly the amount of energy contained in eight gallons of gasoline. So for comparison, Americans use 284 gigajoules a year per capita, nearly four times that sweet spot. ESTRIN: OK. So we know that scientists have been warning that Americans' energy habits need to change in order to avoid the worst outcomes of climate change. So what does this new research say about what kinds of habits that we need to change? BENSHOFF: I'm going to let the lead author, Stanford environmental scientist Rob Jackson, answer that one. ROB JACKSON: The world can't support 7 or 8 billion people living at a level of consumption that we have in the United States. It's not possible regardless of whether everything is clean, green infrastructure. BENSHOFF: So there's a lot of focus on changing where energy comes from. That's what he's referring to - switching from coal and gas to renewable sources, for example. But this study emphasizes the demand side and these kinds of overlooked but really important tools for reducing energy demand, such as conservation and efficiency.

They were left by someone walking through the mud nearly 3. 7 million years ago. And it looks like that early human didn't walk alone. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce filed this report on researchers who took a new look at some other ancient tracks. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Walking on two legs is a distinctively human thing to do. It seems to make us different than other living primates. ELLISON MCNUTT: It's a very strange way of kind of moving through the world. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Ellison McNutt is a biological anthropologist at the Ohio University Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine. She studies upright walking and says most four-legged creatures find it challenging. MCNUTT: If you imagine asking your dog to do that, they're really wobbly. They're really uncomfortable. They don't want to do that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Yet humans did it early in their history. For example, at one site in Tanzania, a volcanic eruption over 3 1/2 million years ago covered the landscape with ash and preserved all kinds of tracks that had been left in the mud. MCNUTT: So we're talking elephants and bunnies, birds. All kinds of things walked across this landscape, and they left these amazing footprints. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Including one set of footprints that look quite human. MCNUTT: And this trackway has been reconstructed to belong to a common and early human ancestor called Australopithecus afarensis, and this is the same species that the quite famous fossil Lucy belongs to. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Now, when these were discovered back in the 1970s, workers also found a track of five footprints that looked more mysterious. Researchers speculated that these prints were created by a small bear walking upright. MCNUTT: They were tentative about it and acknowledged that, you know, we don't have a good answer for this. This is a reasonable answer. Bears do stand up and walk upright. GREENFIELDBOYCE: McNutt had actually been studying how bears do that when she came across a mention of these fossil tracks, which had been mostly forgotten for decades. She and her colleagues decided to reexamine them using modern technology. They did detailed comparisons to footprints left by humans, chimpanzees and young bears living at a sanctuary. MCNUTT: We ended up with four little juvenile bears that we had stand up and walk through mud for either applesauce or maple syrup as their reward at the end of it (laughter). GREENFIELDBOYCE: Their results appear in the journal Nature. And it turns out the fossil footprints just aren't bearlike. Instead, there's signs of more humanlike features, such as a big toe. McNutt says it looks like there were two early human species walking around back then. In fact, they could have seen each other go by. MCNUTT: The nature of fossil footprints and how these trackways are made is that they're in the same layer of mud. So these are likely made within the scale of hours to days from one another. GREENFIELDBOYCE: All of this has convinced Stephanie Melillo. She's a paleoanthropologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. STEPHANIE MELILLO: We see there the presence of two different kinds of hominid ancestors together in the same environment, in the same place, at the same time. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says one of the biggest questions about human evolution is why our ancestors started walking upright. MELILLO: And I don't think that we really have a good answer to that question yet. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But these footprints suggest that multiple human species coexisted while walking upright in different ways. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

The icy heart of the megacomet is about 80 miles in diameter, we're told, which makes it larger than the state of Rhode Island. NPR's Deepa Shivaram reports. DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: It's called the C/2014 UN271, which is a pretty short name given its gargantuan size. This comet is 50 times bigger than average. DAVID JEWITT: So it really is big compared to the average comet that we've seen. And, in fact, it's the biggest one that's been seen so far. SHIVARAM: That's David Jewitt, an astronomer at UCLA. He's one of the scientists who confirmed this comet's record-breaking size. And he says even measuring it was a feat. It took him eight months. That's because what he's really focused on is the icy core called the nucleus. JEWITT: So the important part of a comet is kind of the solid bit in the middle, but it's the hardest part to measure because it's surrounded by kind of an atmosphere that swamps the brightness of the nucleus. SHIVARAM: But Jewitt and the researchers were able to solve this problem using the Hubble Space Telescope and their own modeling that allowed them to extract the light coming from the comet's nucleus and separate it from the light coming from the comet's tail. The comet is barreling at a speed of 22,000 miles per hour, but it won't ever get close to planet Earth. In fact, the closest this comet will even get to the sun is 1 billion miles away. JEWITT: You know, nobody should expect to go outside and see this thing through a pair of binoculars or, you know, just by naked eye. It's not going to be a really spectacular nighttime object. SHIVARAM: But Jewitt says the discovery underscores that our solar system is still an unknown and unfamiliar place, with thousands of comets left to be discovered. JEWITT: There are tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of smaller bodies in the outer solar system that we haven't discovered yet because we haven't looked hard enough.

Winds like these pushed a rare December wildfire into a suburb, destroying more than a thousand homes in a single day. Since then, there have been several more close calls, as NPR's Kirk Siegler reports. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: The Marshall Fire last winter, fanned by 100-mile-an-hour winds, raced into the suburbs east of Boulder, burning from home to home, igniting a whole shopping center, a hotel. Three and a half months later, drive up the Boulder Turnpike, and it's eerie seeing all that's left of that hotel - a four-story-high elevator shaft amidst rubble. I'm watching a huge dozer scoop up twisted, burnt debris in a cul-de-sac just in front of me - wrought iron, charred patio furniture, burnt cars. LONNI PEARCE: When I drive through our neighborhood and it looks like a war zone, I can't help but just be still shocked. SIEGLER: Lonni Pearce lost everything. The University of Colorado professor was under-insured. It's a common problem after disasters. So her family isn't sure whether they'll rebuild. And the recent return of fierce winds stirs anxiety. PEARCE: It just felt like, OK, that - can this really be happening again? SIEGLER: And all it takes is a 50-mile-an-hour wind gust like this to topple a power line or send a spark from a passing truck into the dry brush. It's hard to remember a day here recently when there wasn't a dreaded red flag warning for extreme wildfire danger. Arzelia Walker has lived in South Boulder for 40 years. ARZELIA WALKER: You sort of start to feel anxious, you know? And the fact that the Marshall Fire was in the dead of winter is terrifying. SIEGLER: Like a lot of this college town of 100,000 people at the doorstep of the Rockies, her neighborhood abuts open space. WALKER: Our big winds tend to come in the winter, but - so that's not been a problem so much in the past 'cause there's been snow. SIEGLER: But climate change has made winters warmer and drier. Just a few weeks ago, Walker had to evacuate during the NCAR Fire - NCAR for the National Center for Atmospheric Research it ironically threatened. It's one of Boulder's premier climate research labs. Firefighters got a handle on it before it got bigger than 200 acres, though. BRIAN OLIVER: Definitely a scare. You know, you can see the neighborhood just a couple hundred yards away from the fire line, the black edge there. SIEGLER: Brian Oliver is Boulder's wildland fire chief. Standing on a mesa with a 360-degree view of the city and its striking flat iron rock formations. The red flag warnings have him stationing fire engines in strategic places around town. Heavy air tankers are on call in nearby Fort Collins if it's safe to fly in this wind. OLIVER: There's definitely a feeling of - man, it's - I'm not sure the word to use. On edge is a good way to put it. There's tension because we haven't gotten a break. SIEGLER: Fires, floods, the pandemic, a mass shooting a year ago at the grocery store down the hill - Oliver says it's been relentless. When the NCAR Fire ignited, evacuation alerts went out to some 19,000 people, more than probably needed it, and traffic was bottlenecked. But Oliver says he'd rather be overly cautious than have people trapped behind. OLIVER: I equate that to trying to fight a hurricane, right? We don't mobilize a force to go turn a hurricane around, right? We get everybody out of the way, and then we try to come back in and clean up after, if we can. SIEGLER: Now, these aren't the wildfires burning into newly built communities out in the woods that often grab headlines. Boulder capped growth and sprawl some 40 years ago. But climate change, Oliver says, is bringing these fires into the city. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: How's it going? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Good. Yourself? SIEGLER: Federal leaders, including Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, toured Boulder County this week trying to sound that alarm. One of their stops was the still-charred hillsides of the Cal-Wood Fire in a canyon north of town. In 2020 in late October, it burned 10,000 acres and destroyed homes. JOE NEGUSE: It is clear that fire seasons no longer exist here in Colorado. We have fire years. SIEGLER: The local congressman, Joe Neguse, touted $130 million in new fire funding in the infrastructure law. It'll go to prevention and hiring more fire crews in the Western states. Now, it won't help people in crisis here right now, but Lonni Pearce, whose home burned down last December, found the news encouraging. PEARCE: It just feels like this is a little bit of a tipping point. Like, OK, things are really real now. And we need to, not just as individuals but as communities, start to do things differently. SIEGLER: From changing landscaping to building code, she says, Westerners have to live with fire now, even in cities. Kirk Siegler, NPR News, Boulder, Colo.

These are among the top priorities outlined for NASA by a group of planetary researchers. NPR science correspondent Nell Greenfieldboyce, with one of the coolest assignments at NPR, joins us to discuss this new report. Hi, Nell. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Hey there. ESTRIN: OK. First of all, I understand this is a pretty important report. Why does it matter so much? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Well, it matters because it's basically a highly influential scientific wish list that's put together just once every decade. So there's lots of cool places out there to explore. Scientists would love to go everywhere. But money is not unlimited, and at some point, decisions have to be made. This kind of report is how the field of planetary science sort of comes to a consensus on what missions seem the most compelling. Every 10 years, the prestigious National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine convene a bunch of experts to review the state of the science and make a list of priorities. ESTRIN: OK. So what are the priorities? GREENFIELDBOYCE: This time around, the big headline is a mission to Uranus. It's a blue ice giant planet like Neptune, so smaller than a gas giant like Jupiter. And it's got a lot of icy materials around a rocky core. Now, studies of planets around distant stars show that ice giants are probably the most common kind of planet in the universe. But NASA has never sent a spacecraft to orbit an ice giant and study it closely. I mean, Voyager 2 flew by Uranus back in 1986, but that's about it. And then the other destination that these experts say NASA should visit is Enceladus. And that's an icy moon of Saturn. It has geysers that spew out water vapor from an underground ocean. And that means a probe could land there and analyze samples that originated deep within and then sort of rain down on the probe. And, you know, they could see if conditions there are right for life. ESTRIN: Wow. So cool, Nell. OK, so a moon of Saturn. What about our moon? I mean, do the experts prioritize that? Because I understand NASA is trying to send people back to the moon sometime in the next decade. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That is a tough one. The report is super excited about the scientific potential of human exploration of the moon, but it also raises real concerns about whether good science will get done there by the astronauts. It says it looks like the scientific payoff of the first landings that are planned might be minimal. Basically, they say NASA has to reorganize itself to make sure high-quality science gets incorporated into moon trips. You know, since the Apollo moon program ended, human spaceflight has been sort of separate from planetary exploration. And this report says NASA needs to fix that disconnect. ESTRIN: OK. So briefly, we heard a lot of exciting ideas from these experts, but does NASA tend to follow the advice? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Generally, yes. I mean, so-called decadal surveys like this one have a real impact with NASA, as well as with Congress, which controls the budget. The last time around, the top recommendations were to bring home rocks from Mars and send a probe to Europa, a moon of Jupiter. And NASA is now working on both of those. ESTRIN: Wow.

The population has suffered from a decade of hurricanes and floods and oil spills and droughts. And the closing of almost all the public oyster reefs has drawn protests from harvesters. Katie Watkins reports. KATIE WATKINS, BYLINE: At a dock near Galveston Bay, about an hour south of Houston, Johny Jurisich climbs aboard his boat, the Mr. Jurisich. As he enters the bay, just a few other boats dot the horizon, an odd sight for what is normally peak oyster harvesting season. JOHNY JURISICH: Oh, you would have maybe about 40 or 50 boats working, scattered across, all around us. WATKINS: Currently, 25 of the state's 27 harvesting areas are already closed. The season normally runs from November through April, but many of the areas have been closed since mid-December, a move the state says is necessary to help the oysters rebound. But those in the oyster business, like Jurisich, worry about the sustainability of their industry and livelihoods. JURISICH: It's been taking a big toll on me, actually. I started this right out of high school. So, I mean, this is all I've ever done. WATKINS: A fourth-generation fisherman and oyster wholesaler, he says his business is lucky to have some of the few private leases in Galveston Bay. But those oysters are usually saved for the offseason. JURISICH: We started working in our private grounds but way too early. So we know that this summer, we're not going to have enough to supply our customers. WATKINS: Jurisich drops the dredge into the waters. (SOUNDBITE OF CRASH, SPLASH)WATKINS: The boat slowly spinning in circles to harvest the bivalves from the reef below. He sorts through the oysters, keeping those over 3 inches and putting the smaller ones back into the water. JURISICH: These are the baby oyster, this little red polka dot right here. WATKINS: That's a baby oyster? JURISICH: This is a baby oyster. This is a little. . . WATKINS: The state closes the bays for harvesting if their samples come back with too many small oysters or too few oysters overall. Jurisich and others from the industry disagree with how the state takes the samples and also with the system itself. They say by closing some bays, it forces all of the boats into just a few areas, inevitably overwhelming those reefs as well. Christopher Steffen with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department says it's necessary to protect the oysters. CHRISTOPHER STEFFEN: I completely understand the concern from an industry standpoint, but I also think it's important to look at the ecological standpoint. WATKINS: Steffen says oysters prevent shoreline erosion and help filter the water. But he says, unlike fish, they can't just swim away to escape poor conditions. JURISICH: They're very susceptible to environmental conditions changing. And if those conditions aren't favorable for them, they sort of have to deal with them in a sense. WATKINS: Jennifer Pollack with the Harte Research Institute says repeated disasters in recent years means it's hard for Texas oysters to bounce back. JENNIFER POLLACK: We have all these disturbances that knock the reefs back. We have harvesting that continues that probably keeps them at maybe a lower level, lower abundance level of oysters in the bay. And they just can never climb back out, and so they're a little bit less resilient next time something happens. WATKINS: A lot of these conditions - droughts, increased rainfall - are only expected to be exacerbated by climate change. Beyond the temporary closures, Texas Parks and Wildlife is also studying the possibility of permanently closing three bays. Jurisich and other oyster fishermen, like Antonio Ayala, worry this could push the industry even closer to the brink. ANTONIO AYALA: (Speaking Spanish). WATKINS: Ayala says the state is hurting the oyster industry rather than helping them. And this year has been tough. He's had to dip into his savings just to pay the bills. He tells me he thinks about getting another job, but after 30 years harvesting oysters, this is all he knows. For NPR News, I'm Katie Watkins in Houston.

But before that consequential event even happens, the space agency needs to hash out some details. A big one is how to protect Earth from any alien life that might hitch a ride back. Here's NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: On Mars, a NASA rover called Perseverance is exploring a crater that seems to have once been flooded with water. Every once in a while, the rover drills down into the rocky surface. JIM BELL: And then it pulls up a plug of that rock, a core, that's about the size of a dry-erase marker. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Jim Bell of Arizona State University is a member of the rover team. He says a little robotic arm processes each rock sample. BELL: Takes pictures of it, measures its volume and then hermetically seals it in one of our 42 empty sample tubes that we brought with us. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The rover brought those metal sample tubes to Mars because NASA intends to pay the red planet another robotic visit to pick up those carefully selected rocks and send them back to Earth. The question is, what else might come back with them? Peter Doran is a geologist at Louisiana State University who studies life in extreme environments. PETER DORAN: It would be a big deal if some pathogen got back to Earth and caused problems. You know, it could be any level of problems. But we definitely have to take the stance of protecting Earth, at least in the early missions. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says Mars is a harsh place - cold, dry, blasted with UV radiation. But on the other hand, the chances of life aren't zero. DORAN: Even though it's highly unlikely, there is a possibility it could eke out a living there. And there's examples of microbes on Earth that could do it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So as NASA and the European Space Agency are working towards a sample return mission that could launch around 2028, NASA is trying to assess the potential environmental impact on Earth and inviting the public to weigh in. DORAN: Maybe this is the most important environmental assessment that humans have ever done. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The agency is having public meetings today and tomorrow to lay out their plans and get feedback. One of the speakers will be Brian Clement, a planetary protection expert at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He says, over the years, panels of scientific experts have considered whether bringing home Martian rocks could endanger any life here. BRIAN CLEMENT: Those panels have all agreed that the potential hazard is very, very low. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says, nonetheless, NASA is being conservative and will either sterilize or securely contain anything that has touched Mars before it comes home. Mars researcher Jim Bell says what worries him is not the sci-fi scenario of Martian germs getting out, but Earth stuff getting in - that would contaminate the pristine samples NASA will have gone to so much trouble to collect. These samples will have to be opened in a special lab, and Bell can't wait. BELL: I just want to see the stuff with my own eyes. I mean, we've been looking at this world through robotic eyes for so long, and I want to see that famous red dust, and I want to see the insides of some of these rocks and little grains that may have formed in a watery environment 3, 4 billion years ago.

To help them learn, some schools have gone all in on one of the world's most widely used reading intervention programs. But according to a new federally funded study, that program may be doing more harm than good. Emily Hanford of APM Reports has done a lot of reporting on how schools teach children to read. Hi, Emily. EMILY HANFORD: Hi. SHAPIRO: Let's start with this program. What's it called, and how do schools use it? HANFORD: The program is called Reading Recovery. It's for first-graders who are having the hardest time learning how to read. Those kids get one-on-one instruction with a teacher who has gone through extensive training in Reading Recovery methods, and those methods are controversial. I did a reporting project back in 2019 where I showed that some of the strategies kids are taught in Reading Recovery are actually the strategies that struggling readers use to get by. In other words, kids are taught to read the way that poor readers read. But before this new study, existing research on Reading Recovery had shown the program was effective, at least in the short term. Kids made large positive gains in first grade. SHAPIRO: OK. So there was evidence that it worked in the short term, but this new study took a longer view. What did it show? HANFORD: Right. So a big question about Reading Recovery has always been whether those short-term gains translate into long-term success. This is the largest, most rigorous study to look at that question. It focused on how third- and fourth-graders did on state reading tests. And what the study found is that the kids who got Reading Recovery actually did worse than a comparison group. SHAPIRO: And do researchers know why that is? HANFORD: The researchers cannot say exactly why, but they have some ideas. One hypothesis is that kids in the program can seem like good readers in first grade, but Reading Recovery may fail to teach them the skills they need to be good readers in the long run. Another possibility is that they did worse because of instruction that they got or didn't get after the first grade. Henry May is the lead author of the study, and he was surprised by the negative results. HENRY MAY: Was Reading Recovery harmful? I wouldn't go so far as to say that. But what we do know is that the kids that got it, for some reason, they ended up losing their gains and then falling behind where they would have been expected to fall. HANFORD: The Reading Recovery Council of North America is the organization that advocates for Reading Recovery in the United States. In a statement about the study, they disputed some of the methodology, and they maintained that their program is effective. SHAPIRO: And in the meantime, are schools still using the program? HANFORD: Yes, they are, and it's an expensive program. It can cost more than $10,000 a year per child. At one point, it was in every state, but some districts have been dropping Reading Recovery. In fact, the very first U. S. district to use the program back in 1984 was Columbus, Ohio, and they recently decided to stop using it. I talked to their executive director of teaching and learning. She told me the decision to drop Reading Recovery is part of a larger effort to bring what's been dubbed the science of reading to Columbus City schools. She and her colleagues realized that their approach to reading instruction, including Reading Recovery, didn't align well with that science. Her name is Leslie Kelly, and I asked her what advice she had for other districts still using Reading Recovery. LESLIE KELLY: I would say be open; do your research; read a lot and really look at, do you have evidence of impact? That's really the key. Do you have evidence of impact, and how do you know? And if you don't have evidence of impact, you have to ask yourself why, and then what are you going to do about it? HANFORD: There are many districts and even entire states right now that are looking carefully at how schools teach reading. And we know that COVID has had a big impact on kids' reading development. This new research is something for policymakers and school leaders to consider as they make decisions about what programs to invest in. SHAPIRO: That's Emily Hanford of APM Reports. Thank you. HANFORD: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   Millions of kids struggle to read. To help them learn, some schools have gone all in on one of the world's most widely used reading intervention programs. But according to a new federally funded study, that program may be doing more harm than good. Emily Hanford of APM Reports has done a lot of reporting on how schools teach children to read. Hi, Emily. EMILY HANFORD: Hi. SHAPIRO: Let's start with this program. What's it called, and how do schools use it? HANFORD: The program is called Reading Recovery. It's for first-graders who are having the hardest time learning how to read. Those kids get one-on-one instruction with a teacher who has gone through extensive training in Reading Recovery methods, and those methods are controversial. I did a reporting project back in 2019 where I showed that some of the strategies kids are taught in Reading Recovery are actually the strategies that struggling readers use to get by. In other words, kids are taught to read the way that poor readers read. But before this new study, existing research on Reading Recovery had shown the program was effective, at least in the short term. Kids made large positive gains in first grade. SHAPIRO: OK. So there was evidence that it worked in the short term, but this new study took a longer view. What did it show? HANFORD: Right. So a big question about Reading Recovery has always been whether those short-term gains translate into long-term success. This is the largest, most rigorous study to look at that question. It focused on how third- and fourth-graders did on state reading tests. And what the study found is that the kids who got Reading Recovery actually did worse than a comparison group.

The finalists from Ukraine, though, are competing virtually in Regeneron's International Science and Engineering Fair. SOFIIA SMOVZH: My name is Sofiia Smovzh. I'm from Kyiv initially, but now I am in Paris. SERHII KOLOMIICHUK: My name is Serhii Kolomiichuk, and my project partner is Dmytriy Omelyanov. We are students of the Financial and Economic Lyceum of Dnipro city. FADEL: Sofiia's research is aimed at finding less toxic treatments for cancer. SMOVZH: When I was in 10th grade, I fell in love with organic chemistry, and that's why my research this year was in this field of organic synthesis. FADEL: Serhii and Dmytriy's idea focuses on how various aromas affect the motor activity of cockroaches. Here's Dmytriy. DMYTRIY OMELYANOV: People have long learned to deal with this insects with insecticides, but they have already become a problem. So we should find a alternative for insecticides. FADEL: Serhii says that they were in Kyiv for the national science fair the day Russia began its assault. KOLOMIICHUK: We woke up at 5 o'clock in the morning from the noise of explosions. Getting out of the taxi on the way to the metro station, we were stuck by a station that we could not imagine on ordinary life. Then the most unusual and uncomfortable train ride home awaited us. Since there were just a huge number of people, we had to sleep two people on the top bunk. People slept for 10 hours wherever they could. Arriving home, constant air raid alerts and a sad view (ph) awaited us. FADEL: Yeah. Sofiia, what about you? SMOVZH: On the first day of the war, I was in Kyiv because I live in Kyiv. . . FADEL: Yeah. SMOVZH: . . . For my whole life. And my family moved to the western part of Ukraine on the first day of the war because I have a small sister, and we didn't want her to listen to all the sounds of explosions that we. . . FADEL: Yeah. SMOVZH: . . . Woke up, we've heard them, and, yeah, it was horrible. But then my friend that lives in Paris invited me to go there. The atmosphere in Ukraine, when you just sit and read news, it's very hard to focus on studying, on something like that. FADEL: Yeah. SMOVZH: And that's why I moved to Paris. And I did it on my own. So my mom, my sister and my stepfather initially left in Ukraine, but now my mom and my sister are in Spain. FADEL: Are in Spain - and so your stepfather is still in Kyiv? SMOVZH: He's in Kyiv, yeah. FADEL: How did you continue to focus on your project when so much was going on with your country and your family? SMOVZH: It's very difficult. I mean, for example, my grandmother, she lives in Kyiv region, and she was in occupation for a month. And also, my supervisor for my project was in occupation for a month. . . FADEL: Oh, my gosh. SMOVZH: . . . Because she also lives in - yeah, in Kyiv region. But still, she tried to help me and tried to answer all my questions, and yeah. FADEL: So your supervisor was under occupation answering your questions about the project. SMOVZH: Yeah. FADEL: Incredible. SMOVZH: I mean, she's very courageous. But I always understood that I have to be strong, and I have to work and to study and prepare for ISEF, you know, to show, like, that Ukraine is strong and independent country, and we're strong in every field and in science, as well. FADEL: Do you feel like your role representing Ukraine at the International Science and Engineering Fair is more than just about your individual projects this year? SMOVZH: For me, it's more than just individual participation and winning something or not winning. It's important to show that the whole country is united, and we are strong, and we can present our country on the international level. FADEL: Serhii and Dmytriy. KOLOMIICHUK: It's so hard, but we can do this. Oddly enough, our life and studies in the Dnipro city continued almost in the usual rhythm. Sometimes we meet with friends and hang out together. Despite this, the war reminds us of itself from time to time, and we hear the sounds of invasion above our heads, and sometimes we see air defense missiles in the distance. Right now, we are in safety, but it can change in any moment.

SASA WOODRUFF, BYLINE: You know, once you don't have a stomach, you actually realize that you don't really need one. CHANG: She had that surgery because a doctor called her in 2019 and said that she had tested positive for a gene mutation that causes a rare, potentially lethal form of stomach cancer. Woodruff hadn't known she was going to be screened for that particular mutation when she first decided to undergo genetic testing. But after several years of investigating it, she's grateful for the information. And as genetic testing becomes cheaper and more accessible, Woodruff's story raises questions about how much information patients should have and how they should receive it. My co-host Ari Shapiro spoke to two experts who think a lot about this - Nita Farahany, professor of law and philosophy at Duke University, where she focuses on the implications of emerging technologies; and Hank Greely, professor of law and biosciences at Stanford University, where he focuses on ethical, legal and social implications of advances in bioscience. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  Let me first get your reaction to Sasa's story and especially the fact that she was contacted without knowing she had given consent to be informed about a genetic mutation that she did not even know she was being tested for. What do you make of this? NITA FARAHANY: Oh, there's so much to make of it, right? I mean, so first, you know, I think it's not probably that unusual in the coming days of what we can expect from genetic testing. And because what we know about genetics is changing all the time, it's not that surprising that there'd be some additional discovery as part of her original sequencing that she didn't anticipate she was being tested for. I think what's surprising is that somebody actually kept up with it and thought to actually contact her. That's the part that I think is the most surprising. HANK GREELY: And it's different, I think, when you're in a clinical context. Her family history of cancer is incredible. It's amazingly bad. And so in her particular case, if I were her, I certainly would have wanted my doctors to be on the lookout for any kind of cancer connection in my genome. And you have an obligation to go back every five years and recheck the patient's genome to see if there's something new that should be disclosed. That's going to be a tough one. SHAPIRO: This is an instance of a doctor saying, you have this gene, so you need to do that. But I could imagine grayer areas. How do you balance the need to keep people informed and the desire to give them good information with the psychological burden of knowing something that might not have a clear answer or a solution? FARAHANY: You know, in the kind of short term, what you have a duty to disclose is more limited to those things that are actionable, not necessarily things that are far off into the future. There's a question of, like, should you, and do you? And some people would want to know. I, for one, would want to know even if it was iffy and even if it was equivocal. Here's where Hank and I probably disagree about. . . GREELY: I think people are very bad at making health decisions. I think most people know very little about genetics. They need help in order to make sense of this. And, you know, if it's a health issue, you're peculiarly not likely to be in a great - in great shape to make a good decision. You're scared. You're nervous. SHAPIRO: We talked to Sasa about how she weighed the information that she might get cancer against the certainty that her life would change if she had the procedure. Here's what she told us. WOODRUFF: You know, one of the things I was afraid of is, what if in two years, they find something where they can actually monitor for this so I won't have to have my stomach removed? - because it's so drastic. I was so afraid of making a mistake. SHAPIRO: And so what do you think? Do you think Sasa was right to question, well, maybe in a couple of years this cancer will be more treatable than it is today or at least diagnosable earlier on? FARAHANY: Yeah. I think it's not an obvious and easy choice for anyone, but I think the right answer is that they have the full information available to them to actually decide whether or not they want to take a preventive or precautionary approach. And for her, she made the right decision. GREELY: And it's all going to depend on both the medical circumstances and the personal circumstances. If there's an 80% chance of getting a cancer that is very, very hard to treat and very likely to kill you, that's one thing. If there is a 5% chance instead of a 1% chance of getting a cancer that is relatively treatable, that's a very different kind of situation. SHAPIRO: There's also a booming market of genetic tests that are marketed straight to consumer. How does the ethical analysis of that differ from what we're talking about here that comes through an insurance company with all of the health care system attached to it? FARAHANY: Well, I think direct-to-consumer genetic testing is an exciting field because it gives people direct access to information about themselves and does so more cheaply and in a more easily accessible way than going through a physician's office. And so, you know, you can get a kit that's sent to you at home. You can spit into a tube and send it off. You can get a lot of information back about different predisposition to risk. And I think it promises a way to democratize information and give people direct access to information. But it also potentially increases the likelihood of genetic literacy as people start to seek to understand what that information means. And that, I think, is exciting. But - you know, but it raises the kind of ethical calculus for many people, such as Hank. I think Hank calls himself a health exceptionalist (ph). SHAPIRO: Hank, is this the 21st century equivalent of, centuries ago, believing that only priests should have access to books? GREELY: Or, alternatively, is this equivalent of saying only licensed physicians should be able to write prescriptions or only licensed surgeons should be able to perform operations? Information can be more powerful and more damaging than a scalpel. If we can reliably predict that many people will not be able to use the information well, not because they're lacking in intelligence but because they don't have the background or because they're not in a good emotional state to try to evaluate everything, then I think requiring that there be resources available to them to help guide them through that decision is every bit as sensible as limiting prescriptions to physicians. SHAPIRO: There's way more data on the genetic makeup of white people in America than people of color. Is there work being done in the field to make this science more inclusive? FARAHANY: Yes, there is an effort to try to diversify these populations significantly and to collect data from far more individuals in order to both be able to improve the predictive value but also to see if there are differences by different regions and, you know, kind of different genetic inheritance patterns that may have occurred in different areas of the world. SHAPIRO: So let me ask - just taking host's privilege here. I'm a relatively healthy person without huge warning signs in my family history. I've got good insurance. Should I get my genome sequenced? FARAHANY: Do I think you should do it? Yes, I do if you're curious about your genome. I don't think that you're going to learn anything Earth-shattering about your likelihood of future diseases. You may find. . . SHAPIRO: I hope I don't. FARAHANY: Well, you probably won't. I mean, family history is in general pretty informative. You know, one thing that I caution some people about is neither your employer nor your health insurance can make choices about you or discriminate or change those insurance decisions or your employment decisions based on genetic information. But that doesn't mean, for example, that life insurance couldn't make those decisions based on genetic information. SHAPIRO: Get the life insurance first, then get it sequenced. FARAHANY: Yeah. I mean, really, like, get your life insurance first and then go ahead and do it if you're interested in doing so. But I do think it can be valuable to make sure you have all of your ducks in a row before you undertake genetic testing. SHAPIRO: Hank, what do you think? Should I get my genome sequenced? GREELY: Yes, I would do it. But for any medical implications, I'd only do it if I knew I had good genetic counseling. SHAPIRO: Professor Hank Greely of Stanford and Nita Farahany of Duke, thank you both for being with us today. GREELY: You're welcome. FARAHANY: Thanks for having me.

How does the ethical analysis of that differ from what we're talking about here that comes through an insurance company with all of the health care system attached to it? FARAHANY: Well, I think direct-to-consumer genetic testing is an exciting field because it gives people direct access to information about themselves and does so more cheaply and in a more easily accessible way than going through a physician's office. And so, you know, you can get a kit that's sent to you at home. You can spit into a tube and send it off. You can get a lot of information back about different predisposition to risk. And I think it promises a way to democratize information and give people direct access to information. But it also potentially increases the likelihood of genetic literacy as people start to seek to understand what that information means. And that, I think, is exciting. But - you know, but it raises the kind of ethical calculus for many people, such as Hank. I think Hank calls himself a health exceptionalist (ph). SHAPIRO: Hank, is this the 21st century equivalent of, centuries ago, believing that only priests should have access to books? GREELY: Or, alternatively, is this equivalent of saying only licensed physicians should be able to write prescriptions or only licensed surgeons should be able to perform operations? Information can be more powerful and more damaging than a scalpel. If we can reliably predict that many people will not be able to use the information well, not because they're lacking in intelligence but because they don't have the background or because they're not in a good emotional state to try to evaluate everything, then I think requiring that there be resources available to them to help guide them through that decision is every bit as sensible as limiting prescriptions to physicians. SHAPIRO: There's way more data on the genetic makeup of white people in America than people of color. Is there work being done in the field to make this science more inclusive? FARAHANY: Yes, there is an effort to try to diversify these populations significantly and to collect data from far more individuals in order to both be able to improve the predictive value but also to see if there are differences by different regions and, you know, kind of different genetic inheritance patterns that may have occurred in different areas of the world. SHAPIRO: So let me ask - just taking host's privilege here. I'm a relatively healthy person without huge warning signs in my family history. I've got good insurance. Should I get my genome sequenced? FARAHANY: Do I think you should do it? Yes, I do if you're curious about your genome. I don't think that you're going to learn anything Earth-shattering about your likelihood of future diseases. You may find. . . SHAPIRO: I hope I don't. FARAHANY: Well, you probably won't. I mean, family history is in general pretty informative. You know, one thing that I caution some people about is neither your employer nor your health insurance can make choices about you or discriminate or change those insurance decisions or your employment decisions based on genetic information. But that doesn't mean, for example, that life insurance couldn't make those decisions based on genetic information. SHAPIRO: Get the life insurance first, then get it sequenced. FARAHANY: Yeah. I mean, really, like, get your life insurance first and then go ahead and do it if you're interested in doing so. But I do think it can be valuable to make sure you have all of your ducks in a row before you undertake genetic testing. SHAPIRO: Hank, what do you think? Should I get my genome sequenced? GREELY: Yes, I would do it. But for any medical implications, I'd only do it if I knew I had good genetic counseling. SHAPIRO: Professor Hank Greely of Stanford and Nita Farahany of Duke, thank you both for being with us today. GREELY: You're welcome. FARAHANY: Thanks for having me.

For decades, people have been able to look up flood risks. But for wildfires, they're mostly in the dark. But that is changing starting today. NPR's Lauren Sommer reports. LAUREN SOMMER, BYLINE: In 1991, Tom Grossman got a pretty tough assignment. He was on a search and rescue team that was called in when the Oakland Hills fire destroyed more than 3,000 homes. TOM GROSSMAN: It looks like a war zone, right? It's flattened. Everything is burned. SOMMER: He and his team combed the rubble for human remains. In all, 25 people died in the fire. Fast forward to two decades later and Grossman found himself looking for a new home in the Oakland Hills. GROSSMAN: You're buying a house around here, you're in a bidding war. So we put bids on multiple houses and lost all of them. SOMMER: But they got lucky. GROSSMAN: This is our house up here in the Oakland Hills. SOMMER: His home is on a steep hillside covered in trees. And it's only a few miles from where the Oakland Hills fire burned, a connection Grossman didn't make at the time. GROSSMAN: Oh, we totally didn't make that connection. We were just going, oh, my God, another freaking bidding war. KELLY POHL: Most folks don't know very much about their wildfire risk when they're thinking about buying a home or moving. SOMMER: Kelly Pohl is associate director of Headwaters Economics, a land use think tank. She says homeowners can only find out their wildfire risk if it's been mapped and only a handful of states have done that. POHL: It's definitely a patchwork. Some communities have that level of mapping, but very few do. SOMMER: On a national scale, the federal government has mapped flood risk for more than 50 years. But its wildfire maps aren't detailed enough to be used for individual properties. Now the private sector is making those maps. MATTHEW EBY: This will be the first look that the country has at property specific risk from wildfire. And the results are going to be surprising for some folks, to say the least. SOMMER: Matthew Eby is executive director of First Street Foundation, a nonprofit climate research group. His team ran complex computer models to map the wildfire risk for houses in the lower 48. Satellite imagery helped them figure out what the vegetation and roof materials look like. And then they calculated how that risk will change over the next 30 years as the climate gets hotter. EBY: And what we see is that in some areas, that risk will double, triple, quadruple. And in areas that really have high levels of risk already, like California, we see almost a 50% increase. SOMMER: Their map show that 20% of homes are at risk. That information will be shown on home listings at realtor. com and eventually other real estate websites. Eby says the hope is that seeing wildfire info on the same page as remodeled kitchen photos will help buyers understand how climate change could affect the biggest purchase of their lives. That may not dissuade all buyers. There is a national housing shortage. But Kelly Pohl says, it could still be valuable. POHL: We're not going to be able to stop all wildfires. And we already live in these places that have a lot of risk. So we need to think about how we can become better fire-adapted and build our homes and communities safer. SOMMER: There's a lot homeowners can do to reduce the chance their house will burn, like cutting back flammable vegetation or changing a roof to be fire resistant. In the Oakland Hills, that's something Tom Grossman has been working on. (SOUNDBITE OF GRAVEL CRUNCHING)SOMMER: He put gravel down around his house where wood mulch used to be. GROSSMAN: We used to think, wow, plants, vegetation, trees. No, it's all fuel.

(SOUNDBITE OF DROP ELECTRIC'S \"WAKING UP TO THE FIRE\")ADRIAN MA, HOST:  This is THE INDICATOR FROM PLANET MONEY. I'm Adrian Ma. DARIAN WOODS, HOST:  And I'm Darian Woods. Today, we hit a grave milestone for the U. S. - a million recorded deaths from COVID-19. That's 1 in 330 Americans recorded as dead from the disease. It's a really hard number to wrap your head around. MA: And all through the pandemic, there have been a group of people who have basically been stuck to their laptops trying to help us make sense of these numbers - data people. WOODS: Yeah, like the Johns Hopkins tracker, which has the numbers that NPR follows. MA: There were also models and forecasts coming out of places like the University of Washington. But out of all these websites and charts, one of the first was built with a specific question in mind - after the terrifying images from Wuhan, will my country be next? WOODS: And the chart that I was refreshing every single day was made by the British newspaper the Financial Times. This chart had the classic FT salmon-colored background, and it showed these colorful lines rising and rising. It was how many COVID cases various countries had. MA: Today on the show, an interview with its author, one of the best COVID data journalists in the business. We sit down with John Burn-Murdoch from the Financial Times, and we learn how he creates such compelling charts to cut through these confusing times and what lessons we can all learn about how to communicate fast-moving numbers. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MA: In March 2020, we really didn't know a lot about the new coronavirus. We didn't know why some countries like Italy and Iran were ravaged by COVID deaths, but there were other countries like Japan and South Korea which seemed to be able to contain the disease. It was hard to tell what was going to happen next. WOODS: Yeah, they were really scary months. And around that time, a data journalist with the Financial Times, John Burn-Murdoch, got an email. JOHN BURN-MURDOCH: The big question from everyone west of Italy, essentially, was, are we going to be next? And so a reporter colleague of mine actually just sent me an email one day essentially asking that; saying, you know, do we have any data that would allow us to answer that question? WOODS: At the time, people were trying to figure out what was happening. If you can remember back, there was chatter invoking cultural factors, like maybe Italian households have more mixed-generation families and that was responsible for their high death rates, or maybe the virus will go away in hot weather. We were really grasping at straws. MA: But John Burn-Murdoch did not want to look at straws. He wanted to look at the data. But then again, a chart just, like, plotting COVID cases in a given country over time - that was not terribly insightful. BURN-MURDOCH: You would see a line that gets steeper and steeper and steeper and steeper. And, you know, it could sort of almost become vertical if things continued indefinitely. WOODS: It's going to shoot up like a rocket anytime soon. BURN-MURDOCH: Exactly, exactly. WOODS: And that's where one of my favorite mathematics tricks comes in - the logarithmic scale, or the log for short, which essentially just squashes out that exponential curve so that you can see subtle changes in the spread of the virus more easily. MA: And aside from scaling the charts in an easy-to-read way, John also thought long and hard about how charts were titled. BURN-MURDOCH: What should the headline be? What we try to do at the FT in terms of how we use text in our charts is to say, this is something you can read. This is for you. Here's the key message. And now that you've seen that, here's what that looks like in a chart. MA: So the charts would be written in this conversational way. Like, a chart title might even be a sentence, like Italy and Spain's daily death tolls are falling. In the U. K. and U. S. , daily deaths may be plateauing. But even though John published a well-thought-out chart updated daily with a clear title, there would still be people with a lot of questions. So John set up a specific email address for people with questions about the COVID charts. BURN-MURDOCH: There would be so many questions - hundreds, thousands of questions from people wanting a little bit of clarification or wanting to know what was happening in their country or how to interpret something, people with feedback on the charts pointing us to datasets that we weren't aware of, that kind of thing. So I think just we could all learn from that idea of really seeing a story as just part of an ongoing communication rather than something we just sort of broadcast out and then walk off from. WOODS: Your output during 2020 especially was just phenomenal, and I was a little bit concerned about your sleep. So how many hours of sleep were you getting around that time? BURN-MURDOCH: Another good question. I think I was doing OK. But, you know, it would eat into the evenings. And yeah, that was the sort of rhythm of the first couple of months. And then as more and more other organizations started doing some of that heavy aggregation work - places like Johns Hopkins University, like Our World in Data - there were increasingly ways that we could sort of automate some of our data collection and visualization process. MA: With those charts automated more, John had time to hopefully sleep, but also time to answer new questions - like by April 2020, how many people were really dying from COVID? BURN-MURDOCH: We had a reporter for the Financial Times file a story from Ecuador talking about the numbers of coffins piling up on the streets and vultures circling overhead. And this was at a time when the reported numbers of COVID deaths from Ecuador were in the single or double figures. And it was clear that for whatever reason, the reported numbers weren't capturing the full extent. And fundamentally, in almost all cases, what was happening was the testing infrastructure in a lot of countries was only capturing a tiny percentage of the people who had been infected. And indeed, we found, particularly in some of those Latin American countries, the number of people who had died in those early months relative to what you would expect in a normal year, that excess, that gap between the observed and the expected, completely dwarfed the numbers that had been reported. MA: This is a concept known as excess mortality, which we have seen nearly everywhere. BURN-MURDOCH: So it was just very clear that because of the inability to test everyone, this concept of excess mortality was going to be a critical statistic to use to make sure we could get as close as possible to a sort of apples to apples comparison of death rates across the world. WOODS: We're around a million deaths in the U. S. recorded as having died of COVID. What do you think the real number is? BURN-MURDOCH: In the Financial Times' excess mortality statistics, we have the U. S. at around 1. 2 million as of the start of April. So that would suggest somewhere in the region of a 20% undercount. WOODS: So why do you think there's roughly a 20% undercount in the U. S. ? BURN-MURDOCH: I think a lot of this comes back to the fact that not everyone was being tested in the early parts of the pandemic, and therefore, you could have had thousands of deaths taking place where that person hadn't had a positive test. Therefore, they don't appear as an official COVID death, but they very much are someone who wouldn't have died had there not been a pandemic. WOODS: Yeah, gosh, it's sobering statistics. I mean, there is the saying that one death is a tragedy and a million deaths is a statistic. And do you at all feel that way? BURN-MURDOCH: I do think it can be a bit numbing. So I think, yeah, it's something we should always be aware of and really try and draw out what really matters at any given time rather than just assuming a big number will do it. WOODS: There are new variants coming all the time it seems, and we know unfortunately this is probably not going to be the last pandemic. What kind of changes or what would really help you policy-wise in the U. S. to kind of help you with your numbers in the future? BURN-MURDOCH: I would love to have one day some system where the way this stuff was reported was standardized. WOODS: Across all the different states. BURN-MURDOCH: Exactly, or even, you know, beyond that, even internationally. Because, you know, if we look at how countries report economic data, for example, in Europe, it's all standardized to a sufficient degree that it can then be collated and cleaned and compared like for like, and, you know, it would be amazing if a model like that could be applied to things like infectious disease surveillance. WOODS: Stepping back, how important do you think the numbers have been in saving lives over the last couple of years? BURN-MURDOCH: I think anyone would struggle to put a hard number on that. It's the combination of policy and the media and individual behavior and what the virus itself is doing that causes case numbers to rise and fall. I think charts clearly do matter, clearly do cut through and have an impact, but they're just one small part of this sort of much broader societal approach and sort of take almost on the virus at any given time.

We sit down with John Burn-Murdoch from the Financial Times, and we learn how he creates such compelling charts to cut through these confusing times and what lessons we can all learn about how to communicate fast-moving numbers. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MA: In March 2020, we really didn't know a lot about the new coronavirus. We didn't know why some countries like Italy and Iran were ravaged by COVID deaths, but there were other countries like Japan and South Korea which seemed to be able to contain the disease. It was hard to tell what was going to happen next. WOODS: Yeah, they were really scary months. And around that time, a data journalist with the Financial Times, John Burn-Murdoch, got an email. JOHN BURN-MURDOCH: The big question from everyone west of Italy, essentially, was, are we going to be next? And so a reporter colleague of mine actually just sent me an email one day essentially asking that; saying, you know, do we have any data that would allow us to answer that question? WOODS: At the time, people were trying to figure out what was happening. If you can remember back, there was chatter invoking cultural factors, like maybe Italian households have more mixed-generation families and that was responsible for their high death rates, or maybe the virus will go away in hot weather. We were really grasping at straws. MA: But John Burn-Murdoch did not want to look at straws. He wanted to look at the data. But then again, a chart just, like, plotting COVID cases in a given country over time - that was not terribly insightful. BURN-MURDOCH: You would see a line that gets steeper and steeper and steeper and steeper. And, you know, it could sort of almost become vertical if things continued indefinitely. WOODS: It's going to shoot up like a rocket anytime soon. BURN-MURDOCH: Exactly, exactly. WOODS: And that's where one of my favorite mathematics tricks comes in - the logarithmic scale, or the log for short, which essentially just squashes out that exponential curve so that you can see subtle changes in the spread of the virus more easily. MA: And aside from scaling the charts in an easy-to-read way, John also thought long and hard about how charts were titled. BURN-MURDOCH: What should the headline be? What we try to do at the FT in terms of how we use text in our charts is to say, this is something you can read. This is for you. Here's the key message. And now that you've seen that, here's what that looks like in a chart. MA: So the charts would be written in this conversational way. Like, a chart title might even be a sentence, like Italy and Spain's daily death tolls are falling. In the U. K. and U. S. , daily deaths may be plateauing. But even though John published a well-thought-out chart updated daily with a clear title, there would still be people with a lot of questions. So John set up a specific email address for people with questions about the COVID charts. BURN-MURDOCH: There would be so many questions - hundreds, thousands of questions from people wanting a little bit of clarification or wanting to know what was happening in their country or how to interpret something, people with feedback on the charts pointing us to datasets that we weren't aware of, that kind of thing. So I think just we could all learn from that idea of really seeing a story as just part of an ongoing communication rather than something we just sort of broadcast out and then walk off from. WOODS: Your output during 2020 especially was just phenomenal, and I was a little bit concerned about your sleep. So how many hours of sleep were you getting around that time? BURN-MURDOCH: Another good question. I think I was doing OK. But, you know, it would eat into the evenings. And yeah, that was the sort of rhythm of the first couple of months. And then as more and more other organizations started doing some of that heavy aggregation work - places like Johns Hopkins University, like Our World in Data - there were increasingly ways that we could sort of automate some of our data collection and visualization process. MA: With those charts automated more, John had time to hopefully sleep, but also time to answer new questions - like by April 2020, how many people were really dying from COVID? BURN-MURDOCH: We had a reporter for the Financial Times file a story from Ecuador talking about the numbers of coffins piling up on the streets and vultures circling overhead. And this was at a time when the reported numbers of COVID deaths from Ecuador were in the single or double figures. And it was clear that for whatever reason, the reported numbers weren't capturing the full extent. And fundamentally, in almost all cases, what was happening was the testing infrastructure in a lot of countries was only capturing a tiny percentage of the people who had been infected. And indeed, we found, particularly in some of those Latin American countries, the number of people who had died in those early months relative to what you would expect in a normal year, that excess, that gap between the observed and the expected, completely dwarfed the numbers that had been reported. MA: This is a concept known as excess mortality, which we have seen nearly everywhere. BURN-MURDOCH: So it was just very clear that because of the inability to test everyone, this concept of excess mortality was going to be a critical statistic to use to make sure we could get as close as possible to a sort of apples to apples comparison of death rates across the world. WOODS: We're around a million deaths in the U. S. recorded as having died of COVID. What do you think the real number is? BURN-MURDOCH: In the Financial Times' excess mortality statistics, we have the U. S. at around 1. 2 million as of the start of April. So that would suggest somewhere in the region of a 20% undercount. WOODS: So why do you think there's roughly a 20% undercount in the U. S. ? BURN-MURDOCH: I think a lot of this comes back to the fact that not everyone was being tested in the early parts of the pandemic, and therefore, you could have had thousands of deaths taking place where that person hadn't had a positive test. Therefore, they don't appear as an official COVID death, but they very much are someone who wouldn't have died had there not been a pandemic. WOODS: Yeah, gosh, it's sobering statistics. I mean, there is the saying that one death is a tragedy and a million deaths is a statistic. And do you at all feel that way? BURN-MURDOCH: I do think it can be a bit numbing. So I think, yeah, it's something we should always be aware of and really try and draw out what really matters at any given time rather than just assuming a big number will do it. WOODS: There are new variants coming all the time it seems, and we know unfortunately this is probably not going to be the last pandemic. What kind of changes or what would really help you policy-wise in the U. S. to kind of help you with your numbers in the future? BURN-MURDOCH: I would love to have one day some system where the way this stuff was reported was standardized. WOODS: Across all the different states. BURN-MURDOCH: Exactly, or even, you know, beyond that, even internationally. Because, you know, if we look at how countries report economic data, for example, in Europe, it's all standardized to a sufficient degree that it can then be collated and cleaned and compared like for like, and, you know, it would be amazing if a model like that could be applied to things like infectious disease surveillance. WOODS: Stepping back, how important do you think the numbers have been in saving lives over the last couple of years? BURN-MURDOCH: I think anyone would struggle to put a hard number on that. It's the combination of policy and the media and individual behavior and what the virus itself is doing that causes case numbers to rise and fall. I think charts clearly do matter, clearly do cut through and have an impact, but they're just one small part of this sort of much broader societal approach and sort of take almost on the virus at any given time.

EMMA JACOBS, BYLINE: Forestry research technician Grace Smith uses a long, pointed planting tool called a dibble to open a wedge in the ground big enough for a tree sapling. GRACE SMITH: Super handy - so essentially using these planting bars to open up enough soil underneath to be able to get these roots deep enough down. JACOBS: Smith is working 10-hour days to get ankle-high pine, cedar and red spruce trees settled in test plots in this National Wildlife Refuge before the weather gets too hot. JEREMY GOETZ: Hey, Grace, Grace. TONY D'AMATO: Grace, you got trouble over there. GOETZ: Is that deer? JACOBS: Visiting today is her boss, University of Vermont scientist Tony D'Amato, and refuge staff, including forester Jeremy Goetz, who says besides hungry deer who will snack on unprotected saplings, the refuge also provides habitat for grouse, Canada lynx and moose. Goetz says this land used to belong to a paper company. GOETZ: So these are the ruts from the last time this was harvested - the machine that they would use to pull the logs out. JACOBS: The company left a landscape of almost all young balsam fir trees. As the warm weather gets hotter and drier, if those conditions or new insects start killing balsam fir, D'Amato says that can mean a lot of dead trees. D'AMATO: And with climate change, the broadest things we want to maintain are the functions of forests that are so important. So it's clean air. It's carbon sequestration. It's water filtration. It's bird habitat. JACOBS: The new seedlings he's most excited about come from the central Appalachians in West Virginia, where the climate now looks a lot like what models project here by about 2070. Katy Barlow of The Nature Conservancy, which grew those red spruce saplings, says the species already grows in Vermont but will have small genetic differences, determining things like when they're growing season stops and starts. KATY BARLOW: The main portion of red spruce populations are up in northern New England, but in each of those places, these populations have adapted to their particular climate. JACOBS: If red spruce optimized for a West Virginia climate can survive in Vermont now, they could give this forest a head start in adapting to its future climate. Lots of experiments like this one are going on around the country to study what scientists call assisted migration. That term actually covers a whole range of activities from, in this case, moving a genotype within a tree's existing range to introducing an animal somewhere its species has never lived before. ABE MILLER-RUSHING: Thinking about actively moving species around is a little - well, it's a lot uncomfortable for us. JACOBS: Abe Miller-Rushing is science coordinator for Acadia National Park in Maine. MILLER-RUSHING: What might be the kind of unintended consequences? What diseases might we unintentionally move around if we move species around? JACOBS: He says, for a long time, the Park Service has supported hands-off management of federal lands. But he says not intervening as Acadia changes could mean its iconic evergreen forests get replaced by a shrub blend of invasive bushes. MILLER-RUSHING: Typically in a warming environment like this, we would expect trees from the south, things like oaks and hickory, to move up into the park. But the climate is changing faster than those species can keep up with. We've put a lot of obstacles in their way, like development. JACOBS: Cities and suburbs. Last year, the Park Service published a guide for staff considering assisted migration. Miller-Rushing helped write it. So did Mark Schwartz, a researcher at the University of California, Davis. He says forest managers helping species migrate face a lot of uncertainty. MARK SCHWARTZ: It turns out, though, it might be the best bad idea that we have. And as a consequence, we may need to engage it more and more. JACOBS: More more data from experiments like the one in Vermont will help. D'AMATO: There's always that challenge, too, like, the personal versus the scientific. JACOBS: Tony D'Amato says he doesn't want to see familiar species disappear from northern forests.

But in space, the two sides are getting along, according to NASA administrator Bill Nelson. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BILL NELSON: I see nothing that has interrupted that professional relationship, no matter how awful Putin is conducting a war with such disastrous results in Ukraine.

It was designed so that each side literally needed the other to survive. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NELSON: The Russians have the propulsion, the attitude control. The U. S. has the electricity production. BRUMFIEL: That co-dependence has kept the collaboration going. Even Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea was not enough to shake the partnership. But this full-scale war in Ukraine may be different. It's already ruptured another longstanding Russian collaboration with the European Space Agency, or ESA.

But making hydrogen isn't always clean or cheap. Reid Frazier from the Allegheny Front reports. REID FRAZIER: Every few days, big white tubes filled with hydrogen are trucked to the Long Ridge Energy gas-fired power plant in rural southeast Ohio. Long Ridge CEO Bo Wholey says his company recently started blending a small amount of hydrogen - no more than 5% - to power the generators. BO WHOLEY: The market really shifted over the last couple of years in the conversation about clean energy. And we're really responding to what the market wants. FRAZIER: Eventually, Wholey wants to run the plant completely on hydrogen. That goal may be more attainable thanks to a big infrastructure law passed last year. It includes $8 billion for at least four hydrogen hubs to produce, store and use this combustible gas. Backers hope to land one of these hubs in this part of the Ohio River Valley. Mention hydrogen and some remember the Hindenburg disaster. But climate scientists see a replacement for fossil fuels in heavy industry. PAULINA JARAMILLO: I think hydrogen is crucial. FRAZIER: Paulina Jaramillo of Carnegie Mellon University says hydrogen can be a clean alternative for things like steel mills, fertilizer plants or shipping. Hydrogen can be made in a number of ways, each with its own color-coding system. There's gray hydrogen, how most hydrogen is made today - through heating up natural gas. This creates lots of carbon dioxide, the driving force in climate change. Blue hydrogen is when that CO2 is captured. The infrastructure bill mandates one blue hydrogen hub and another for green hydrogen. That's where renewable energy is used to extract hydrogen from water, so it gives off no carbon dioxide. Blue hydrogen still produces some CO2. And it relies on the natural gas system, which leaks methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas. That's why Julie McNamara with the Union of Concerned Scientists wants better methane safeguards on any federal funding for blue hydrogen. JULIE MCNAMARA: The government is now investing $8 billion to catalyze an industry that might not be clean at all if they don't get this right. FRAZIER: Even with questions about blue hydrogen, some scientists think it's still worth pursuing. GOTZ VESER: So this is one of the technologies we're investigating here. FRAZIER: In his lab at the University of Pittsburgh, chemical engineer Gotz Veser shows off an experiment one of his grad students is running. Inside a glass case, tubes run natural gas through a chamber that produces hydrogen. And instead of CO2, the byproduct is solid carbon - easier to dispose of, no carbon capture necessary. VESER: If you really want to remove that carbon, you can literally just dump it anywhere. FRAZIER: Veser says one advantage of blue hydrogen is it relies on technology that's been around for decades. And the politically powerful fossil fuel industry supports it, says Bridget van Dorsten, an analyst with the firm Wood Mackenzie. She says that makes it more likely than a full push for green hydrogen. She asked rhetorically, would the oil and gas industry simply go along with green hydrogen and abandon its own infrastructure? BRIDGET VAN DORSTEN: Or do you think that they would prefer, hey, you know what? That investment that you made in all of that infrastructure, you can keep it. You just got to pay more to, like, add carbon capture onto it - because I think they'd be interested in the latter. FRAZIER: One key blue hydrogen supporter is Senator Joe Manchin. Manchin blocked Biden's climate agenda last year, but said he might accept a compromise bill with clean energy tax credits, including one for hydrogen. Manchin has also made it clear he wants one of the hydrogen hubs built in his home state of West Virginia. For NPR News, I'm Reid Frazier in Pittsburgh. A MARTINEZ, HOST:   To curb climate change, the Biden administration wants to build hydrogen hubs. But making hydrogen isn't always clean or cheap. Reid Frazier from the Allegheny Front reports. REID FRAZIER: Every few days, big white tubes filled with hydrogen are trucked to the Long Ridge Energy gas-fired power plant in rural southeast Ohio. Long Ridge CEO Bo Wholey says his company recently started blending a small amount of hydrogen - no more than 5% - to power the generators. BO WHOLEY: The market really shifted over the last couple of years in the conversation about clean energy. And we're really responding to what the market wants. FRAZIER: Eventually, Wholey wants to run the plant completely on hydrogen. That goal may be more attainable thanks to a big infrastructure law passed last year. It includes $8 billion for at least four hydrogen hubs to produce, store and use this combustible gas. Backers hope to land one of these hubs in this part of the Ohio River Valley. Mention hydrogen and some remember the Hindenburg disaster. But climate scientists see a replacement for fossil fuels in heavy industry. PAULINA JARAMILLO: I think hydrogen is crucial. FRAZIER: Paulina Jaramillo of Carnegie Mellon University says hydrogen can be a clean alternative for things like steel mills, fertilizer plants or shipping. Hydrogen can be made in a number of ways, each with its own color-coding system. There's gray hydrogen, how most hydrogen is made today - through heating up natural gas. This creates lots of carbon dioxide, the driving force in climate change. Blue hydrogen is when that CO2 is captured. The infrastructure bill mandates one blue hydrogen hub and another for green hydrogen. That's where renewable energy is used to extract hydrogen from water, so it gives off no carbon dioxide. Blue hydrogen still produces some CO2. And it relies on the natural gas system, which leaks methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas. That's why Julie McNamara with the Union of Concerned Scientists wants better methane safeguards on any federal funding for blue hydrogen. JULIE MCNAMARA: The government is now investing $8 billion to catalyze an industry that might not be clean at all if they don't get this right. FRAZIER: Even with questions about blue hydrogen, some scientists think it's still worth pursuing. GOTZ VESER: So this is one of the technologies we're investigating here. FRAZIER: In his lab at the University of Pittsburgh, chemical engineer Gotz Veser shows off an experiment one of his grad students is running. Inside a glass case, tubes run natural gas through a chamber that produces hydrogen. And instead of CO2, the byproduct is solid carbon - easier to dispose of, no carbon capture necessary. VESER: If you really want to remove that carbon, you can literally just dump it anywhere. FRAZIER: Veser says one advantage of blue hydrogen is it relies on technology that's been around for decades. And the politically powerful fossil fuel industry supports it, says Bridget van Dorsten, an analyst with the firm Wood Mackenzie. She says that makes it more likely than a full push for green hydrogen. She asked rhetorically, would the oil and gas industry simply go along with green hydrogen and abandon its own infrastructure? BRIDGET VAN DORSTEN: Or do you think that they would prefer, hey, you know what? That investment that you made in all of that infrastructure, you can keep it. You just got to pay more to, like, add carbon capture onto it - because I think they'd be interested in the latter. FRAZIER: One key blue hydrogen supporter is Senator Joe Manchin.

But what does outer space sound like? Maybe this. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SIMON: That's what NASA calls a sonification - not the literal sounds from the cosmos, but a translation to help blind and low-vision people appreciate the majesty of space. It's a project that Dr. Kim Arcand has been working on at NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. She joins us now. Dr. Arcand, thanks so much for being with us. KIM ARCAND: Hi. Thanks so much for having me. SIMON: That was a clip that purports to sound like the Milky Way Galaxy, right? ARCAND: Right. Exactly. That is, like, the inner 400 light-years around our Milky Way's sort of downtown area. So what we're doing is we're actually taking light and translating it into sound as a way to make our data a little bit more approachable. SIMON: How does that work? ARCAND: So we actually take the data, and we extrapolate the information that we need. We really pay attention to the scientific story to make sure that conversion from light into sound is something that will make sense for people, particularly for people who are blind or low vision. SIMON: So they would hear the differences between different galaxies. ARCAND: Right, exactly. So our Milky Way galaxy - that inner region that we just heard - that is this really sort of energetic area where there's just a whole lot of frenetic activity taking place. But if we're looking at a different galaxy that perhaps is a little bit more calm, a little bit more restive at its core, it could sound completely different. SIMON: You're a visual scientist, I gather. What moved you to accomplish this in sounds? ARCAND: Actually, I think I started out the first, like, say, 10 years of my career really paying attention to only the visual and just realized that I had done a complete disservice to people who were either not visual learners or for people who are blind or low vision. And so during the pandemic, particularly, I reached out to some colleagues who specialize in this sort of area of data sonification, Matt Russo and Andrew Santaguida, to be able to work with them to take data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Hubble Space Telescope and translate it into a way that could be heard in a really exciting new form. SIMON: Well, I can't wait to hear another example. This is, I'm told, \"Pillars Of Creation. \"(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SIMON: Oh, my gosh. ARCAND: (Laughter). SIMON: That really reaches inside, doesn't it? ARCAND: I hope so. I think those soundscapes that are being created can really bring a bit of emotion to data that could seem pretty esoteric and abstract otherwise. In what we just heard, we're listening now to, like, a baby stellar nursery, so these tall columns of gas and dust where stars are forming. And you're listening to the interplay between the X-ray information and the optical information. And it's really trying to give you a bit of the text. SIMON: Wow. Now, I'm told that earlier this month, you and your team developed not just a sonic representation of an image, but - get ready for this, everyone - the actual sound of a black hole. (SOUNDBITE OF BLACK HOLE)SIMON: Please, Dr. Arcand, forgive me for this. I'm dazzled. But am I just going to hear this in a \"Star Wars\" film? ARCAND: (Laughter) So for some reason, most of the people who have heard this have responded it either sounds like a horror movie soundtrack or something from a Hans Zimmer score. But yeah, what we're listening to is essentially a re-sonification, so a data sonification of an actual sound wave in this cluster of galaxies where there is this supermassive black hole at the core that's sort of burping and sending out all of these waves, if you will. And the scientists who originally studied the data were able to find out what the note is. And it was essentially a B-flat, about 57 octaves below middle C. So we've taken that sound that the universe was singing and then just brought it back up into the range of human hearing because we certainly can't hear 57 octaves below middle C. SIMON: Oh, my word. Does our Earth send out a sound? And I hope it's not by B. J. Leiderman, who does our theme music. But please go ahead. ARCAND: There are sounds for sure that we are making as humans on Earth. However, what's interesting about sonifications like this of Perseus that are far, far away is that there is actually a medium for those sound waves to travel through, whereas here in the solar system, we don't have that medium. So in this cluster of galaxies, there's this hot gas, and that pressure wave is moving through them. And that's how the sound waves are being formed. SIMON: I'm just stupefied, I've got to tell you. ARCAND: That's great, I guess (laughter). SIMON: Dr. Kim Arcand is a visualization scientist at NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. And by the way, you can find some of these sonifications at our website, npr. org. Thank you so much, and keep listening to the stars. ARCAND: Thanks so much.

NPR's Joe Palca looks at how an AI program with a weird name is being used to search for whales. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Yes, deep squeak doesn't sound like a whale detector, but we'll get to that. In 2018, Elizabeth Ferguson founded a company called Ocean Science Analytics. It's a company that, among other things, helps people building offshore wind farms track the impact of their projects on marine mammals to make sure the projects aren't harming the whales. ELIZABETH FERGUSON: Any kind of operations that happen in the ocean require there be some monitoring or mitigation. PALCA: Now, you could just go out in a boat and look for whales and dolphins. But that doesn't always give you an accurate count. FERGUSON: Because some species are difficult to see at the surface. Or they spend a long time at depth. PALCA: So she wanted to find a better way. Enter Kevin Coffey. KEVIN COFFEY: I am a behavioral neuroscientist. PALCA: In particular, Coffey is a behavioral neuroscientist who studies the calls rats and mice make when they're stressed. Those calls are different from the sounds they make when they're not stressed. A lot of his projects are long term, so that means listening to many hours of audio to analyze the rodent calls. But he and colleagues at the University of Washington had an idea. COFFEY: You take the audio signal. You turn it into an image. And then you can see the calls by eye. PALCA: And recently, artificial intelligence programs have gotten very good at image analysis using what's called deep learning. So Coffey created a program that was good at recognizing the visual representations of the mouse calls and classifying them as stressed or non-stressed - thus, deep squeak was born. Elizabeth Ferguson figured that what works for mice in cages could be modified to work with marine mammals in the ocean. FERGUSON: So I'm going to share my screen here. PALCA: Ferguson is showing me on a computer the results of using her modified version of deep squeak on about 2 1/2 hours of audio recorded off the Oregon coast. FERGUSON: Anything that has a green box around it is something that was detected in the network. PALCA: The calls are coming from whales and dolphins within a couple miles of the shore. She can see them thanks to her reworked version of deep squeak. FERGUSON: So you can see that there's definitely a wide range of calls and a high degree of variability in those calls. But it's still done a pretty good job of detecting them. PALCA: Ferguson recently presented details of her modifications to deep squeak at a meeting of the Acoustical Society of America. But really, is deep squeak the name you want to use for a program that detects whale calls? FERGUSON: No, we're going to change it. PALCA: To what? FERGUSON: So we're going to be calling it deep waves. Should we find something better? Do you have any suggestions? PALCA: I'm working on it. Joe Palca, NPR News.

And I promise this is the last joke I'm going to make. What do rocket science and stand-up comedy have in common? It's our next speaker, Kasha Patel. Kasha applies the scientific method to stand up and uses humor to teach. Here she is on the TED stage in 2018. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KASHA PATEL: I write jokes about science, and I've been doing comedy for a while. And I realized stand-up comedy actually has a lot of qualities that can make science more approachable for people who think it's boring or don't care. How do I know this? Well, I've actually analyzed over 500 of my jokes, and it took a long time. I had one volunteer helper, and bless his soul because not all of my performances were winners, and even I cringed at them. One of the things that I measured was how long a premise took to take and then how many seconds of laughter it produced. I did this to figure out what kind of impact the joke had on the audience. I also categorized my jokes as science or not science. And it turns out that only a quarter of my jokes are science jokes. But this small percentage actually had the biggest impact out of all of my jokes. If you looked at my jokes overall, my science jokes actually performed 40% better than my non-science jokes. I wanted to know why. Why did the audience respond so much to my science jokes? In my experience, people aren't really that enthused to hear science jokes when they're about to have a night on the town. I remember one time I was in this obscure gig that was at a seafood restaurant turned comedy club, and people were so rowdy because it was their Friday night. And I went up there, and I said as cheerily as I could, I said, who likes science? (SOUNDBITE OF MICROPHONE FEEDBACK)PATEL: And there was this one guy in the front row who said, do we look like a crowd that likes science? And I was like, what did I get myself into? But during the day time, I actually work as a science writer at NASA. So I saw this, and I took the challenge. OK, sir, I get why you don't like science. It can be overwhelming, and you don't know what is true. But my job as a science writer is to help distinguish the difference between fact versus myth. Fact - you can get chlamydia if a koala scratches you. Myth - your wife will believe you. (LAUGHTER)PATEL: Some men were clapping too hard at that. This is actually my most successful science joke. It has a short promise, and it produces about 7 1/2 seconds of laughter on average. I wanted to sneak attack the audience with science. If I can use comedy to draw you in, then yeah, I'll slide in a science fact or two. I know what you're thinking. People want to go to a comedy club, not a lecture. But I actually think the emphasis of truth in my jokes actually makes my comedy more special and memorable. And I think it's because science and comedy are kind of an odd couple, right? We trust scientists. The Pew Research Center did a survey that said public confidence in scientists is actually high compared to other groups. And then on the other hand, you have comedians, who are known for stretching the truth to get a laugh. Think about Rodney Dangerfield. Now, when you combine these two things, though, I think they actually have a lot of traits that can help each other out. Science is about the discovery of truth, and my comedy is about communicating that truth while entertaining. I read about a recent research project where these students actually created this condom that can detect an STD. It's actually coated with antibodies. So when it comes into contact with an STD, it actually glows a different color. So if it's green, it might be herpes. If it's yellow, it might be chlamydia. If it's blue, it might be on too tight. (LAUGHTER)PATEL: So many people Google that promise and then come up to me afterwards and say, Kasha, your joke was correct. If I can entertain and inform you, that's great. But if I can motivate you to look up something that I said later, I feel like that's a win for the science field. When I show people my charts and my Excel sheets, people say, oh, you're doing the science of science comedy. And even though I'm not a practicing scientist, I realize that I am using a lot of the critical thinking skills that I used when I was a chemistry student. Finding a way to combine your passions can lead to a unique path and help you find the most authentic version of yourself. I combined science and comedy, then found my preferred method of science communication and how I can be a science comedian. Find yours. Thank you.

But I actually think the emphasis of truth in my jokes actually makes my comedy more special and memorable. And I think it's because science and comedy are kind of an odd couple, right? We trust scientists. The Pew Research Center did a survey that said public confidence in scientists is actually high compared to other groups. And then on the other hand, you have comedians, who are known for stretching the truth to get a laugh. Think about Rodney Dangerfield. Now, when you combine these two things, though, I think they actually have a lot of traits that can help each other out. Science is about the discovery of truth, and my comedy is about communicating that truth while entertaining. I read about a recent research project where these students actually created this condom that can detect an STD. It's actually coated with antibodies. So when it comes into contact with an STD, it actually glows a different color. So if it's green, it might be herpes. If it's yellow, it might be chlamydia. If it's blue, it might be on too tight. (LAUGHTER) PATEL: So many people Google that promise and then come up to me afterwards and say, Kasha, your joke was correct. If I can entertain and inform you, that's great. But if I can motivate you to look up something that I said later, I feel like that's a win for the science field. When I show people my charts and my Excel sheets, people say, oh, you're doing the science of science comedy. And even though I'm not a practicing scientist, I realize that I am using a lot of the critical thinking skills that I used when I was a chemistry student. Finding a way to combine your passions can lead to a unique path and help you find the most authentic version of yourself. I combined science and comedy, then found my preferred method of science communication and how I can be a science comedian. Find yours. Thank you.

LEIF KARLSTROM: In 2008, there started an eruptive episode where there was an active lava lake at the summit. BRUMFIEL: That's Leif Karlstrom, a professor of volcanology at the University of Oregon. As the volcano's crater filled with lava, rocks from the wall began falling into it. KARLSTROM: These are big rock falls - like, bus-sized. BRUMFIEL: These giant boulders would plunge into the lava lake several times a week for the next 10 years. And scientists were listening to the splashes they made as they fell.

But what's even cooler is that the song actually reveals something important about the makeup of the molten rock deep inside the volcano. Karlstrom says the notes of the song depend on how many bubbles of gas are in the liquid rock. KARLSTROM: The speed of sound of a bubbly mixture is actually very significantly different.

As NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports, scientists have just found a small population of polar bears in Greenland with an unusual lifestyle that might offer them some protection. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The coast of southeast Greenland is a lonely, rugged place. There's no towns or gas stations. It's just not a place that people usually go. KRISTIN LAIDRE: It's a coastline with huge mountain peaks, lots of winds, extreme conditions, lots of fog. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Kristin Laidre is with the University of Washington. She says you wouldn't expect to find many polar bears there either because it's not a place with much sea ice. LAIDRE: Sea ice is the most important thing for a polar bear. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It's their hunting grounds. They roam the sea's frozen surface and kill seals that come up to breathing holes in the ice. Laidre says in southeast Greenland, the sea ice only lasts for about 100 days a year. LAIDRE: It disappears in May, and that's really early. It's not enough time for a polar bear to get fat enough and survive. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But she and her colleagues were doing a survey of polar bears all up and down the coast. So they helicopter out to this remote place. It's a two-hour flight. LAIDRE: We arrived in these fjords, very isolated fjords, and expected to find, you know, one or two bears here and there. But there were a lot of bears in these fjords. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It turns out these bears were exploiting another source of ice. Where they live, freshwater glaciers come down from the land into the water. Chunks of these glaciers break off and create what's called an ice melange, a jumble of icebergs and snow that congeal together into an irregular surface. LAIDRE: It can have, you know, water in between the pieces or it can be all crushed together. But bears can walk across this melange. If it's loose, they can swim in the melange and hunt seals that pull themselves out and sit on the freshwater ice. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Polar bears that have learned to live this way are homebodies. They stick to their familiar fjords. In the journal Science, the researchers say the few hundred polar bears in southeast Greenland are the most genetically isolated group of polar bears in the world. And Laidre says they're special in another way. They might be able to hold out as climate change melts sea ice all over the world. LAIDRE: Glacial ice basically might help small numbers of bears survive for longer periods under climate warming. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But that doesn't mean we can stop worrying about polar bears because the vast majority rely entirely on sea ice. They don't have access to this kind of glacier ice. IAN STIRLING: There are very few areas in which this kind of habitat is available. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Ian Stirling is a polar bear biologist at the University of Alberta. He says even if these fjords with glaciers offer a potential refuge for some polar bears in a warming world, that refuge will be only temporary. STIRLING: Because if the climate continues to warm as it's projected to do, these areas, too, will become of no use or not enough use to the bears. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says the glaciers will melt and eventually shrink so much that their ends won't reach the water. By that point, there will be so little ice of any kind that polar bears will probably be long gone. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

Philip Connors works in a watchtower in New Mexico. PHILIP CONNORS: The essence of the job is to stay awake and look out the window and alert the dispatch office at the first sign of smoke. INSKEEP: He's seen a lot of smoke this year over the Gila National Forest. Connors is a writer and National Forest Service fire watcher. That makes him a witness to a fire that has burned more than 320,000 acres. When we called, it took us 20 hours to get through on his flip phone. CONNORS: It seems to be the signal is affected by smoke somewhat and certainly by windy and stormy days. INSKEEP: It was worth the wait to hear him tell what it's like to watch his world burn. He stands in a little room atop a 35-foot tower. What are you seeing right now? CONNORS: Well, in the distance to my south, I'm seeing a little bit of smoke off the Black Fire, which is the largest fire this forest has ever seen. And in my foreground, I'm actually living inside that burn scar which burned a few weeks ago. INSKEEP: It's his second tower this season. He had to flee the first one when the flames got too close. CONNORS: The fire started on May 13. I had a few weeks to kind of watch it grow. Every day I would sit and watch this very large megafire cross 200,000 acres, then 250,000 acres. Yeah. It was kind of an exercise in psychic disturbance to live in the presence of this thing that I felt certain would eventually force me to flee. You know, even at night, you start dreaming about it 'cause it's just this presence lurking on your horizon. I would climb the tower after dark and have a look. And seven, eight, nine miles of my northern horizon would be glowing with fire. So I had the time to pack up all my essential belongings. And then myself and my relief lookout, who was there at the same time - we hiked out together. And, yeah, I'm not ashamed to admit I hugged a few trees before I left - some of my favorites. INSKEEP: What is this forest like in the parts that are not burned? CONNORS: Well, in a way, it's many forests, depending on its elevation. The highest elevations, around 10,000 feet above sea level and above, have historically been mixed conifer - spruce and pine and fir intermingled with aspen. Below that, there there's a kind of ponderosa pine and oak belt. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO STATIC)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Inaudible). CONNORS: Oh, there goes my radio. I'm going to turn that down. INSKEEP: That's OK. If you've got to take a call, take a call. CONNORS: No, I don't have to take that call. That's just me eavesdropping on everybody else who's talking in the forest. INSKEEP: Are you hearing anything of interest? CONNORS: This morning, it's mostly people just going in service and telling dispatch where they're going to be so they can be tracked. And things will really start to swing into gear here in the next hour. INSKEEP: Go on. CONNORS: So, yeah, what's happening in the highest elevations - the mixed conifer, typically burned in stand replacement fires that burned a few hundred or a few thousand acres - now we're seeing it going away in much, much bigger chunks. And so that forest is sort of vanishing from this part of the world. INSKEEP: You're answering one of the questions that was on my mind. You're telling me that fire is part of the normal life cycle of the forest, but that things are changing over the 20 years that you've been watching this forest. CONNORS: Yeah, that's true. My arrival in this part of the world coincided very neatly with the onset of the worst megadrought we have seen in more than a thousand years, according to scientists who study tree rings. So what had been a relatively stable climate in this part of the world - for several hundred years, at least - started to change. It's just so dry. When I showed up for my first day of work in late March and hiked up to my tower at 10,000 feet, I noticed big, old, green, still-living trees that had just toppled over at the root. Their roots didn't have the tensile strength to grip the earth anymore because they had no moisture in them. INSKEEP: So that explains why so much can burn now. CONNORS: Yeah. Even at the highest elevations, the biggest, oldest trees that once upon a time were snowed in in late March - they're tinder. I was digging for moisture in the holes created by the root balls of those tipped-over trees. And I couldn't find any in the soil. In fact, I could snap off the root tendrils and use them as kindling in my woodstove. As I was hiking up the trail that first time to go open the tower, I just noticed that with every footstep, I was sending up little puffs of powder from the soil. And I had never seen that that time of year. INSKEEP: I can tell listening to you, this isn't just a job for you, is it? CONNORS: No, not after 20 years. In the beginning, I thought of it as a sort of paid writing retreat with good views. . . INSKEEP: (Laughter). CONNORS: . . . Which, indeed, it is. But, you know, over time, I really did fall in love with the place and all its creaturely life, from the salamanders, pocket gophers and tree frogs to the elk, deer and black bears. The place became sort of my citadel and my solace. And now it's almost like the tables are turned. It is in need of solace because big chunks of it are being transformed and going away. And I feel a deep sense of responsibility to hang in with it and observe the scars of the burn and how they heal and see what it wants to become next. INSKEEP: Well, Mr. Connors, thanks for taking the time to talk with us. CONNORS: Thank you, Steve. I enjoyed it.

And now, a team of scientists thinks it knows why. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports that their explanation offers some clues about the origins of human speech. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: This is a tale of two kinds of monkeys. The first is the macaque. It's larger and lives in Asia and North Africa. Christina Cerkevich at the University of Pittsburgh says when it comes to vocalizing, macaques are kind of limited. (SOUNDBITE OF MACAQUES VOCALIZING)CHRISTINA CERKEVICH: They don't seem to have a lot of control over their vocalizations. They don't change the pitch. They don't change the internal timing. A lot of times, their calls don't have syllables. HAMILTON: The second monkey is the marmoset. It's smaller and lives primarily in South America. Cerkevich says the vocal skills of marmosets are remarkable. (SOUNDBITE OF MARMOSETS VOCALIZING)CERKEVICH: These guys have wonderful control over their vocalizations. They'll change the pitch, get louder because somebody's far away. They'll change the timing so that if you keep artificially cutting them off, they'll wait for the noise to go away so they can get their message heard. HAMILTON: Both species have the same basic vocal tract, so the team figured the difference must be in how their brains control the vocal muscles. Cerkevich says the team decided to focus on one particular muscle in the larynx. CERKEVICH: It's this tiny little muscle, especially in the marmosets because they're very small. This muscle, when it contracts, it increases tension on the vocal cords so that the pitch goes up. HAMILTON: The team designed an experiment to identify the brain areas that control this tiny muscle. Peter Strick, a neurobiologist, says the experiment used a substance that follows the nerve pathways from muscle tissue to the brain. PETER STRICK: And so we said, look, if we inject the same muscle, we might be able to see what's changed in the marmoset that allows it to vocalize. HAMILTON: The experiment worked, and the results are published in the journal PNAS. The team found differences in two areas of the brain. One area seems to help shape a particular sound. The other appears to control the timing and sequence of sounds. Strick says, in both of these areas, the South American marmosets had many more brain cells sending signals to the tiny muscle in the larynx. STRICK: We believe that these two areas are really key in enabling marmoset complex vocalization. HAMILTON: These areas are separate from what's known as the primary motor cortex, which is involved in planning and executing all kinds of muscle movement. But Strick says the areas work together with the primary motor cortex to help a monkey vocalize. STRICK: In a sense, it has multiple separate computers running at the same time to deal with that complex task. HAMILTON: Strick says that's also true in people who devote a lot of brainpower to speech. STRICK: Speech is remarkably complex. You have to control breathing appropriately. You have to control your lips and your tongue and produce sound. HAMILTON: And you have to have very fine control of muscles in the larynx. Dr. Eddie Chang of the University of California, San Francisco, has spent years mapping the brain areas involved in human speech. EDDIE CHANG: What's been a missing piece of the puzzle in all of this is whether or not the part of the brain that controls the larynx is similar in other species, including some of our closest relatives - monkeys. HAMILTON: Chang says now it looks like that puzzle piece has been found. And he says the discovery of brain areas that give marmosets a vocal advantage over macaques could explain how humans took the next evolutionary step. CHANG: This new paper suggests that it's the elaboration of these parts of the brain that might have evolved for humans to speak and have language.

And because they've been put in so many things, they are now everywhere - in soil, in our drinking water, inside our bodies. We're talking about PFAS. The Environmental Protection Agency just revised its guidance about PFAS in drinking water. The agency is warning they could pose health risks if present at all. Well, let's bring in Arlene Blum to discuss. She's a biophysical chemist and the executive director of the Green Science Policy Institute. Welcome. ARLENE BLUM: Delighted to be here. KELLY: All right. So I'm trying to wrap my head around this. In a few sentences, give us the primer on what exactly PFAS are. BLUM: Well, PFAS are a class of thousands of chemicals. And I like to say they are both the best and the worst. They're the best in that they're very useful at keeping things dry, keeping grease out of things - they're slippery - keeping things moving. But they're the worst because, as you said, they never break down. And all the ones that have been studied have been found to be harmful. KELLY: I mentioned that they're in soil. They're in water. They're also in things - you said they're slippery - they're in things like nonstick pans, things like rain jackets. What else? BLUM: We're scientists who have studied PFAS. We tested cosmetics and found them in about half the cosmetics we tested, things like waterproof mascara, shiny lip gloss, shiny foundation. They used to be used in carpets for stain resistance, but the carpet industry has moved away from them, which is great. That was the biggest source of exposure for kids in the past. They're used in the outdoor industry a lot. So they can be very useful. But the good news is they're usually not necessary, and there usually are safer alternatives. KELLY: The EPA, as we mentioned, is warning that they pose health risks. It sounds like just about all of us would have been exposed to them. What kind of health risks are we talking? BLUM: So we do all have some PFAS in our body, unfortunately. And across the whole population, they increase the risk of certain kinds of cancer, some infertility. They can contribute to obesity, kidney disease. There's a whole wide range of health effects. They can adversely affect almost all of our organs. But that doesn't mean that everyone's going to get these effects. This is just across the population. KELLY: It's the range of things that could happen. So in terms of the way forward here, as you see it, the way forward is to keep them out of products going forward. So there's a role here for the government. There's also a huge role, it would seem, for the private sector. BLUM: Absolutely. And indeed, the carpet industry, for example, decided ahead of regulation to find better alternatives for carpets. The outdoor industry is on the path towards that. Food packaging - there have been a number of announcements that big fast-food companies are no longer having PFAS in their packaging. The cosmetics companies are moving away from it. So this is something where manufacturers can move faster than the government, but the possibility of government regulation definitely moves some forward. And it looks like there's legislation all over the United States, in the various states, proposing regulation on PFAS in food packaging and cosmetics, in textiles, in a wide range of products. KELLY: I'm thinking, I put on lipstick this morning. I had a nonstick pan sitting on my stove as I walked out. I mean, what can each of us do personally? What should we be thinking about doing to keep these things out of us, out of our lives? BLUM: Well, in terms of nonstick pans, the PFAS is used to make the nonstick pan, but the pan itself probably isn't going to be a problem. So - and it's the same with Gore-Tex. PFAS is used to make Gore-Tex, to make outdoor jackets. But when you're wearing it, it shouldn't be a health problem. However, the manufacturing of your Teflon pan and the Gore-Tex jacket is a big problem. So I like to tell people, you can wear your jacket, you can use your pan, but don't buy another one.

Now, scientists have one that's so big, it's visible to the naked eye. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports.

Jean-Marie Volland is with the Laboratory for Research in Complex Systems in California. He says each one can be about a centimeter long. JEAN-MARIE VOLLAND: The bacteria that we discovered have roughly the shape and the size of an eyelash, and yet it is a single bacterial cell.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   Bacteria are usually microscopic. Now, scientists have one that's so big, it's visible to the naked eye. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: These bacteria were found in the mangrove swamps of the Caribbean. They somehow attach themselves to sunken leaves. The bacteria look like white filaments or hairs. Jean-Marie Volland is with the Laboratory for Research in Complex Systems in California. He says each one can be about a centimeter long. JEAN-MARIE VOLLAND: The bacteria that we discovered have roughly the shape and the size of an eyelash, and yet it is a single bacterial cell.

So allow us to present you something extraordinary - the story of Fred. Fred was born somewhere in the Midwestern United States and likely spent much of his early life at home. When it was finally time to forge a path of his own, he said goodbye to his family and set off into the wild. JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  For the rest of his life, Fred roamed the plains of what is now Indiana. Every summer, he'd compete against other males for a mate. These competitions were violent, physical battles, and one summer, one of these fights brought Fred to an untimely end. Dead at 34 years old, Fred's body sank into the swampy earth. SHAPIRO: These days, Fred's skeleton is preserved in the Indiana State Museum. It's 9 feet tall and 25 feet long. His head alone weighs over 300 pounds. SUMMERS: Fred was a mastodon, also known as the Buesching mastodon, named after the family farm where his remains were found. He is a distant relative of the modern elephant. JOSH MILLER: So the Buesching mastodon was preserved in a swampy area, and those kind of environments are really conducive to excellent preservation. SHAPIRO: That's Josh Miller, a paleoecologist at the University of Cincinnati. He recently co-authored a paper studying much of Fred's life. The study is unique because it's a really detailed look into the life of an individual animal who lived such a long time ago. SUMMERS: You see, mastodons' tusks grow throughout their lives in distinct layers, kind of like the rings on a tree trunk. And since Fred's tusks were so well preserved. . . MILLER: You get a daily record of its behavior, of its landscape use and the season in which that tusk and (inaudible) was grown. SHAPIRO: Basically, the nutrients that build the layers of Fred's tusks can tell us where he was at different points in his life. The team specifically looked at variation in the elements oxygen and strontium. MILLER: So every element comes in different isotopes, kind of different flavors, if you will, of an isotope that are slightly - that weigh slightly more or slightly less. SUMMERS: Different isotope blends are unique to certain areas and seasons, and they're reflected in the local plants and water. So as Fred roamed the plains, the food he ate and the water he drank imprinted those unique isotope blends into his tusks. SHAPIRO: You can think of it kind of like a dated passport stamp. Each layer of Fred's tusk reflects where and when that piece grew. SUMMERS: And when he was young, Fred would have stuck close to home with his herd and grown a lot. MILLER: But there will be a year that the growth is really reduced. They just don't grow much that year. SUMMERS: That's the year Miller's analysis starts, and it is the first year Fred was fending for himself after getting kicked out of his herd. MILLER: And they're essentially just really obnoxious, and they - just getting in everyone's hair. They're kind of getting in the way. They're just not particularly helpful members of the herd. And at that point, the mom and the aunts will essentially boot that individual from that maternal herd. SHAPIRO: Then as an adult male, Fred would visit the same area in northeastern Indiana every summer, presumably to find a mate. And around this time in his life, Fred's tusks start to show some damage when rival male mastodons are competing for females. MILLER: They get in these huge battles where one or even both combatants may die. SHAPIRO: Their tusks are their primary weapons. And one summer, an opponent stabbed his tusk through Fred's skull and killed him. SUMMERS: Although he died over 13,000 years ago, Fred's legacy lives on in his tusks. You can visit him and pay your respects at the Indiana State Museum. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   It can be tough to reconstruct a life in detail after 13,000 years.

The Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, made history in 2012 when scientists used it to prove the existence of a particle called the Higgs boson and with it the secret behind what gives all particles mass. The LHC is a nearly 17-mile ring buried underground near Geneva, and after years on pause, scientists still have high hopes for what it can uncover. I spoke with Sarah Demers, a Yale physics professor who works at the LHC earlier, and I asked her what it is like to be underground when the machine is running. SARAH DEMERS: Well, I think it's always really cool, obviously, but I guess I'm biased. The truth is, when the Large Hadron Collider is running, we can't go underground. SUMMERS: Oh. DEMERS: We can't get near those collisions because the radioactivity is pretty high because of all of those particles that are being created. So we are safely 100 meters above the detectors and the collider and operating the control rooms here from the surface in the control rooms and satellite control rooms. SUMMERS: So as I understand it, this is the LHC's third run. What types of questions are scientists hoping to answer this time around? DEMERS: Well, at this point, we have the Higgs boson in hand. And so we're both trying to understand it better by making more careful measurements of the way it's produced and the way that it decays because we still have some open questions. You know, we've had the Higgs for a couple of years now. We've done some measurements, but we need more data in order to really complete the picture. At the same time, we're turning around and using the Higgs boson to go hunting for other physics questions that we have. We're thinking about the Higgs as a portal into exploring dark matter, as just one really exciting example. And also, we're using the fact that we're at higher energy in this run. We hit a world-breaking 13. 6 TeV, so that's the highest that we've managed in the world in terms of human-made collisions. And so that higher energy gives us more space to explore. I like to think about it as if you're climbing up a mountain. The higher up you're able to go, the further you can see. And so from our perspective in particle physics, we just reached a new peak. SUMMERS: You mentioned dark matter and hoping to learn a little bit more about that. What do you hope to uncover about dark matter on this run? And I should ask, what is dark matter? DEMERS: So I wish we knew. And I think even if we made just one step forward in trying to answer that question, we would be making real progress. It's interesting how we can understand so much about the matter that surround us. We've catalogued it, categorized it. We can make predictions about it and measurements of it so well. But when we look out into the universe, we have multiple pieces of evidence that tell us we're missing a huge amount of matter out there. We know so little about it. It's invisible to us. We've labeled it dark matter. We have fundamental questions about it. Is it even particles? If it is particles, what kinds of masses do they have? And when we think about trying to explore and answer questions about dark matter at the LHC, I think it would be making tremendous progress just to even rule out some things, to be able to say, ah, OK, well, it's not that.

Octopuses branched away from humans on the evolutionary tree some 500 million years ago. To find out how their intelligence works, we're going to turn the mics over to Emily Kwong and Aaron Scott, co-hosts of Short Wave, NPR's daily science podcast, for a story about octopus researcher Dominic Sivitilli. EMILY KWONG, BYLINE: OK, Aaron, many a tale has been written about how ridiculously intelligent octopuses are. My favorite thing about them is how they're escape artists. So the aquarium near where I grew up as a kid, they had this problem of fish disappearing from their tanks in the night. AARON SCOTT, BYLINE: OK. KWONG: And after a few days of this through, like, nighttime vision hallway cameras, the staff figured out it was the octopus. . . SCOTT: No way. KWONG: . . . Sneaking out of its tank for a snack and then sneaking back in before the lights were turned on. SCOTT: That sounds like an episode of \"Octopus CSI. \" I love it. KWONG: Seriously. SCOTT: So this story begins last summer when cameraperson extraordinaire Stephani Gordon and I headed up to meet Dominic at Friday Harbor Laboratories on San Juan Island. KWONG: Awesome. I am sensing a field trip. Set the scene, my friend. SCOTT: Dominic's building is on the edge of this beautiful harbor. He's set up in a room that has tanks running along the walls. And there are pipes that pump seawater through them. And then each of the octopuses has its own tank full of rocks and shells and toys, like floating plastic dinosaurs - plus, to your point, full-on security measures. DOMINIC SIVITILLI: Cover on. . . (SOUNDBITE OF COVER SNAPPING)SIVITILLI: . . . Fully on and then bricks. So the bricks might be overkill, but I sleep better. SCOTT: So when we arrive, he actually removes the bricks from one of those tanks and takes the lid off. And it's this magical moment where he places his fingers on the surface of the water, and then this small octopus kind of rises out of the corner and stretches out her arms to actually touch his fingertips. SIVITILLI: This is Lizbeth. She is our giant Pacific octopus. She can grow to being well over 20 feet long if she spread her arms out. KWONG: Wow. SCOTT: Yeah. I mean, it's - right now, she's not anywhere close to that. She's just, like, a foot across. But it was so cool to watch as her suckers kind of work their way across his fingertips. SIVITILLI: Our fingertip might have 400 mechanical receptors. A given sucker might have tens of thousands of mechanical and chemical receptors on it. So each sucker is many times more mechanically sensitive than one of our fingertips is and also has the benefit of being able to taste and smell the world around it. And it's able to do this because each sucker has a local computation center where most of this information is being processed. SCOTT: You can think about it like her suckers can feel, they can taste, they can smell, and he says each sucker basically has, like, a little mini brain of its own. Each of those little processing centers link together to create these thick bands of neurons that run the entire lengths of the octopuses' arms. KWONG: Whoa. SCOTT: You know, we humans are so brain centric. Everything we perceive and process about the world is routed through this central command center in our craniums but not so the octopus. SIVITILLI: It's really hard to imagine how these animals are experiencing the world. Their nervous system and their perceptions and sensory systems are built entirely differently from ours. While most of our neurons are in our brain, most of their neurons exist beyond their central brain in their arms and suckers. SCOTT: Dominic calls it distributed intelligence. KWONG: Distributed intelligence sounds like it radiates kind of throughout their body. So if the suckers in arms are thinking for themselves, how does that explain octopus behavior? SCOTT: That's exactly what Dominic is trying to figure out. He created this puzzle box that has rows of crevices, and he put some shrimp into one of those crevices and then sets the box on the wall of the tank so that we can see into it, but all Lizbeth can see is a black box with a couple of holes in it. So she crawls under the box, and she starts running her arms into the holes. SIVITILLI: Come on. You can do it. SCOTT: Her suckers are exploring each crevice, probing for a snack. And then finally, one sucker finds the shrimp and all of its neighboring suckers wrap around the shrimp bit and then pull it up to her mouth. STEPHANI GORDON, BYLINE: She got it. SIVITILLI: She got it? GORDON: Yeah. SIVITILLI: Excellent. Good girl. The octopus' mind at network. There seems to be a strategy that the sucker is used to coordinate. So if one sucker finds something of interest, then it will tell the next sucker over, hey, I found something of interest. And that sucker will turn toward that prey. KWONG: Oh. So neurologically, there's almost, like, a sucker chain reaction happening in these arms. SCOTT: Yeah, exactly. That's a great way to think about it. I mean, he's analyzed hours of footage of different octopuses all doing this test. And what it looks like is that the more suckers get involved, the stronger a signal they all send to the brain. Think of it kind of like upvoting something on Reddit. KWONG: I'm really curious then, Aaron, about how such a complex system even evolved. SCOTT: In Dominic's eye, it has a little bit to do with the fact that, you know, we simple vertebrates with our skeletons, we can only move our arms and our fingers and our legs so many ways. But an octopus can bend its eight arms with just almost infinite freedom, twisting and winding. And then you add all that sensory information that each sucker is receiving, and you think about the fact that they hunt in the dark, so they are not even able to see things. So it's like they're really being guided by each sucker as they explore these rock walls or coral reefs. And you can see there is a lot of information to process all at once. SIVITILLI: What the brain will do is send out a very generalized command to multiple arms at once and let the arms kind of figure it out from there. And the suckers with all their chemo receptors, all their mechanical receptors, are very well equipped to then find interesting objects out there in the world. SCOTT: And it seems like in the lab, Dominic himself is one of the most interesting things for them to find. SIVITILLI: If they see me around the lab, they will approach, go to the edge of their tank and just watch the interesting things that are happening. Here I am studying them, and yet they seem to also somehow be studying me in their own way. In my time studying the octopus, I really learned to appreciate that there are many varieties of intelligence out in the world and possibly the universe. It's not about how intelligent they are. It's about how they are intelligent. KWONG: I love this point so much, Aaron, because it's such a part of science to help us understand things on its terms, right? SCOTT: Absolutely. Absolutely. And I really think that's the point that Dominic is trying to make with this research.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:   The mind of the octopus is so different from human intelligence that some people are studying it to see what alien intelligence might look like. Octopuses branched away from humans on the evolutionary tree some 500 million years ago. To find out how their intelligence works, we're going to turn the mics over to Emily Kwong and Aaron Scott, co-hosts of Short Wave, NPR's daily science podcast, for a story about octopus researcher Dominic Sivitilli. EMILY KWONG, BYLINE: OK, Aaron, many a tale has been written about how ridiculously intelligent octopuses are. My favorite thing about them is how they're escape artists. So the aquarium near where I grew up as a kid, they had this problem of fish disappearing from their tanks in the night. AARON SCOTT, BYLINE: OK. KWONG: And after a few days of this through, like, nighttime vision hallway cameras, the staff figured out it was the octopus. . . SCOTT: No way. KWONG: . . . Sneaking out of its tank for a snack and then sneaking back in before the lights were turned on. SCOTT: That sounds like an episode of \"Octopus CSI. \" I love it. KWONG: Seriously. SCOTT: So this story begins last summer when cameraperson extraordinaire Stephani Gordon and I headed up to meet Dominic at Friday Harbor Laboratories on San Juan Island. KWONG: Awesome. I am sensing a field trip. Set the scene, my friend. SCOTT: Dominic's building is on the edge of this beautiful harbor. He's set up in a room that has tanks running along the walls. And there are pipes that pump seawater through them. And then each of the octopuses has its own tank full of rocks and shells and toys, like floating plastic dinosaurs - plus, to your point, full-on security measures. DOMINIC SIVITILLI: Cover on. . . (SOUNDBITE OF COVER SNAPPING) SIVITILLI: . . . Fully on and then bricks. So the bricks might be overkill, but I sleep better. SCOTT: So when we arrive, he actually removes the bricks from one of those tanks and takes the lid off. And it's this magical moment where he places his fingers on the surface of the water, and then this small octopus kind of rises out of the corner and stretches out her arms to actually touch his fingertips. SIVITILLI: This is Lizbeth. She is our giant Pacific octopus. She can grow to being well over 20 feet long if she spread her arms out. KWONG: Wow. SCOTT: Yeah. I mean, it's - right now, she's not anywhere close to that. She's just, like, a foot across. But it was so cool to watch as her suckers kind of work their way across his fingertips. SIVITILLI: Our fingertip might have 400 mechanical receptors. A given sucker might have tens of thousands of mechanical and chemical receptors on it. So each sucker is many times more mechanically sensitive than one of our fingertips is and also has the benefit of being able to taste and smell the world around it. And it's able to do this because each sucker has a local computation center where most of this information is being processed. SCOTT: You can think about it like her suckers can feel, they can taste, they can smell, and he says each sucker basically has, like, a little mini brain of its own. Each of those little processing centers link together to create these thick bands of neurons that run the entire lengths of the octopuses' arms. KWONG: Whoa. SCOTT: You know, we humans are so brain centric. Everything we perceive and process about the world is routed through this central command center in our craniums but not so the octopus. SIVITILLI: It's really hard to imagine how these animals are experiencing the world. Their nervous system and their perceptions and sensory systems are built entirely differently from ours. While most of our neurons are in our brain, most of their neurons exist beyond their central brain in their arms and suckers. SCOTT: Dominic calls it distributed intelligence.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Parents like Cassandra Schwartz are finally exhaling. SCHWARTZ: My baby's been in a grocery store one time in her entire life. We don't go anywhere that's inside with her, you know, that's not, like, a friend's house that we fully vetted or her day care. So, like, I'm excited to be able to, like, if I need to go grocery shopping and take her with me, I can do that. CHANG: She can do that, she says, because COVID vaccines are now available for kids under 5 years old. It took a minute to get here. Vaccines for children ages 5 through 11 were authorized last fall. Then weeks and months slowly ticked by. And parents of toddlers like Schwartz wondered, hey, remember us? SCHWARTZ: When everyone else could get vaccinated and the under-5s couldn't, and the rest of the - in the whole, it felt like state and local and national governments were like, all right, cool. Everyone's vaccinated. No more mask mandates. We don't have to be as careful, don't have to worry about social distancing. And it just felt like we were forgotten. CHANG: Well, finally, last month, the FDA authorized vaccines for children between 6 months and 5 years of age, and shots started going into tiny arms and thighs. But parents like Schwartz, who are eager to get their very young kids vaccinated, are a minority because, you see, only about 1 in 5 parents plan to vaccinate their children as soon as they are eligible, according to a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Almost 40% of parents say they want to wait a bit longer to see how the vaccine works for others. More than half of the people polled say they just don't have enough information. CONSIDER THIS - COVID vaccines for kids under 5 are rolling out. Lots of parents have questions, and we will try to answer some of yours. From NPR, I'm Ailsa Chang. It's Wednesday, July 6. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. COVID vaccines are now authorized for kids between the ages of 6 months and 5 years old, which is great news for the parents who are eager to get their kids vaccinated. But for many, this news means more questions. And joining me now to answer some of those questions are NPR health correspondent Rob Stein and Dr. Nia Heard-Garris. She's a pediatrician and researcher at Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University and at the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. Welcome to both of you. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Nice to be here. NIA HEARD-GARRIS: Thanks for having us. CHANG: Thanks for being here. Rob, I want to start with an update on the whole campaign to vaccinate this very last group to become eligible. We're talking about kids younger than age 5. How are things going so far in that campaign? STEIN: Well, you know, the federal government hasn't released any hard numbers yet about how many kids have gotten the shots. But the early indication so far is that the demand for the shots for these littlest ones is living up to expectations, which frankly, were very low. That's because most parents of kids ages 5 to 11 still haven't gotten their kids vaccinated, even though they've been eligible for months. And the parents of the younger kids are even more reluctant. The pace at which states started off ordering the vaccine was pretty lackluster. So the Biden administration has been warning that it will take a while to convince most parents to get their shots for their little kids. That said, there definitely are many parents out there who have been waiting for a long time for these vaccines and have been eager to get their kids vaccinated. CHANG: What about this whole choice between Pfizer versus Moderna for really young kids? Is there a preference that you have? HEARD-GARRIS: That's a great question. This question keeps coming up for a lot of my patients. We really think that the Pfizer and Moderna have equal efficacy, meaning that both are effective, and they're both going to keep your kids safe against COVID - you know, at least prevent them from being in the hospital and getting really, really sick. So, bottom line - just go get whatever you can. They're both safe and effective and approved by the FDA. CHANG: I'm going to start now with Amanda Gray from Bangor, Maine. She writes, quote, \"I feel like I have been waiting two-plus years for this news that I could finally get my daughter vaccinated. And here I am thinking, maybe it's best to wait? The current COVID strain is not as fatal, especially in young children. Do I wait to vaccinate till right before back to school? Should I wait until a more aggressive and lethal strain circulates, perhaps this winter? I don't want to vaccinate her now and then have a bad strain occur in six months when the efficacy has waned, and she's not eligible for a booster. \" OK. Dr. Heard-Garris, what do you say to Amanda Gray? HEARD-GARRIS: I say, Amanda, I hear you. I get it. You're not alone. But I want to let you know, you know, omicron may appear less virulent because there's a fair number of people that have already been exposed to COVID. They've had COVID, or they've been vaccinated against it. So it actually offers some protection to the rest of us. And so that's why it seems less virulent. But for a child that has not been exposed or vaccinated to COVID, that's not true. And they're still at risk. So they still face the same risk of mortality, and they still face the same risk of hospitalization. So I would say, Amanda, don't wait. Go get your kid vaccinated. We've been waiting for two years. Go out. Do it. CHANG: Next step is Felix Ortiz from Canton, Ohio. FELIX ORTIZ: Why is it taking long for some of the local health departments, as well as children's hospitals, to be able to get the right doses? I have contacted both of mine here, and I've been told that it might be until early July before they're able to get the right doses. CHANG: OK. So for the parents who want to just go and get their kids vaccinated, they can. Rob, can you answer this question from Felix Ortiz? STEIN: You know, Ailsa, the answer to that one isn't entirely clear, and the explanation probably varies, you know, from place to place around the country. But one reason I've been hearing for why the vaccines aren't more widely available is the way they've been packaged, believe it or not. They come in 10-dose vials that have to be used within 12 hours. And many doctors are apparently hesitant to order the vaccines because they don't have 10 kids to vaccinate every time they puncture a vial. And they're afraid they'll end up wasting a lot of vaccine. I talked about this with Claire Hannan. She's the executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers. CLAIRE HANNAN: It's been a lot of education of providers and encouraging them that it's OK to waste vaccine. They need to worry more about wasting an opportunity to vaccinate than to worry about wasting the nine remaining doses in the vial. STEIN: You know, that's because there's plenty of vaccine available. And even though COVID-19 doesn't necessarily pose as great a risk to kids as it does to older people, you know, as we heard, it still can be quite dangerous. CHANG: OK. Let's now move on to a question from Allison Cloyd from Arvada, Colo. She writes, quote, \"with the efficacy of Moderna being so much lower for the under-5 crowd and Pfizer having a very small sample size, is it worth having my 3-year-old vaccinated if she tested positive for COVID in February? How does that calculus change knowing we have a 10-week-old baby who can't be vaccinated yet but is breastfed - parentheses, I'm triple vaxxed - and was still in utero when I had COVID at that same time? \" Dr. Heard-Garris, there's a lot to unpack here, but maybe you can give some advice to Allison here. HEARD-GARRIS: Yeah. I - you know, I think it's a good question, especially since, you know, her child, Allison's child, was actually positive for COVID-19 in February. And even though she had it in February, her immunity is starting to wane. So we say about, you know, 30 to 90 days after getting a COVID-19 infection is an ideal time. It's still safe. You can immediately get your COVID-19 vaccination right after. But if you want to wait some time, you know, 30 to 90 days is still the safe window. She's well beyond that now. So I think it's time for Allison's child to get vaccinated, especially because she has a vulnerable 10-week-old at home. CHANG: Well, Rob, here's a question from Grace Cummings of Lexington Park, Md. She writes, quote, \"my local health department has been very slow to issue information about vaccines for under 5. And they're also slow to acquire and distribute them. I'm taking my daughter to our neighboring county to get vaccinated this week. I've heard this is similar in other areas and it wasn't this slow for the adult vaccines. I also saw a lot more information and outreach for the adult and older child vaccines. Why the slow rollout here? \" What do you think, Rob? STEIN: Yeah, so part of it may be that issue about wasting vaccine that we talked about earlier, but part of it may be that individual, you know, counties aren't being as aggressive about promoting vaccine as the federal government would like, you know. And another reason is the emphasis for these very young children has been on administering the vaccine more at pediatrician's offices instead of going through, like, big mass vaccination clinics or even pharmacies, you know. So some pharmacies are giving out the shots but not nearly as many as during the earlier booster and vaccine campaigns. And that's because many pharmacies aren't set up to give shots to these little kids and because parents are more comfortable bringing babies and toddlers to their own pediatricians, who they know and they trust. And the thinking is, you know, many kids may end up getting the shots when the kids come in for other things, like their routine vaccinations or well-child visits. HEARD-GARRIS: For people that are really frustrated with how things are going in their county, there's not a better time than right now to work with your public health leaders and policymakers to ask why. And so that the next time this happens or the next time we're faced with a pandemic - hopefully not anytime soon - we have these relationships and inroads built and can really push our policymakers to give - to put kids first and to make sure that they have the same access, if not better access, than adults and older kids have. I think it's really important to think about how we start building these relationships, how we hold policymakers accountable. CHANG: All right. And our final listener question is from Vadnais Heights, Minn. HOPE SAVARIA: Hello. My name is Hope Savaria. And my question is, what sorts of side effects should we expect for the 24 hours or so after the vaccine? Will it be similar to those seen in adults, mild flu-like symptoms? And is there anything we can do to help mitigate these effects, such as administering children's Tylenol or ibuprofen before the vaccine? CHANG: I remember I had a really swollen left armpit. What do you think, Dr. Heard-Garris? What kind of symptoms will we see in these young kids? HEARD-GARRIS: So sometimes, kids will have fever. They'll have some pain at the site and redness and swelling at that injection site. And that's really similar to some of the other vaccines that we typically give. They also might be irritable, and they might be fussy. They might be a little bit more sleepy or not want to eat as much as they normally eat. All, again, pretty, pretty common. But specifically with the COVID-19 vaccines, they might have some swelling. So just like you, Ailsa, had some swelling under your arms and others might have swelling in their groin (ph) area. And that's just where their lymph nodes are. So the lymph nodes kind of get bigger and swollen. It's a sign that your body's responding. So that lymph node swelling is a little bit more common in older kids we've seen and adults. But your small child might develop it, too. So it's important to be aware of that. And I would say these symptoms show up one to three days kind of after they've gotten their shot. So if it's weeks and weeks later, I would advise parents to see their pediatrician. And then the other question, you know, about Tylenol and ibuprofen - and there's a lot of controversy about this. I don't think in the scientific world we really know if you give Tylenol and ibuprofen before you give the vaccine, if that will actually lessen your body's response to the vaccine. So I would say to wait until your child develops any symptoms. So if they have fever or if they're not feeling well, then go ahead and give the Tylenol and ibuprofen. But let the vaccine do what it does best before you give those medicines. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: That was NPR health correspondent Rob Stein and Dr. Nia Heard-Garris.

STEIN: You know, that's because there's plenty of vaccine available. And even though COVID-19 doesn't necessarily pose as great a risk to kids as it does to older people, you know, as we heard, it still can be quite dangerous. CHANG: OK. Let's now move on to a question from Allison Cloyd from Arvada, Colo. She writes, quote, \"with the efficacy of Moderna being so much lower for the under-5 crowd and Pfizer having a very small sample size, is it worth having my 3-year-old vaccinated if she tested positive for COVID in February? How does that calculus change knowing we have a 10-week-old baby who can't be vaccinated yet but is breastfed - parentheses, I'm triple vaxxed - and was still in utero when I had COVID at that same time? \" Dr. Heard-Garris, there's a lot to unpack here, but maybe you can give some advice to Allison here. HEARD-GARRIS: Yeah. I - you know, I think it's a good question, especially since, you know, her child, Allison's child, was actually positive for COVID-19 in February. And even though she had it in February, her immunity is starting to wane. So we say about, you know, 30 to 90 days after getting a COVID-19 infection is an ideal time. It's still safe. You can immediately get your COVID-19 vaccination right after. But if you want to wait some time, you know, 30 to 90 days is still the safe window. She's well beyond that now. So I think it's time for Allison's child to get vaccinated, especially because she has a vulnerable 10-week-old at home. CHANG: Well, Rob, here's a question from Grace Cummings of Lexington Park, Md. She writes, quote, \"my local health department has been very slow to issue information about vaccines for under 5. And they're also slow to acquire and distribute them. I'm taking my daughter to our neighboring county to get vaccinated this week. I've heard this is similar in other areas and it wasn't this slow for the adult vaccines. I also saw a lot more information and outreach for the adult and older child vaccines. Why the slow rollout here? \" What do you think, Rob? STEIN: Yeah, so part of it may be that issue about wasting vaccine that we talked about earlier, but part of it may be that individual, you know, counties aren't being as aggressive about promoting vaccine as the federal government would like, you know. And another reason is the emphasis for these very young children has been on administering the vaccine more at pediatrician's offices instead of going through, like, big mass vaccination clinics or even pharmacies, you know. So some pharmacies are giving out the shots but not nearly as many as during the earlier booster and vaccine campaigns. And that's because many pharmacies aren't set up to give shots to these little kids and because parents are more comfortable bringing babies and toddlers to their own pediatricians, who they know and they trust. And the thinking is, you know, many kids may end up getting the shots when the kids come in for other things, like their routine vaccinations or well-child visits. HEARD-GARRIS: For people that are really frustrated with how things are going in their county, there's not a better time than right now to work with your public health leaders and policymakers to ask why. And so that the next time this happens or the next time we're faced with a pandemic - hopefully not anytime soon - we have these relationships and inroads built and can really push our policymakers to give - to put kids first and to make sure that they have the same access, if not better access, than adults and older kids have. I think it's really important to think about how we start building these relationships, how we hold policymakers accountable. CHANG: All right. And our final listener question is from Vadnais Heights, Minn. HOPE SAVARIA: Hello. My name is Hope Savaria. And my question is, what sorts of side effects should we expect for the 24 hours or so after the vaccine? Will it be similar to those seen in adults, mild flu-like symptoms? And is there anything we can do to help mitigate these effects, such as administering children's Tylenol or ibuprofen before the vaccine? CHANG: I remember I had a really swollen left armpit. What do you think, Dr. Heard-Garris? What kind of symptoms will we see in these young kids? HEARD-GARRIS: So sometimes, kids will have fever. They'll have some pain at the site and redness and swelling at that injection site. And that's really similar to some of the other vaccines that we typically give. They also might be irritable, and they might be fussy. They might be a little bit more sleepy or not want to eat as much as they normally eat. All, again, pretty, pretty common. But specifically with the COVID-19 vaccines, they might have some swelling. So just like you, Ailsa, had some swelling under your arms and others might have swelling in their groin (ph) area. And that's just where their lymph nodes are. So the lymph nodes kind of get bigger and swollen. It's a sign that your body's responding. So that lymph node swelling is a little bit more common in older kids we've seen and adults. But your small child might develop it, too. So it's important to be aware of that. And I would say these symptoms show up one to three days kind of after they've gotten their shot. So if it's weeks and weeks later, I would advise parents to see their pediatrician. And then the other question, you know, about Tylenol and ibuprofen - and there's a lot of controversy about this. I don't think in the scientific world we really know if you give Tylenol and ibuprofen before you give the vaccine, if that will actually lessen your body's response to the vaccine. So I would say to wait until your child develops any symptoms. So if they have fever or if they're not feeling well, then go ahead and give the Tylenol and ibuprofen. But let the vaccine do what it does best before you give those medicines. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CHANG: That was NPR health correspondent Rob Stein and Dr. Nia Heard-Garris.

And because nuclear energy is increasingly in demand, America's only operating uranium mill is getting busier. But an Indigenous community nearby is worried about health impacts because regulators say the mill is violating air quality rules. From member station KSJD, Lucas Brady Woods reports. LUCAS BRADY WOODS, BYLINE: On a dirt road cutting through the sandstone canyon country of southeast Utah, Michael Badback points out Bears Ears National Monument in the distance, a sacred site for the region's Indigenous people. MICHAEL BADBACK: Look at the beauty in the rocks, in the formations of the hills. It's pure out here. WOODS: Badback, a member of the Ute Mountain Ute tribe, lives nearby. Across the road, the White Mesa uranium mill produces fuel for nuclear reactors. A barbed wire fence here is fixed with signs that say, caution, radioactive materials. BADBACK: We don't know the health issues of what comes along with this stuff. A lot of our people mysteriously started getting sick. And kids and other adults started to have asthma like they never had before. WOODS: Definitively linking health conditions to environmental contamination is notoriously difficult. Energy Fuels resources, the company that owns and operates the mill, says there's nothing to worry about. Energy Fuels' Vice President Curtis Moore. CURTIS MOORE: You will see very big fluctuations in naturally occurring elements. That's what we're seeing right now. WOODS: Moore says the mill takes precautions. Radioactive waste is stored in specially designed cells that are covered with water to keep radiation from escaping into the air. But for at least two years, material in one 40-acre cell at the mill has been above water. In December, the EPA told Energy Fuels they need to cover it. Moore says the company is filling the pond. But. . . MOORE: It'll take several months because we can only pull so much water out of our wells at a certain rate. WOODS: Moore says the uncovered waste poses no danger and that filling up the pond during the ongoing drought is a waste of water. Scott Clow, environmental director for the Ute Mountain Ute tribe, disagrees. SCOTT CLOW: At the end of the day, the Clean Air Act says that that thing should have liquid on it. WOODS: The EPA says the waste cell could be emitting up to 10 times more radiation than if it were under water. And Clow says the tribe is worried about water contamination, too. The Grand Canyon Trust, an advocacy group, says samples from the aquifer below the mill have concerning levels of acidity and contaminants like chloroform. CLOW: It's clearly not natural. Those are orders of magnitude higher than what we would find in there naturally. WOODS: Energy Fuels says the contamination is naturally occurring and not significant enough to impact people's health. State regulators agree and have loosened rules, allowing Energy Fuels to store increasingly radioactive waste onsite, including waste imported from overseas. Clow and members of the tribe he works for want more information. CLOW: I am aware that there have been increased levels of cancer. We don't have any evidence tying that to the mill at this point, but we have our concerns. WOODS: The tribe is launching a study to look for evidence. In June, the EPA gave them a grant to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on that. Results are expected in 2025. Michael Badback and other Ute Mountain Utes who live at White Mesa would be happier if the mill wasn't there at all. BADBACK: This is still virgin land. And we want it to remain that way. That's how our ancestors used to walk on this land. And we want to walk on it like that and leave the legacy up to our grandchildren. WOODS: But demand for fuel for U.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Light from the oldest galaxies, the oldest documented light in the history of the universe, from over 13 billion - let me say that again - 13 billion years ago. It's hard to even fathom. CHANG: The glittering constellation of galaxies is a snapshot taken by NASA's new James Webb Space Telescope. Joining us now to discuss that image and what it all means is NPR's Joe Palca. Hey, Joe. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Hi there, Ailsa. CHANG: Hey. OK, so first of all, can you just tell me about this image? Like, what does it show exactly? PALCA: Well, it shows a field of objects, many of which are galaxies, and it's just stunning the number that you can see in the image. Now, these are very, very faint and very far away, and as the president said, some of them may, in fact, be as old as 13 or even older than 13 billion years. CHANG: Wow. PALCA: So it's quite a remarkable thing. Now, there's something also that's interesting. This picture was taken by the James Webb Space Telescope, as you said, this new one. And it still took 12 1/2 hours to capture this very, very, very faint light. But it would have taken the NASA Hubble Space Telescope weeks to make the same image, so scientists are thrilled. CHANG: OK, so what can an image like this new one tell us about the early universe, you think? PALCA: Well, one image by itself, not all that much - a lot, but not as much as you might like. But it allows astronomers like Caitlin Casey to build up a better picture of the large structure of the universe. She's an astronomer at the University of Texas at Austin who's going to be using the telescope to hunt for even more of these galaxies. She wants to understand what the early universe would look like if you could step back and get a - kind of a bird's-eye view of it. CAITLIN CASEY: If you zoom all the way out, the entire universe looks like, you know, something like the interior of a sponge, where there are these, like, little filaments and voids. And so what we really want to capture is that structure. CHANG: It's kind of blowing my mind that we're all living in this, like, giant universe-size sponge or something. What is it about the James Webb Space Telescope that gives scientists, you know, like, the ability to see these galaxies that other telescopes haven't been able to see? PALCA: Well, it's huge. It's got 18 segments to a giant mirror that's coated with gold. And it can see in the infrared, which is a wavelength of light that humans cannot see. And it's a longer wavelength in visible light. And to see it efficiently, you have to go into space where it's cold because warm objects tend to give off infrared light. Now, there's a reason you want a telescope that looks in the infrared because - this is important - the universe is expanding, and the light from those earliest objects is being stretched out. So even though it was light - visible when it started, it got stretched into the infrared. So if you want any chance of seeing it today, you have to have a telescope that can look in the infrared. CHANG: Wow. OK, so what are some of the other things that scientists hope to learn using this Webb telescope? PALCA: Well, they're going to be studying atmospheres of planets orbiting distant stars. They're going to be looking for places that might be capable of sustaining life. I spoke with Jean Turner at UCLA. She's studying massive stars that tend to hide behind interstellar dust, and an infrared telescope like JWST can see through that dust. But what she's really excited about is something she can't even predict. JEAN TURNER: What I love more than anything is seeing something unexpected. And that happens all the time, and I know it's going to happen with JWST. It's guaranteed. PALCA: So I think Turner is making a safe bet there because every time you get a new scientific instrument, you get findings you weren't expecting. CHANG: That is so cool. That is NPR's science correspondent Joe Palca. Thank you so much, Joe. PALCA: You're very welcome.

It accounts for more than half of all COVID infections. Its quick rise corresponds with an increase in reinfections and hospitalizations. NPR's Allison Aubrey has been looking into this and joins us this morning. Hi, Allison. ALLISON AUBREY, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: So is BA. 5 bringing us another surge? AUBREY: Well, at a time when people use rapid tests at home, it's hard to know just how many people are infected. But one indicator is that hospitalizations are rising. About 31,000 people are in the hospital with COVID right now across the country. Admissions are up about 5% compared to a week ago. And reinfections appear to be on the rise, too. Some people who got COVID this winter are getting it again. I spoke to Bob Wachter. He's a physician at UC San Francisco. He says BA. 5 is highly transmissible. And it manages to kind of sidestep, at least partially, some of the immunity from prior infections and vaccinations. BOB WACHTER: Not only is it more infectious, but your prior immunity doesn't count for as much as it used to. And that means that the old saw that I just had COVID a month ago and so I have COVID immunity superpowers, I'm not going to get it again, that no longer holds. AUBREY: That's not something any of us want to hear, right? Speaking as someone who just had COVID last month, I don't want it again. It felt pretty rotten. MARTIN: Right. So vaccines aren't good at fighting this. Our immunity isn't as good as it used to be. I mean, is this variant any more dangerous than previous strains? AUBREY: There's really no evidence that BA. 5 causes any more serious illness. And though many people are getting infected or reinfected, the impact of BA. 5 will not likely be on the scale of what we saw last winter. We will be able to manage it better. That's what infectious disease experts are telling me. I spoke to Anna Durbin, a physician at Johns Hopkins, about this. She says, you know, the combination of prior infection and vaccination, it is protective. And treatments are better. Last winter, we had about 3,000 deaths a day. Now we're averaging about 300. ANNA DURBIN: Most people have some underlying immunity that is helpful in fighting the virus. We have antivirals. And, I think, because of that, we're not seeing a rise in deaths. And that's very reassuring. That tells me that this virus, even BA. 5, is not so divergent that it is escaping all arms of the immune system. AUBREY: She says new booster shots that can specifically target omicron should be helpful. They won't halt all infections or reinfections. But they will help prevent serious illness and death. MARTIN: Well, let's talk about reinfections. Do we know whether there are long-term consequences for people who get COVID again and again? AUBREY: Well, there's new data to show that people who've had COVID more than once may have an elevated risk of some long COVID symptoms. I spoke to Ziyad Al-Aly of the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System. He did the study. Analyzing medical records, he identified thousands of cases of reinfection. And he saw a wide range of problems diagnosed in the months that followed. ZIYAD AL-ALY: Some respiratory conditions, you know, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, you know, brain fog and a lot of other conditions, including heart disease, diabetes and kidney disease. So even if you're vaccinated, it's still best - it's absolutely best - to avoid reinfection. AUBREY: There's a lot of BA. 5 out there. So he says it would be wise to take steps to reduce your exposure. Even if it seems unfashionable or unpopular to mask up in a crowded, indoor space, that could help protect you. MARTIN: NPR's Allison Aubrey. Allison, thank you for your reporting. AUBREY: Thank you, Rachel.

So vaccines aren't good at fighting this. Our immunity isn't as good as it used to be. I mean, is this variant any more dangerous than previous strains? AUBREY: There's really no evidence that BA. 5 causes any more serious illness. And though many people are getting infected or reinfected, the impact of BA. 5 will not likely be on the scale of what we saw last winter. We will be able to manage it better. That's what infectious disease experts are telling me. I spoke to Anna Durbin, a physician at Johns Hopkins, about this. She says, you know, the combination of prior infection and vaccination, it is protective. And treatments are better. Last winter, we had about 3,000 deaths a day. Now we're averaging about 300. ANNA DURBIN: Most people have some underlying immunity that is helpful in fighting the virus. We have antivirals. And, I think, because of that, we're not seeing a rise in deaths. And that's very reassuring. That tells me that this virus, even BA. 5, is not so divergent that it is escaping all arms of the immune system. AUBREY: She says new booster shots that can specifically target omicron should be helpful. They won't halt all infections or reinfections. But they will help prevent serious illness and death. MARTIN: Well, let's talk about reinfections. Do we know whether there are long-term consequences for people who get COVID again and again? AUBREY: Well, there's new data to show that people who've had COVID more than once may have an elevated risk of some long COVID symptoms. I spoke to Ziyad Al-Aly of the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System. He did the study. Analyzing medical records, he identified thousands of cases of reinfection. And he saw a wide range of problems diagnosed in the months that followed. ZIYAD AL-ALY: Some respiratory conditions, you know, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, you know, brain fog and a lot of other conditions, including heart disease, diabetes and kidney disease. So even if you're vaccinated, it's still best - it's absolutely best - to avoid reinfection. AUBREY: There's a lot of BA. 5 out there. So he says it would be wise to take steps to reduce your exposure. Even if it seems unfashionable or unpopular to mask up in a crowded, indoor space, that could help protect you.

Using animal imagery was how parents used to avoid speaking frankly about human reproduction because, let's face it, that can be an awkward conversation for both the child and parent. Comedian Julia Sweeney remembers having the talk with her daughter, which went in all kinds of unexpected directions. And we just have to share it with you. Here she is telling the story on the TED stage in 2010. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)JULIA SWEENEY: I have a daughter, Mulan. And when she was 8, she was doing a report for school, or she had some homework about frogs. And we were at this restaurant. And she said, so basically, frogs lay eggs, and the eggs turn into tadpoles, and tadpoles turn into frogs. And I said, yeah, you know, I'm not really up on my frog reproduction that much. It's the females, I think, that lay the eggs, and then the males fertilize them, and then they become tadpoles and frogs. And she says, what? Only the females have eggs? And I said, yeah. And she goes, what's this fertilizing? So I kind of said, oh, it's this extra ingredient, you know, that you need to create a new frog from the mom and dad frog. And she said, oh, so is that true for humans, too? And I thought, OK, here we go. I didn't know it would happen so quick at 8. I was trying to remember all the guidebooks, and all I could remember was only answer the question they're asking. Don't give any more information. (LAUGHTER)SWEENEY: So I said, yes. And she said, and where do human women - like, where do women lay their eggs? And I said, well, funny you should ask. (LAUGHTER)SWEENEY: We have evolved to have our own pond. We have a very own pond inside our bodies. (LAUGHTER)SWEENEY: And we lay our eggs there. We don't have to worry about other eggs or anything like that. It's our own pond, and that's how it happens. And she goes, and how do they get fertilized? And I said, well, men in their - from their - through their penis, they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out, and you go through the woman's vagina. And so we're just eating. And her jaw just drops, and she goes, mom, like, where you go to the bathroom? And I said, I know. I know. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)SWEENEY: It's how we evolved. It does seem odd. It is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant right next to an amusement park. (LAUGHTER)SWEENEY: Bad zoning - but she's like, what? And she goes, but mom? you - but men and women can't ever see each other naked, mom, so how could that ever happen? And then I go, well - then I, like, put my Margaret Mead hat on - human males and females develop a special bond. And when they're much older, much, much older than you and they have a very special feeling, then they can be naked together. And she said, mom, have you done this before? (LAUGHTER)SWEENEY: And I said, yes. And she said, but, mom, you can't have kids because she knows I adopted her and that I can't have kids. And I said, yes. And she said, well, you don't have to do that again. (LAUGHTER)SWEENEY: And then she said, but how does it happen when a man and woman are together? Like, how do they know that's the time? Mom, does the man just say, is now the time to take off my pants? (LAUGHTER)SWEENEY: And I said, yes. (LAUGHTER)SWEENEY: That's exactly how it happens. Then we got home, and we see the cat. And she goes, how do - mom, how do cats do it? And I go, oh, it's the same. It's basically the same. And then she got all caught up in the legs. But how would their legs go, mom? I don't understand the legs. And I was like - she goes mom, everyone can't do the splits. And I go, I know. But the legs - then finally I'm like, the legs get worked out. And she goes, but I just can't understand it. So I go, you know, why don't we go on the internet, and maybe we can see. . . (LAUGHTER)SWEENEY: . . . Like on Wikipedia? So we go online, and we put in cats mating. And unfortunately, on YouTube, there's many cats mating videos. And we watch them, and I'm so thankful 'cause she's just like, wow, this is so amazing. She goes, what about dogs? (LAUGHTER)SWEENEY: So we put in dogs mating. And, you know, we're watching it, and she's totally absorbed. And then she goes, mom, do you think they would have on the internet any humans mating?

Take the lowly cricket, for example. MARLENE ZUK: From a cricket's standpoint, the world is very big and very dark. ZOMORODI: This is Marlene Zuk. She's an evolutionary biologist and behavioral ecologist who specializes in insect reproduction. ZUK: The short version I always tell people is I study bug sex. ZOMORODI: And Marlene has spent a lot of time observing how crickets do it. ZUK: They're cool to study from the standpoint of understanding how males and females interact because, as everybody knows, crickets sing, and the song attracts females from a distance. ZOMORODI: This cricket story begins when Marlene was invited to a conference in Hawaii 20 years ago, and she spent a couple extra days researching male-female cricket interaction. ZUK: It's not clear to me why I couldn't come up with the standard things that one does when one goes to Hawaii. Like, you know, I want to go to the beach, or I want to, you know, go hiking, or I want to, you know, learn to hula. I don't know. And instead, I thought, I wonder if there are crickets that I can look for when I'm in Hawaii. ZOMORODI: Wait, so how does one collect crickets. . . ZUK: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: . . . at night in Hawaii? ZUK: Or anywhere else. It's a very low-tech operation. ZOMORODI: Yeah. ZUK: So you go outside at night, and you listen for cricket song. You do have to know what they sound like. And, of course, each species has its own song. (SOUNDBITE OF CRICKETS CHIRPING)ZUK: There is a certain amount of skill involved in sound localization. So if you hear a sound, if you turn your head back and forth, that's actually a good way to figure it out. And it'll be louder on the side where, obviously, the sound is coming from. So. . . ZOMORODI: Mmm. ZUK: And then, you have to just kind of pounce with your hand, but they don't bite. And it's OK. And so you can just grab them. ZOMORODI: Marlene was looking for the Pacific field cricket. And that first night, she went out into an open area and noticed that something was off. ZUK: Unlike the usual situation with crickets where they are all buried under the leaf litter in the grass, I was seeing a bunch of males just walking on top of the lawn. ZOMORODI: She had heard of only one instance where crickets behaved like this - a case in Texas. ZUK: Where a scientist named Bill Cade had discovered a parasitic fly that could hear the sound of the cricket and would home in on that cricket and drop its larvae on them. And the larvae then burrow into the cricket, eat it from the inside out. . . ZOMORODI: Oh. ZUK: . . . And kill the cricket, which is a gory but wonderful life history. And I said, but that's weird because I've never heard of that happening anywhere but in Texas. And then, I was collecting the crickets and dissecting them the next day, and what should happen but a fly larva pops out. And I thought, oh, my God. (SOUNDBITE OF BLUE DOT SESSIONS' \"AN UNKNOWN VISITOR\")ZUK: It turned out that I discovered that there was these sound-orienting parasitic flies in Hawaii that no one had ever known were there. And so that puts the male in this terrible bind because the more he calls, the more likely he is to attract a female, which is the best thing ever from an evolutionary standpoint. But it's also the worst thing ever because he could attract this fly that will deposit these alienlike creatures that will burrow in, eat him. . . ZOMORODI: Ugh. ZUK: . . . From the inside out, and then leave him a shell of his former self. ZOMORODI: In a minute, more from Marlene Zuk about how these crickets found a genetic loophole and completely changed their reproductive strategy. On the show today, The Birds And The Bees. You're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. On the show today - the birds and the bees. And we were talking to evolutionary biologist Marlene Zuk. She is the author of numerous books and essays. ZUK: \"Riddled With Life: Friendly Worms, Ladybug Sex, And The Parasites That Make Us Who We Are. \"\"Bring On The Aerial Ant Sex. \"\"Mates With Benefits: When And How Sexual Cannibalism Is Adaptive. \"\"Sex On Six Legs: Lessons On Life, Love And. . . \"ZOMORODI: In addition to writing, Marlene does a lot of field research. And about 30 years ago, she stumbled upon an evolutionary dilemma for the Pacific field crickets of Hawaii. ZUK: And it turned out that I discovered that there was these sound-orienting parasitic flies in Hawaii that no one had ever known were there. ZOMORODI: Year after year, Marlene returned to the island of Kauai to see if these crickets could survive an infestation of parasitic flies. . . ZUK: That could hear the sound of the cricket and would home in on that cricket and drop its larvae on them, and the larvae then burrow into the cricket, eat it from the inside out and kill the cricket. ZOMORODI: OK, so if it sings - if the male cricket sings, he could either attract a girlfriend or a murderer. ZUK: Right. There you go. ZOMORODI: OK, so how did you go about measuring or observing how the crickets were coping with this? ZUK: We've been working on three islands in Hawaii. And on one of them, the island of Kauai, the cricket numbers had just been falling for a few years, and I thought, well, you know, maybe we're just going to see extinction happening. And then the following year I went and didn't hear anything but thought, OK, well, you may as well get out of the car. And I started walking up the road where we usually see them in Kauai with my headlamp. And all of a sudden, I started seeing all these crickets, but I wasn't hearing anything. It's like this moment of cognitive dissonance because if you see crickets and it's nighttime, then you should be hearing crickets. And if it's nighttime and you're not hearing crickets, then you shouldn't be seeing crickets because that's what crickets do. It's their raison d'etre. You know, they call. I mean, that's what male crickets do. And so I literally was picking them up and thinking, what is this? And, you know - 'cause of course, I've been working on them for years by then, so of course I knew what they were. I just couldn't figure it out. And finally, what we realized is that - not all, as it turns out, but a bunch of the males on that island - and then later it was on other islands as well - had a mutation in their wings that made them unable to call. These male crickets were certainly males, and they, you know, had everything else that a male needs. But their wings looked like female wings, and females don't call. And so this is awesome for the males because it protects them completely from being found by this parasitic fly 'cause the fly can only hunt by listening. But it's also a hindrance because, of course, from the standpoint of, you know, finding a female, they're kind of out of luck. ZOMORODI: Yeah. Like, what's - yes, they're surviving. They're not being eaten from the inside out by these parasites. But how are they finding females and making more crickets? ZUK: It turns out that the males with this mutation act as what are called satellites to the calling males. (SOUNDBITE OF CRICKETS CHIRPING)ZUK: The key to all of this is it can't work unless there's still a few callers because if everybody becomes what we call a flat-wing - one of these males that can't call - then the show is over because everybody's just wandering around in the dark, and nobody can find anybody else. But if there's a few callers left, the females are still super attracted to them. And if, as they're walking toward the caller, they're intercepted by one of these flat-wings, they will, at least some of the time, mate with them. And even if the females don't like them as much, because those flat-wing males are protected from the fly, they live longer. So they can just kind of wait it out. And so even if, on a sort of per-night basis, they're not mating as much, if they live longer, eventually something, you know, will happen to them. ZOMORODI: So how does this example challenge what we think we know about evolution and how it works? ZUK: You know, everybody always thinks, oh, evolution - the dinosaurs rose and fell. It's millions of years, and so evolution can't happen fast. But increasingly, scientists are realizing that evolution can happen really fast or really slow or in between, but it's hard to demonstrate in the wild because you're not always there to see it happen. And in our case, because I'd been working on the crickets long-term, I knew that it had taken at maximum about 20 generations to have the mutation spread, which of course, from an evolutionary perspective, is really, really, really fast. And I think that one of the fun things that's come out of a lot of this work is how flexible insect behavior is. ZOMORODI: Here's Marlene Zuk on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ZUK: Now, I will maintain, and I think I can defend, what may seem like a surprising statement. I think sex in insects is more interesting than sex in people. (LAUGHTER)ZUK: And the wild variety that we see makes us challenge some of our own assumptions about what it means to be male and female. Of course, to start with, a lot of insects don't need to have sex at all to reproduce. Female aphids can make little, tiny clones of themselves without ever mating - virgin birth right there on your rosebushes. (LAUGHTER)ZUK: When they do have sex, even their sperm is more interesting than human sperm. Dragonflies and damselflies have penises that look kind of like Swiss Army knives with all of the attachments pulled out. (LAUGHTER)ZUK: And they use these formidable devices like scoops to remove the sperm from previous males that the female has mated with. (LAUGHTER)ZUK: So what can we learn from this? I mean, I. . . (LAUGHTER)ZUK: All right. It is not a lesson in the sense of us imitating them or of them setting an example for us to follow. What I think insects do is break a lot of the rules that we humans have about the sex roles. So people have this idea that nature dictates kind of a 1950s-sitcom version of what males and females are like so that males are always supposed to be dominant and aggressive, and females are passive and coy. But that's just not the case. So, for example, take katydids, which are relatives of crickets and grasshoppers. The males are very picky about who they mate with because they not only transfer sperm during mating, they also give the females something called a nuptial gift. Now, the male manufactures this from his own body, and it's extremely costly to produce. It can weigh up to a third of his body mass. I will now pause for a moment and let you think about what it would be like if human men, every time they had sex, had to produce something that weighed 50, 60, 70 pounds. (LAUGHTER)ZUK: OK, they would not be able to do that very often. (LAUGHTER)ZUK: And indeed, neither can the katydids. And so what that means is the males are very passive about mating whereas the females are extremely aggressive and competitive in an attempt to get as many of these nutritious nuptial gifts as they can. (SOUNDBITE OF BLUE DOT SESSIONS' \"THE CORNICE\")ZUK: These nuptial gifts contain protein and a bunch of other nutrients, and the female eats it while she is being fertilized by the male. ZOMORODI: She's basically eating a PowerBar while they do it. ZUK: I like to think of it more as, like, a box of, like, really good chocolate truffles, so. . . ZOMORODI: OK, yeah, that's better. ZUK: So I would be, you know - I mean, yes, the protein. But, you know, from her perspective, it's really - it's just a fabulous thing to eat because it helps her produce more eggs, which, of course, makes her produce more offspring, which, of course, makes her produce more genes in the next generation, which, of course, is what it's all about. And so from the standpoint of, like, OK, we've always got these competitive males and these picky females, the katydids don't really follow that rule. They're still male katydids and female katydids, they're - it's not like - they're not changing sex. It's just that being a male and being a female is way more variable than people tend to think. ZOMORODI: So this might be kind of a dumb question, but I have to ask it. Do you think, Marlene, that insects - I mean, they're hot for each other 'cause they need to procreate. ZUK: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: That's in their biology. ZUK: Sure. ZOMORODI: But is there a pleasure element in that as well? Or would that just be an example of us anthropomorphizing them? ZUK: So I think it's a super good question. I don't think it's dumb at all. And I think I - it gets to something that has fascinated me forever, which is, so how much can we think of other animals as being like us? You know, we're fascinated with this. We're like, only humans can, you know, fill in the blank. For a long time, it was use tools. And then, it's like, oops, there's lots of other animals that can use tools. People are constantly trying to come up with something that will make us different. And then, if it turns out we're not different, then they're all in a tizzy about, oh, but - so does that mean that everything is exactly like us, and they all feel the same things we do, and they all, you know, like, love the way we do? And this is finally getting back to your question - do they all experience pleasure the same way we do? And that explains, you know, everything? And I just don't see why we have to have it one of two ways. It seems to me that insects and other animals can be not like little automatons or robots or whatever, but they can also not be like us. And it's like we don't expect other animals to be like us physically. Like, we think kidneys are different in different animals. Why do we think that emotions have to be the same in us as in other animals? So I think it's fine. Like, insects have a really weird version of kidneys. They're called malpighian tubules. They do strange stuff. They don't look anything like a kidney, but they have the same function. We have kidneys. Nobody's, like, having hysterics about, but why do we have such different ways to process waste? And, you know, like, it's just - you do you. This is why I like insects, is because you cannot look at an ant and say, oh, that's just like a person in an exoskeleton because their brain is, like, the size of a poppy seed. I mean, come on. They cannot. . . ZOMORODI: (Laughter). ZUK: . . . Be doing the things the way you're doing them because you're doing them dependent on this gigantic, floppy thing inside your skull that then connects to all your nerves and all these - they can't be doing it. And so they're, like, showing you this other world that is completely different. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: That was evolutionary biologist and behavioral ecologist Marlene Zuk. Her latest book is called \"Dancing Cockatoos And The Dead Man Test: How Behavior Evolves And Why It Matters. \" On the show today, The Birds and The Bees. (SOUNDBITE OF BLUE DOT SESSIONS' \"DARN THAT WEASEL\") MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   We've been hearing about animal instincts, behaviors that are crucial to survival, because it can be tough out there. Take the lowly cricket, for example. MARLENE ZUK: From a cricket's standpoint, the world is very big and very dark. ZOMORODI: This is Marlene Zuk. She's an evolutionary biologist and behavioral ecologist who specializes in insect reproduction. ZUK: The short version I always tell people is I study bug sex. ZOMORODI: And Marlene has spent a lot of time observing how crickets do it. ZUK: They're cool to study from the standpoint of understanding how males and females interact because, as everybody knows, crickets sing, and the song attracts females from a distance. ZOMORODI: This cricket story begins when Marlene was invited to a conference in Hawaii 20 years ago, and she spent a couple extra days researching male-female cricket interaction. ZUK: It's not clear to me why I couldn't come up with the standard things that one does when one goes to Hawaii. Like, you know, I want to go to the beach, or I want to, you know, go hiking, or I want to, you know, learn to hula. I don't know. And instead, I thought, I wonder if there are crickets that I can look for when I'm in Hawaii. ZOMORODI: Wait, so how does one collect crickets. . . ZUK: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: . . . at night in Hawaii? ZUK: Or anywhere else. It's a very low-tech operation. ZOMORODI: Yeah. ZUK: So you go outside at night, and you listen for cricket song. You do have to know what they sound like. And, of course, each species has its own song. (SOUNDBITE OF CRICKETS CHIRPING) ZUK: There is a certain amount of skill involved in sound localization. So if you hear a sound, if you turn your head back and forth, that's actually a good way to figure it out. And it'll be louder on the side where, obviously, the sound is coming from. So. . . ZOMORODI: Mmm. ZUK: And then, you have to just kind of pounce with your hand, but they don't bite. And it's OK. And so you can just grab them. ZOMORODI: Marlene was looking for the Pacific field cricket. And that first night, she went out into an open area and noticed that something was off. ZUK: Unlike the usual situation with crickets where they are all buried under the leaf litter in the grass, I was seeing a bunch of males just walking on top of the lawn. ZOMORODI: She had heard of only one instance where crickets behaved like this - a case in Texas. ZUK: Where a scientist named Bill Cade had discovered a parasitic fly that could hear the sound of the cricket and would home in on that cricket and drop its larvae on them. And the larvae then burrow into the cricket, eat it from the inside out. . . ZOMORODI: Oh. ZUK: . . . And kill the cricket, which is a gory but wonderful life history. And I said, but that's weird because I've never heard of that happening anywhere but in Texas. And then, I was collecting the crickets and dissecting them the next day, and what should happen but a fly larva pops out. And I thought, oh, my God. (SOUNDBITE OF BLUE DOT SESSIONS' \"AN UNKNOWN VISITOR\") ZUK: It turned out that I discovered that there was these sound-orienting parasitic flies in Hawaii that no one had ever known were there. And so that puts the male in this terrible bind because the more he calls, the more likely he is to attract a female, which is the best thing ever from an evolutionary standpoint. But it's also the worst thing ever because he could attract this fly that will deposit these alienlike creatures that will burrow in, eat him. . . ZOMORODI: Ugh. ZUK: . . . From the inside out, and then leave him a shell of his former self. ZOMORODI: In a minute, more from Marlene Zuk about how these crickets found a genetic loophole and completely changed their reproductive strategy. On the show today, The Birds And The Bees. You're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. On the show today - the birds and the bees. And we were talking to evolutionary biologist Marlene Zuk. She is the author of numerous books and essays. ZUK: \"Riddled With Life: Friendly Worms, Ladybug Sex, And The Parasites That Make Us Who We Are. \" \"Bring On The Aerial Ant Sex. \" \"Mates With Benefits: When And How Sexual Cannibalism Is Adaptive. \" \"Sex On Six Legs: Lessons On Life, Love And. . . \" ZOMORODI: In addition to writing, Marlene does a lot of field research. And about 30 years ago, she stumbled upon an evolutionary dilemma for the Pacific field crickets of Hawaii. ZUK: And it turned out that I discovered that there was these sound-orienting parasitic flies in Hawaii that no one had ever known were there. ZOMORODI: Year after year, Marlene returned to the island of Kauai to see if these crickets could survive an infestation of parasitic flies. . . ZUK: That could hear the sound of the cricket and would home in on that cricket and drop its larvae on them, and the larvae then burrow into the cricket, eat it from the inside out and kill the cricket. ZOMORODI: OK, so if it sings - if the male cricket sings, he could either attract a girlfriend or a murderer. ZUK: Right. There you go. ZOMORODI: OK, so how did you go about measuring or observing how the crickets were coping with this? ZUK: We've been working on three islands in Hawaii. And on one of them, the island of Kauai, the cricket numbers had just been falling for a few years, and I thought, well, you know, maybe we're just going to see extinction happening. And then the following year I went and didn't hear anything but thought, OK, well, you may as well get out of the car. And I started walking up the road where we usually see them in Kauai with my headlamp. And all of a sudden, I started seeing all these crickets, but I wasn't hearing anything. It's like this moment of cognitive dissonance because if you see crickets and it's nighttime, then you should be hearing crickets. And if it's nighttime and you're not hearing crickets, then you shouldn't be seeing crickets because that's what crickets do. It's their raison d'etre. You know, they call. I mean, that's what male crickets do. And so I literally was picking them up and thinking, what is this? And, you know - 'cause of course, I've been working on them for years by then, so of course I knew what they were. I just couldn't figure it out. And finally, what we realized is that - not all, as it turns out, but a bunch of the males on that island - and then later it was on other islands as well - had a mutation in their wings that made them unable to call. These male crickets were certainly males, and they, you know, had everything else that a male needs. But their wings looked like female wings, and females don't call. And so this is awesome for the males because it protects them completely from being found by this parasitic fly 'cause the fly can only hunt by listening. But it's also a hindrance because, of course, from the standpoint of, you know, finding a female, they're kind of out of luck. ZOMORODI: Yeah. Like, what's - yes, they're surviving. They're not being eaten from the inside out by these parasites. But how are they finding females and making more crickets? ZUK: It turns out that the males with this mutation act as what are called satellites to the calling males. (SOUNDBITE OF CRICKETS CHIRPING) ZUK: The key to all of this is it can't work unless there's still a few callers because if everybody becomes what we call a flat-wing - one of these males that can't call - then the show is over because everybody's just wandering around in the dark, and nobody can find anybody else. But if there's a few callers left, the females are still super attracted to them. And if, as they're walking toward the caller, they're intercepted by one of these flat-wings, they will, at least some of the time, mate with them. And even if the females don't like them as much, because those flat-wing males are protected from the fly, they live longer. So they can just kind of wait it out. And so even if, on a sort of per-night basis, they're not mating as much, if they live longer, eventually something, you know, will happen to them. ZOMORODI: So how does this example challenge what we think we know about evolution and how it works? ZUK: You know, everybody always thinks, oh, evolution - the dinosaurs rose and fell. It's millions of years, and so evolution can't happen fast. But increasingly, scientists are realizing that evolution can happen really fast or really slow or in between, but it's hard to demonstrate in the wild because you're not always there to see it happen. And in our case, because I'd been working on the crickets long-term, I knew that it had taken at maximum about 20 generations to have the mutation spread, which of course, from an evolutionary perspective, is really, really, really fast. And I think that one of the fun things that's come out of a lot of this work is how flexible insect behavior is. ZOMORODI: Here's Marlene Zuk on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) ZUK: Now, I will maintain, and I think I can defend, what may seem like a surprising statement. I think sex in insects is more interesting than sex in people. (LAUGHTER) ZUK: And the wild variety that we see makes us challenge some of our own assumptions about what it means to be male and female. Of course, to start with, a lot of insects don't need to have sex at all to reproduce. Female aphids can make little, tiny clones of themselves without ever mating - virgin birth right there on your rosebushes. (LAUGHTER) ZUK: When they do have sex, even their sperm is more interesting than human sperm. Dragonflies and damselflies have penises that look kind of like Swiss Army knives with all of the attachments pulled out. (LAUGHTER) ZUK: And they use these formidable devices like scoops to remove the sperm from previous males that the female has mated with. (LAUGHTER) ZUK: So what can we learn from this? I mean, I. . . (LAUGHTER) ZUK: All right. It is not a lesson in the sense of us imitating them or of them setting an example for us to follow. What I think insects do is break a lot of the rules that we humans have about the sex roles. So people have this idea that nature dictates kind of a 1950s-sitcom version of what males and females are like so that males are always supposed to be dominant and aggressive, and females are passive and coy. But that's just not the case. So, for example, take katydids, which are relatives of crickets and grasshoppers. The males are very picky about who they mate with because they not only transfer sperm during mating, they also give the females something called a nuptial gift. Now, the male manufactures this from his own body, and it's extremely costly to produce. It can weigh up to a third of his body mass. I will now pause for a moment and let you think about what it would be like if human men, every time they had sex, had to produce something that weighed 50, 60, 70 pounds. (LAUGHTER) ZUK: OK, they would not be able to do that very often. (LAUGHTER) ZUK: And indeed, neither can the katydids. And so what that means is the males are very passive about mating whereas the females are extremely aggressive and competitive in an attempt to get as many of these nutritious nuptial gifts as they can. (SOUNDBITE OF BLUE DOT SESSIONS' \"THE CORNICE\") ZUK: These nuptial gifts contain protein and a bunch of other nutrients, and the female eats it while she is being fertilized by the male. ZOMORODI: She's basically eating a PowerBar while they do it. ZUK: I like to think of it more as, like, a box of, like, really good chocolate truffles, so. . . ZOMORODI: OK, yeah, that's better. ZUK: So I would be, you know - I mean, yes, the protein. But, you know, from her perspective, it's really - it's just a fabulous thing to eat because it helps her produce more eggs, which, of course, makes her produce more offspring, which, of course, makes her produce more genes in the next generation, which, of course, is what it's all about. And so from the standpoint of, like, OK, we've always got these competitive males and these picky females, the katydids don't really follow that rule. They're still male katydids and female katydids, they're - it's not like - they're not changing sex. It's just that being a male and being a female is way more variable than people tend to think. ZOMORODI: So this might be kind of a dumb question, but I have to ask it. Do you think, Marlene, that insects - I mean, they're hot for each other 'cause they need to procreate. ZUK: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: That's in their biology. ZUK: Sure. ZOMORODI: But is there a pleasure element in that as well? Or would that just be an example of us anthropomorphizing them? ZUK: So I think it's a super good question. I don't think it's dumb at all. And I think I - it gets to something that has fascinated me forever, which is, so how much can we think of other animals as being like us? You know, we're fascinated with this. We're like, only humans can, you know, fill in the blank. For a long time, it was use tools. And then, it's like, oops, there's lots of other animals that can use tools. People are constantly trying to come up with something that will make us different. And then, if it turns out we're not different, then they're all in a tizzy about, oh, but - so does that mean that everything is exactly like us, and they all feel the same things we do, and they all, you know, like, love the way we do? And this is finally getting back to your question - do they all experience pleasure the same way we do? And that explains, you know, everything? And I just don't see why we have to have it one of two ways. It seems to me that insects and other animals can be not like little automatons or robots or whatever, but they can also not be like us. And it's like we don't expect other animals to be like us physically. Like, we think kidneys are different in different animals. Why do we think that emotions have to be the same in us as in other animals? So I think it's fine. Like, insects have a really weird version of kidneys. They're called malpighian tubules. They do strange stuff. They don't look anything like a kidney, but they have the same function. We have kidneys. Nobody's, like, having hysterics about, but why do we have such different ways to process waste? And, you know, like, it's just - you do you. This is why I like insects, is because you cannot look at an ant and say, oh, that's just like a person in an exoskeleton because their brain is, like, the size of a poppy seed. I mean, come on. They cannot. . . ZOMORODI: (Laughter). ZUK: . . . Be doing the things the way you're doing them because you're doing them dependent on this gigantic, floppy thing inside your skull that then connects to all your nerves and all these - they can't be doing it. And so they're, like, showing you this other world that is completely different. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: That was evolutionary biologist and behavioral ecologist Marlene Zuk.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. I see bees. Hello, friend. Hello. And today on the show. . . One just landed on me. . . . The birds and the bees. Oh, my goodness. We have just come up a very steep ladder into paradise. This is amazing. A few weeks ago, I visited biologist and beekeeper Noah Wilson-Rich on a rooftop covered with wildflowers and trees right in the middle of Manhattan. OK, so where do we go to find the hives? NOAH WILSON-RICH: OK, so we're going to walk past these bronze sculptures, and there are four beehives in the corner, so follow me. We're going to make our own pathways. ZOMORODI: Can I just say how odd it is to be talking to you surrounded by a cloud of bees and not being fearful or running? I feel like we've got, like, this bee soup swimming around our heads. You said it was going to be calming, and it kind of is. WILSON-RICH: There you go. Yeah, you have to vibe with it. You know, everything we do in life. . . ZOMORODI: I mean, OK, so Noah, we had to come up - we had to take the subway, and then we had to come up this flight of - you know, a steep ladder. We're in Manhattan. Somebody who maybe doesn't know you might think, why go through all this trouble? Why not just put these hives in a beautiful field in New Jersey? WILSON-RICH: You know, Manoush, I did not set out to become an urban beekeeper at all. I was living in the city of Boston, going to graduate school nearby, when I needed to get more beehives for our research, at the time developing vaccines for bees. And I just began to notice that bees were dying outside of the city, and they were thriving inside the city, and on the higher-up rooftops as well, they were doing better. So we need to have beehives here on a rooftop in Manhattan instead of the fields of New Jersey because they're dying there. This is where they're thriving. ZOMORODI: You've likely heard that bees are in trouble for many reasons, including climate change and pesticides. Noah's company, Best Bees, collects data from hundreds of honeybee hives that they install and maintain in cities across the U. S. This research, he says, is helping biologists better understand how to protect all kinds of bee species. WILSON-RICH: We can start to see which beehives are thriving, which beehives are not on this network, and then ask questions about the habitat, which so far seem to really converge around the habitat hypothesis that, as with this rooftop, the more plant diversity around the beehive, that seems to be the leading explanation for why beehives are thriving. ZOMORODI: Yeah, I'm just wondering, as an expert in bees, as you look around, what are you looking for? What are the indicators that you want to see? WILSON-RICH: So what I'm looking for in a healthy bee population is safety, first and foremost. Are these bees just doing their own thing? Are they ignoring humans as they should? Bees are vegan. They should go to flowers and come back. That's really it. ZOMORODI: So far, does it look good? WILSON-RICH: It looks amazing so far. ZOMORODI: Yeah? WILSON-RICH: These four beehives are thriving. I know from my database, also, when our beekeepers visited recently that we've done everything to make sure that the bees have a healthy queen. She's laying eggs. They're starting to make honey. And we're working with bees that are already in the environment, and that's a beautiful thing for sustainability. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Multiply and survive. That is the goal of every organism. WILSON-RICH: Yes. The goal of bees is to make more bees. In an evolutionary biology perspective, the goal of humans is to make more humans, and that's what organisms do. We pass our genes to the next generation. ZOMORODI: Maybe as a child you first heard reproduction referred to as the birds and the bees, but your parents probably didn't teach you about pollination or insect intercourse or eggs hatching. So today on the show, we investigate the birds and bees, quite literally. We'll learn how feathered creatures and various insects breed, what can get in their way and if linking their mating rituals to ours is ever a fair comparison. Which brings us back to biologist Noah Wilson-Rich, who says humans have made honeybees essential to their own survival. WILSON-RICH: So bees are this universal pollinator. They bring over 70 fruit and vegetable crops that we humans rely upon for healthy, nutritious food. They bring nuts, you know, crunchy almonds, sour lemons, tart apples. They are responsible for over $100 billion to the global economy every year through this pollination service. They even support the cattle and dairy and cheese industries through their role of pollinating hay and alfalfa. And there are 20,000 species of bees worldwide, hard at work pollinating not just crops, but also plants. And so whether they're pollinating crops or plants around the world, they're providing a really important ecosystem service that we rely upon every day in our daily activities. ZOMORODI: So we started the show visiting beehives right here in New York City, and you have said that these honeybees are doing better in urban areas because of the habitat. Talk me through how you came to that conclusion 'cause it's a bit surprising. WILSON-RICH: Yeah. So we were looking at the three main hypotheses for what's killing bees. That's the starting point in understanding what's saving them. So the main three killers of bees are agricultural chemicals, so that includes pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, anything that's designed to kill off some intricate part of this relationship between plants and pollinators. So that's one. The second is diseases, of which bees are affected by many pests and pathogens. So two is disease, and three is habitat loss, meaning there just aren't enough flowers out there to facilitate good nutrition for pollinators. Now, nutrition is just as important for bees as it is for humans. For bees, it helps them to better metabolize pesticides, which they can do, and also to better withstand disease. So that's how habitat loss relates to the first two leading killers of bees. Now, flipping those a little bit, what's saving bees? We were looking at the areas where bees were thriving and where they weren't on our network of beehives here, so these were beehives at home gardens and business rooftops across the United States. And we wanted to test to see if the areas where bees were doing great had less pesticides. Did they have less disease, or was the habitat better? And we found that in urban areas, there are up to eight times more plant species for bees to pollinate compared to their nearby rural and suburban areas. ZOMORODI: Here's Noah Wilson-Rich on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WILSON-RICH: So we're finding out now that in rural areas, there are 150 plants on average in a sample of honey. That's a measure for rural. Suburban areas - what might you think? Do they have less or more plants in suburban areas with lawns that look nice for people, but they're terrible for pollinators? Suburbs have very low plant diversity. So if you have a beautiful lawn, well, good for you, but you can do more. You can have a patch of your lawn that's a wildflower meadow to diversify your habitat, to improve pollinator health. Anybody can do this. Urban areas have the most habitat - best habitat, over 200 different plants. We have, for the first time ever, support for the habitat hypothesis. Spring honey in Provincetown is from Privet. What's Privet? Hedges. What's the message? Don't trim your hedges to save the bees. Right? Move to the summer honey, which is water lily honey. If you have honey from Provincetown right here in the summer, you're eating water lily juice. In the fall - sumac honey. We're learning about our food for the first time ever. And now we're able to report, if you need to do any city planning, what are good things to plant? What do we know the bees are going to that's good for your garden? I think we should taste some honey. So we look at all these little nuances, but this is a great time, Manoush, if you're comfortable. . . ZOMORODI: Yeah. WILSON-RICH: . . . Taking off a glove, we're going to taste some honey fresh out of the hive with our fingers. And we're just going to smush (ph). ZOMORODI: My hunger overcomes all fear. WILSON-RICH: There's no wrong way to do it. I'll do it first. I'm just going to take my finger, and I'm smushing it right into the wax comb. ZOMORODI: It just squeezes out. It's so beautiful. Oh, my God. WILSON-RICH: This beautiful honey, just pouring out. What you'll notice, too. . . ZOMORODI: Look at them. They're like, what are you doing, man? WILSON-RICH: Yeah. These bees will come up right away and say, ugh, we've got to clean up your mess. And I'm just going to taste it. Wow. This flavor is unlike anything that you can find in a store. ZOMORODI: Oh, my gosh. I was going to say it's nectar, but - it's nectar. WILSON-RICH: You know, and we don't have the vocabulary, still, at this modern day to put towards this. We call it all honey. It's flower juice, and it's entirely different all around the world. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: So here's what I'm wondering. Can you give me a pitch? Let's say I am a commercial landlord, and I'm like, hey, Noah, I've heard about you and bees, and I've got this huge rooftop in Midtown Manhattan. What's the deal? What do you do? Why should I join you? WILSON-RICH: So when you think about real estate companies and when you're entering New York City, for anybody who's ever taken a train or a plane in there, and you look out onto the landscape of the city and you see gray, you see - wow, there must have been habitat before these buildings went up. What was there? There's nothing there in its place. And this is part of what's now called the gray to green movement. And so for companies that have underleveraged assets, what more could you do? When you're thinking about how to compete for business, for people to lease an office or an apartment space, think about what they're making those decisions based on. Green space is now the new mandate. Having a green rooftop, having the ability to go outside and to experience the feeling of wellness, to be able to see some butterflies and some bees or even pick some carrots from a roof - that's the future that we see, and we're seeing spending patterns going towards companies that have a more sustainable brand and reputation. ZOMORODI: OK, this has been a pretty exciting, optimistic conversation. But let's say, Noah, what happens if we don't succeed here? WILSON-RICH: If we don't succeed, then I believe that bees are going to die off much faster than anybody realizes. We already have places around the world where there are humans doing the pollinating with little wands and cotton swabs, going from flower to flower to transfer that pollen to create fruit. This is very unsustainable. Those people could be doing other things to benefit society if only we had the pollinators to do that service for us. And so how do we know the health of the other 200,000 species of pollinators if we don't even know what they are? And that's where honeybees help us so much. We know so much about them, and if they're not doing well, and they have human help to create more hives, then we're really in trouble. And some people call this the great insect apocalypse. We need to understand the identities of these pollinators so we know how to save them so that they can bring us healthy fruits, vegetables, nuts, all the foods that we want for ourselves and for our kids, as well as to help promote all the plants that are out there bringing in carbon dioxide as part of their photosynthesis and then producing oxygen. Without all of these plants that are pollinated by pollinators like bees, we are not going to be able to move the needle on our carbon goals and to really have a healthy future as humans.

ZOMORODI: Yeah, I'm just wondering, as an expert in bees, as you look around, what are you looking for? What are the indicators that you want to see? WILSON-RICH: So what I'm looking for in a healthy bee population is safety, first and foremost. Are these bees just doing their own thing? Are they ignoring humans as they should? Bees are vegan. They should go to flowers and come back. That's really it. ZOMORODI: So far, does it look good? WILSON-RICH: It looks amazing so far. ZOMORODI: Yeah? WILSON-RICH: These four beehives are thriving. I know from my database, also, when our beekeepers visited recently that we've done everything to make sure that the bees have a healthy queen. She's laying eggs. They're starting to make honey. And we're working with bees that are already in the environment, and that's a beautiful thing for sustainability. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: Multiply and survive. That is the goal of every organism. WILSON-RICH: Yes. The goal of bees is to make more bees. In an evolutionary biology perspective, the goal of humans is to make more humans, and that's what organisms do. We pass our genes to the next generation. ZOMORODI: Maybe as a child you first heard reproduction referred to as the birds and the bees, but your parents probably didn't teach you about pollination or insect intercourse or eggs hatching. So today on the show, we investigate the birds and bees, quite literally. We'll learn how feathered creatures and various insects breed, what can get in their way and if linking their mating rituals to ours is ever a fair comparison. Which brings us back to biologist Noah Wilson-Rich, who says humans have made honeybees essential to their own survival. WILSON-RICH: So bees are this universal pollinator. They bring over 70 fruit and vegetable crops that we humans rely upon for healthy, nutritious food. They bring nuts, you know, crunchy almonds, sour lemons, tart apples. They are responsible for over $100 billion to the global economy every year through this pollination service. They even support the cattle and dairy and cheese industries through their role of pollinating hay and alfalfa. And there are 20,000 species of bees worldwide, hard at work pollinating not just crops, but also plants. And so whether they're pollinating crops or plants around the world, they're providing a really important ecosystem service that we rely upon every day in our daily activities. ZOMORODI: So we started the show visiting beehives right here in New York City, and you have said that these honeybees are doing better in urban areas because of the habitat. Talk me through how you came to that conclusion 'cause it's a bit surprising. WILSON-RICH: Yeah. So we were looking at the three main hypotheses for what's killing bees. That's the starting point in understanding what's saving them. So the main three killers of bees are agricultural chemicals, so that includes pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, anything that's designed to kill off some intricate part of this relationship between plants and pollinators. So that's one. The second is diseases, of which bees are affected by many pests and pathogens. So two is disease, and three is habitat loss, meaning there just aren't enough flowers out there to facilitate good nutrition for pollinators. Now, nutrition is just as important for bees as it is for humans. For bees, it helps them to better metabolize pesticides, which they can do, and also to better withstand disease. So that's how habitat loss relates to the first two leading killers of bees. Now, flipping those a little bit, what's saving bees? We were looking at the areas where bees were thriving and where they weren't on our network of beehives here, so these were beehives at home gardens and business rooftops across the United States. And we wanted to test to see if the areas where bees were doing great had less pesticides. Did they have less disease, or was the habitat better? And we found that in urban areas, there are up to eight times more plant species for bees to pollinate compared to their nearby rural and suburban areas. ZOMORODI: Here's Noah Wilson-Rich on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) WILSON-RICH: So we're finding out now that in rural areas, there are 150 plants on average in a sample of honey. That's a measure for rural. Suburban areas - what might you think? Do they have less or more plants in suburban areas with lawns that look nice for people, but they're terrible for pollinators? Suburbs have very low plant diversity. So if you have a beautiful lawn, well, good for you, but you can do more. You can have a patch of your lawn that's a wildflower meadow to diversify your habitat, to improve pollinator health. Anybody can do this. Urban areas have the most habitat - best habitat, over 200 different plants. We have, for the first time ever, support for the habitat hypothesis. Spring honey in Provincetown is from Privet. What's Privet? Hedges. What's the message? Don't trim your hedges to save the bees. Right? Move to the summer honey, which is water lily honey. If you have honey from Provincetown right here in the summer, you're eating water lily juice. In the fall - sumac honey. We're learning about our food for the first time ever. And now we're able to report, if you need to do any city planning, what are good things to plant? What do we know the bees are going to that's good for your garden? I think we should taste some honey. So we look at all these little nuances, but this is a great time, Manoush, if you're comfortable. . . ZOMORODI: Yeah. WILSON-RICH: . . . Taking off a glove, we're going to taste some honey fresh out of the hive with our fingers. And we're just going to smush (ph). ZOMORODI: My hunger overcomes all fear. WILSON-RICH: There's no wrong way to do it. I'll do it first. I'm just going to take my finger, and I'm smushing it right into the wax comb. ZOMORODI: It just squeezes out. It's so beautiful. Oh, my God. WILSON-RICH: This beautiful honey, just pouring out. What you'll notice, too. . . ZOMORODI: Look at them. They're like, what are you doing, man? WILSON-RICH: Yeah. These bees will come up right away and say, ugh, we've got to clean up your mess. And I'm just going to taste it. Wow. This flavor is unlike anything that you can find in a store. ZOMORODI: Oh, my gosh. I was going to say it's nectar, but - it's nectar. WILSON-RICH: You know, and we don't have the vocabulary, still, at this modern day to put towards this. We call it all honey. It's flower juice, and it's entirely different all around the world. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: So here's what I'm wondering. Can you give me a pitch? Let's say I am a commercial landlord, and I'm like, hey, Noah, I've heard about you and bees, and I've got this huge rooftop in Midtown Manhattan. What's the deal? What do you do? Why should I join you? WILSON-RICH: So when you think about real estate companies and when you're entering New York City, for anybody who's ever taken a train or a plane in there, and you look out onto the landscape of the city and you see gray, you see - wow, there must have been habitat before these buildings went up. What was there? There's nothing there in its place. And this is part of what's now called the gray to green movement. And so for companies that have underleveraged assets, what more could you do? When you're thinking about how to compete for business, for people to lease an office or an apartment space, think about what they're making those decisions based on. Green space is now the new mandate. Having a green rooftop, having the ability to go outside and to experience the feeling of wellness, to be able to see some butterflies and some bees or even pick some carrots from a roof - that's the future that we see, and we're seeing spending patterns going towards companies that have a more sustainable brand and reputation. ZOMORODI: OK, this has been a pretty exciting, optimistic conversation. But let's say, Noah, what happens if we don't succeed here? WILSON-RICH: If we don't succeed, then I believe that bees are going to die off much faster than anybody realizes. We already have places around the world where there are humans doing the pollinating with little wands and cotton swabs, going from flower to flower to transfer that pollen to create fruit. This is very unsustainable. Those people could be doing other things to benefit society if only we had the pollinators to do that service for us. And so how do we know the health of the other 200,000 species of pollinators if we don't even know what they are? And that's where honeybees help us so much. We know so much about them, and if they're not doing well, and they have human help to create more hives, then we're really in trouble. And some people call this the great insect apocalypse. We need to understand the identities of these pollinators so we know how to save them so that they can bring us healthy fruits, vegetables, nuts, all the foods that we want for ourselves and for our kids, as well as to help promote all the plants that are out there bringing in carbon dioxide as part of their photosynthesis and then producing oxygen. Without all of these plants that are pollinated by pollinators like bees, we are not going to be able to move the needle on our carbon goals and to really have a healthy future as humans.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And on the show today, Birds And Bees - the buzzy, busy, amazing cycle of reproduction that keeps all life clucking along. (SOUNDBITE OF CHICKENS CLUCKING)CARIN BONDAR: So eggs are amazing. ZOMORODI: This is Carin Bondar. BONDAR: We just think about scrambling them for our breakfast - and fair enough, 'cause there is a great source of protein. But the thing about eggs is they enable a couple of really spectacular things. ZOMORODI: Carin is a biologist, science writer and very eggcited (ph) about eggs and the birds who lay them. BONDAR: Moms make these little, beautiful packages of - you know, there's - certainly, the DNA is in there, OK. We've got the embryo. But what else we got in there? We've got food. We've got nutrition. We've got hormones. We've got immune factors. And each one of those factors can be individualized for each egg. ZOMORODI: Tweaked, refined and personalized. Carin says that bird moms are the micromanagers of the animal kingdom, and they can tailor their eggs in ways you would never imagine. (SOUNDBITE OF CHICKEN CLUCKING)BONDAR: For example, if a mother is experiencing a resource shortage, if times are really tough, if food is not plentiful, this will make its way into the eggs that she lays. In a lot of cases, mummy (ph) birds will lay just a few extra eggs. And those will be almost insurance eggs that will almost certainly - you know, if they develop at all, they will develop into runts of the litter that won't make it. ZOMORODI: Oh, OK. So these mommy birds are hedging their bets. Like, she has to weigh all the factors around her as she determines where or which egg she should invest her time and energy in. BONDAR: Yeah, that's right. It's like - and those decisions have to be made quite early. But, you know, there's other things that are to be taken into consideration, too. And a really interesting example of this comes from the Galapagos Islands. . . (SOUNDBITE OF BLUE-FOOTED BOOBY SQUAWKING)BONDAR: . . . From the blue-footed booby. Now, these ladies, or mothers, also base their egg contents on the identity of dad. In the blue-footed booby, you have these males. . . (SOUNDBITE OF BLUE-FOOTED BOOBY SQUAWKING)BONDAR: . . . Who have blue, gorgeous feet, and this is an indicator of health. And this is something that a female would use as a proxy by which to say, OK, yeah, this is a good male. I like this male. I want to reproduce with this male. Therefore, I'm going to invest a lot into these eggs. So researchers manipulated the system of the blue-footed booby. Females will lay two eggs. So they'll mate with a male, and then, about 36 hours later, they'll lay the first egg. Then, another three days later, they'll lay the second one. It almost always works out this way. And so researchers during that interval, they painted a male's feet. . . ZOMORODI: (Laughter). BONDAR: . . . A dark grey - right? - as if to say, OK, hang on, we're taking his health away. We're taking away his beauty. Lo and behold, the second egg came along with fewer nutrients, fewer hormones. Mum provisioned the egg according to the fact that dad was no longer a high quality. And isn't that just an incredible demonstration of the ability that she has to allocate at such an early level of development? It blows my mind. (SOUNDBITE OF BLUE-FOOTED BOOBY CHIRPING)ZOMORODI: It is bananas. So another thing about bird eggs that you talk about in your book is size. Size matters, like, a lot. BONDAR: The size of an egg is actually highly correlated with the success of that egg. So the ones that are somewhat larger, generally speaking, we can assume that that has, you know, more food in there to make for a successful hatching. The latter, or the later eggs, will often be smaller, which makes sense if since she's running out of energy. But sometimes what mums will do for these late-laid, smaller eggs is they'll actually load them up with some more androgens, or the hormones that help for the chicks to be a little more aggressive. In some cases, this will make the difference for them between life and death. Because once they hatch, if they are not aggressive enough - I mean, the saying is true; the loudest bird gets the worm. (Laughter) And so if the late-hatching, little guys don't fight for their share, they simply won't eat, and they will then die. ZOMORODI: So in some ways, she's saying, OK, I get that you little guys are at a disadvantage to start with, but I'm going to give you a boost of androgen, or testosterone, so that you can fight to the death if needed. BONDAR: If needed. ZOMORODI: Like. . . BONDAR: Yes. ZOMORODI: . . . Fight your older sibling? BONDAR: Yes, absolutely. I mean, siblicide is quite commonplace in a lot of these nesting birds. But from a biological point of view, that really is the most advantageous thing to have. The older chicks are going to be the ones that are most likely to survive anyway. And for her to receive or realize any biological fitness, she's got to let those smaller ones go. (SOUNDBITE OF BIRD HOOTING)ZOMORODI: So we talked about the size of the eggs, but I didn't realize that there was also a way for birds to modulate when they lay their eggs, that - like, tell us about the process of actually, how long does it take to lay an egg? How much time is there between eggs? Does it vary for each species? BONDAR: Yeah, there - actually, there can be quite a lot of variation there. But generally speaking, for most species, it takes between 20 and 30-ish minutes. However, there's a whole other set of birds. These ones are called brood parasites. And these are mothers who swoop into someone else's nest entirely - a different species, in fact. And they lay their eggs in someone else's nest, and then, they swoop away again. So they essentially drop off their children in a permanent daycare situation. . . (LAUGHTER)BONDAR: . . . And off they go. (SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CHIRPING)BONDAR: We've got someone like the brown-headed cowbird. She can lay it in about 41 seconds. . . (SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CHIRPING)BONDAR: . . . Which is respectable. But the shiny cowbird can actually lay hers in seven seconds. And the bronzed cowbirds can lay them in five seconds. (SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CHIRPING)ZOMORODI: Whoa. BONDAR: Could you imagine being in labor for five seconds? (Laughter). ZOMORODI: That, well. . . BONDAR: I could handle that (laughter). ZOMORODI: Well, yeah, I guess so. So - but she has to fly there first. She has to fly in. . . BONDAR: Fly in, swoop in, lay the egg, and swoop out again. I'm - it is. . . ZOMORODI: And then, get the hell out of there. BONDAR: Right? ZOMORODI: (Laughter). BONDAR: It is just - it's a drive-by laying. (SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CHIRPING)ZOMORODI: OK, so these brood parasites - I imagine that this whole scheme only works if they can fool the host parents. And you say in your book that cuckoos can mimic other eggs, like, lay them so that they match down to the shade of color. BONDAR: Oh, yeah. I will often do public lectures where I throw a slide up that has eggs in a nest. And it's nearly impossible for the audience members to tell which ones are laid by the parasite and which ones are laid by the actual mum of that nest. They can copy the colors, the pigments. Sometimes, there's even little patterns on the eggs, some speckles. ZOMORODI: But how do they know? Like, are they casing the joint. . . BONDAR: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: . . . And then returning to their own, you know, nest and saying, like, right, OK, I'm going for a Tiffany blue with some brown speckles? Like. . . BONDAR: Right? (Laughter). ZOMORODI: . . . How do they know? BONDAR: That's a great question. And that is a question that we - you know, that - we don't necessarily have a full-on answer to that as far as the cognitive parts of it and the physiological parts of it. But what we do know is that, yes, they will make sort of pre-drop-off flights where they observe the positionality of the nests that they're going to parasitize. They look for nests that are in an appropriate location, that they'll be able to make a quick getaway. But then, you know, what these birds will do - the parasitized birds will then actually say, OK, well, we're going to put our nests right beside this predatory bird as a means by which to scare you guys off. So the predators hopefully won't eat us, but they will eat these cuckoos who are coming incessantly by. (SOUNDBITE OF BLUE DOT SESSIONS' \"THE RAMPART\")ZOMORODI: It does beg the philosophical question of, how does a cuckoo bird know it's a cuckoo bird if it was raised by a magpie, right? BONDAR: You have to think that the identity (laughter) - the personal identity of these birds has got to be - right? And they don't even get to meet their parents ever. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). BONDAR: Wow. (SOUNDBITE OF BLUE DOT SESSIONS' \"THE RAMPART\")ZOMORODI: Can we talk about dads? Is that OK? BONDAR: (Laughter) Let's do it. Let's talk about dads. . . ZOMORODI: Let's do it. Let's talk. . . BONDAR: . . . Because, yes, you know, the bird world is really where we see some of the best fathering, I would argue. ZOMORODI: Really? The bird world? BONDAR: Yeah. And that's just because of that truism that, in mammals - I, me and every other female mammal keeps that baby inside until that baby gets born, right? So as soon as that sperm has made its transfer, once that embryo has been fertilized, dad's job is done. There really isn't anything biologically relevant that dad can do. But in the bird world, that's not the case. In the bird world, once mum has laid that egg, dad can legitimately sit on that egg, and that is worth something. This is why we do see a lot of biparental care in the bird world. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"MARCH OF THE PENGUINS\")MORGAN FREEMAN: As the fathers settled into their long wait at the breeding ground, the winter's second storm arrives. ZOMORODI: I feel like the best example or the first time I kind of became aware of bird parenting was that penguin documentary. . . (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"MARCH OF THE PENGUINS\")FREEMAN: As they move about, the fathers will balance their eggs like tightrope walkers. ZOMORODI: . . . Where you saw these amazing emperor penguins passing an egg back and forth between themselves to keep it warm. BONDAR: Yeah. So there's a need for adults and specifically the dads to sit on these eggs to keep them warm in these frigid environments. And rocks, for example, large rocks to create these nests are something that's quite a hot commodity in these environments. So a lot of sexual favors will take place by females towards males in order to grab onto some of these rocks to be able to build a nest. There's a good amount of homosexual sex that happens between males who are, you know, also dutiful dads but certainly doing their own activities on the side. So, I mean, there's a lot of interesting parental and, I guess, in a way, familial stuff that happens because of the nature of these really harsh environments where the penguins live. (SOUNDBITE OF BLUE DOT SESSIONS' \"BLOOD PETAL\")ZOMORODI: My daughter's favorite bird is the peacock. And. . . BONDAR: Oh, OK. Yes. ZOMORODI: The male peacock, full feathers. . . BONDAR: Oh, yes. ZOMORODI: . . . These showy birds who kind of put on a display for their - the female, does that indicate in any way whether or not they will also be caring for the eggs and the chicks? Is there. . . BONDAR: It sure does. ZOMORODI: Oh, really? BONDAR: Yeah, that's a great question. And generally speaking, the more beautiful he is, the less he's going to help. And that's because. . . ZOMORODI: Why does that not surprise me? BONDAR: (Laughter). I know, right? ZOMORODI: Ugh. BONDAR: That's because, you know, there's only so much biological energy to go around. So we'll often see in species that are lek breeders, or species where there is a male and his job is just to give out sperm - they're going to be very pretty because they are trying to give out as much of that sperm as possible. That's their only job. We also would see that in something like a bowerbird. So these are the birds that create these beautiful homes, almost like bachelor pads, with really beautiful feathers. Sometimes, they find pretty things that are plastic from the human world, and they decorate their nests with these things. They're doing that to entice her into coming to his, you know, bachelor pad and only to receive some of his sperm. And once she has received that sperm, that's it for him. He's looking for the next female. (SOUNDBITE OF BLUE DOT SESSIONS' \"BLOOD PETAL\")ZOMORODI: Just to wrap up, you seem to - and I don't know how you'll take this, but you seem to relish the darker side of our conversation. . . BONDAR: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: . . . Just as much as you relish the beautiful - the gorgeous feathers and songs and well-built nests. There's a. . . BONDAR: Yes. ZOMORODI: There's a little bit of a psychotic side to birds, it feels like. Or am I attributing psychological things to an entire world that. . . BONDAR: No (laughter). ZOMORODI: . . . Doesn't deserve it? BONDAR: I - you know what? I love it. I delight in the macabre and the sort of darker sides because I love that nature is messy and that it isn't what we've been told is a nuclear family or a monogamous relationship or whatever kinds of things that humans have decided should be happening in whatever species or for our own species. But I really do delight in the fact that there's so much about nature that we maybe glaze over. (SOUNDBITE OF BLUE DOT SESSIONS' \"SLOW LANE LOVER\")BONDAR: And it's not necessarily even dark. It's just all a matter of individual survival. And when you - you know, when you consider how that sort of plays out across the human world as well, for me, it just makes us all that much more a part of the animal kingdom. We are animals just like anyone else is, or any other living thing is. And I guess maybe that's where some of my delight in these ridiculous and crazy things comes from. It's like, of course they experience these things. Animals are not these perfect, little, happy family units and stuff. I mean, they just - they go through it just like we do. (SOUNDBITE OF BIRDS CHIRPING)ZOMORODI: That's Carin Bondar. She's a biologist and author of several books including \"Wild Moms\" and \"The Nature Of Sex: The Ins And Outs Of Mating In The Animal Kingdom. \" You can see both of her talks at ted. com.

But the shiny cowbird can actually lay hers in seven seconds. And the bronzed cowbirds can lay them in five seconds. (SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CHIRPING) ZOMORODI: Whoa. BONDAR: Could you imagine being in labor for five seconds? (Laughter). ZOMORODI: That, well. . . BONDAR: I could handle that (laughter). ZOMORODI: Well, yeah, I guess so. So - but she has to fly there first. She has to fly in. . . BONDAR: Fly in, swoop in, lay the egg, and swoop out again. I'm - it is. . . ZOMORODI: And then, get the hell out of there. BONDAR: Right? ZOMORODI: (Laughter). BONDAR: It is just - it's a drive-by laying. (SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CHIRPING) ZOMORODI: OK, so these brood parasites - I imagine that this whole scheme only works if they can fool the host parents. And you say in your book that cuckoos can mimic other eggs, like, lay them so that they match down to the shade of color. BONDAR: Oh, yeah. I will often do public lectures where I throw a slide up that has eggs in a nest. And it's nearly impossible for the audience members to tell which ones are laid by the parasite and which ones are laid by the actual mum of that nest. They can copy the colors, the pigments. Sometimes, there's even little patterns on the eggs, some speckles. ZOMORODI: But how do they know? Like, are they casing the joint. . . BONDAR: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: . . . And then returning to their own, you know, nest and saying, like, right, OK, I'm going for a Tiffany blue with some brown speckles? Like. . . BONDAR: Right? (Laughter). ZOMORODI: . . . How do they know? BONDAR: That's a great question. And that is a question that we - you know, that - we don't necessarily have a full-on answer to that as far as the cognitive parts of it and the physiological parts of it. But what we do know is that, yes, they will make sort of pre-drop-off flights where they observe the positionality of the nests that they're going to parasitize. They look for nests that are in an appropriate location, that they'll be able to make a quick getaway. But then, you know, what these birds will do - the parasitized birds will then actually say, OK, well, we're going to put our nests right beside this predatory bird as a means by which to scare you guys off. So the predators hopefully won't eat us, but they will eat these cuckoos who are coming incessantly by. (SOUNDBITE OF BLUE DOT SESSIONS' \"THE RAMPART\") ZOMORODI: It does beg the philosophical question of, how does a cuckoo bird know it's a cuckoo bird if it was raised by a magpie, right? BONDAR: You have to think that the identity (laughter) - the personal identity of these birds has got to be - right? And they don't even get to meet their parents ever. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). BONDAR: Wow. (SOUNDBITE OF BLUE DOT SESSIONS' \"THE RAMPART\") ZOMORODI: Can we talk about dads? Is that OK? BONDAR: (Laughter) Let's do it. Let's talk about dads. . . ZOMORODI: Let's do it. Let's talk. . . BONDAR: . . . Because, yes, you know, the bird world is really where we see some of the best fathering, I would argue. ZOMORODI: Really? The bird world? BONDAR: Yeah. And that's just because of that truism that, in mammals - I, me and every other female mammal keeps that baby inside until that baby gets born, right? So as soon as that sperm has made its transfer, once that embryo has been fertilized, dad's job is done. There really isn't anything biologically relevant that dad can do. But in the bird world, that's not the case. In the bird world, once mum has laid that egg, dad can legitimately sit on that egg, and that is worth something. This is why we do see a lot of biparental care in the bird world. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"MARCH OF THE PENGUINS\") MORGAN FREEMAN: As the fathers settled into their long wait at the breeding ground, the winter's second storm arrives. ZOMORODI: I feel like the best example or the first time I kind of became aware of bird parenting was that penguin documentary. . . (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"MARCH OF THE PENGUINS\") FREEMAN: As they move about, the fathers will balance their eggs like tightrope walkers. ZOMORODI: . . . Where you saw these amazing emperor penguins passing an egg back and forth between themselves to keep it warm. BONDAR: Yeah. So there's a need for adults and specifically the dads to sit on these eggs to keep them warm in these frigid environments. And rocks, for example, large rocks to create these nests are something that's quite a hot commodity in these environments. So a lot of sexual favors will take place by females towards males in order to grab onto some of these rocks to be able to build a nest. There's a good amount of homosexual sex that happens between males who are, you know, also dutiful dads but certainly doing their own activities on the side. So, I mean, there's a lot of interesting parental and, I guess, in a way, familial stuff that happens because of the nature of these really harsh environments where the penguins live. (SOUNDBITE OF BLUE DOT SESSIONS' \"BLOOD PETAL\") ZOMORODI: My daughter's favorite bird is the peacock. And. . . BONDAR: Oh, OK. Yes. ZOMORODI: The male peacock, full feathers. . . BONDAR: Oh, yes. ZOMORODI: . . . These showy birds who kind of put on a display for their - the female, does that indicate in any way whether or not they will also be caring for the eggs and the chicks? Is there. . . BONDAR: It sure does. ZOMORODI: Oh, really? BONDAR: Yeah, that's a great question. And generally speaking, the more beautiful he is, the less he's going to help. And that's because. . . ZOMORODI: Why does that not surprise me? BONDAR: (Laughter). I know, right? ZOMORODI: Ugh. BONDAR: That's because, you know, there's only so much biological energy to go around. So we'll often see in species that are lek breeders, or species where there is a male and his job is just to give out sperm - they're going to be very pretty because they are trying to give out as much of that sperm as possible. That's their only job. We also would see that in something like a bowerbird. So these are the birds that create these beautiful homes, almost like bachelor pads, with really beautiful feathers. Sometimes, they find pretty things that are plastic from the human world, and they decorate their nests with these things. They're doing that to entice her into coming to his, you know, bachelor pad and only to receive some of his sperm. And once she has received that sperm, that's it for him. He's looking for the next female. (SOUNDBITE OF BLUE DOT SESSIONS' \"BLOOD PETAL\") ZOMORODI: Just to wrap up, you seem to - and I don't know how you'll take this, but you seem to relish the darker side of our conversation. . . BONDAR: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: . . . Just as much as you relish the beautiful - the gorgeous feathers and songs and well-built nests. There's a. . . BONDAR: Yes. ZOMORODI: There's a little bit of a psychotic side to birds, it feels like. Or am I attributing psychological things to an entire world that. . . BONDAR: No (laughter). ZOMORODI: . . . Doesn't deserve it? BONDAR: I - you know what? I love it. I delight in the macabre and the sort of darker sides because I love that nature is messy and that it isn't what we've been told is a nuclear family or a monogamous relationship or whatever kinds of things that humans have decided should be happening in whatever species or for our own species. But I really do delight in the fact that there's so much about nature that we maybe glaze over. (SOUNDBITE OF BLUE DOT SESSIONS' \"SLOW LANE LOVER\") BONDAR: And it's not necessarily even dark. It's just all a matter of individual survival. And when you - you know, when you consider how that sort of plays out across the human world as well, for me, it just makes us all that much more a part of the animal kingdom. We are animals just like anyone else is, or any other living thing is. And I guess maybe that's where some of my delight in these ridiculous and crazy things comes from. It's like, of course they experience these things. Animals are not these perfect, little, happy family units and stuff. I mean, they just - they go through it just like we do. (SOUNDBITE OF BIRDS CHIRPING) ZOMORODI: That's Carin Bondar. She's a biologist and author of several books including \"Wild Moms\" and \"The Nature Of Sex: The Ins And Outs Of Mating In The Animal Kingdom. \" You can see both of her talks at ted. com.

After years of limits on how much Atlantic cod fishers can catch in New England, there's some promising new data on the fish that was central to building the region's economy. From The Public's Radio in Rhode Island, Ben Berke reports. BEN BERKE, BYLINE: Before Raymond Lees goes fishing, he stops by Reidar\u2019s Trawl Gear in New Bedford, Mass. , where he buys custom nets that help him avoid certain types of fish. For commercial fishermen like Lees, cod is known as a choke species, meaning fishermen catch so much of it by accident, they sometimes hit their quota and have to stop fishing for what they really want. RAYMOND LEES: I've been scalloping close to five years because I haven't been able to fish what I was traditionally trained to do, and that's chase codfish and flounders. BERKE: Shop owner Tor Bendiksen is a former fisherman himself. (SOUNDBITE OF NET TEARING)BERKE: As he trims a net design his family has been refining for generations, Bendiksen says he's watched the number of boats fishing for cod out of New Bedford shrink by 90%. TOR BENDIKSEN: Well, we went from, you know, a huge fishing business, as far as the groundfishing fleet's concerned, of, you know, 300 boats down to, you know, 20 boats, which is - what? - two dozen boats. BERKE: Fishing ports up and down the East Coast suffered similar fates. It's been a long decline for a fishery that built New England. Back in the 1600s, tales of an ocean full of cod lured the pilgrims to Plymouth Rock. But after centuries of good catches, nets started to come up light in the 1980s. The federal government kicked foreign fleets out of American fishing grounds. And by the mid-'90s, regulators closed areas of the ocean to American fishermen, too. Some areas are still closed because regulators believe cod never rebounded from overfishing. But new research from Kevin Stokesbury, a professor of fishery science at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, is challenging that claim. KEVIN STOKESBURY: For the first time in about 20 years, we have seen and are tracking a successful year class of cod. And they seem to be growing at a very good rate. BERKE: This healthy population of young cod hatched off the coast of New England three years ago. Stokesbury calls it the class of '19. And he says the group is already spawning. With three or four more classes like it, Stokesbury says the cod fishery could be back in business. If that happens, it wouldn't be the first time Stokesbury's findings shifted fishing regulations. In the 1990s, he devised a new way of counting scallops that opened up a tightly regulated fishery. The government already suspected scallops were rebounding to some extent. But Stokesbury's research upended what regulators had been saying for years. STOKESBURY: They thought there were two to three times as many scallops in there. And there were actually about 14 times as many. BERKE: Restrictions loosened. And the growing scallop industry turned New Bedford into the highest grossing fishing port in America. Local fishermen, in turn, have paid it forward. They donate boats, captains and fuel to Stokesbury's research expeditions. His latest research on cod is under review this summer by scientists who will determine whether it should impact fishing regulations. Russ Brown, a scientist at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, says current models still estimate Atlantic cod stocks are about one-tenth the size they used to be. Brown says Stokesbury's data is exciting. But he and other scientists remember a promising class of young cod that hatched around 2006 and failed to rebuild the species. RUSS BROWN: They were fished and they were harvested. In order to rebuild a stock, you have to sort of preserve those spawners so that they're able to reproduce. BERKE: Brown says scientists will have to wait and see if the class of 2019 matures enough to spawn the comeback everyone is hoping for. For NPR News, I'm Ben Berke in New Bedford, Mass.

Tell the truth. If you see a baby, do you sound like this? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Singing) Five little ducks went swimming one day, over the hill and far away. MARTIN: No shade because it turns out that the instinct to talk to babies a certain way or sing to babies a certain way is just about universal. That's according to new research published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour. Researchers collected the voices of 410 people from 21 societies around the world both singing and talking, and they found striking similarities in the way people talk to babies. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Oh, sweet hug. It's OK. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Oh, oh. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: (Non-English language spoken). MARTIN: Joining us now to tell us more is Courtney Hilton, one of the two lead researchers from the study. He's now at Yale University's Haskins Laboratories. Courtney Hilton, welcome. Thank you for joining us. COURTNEY HILTON: Thank you. It's a pleasure to talk to you. MARTIN: So where did the idea to do this research come from? And then, of course, I want you to tell us what made this study so remarkable. HILTON: So the idea for doing this at a large scale really came from an emerging sense in many sciences that study humans that we need to go beyond just studying Western cultures. And for the case of these infant-directed vocalizations, people have studied this in Western and urban societies for many decades at this point. But we don't really know that much about how that varies across societies. And being able to understand whether this is common across societies might give us clues as to whether this is something that has links to our basic biology as humans or whether this is something we are enculturated into through interacting with other people in our culture. MARTIN: So you mentioned that this is believed to be the first international experiment of this type, studying voices around the world, all these different kinds of societies. Did you find anything interesting comparing, say, geography or social position? HILTON: So there are, of course, differences in how people do these vocalizations. Humans are complex animals. And we - you know, our behaviors are shaped by all sorts of things. But one of the interesting things about our study is, for example, we had recordings from both a urban part of Poland, for example, in Krakow, as well as a rural part of Poland. So we were able to make at least some comparisons. And even though that there were slight differences here, on the whole, there actually - there wasn't much of a difference. People still engaged in the same sorts of vocalizations. They still raised the pitch of their voice. They spoke in a more singsong-like manner. The biggest differences we did see in terms of how people made these vocalizations was that some Western societies, so say, for example, our Canadian society in Toronto or our New Zealand society in Wellington, people from these societies raised their pitch the highest amount. And in some of the remote societies, so, for example, the Achuar people in Ecuador in the Amazon, they didn't change the pitch of their voice that much, but they did still raise the pitch of their voice. MARTIN: If this is universal - to your knowledge, for what you're finding out, this is so universal. There seems to be that there has to be a reason for it. Do we have a sense? Like, what's the - why do we do this? HILTON: Some theories suggest that the way we speak in this way accentuates the vowels of the speech and helps babies learn speech. Other theories suggest that this kind of baby talk helps regulate the baby's emotions and helps structure the social interactions we have with babies. MARTIN: Of course, because this is NPR, I loved hearing the audio you collected. Will you talk a bit more about some of the ways that researchers captured the voices of people speaking to infants and analyzing what you captured? HILTON: The easy part about studying infant-directed speech is just making recordings and analyzing them. The hard part is really doing this cross-culturally. So this is why in this project we collaborated with many anthropologists, with on-the-ground expertise, with many of these societies so we were able to make meaningful recordings. So, for instance, some of the recordings I find really interesting are from the Hadza hunter-gatherer people from East Africa in Tanzania. And what's interesting about these recordings, compared to some of the Western ones, for example, is that the Hadza people live a very different life than Western people, only interacting with a group of about 30 to 40 other people. And they have next to no exposure to global media via the Internet, radio and TV. And the Hadza language, which these people speak, is also called a language isolate, meaning that it is not related to any other known living language. Despite all these differences, we still hear in some of these recordings that people engage in the same sorts of vocalizations, raising the pitch of their voice and speaking in a more rhythmic way when they address infants. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: (Non-English language spoken). HILTON: And when we made these recordings, we prompted people to engage with their infant as if they were fussy and to address them in a way to kind of help with that. MARTIN: That was Courtney Hilton, a researcher who's now at the Haskins Laboratories at Yale, one of two lead authors examining the science of how we talk to babies for Harvard's Music Lab. You can check out their paper in Nature Human Behaviour or the Harvard Gazette if you get that. And the headline there is \"When You Talk Silly To Baby, The World Joins In. \" Courtney Hilton, thanks so much for talking to us. HILTON: Thank you so much, Michel. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   OK.

People still engaged in the same sorts of vocalizations. They still raised the pitch of their voice. They spoke in a more singsong-like manner. The biggest differences we did see in terms of how people made these vocalizations was that some Western societies, so say, for example, our Canadian society in Toronto or our New Zealand society in Wellington, people from these societies raised their pitch the highest amount. And in some of the remote societies, so, for example, the Achuar people in Ecuador in the Amazon, they didn't change the pitch of their voice that much, but they did still raise the pitch of their voice. MARTIN: If this is universal - to your knowledge, for what you're finding out, this is so universal. There seems to be that there has to be a reason for it. Do we have a sense? Like, what's the - why do we do this? HILTON: Some theories suggest that the way we speak in this way accentuates the vowels of the speech and helps babies learn speech. Other theories suggest that this kind of baby talk helps regulate the baby's emotions and helps structure the social interactions we have with babies. MARTIN: Of course, because this is NPR, I loved hearing the audio you collected. Will you talk a bit more about some of the ways that researchers captured the voices of people speaking to infants and analyzing what you captured? HILTON: The easy part about studying infant-directed speech is just making recordings and analyzing them. The hard part is really doing this cross-culturally. So this is why in this project we collaborated with many anthropologists, with on-the-ground expertise, with many of these societies so we were able to make meaningful recordings. So, for instance, some of the recordings I find really interesting are from the Hadza hunter-gatherer people from East Africa in Tanzania. And what's interesting about these recordings, compared to some of the Western ones, for example, is that the Hadza people live a very different life than Western people, only interacting with a group of about 30 to 40 other people. And they have next to no exposure to global media via the Internet, radio and TV. And the Hadza language, which these people speak, is also called a language isolate, meaning that it is not related to any other known living language. Despite all these differences, we still hear in some of these recordings that people engage in the same sorts of vocalizations, raising the pitch of their voice and speaking in a more rhythmic way when they address infants. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: (Non-English language spoken). HILTON: And when we made these recordings, we prompted people to engage with their infant as if they were fussy and to address them in a way to kind of help with that. MARTIN: That was Courtney Hilton, a researcher who's now at the Haskins Laboratories at Yale, one of two lead authors examining the science of how we talk to babies for Harvard's Music Lab. You can check out their paper in Nature Human Behaviour or the Harvard Gazette if you get that. And the headline there is \"When You Talk Silly To Baby, The World Joins In. \" Courtney Hilton, thanks so much for talking to us.

An NPR analysis of new data from the National Hurricane Center shows nearly three-quarters of a million people could be at risk in decades to come in three places - New York City, Washington, D. C. , and Miami-Dade County. Jenny Staletovich from WLRN in Miami joins us now. Hi, Jenny. JENNY STALETOVICH, BYLINE: Hi. FADEL: So Jenny, set this up for us. Share the data you got from the Hurricane Center. STALETOVICH: So the Hurricane Center essentially used storms from the past to tell us what the future could look like. We know that climate change will bring more intense and more frequent hurricanes on top of rising sea levels. That means storm surge can make its way farther inland and start reaching areas that hadn't previously been threatened with flooding. Then we added census information and found that in Miami-Dade County and New York, the number of people exposed to flooding from storm surge nearly doubles by the year 2080. FADEL: Wow. STALETOVICH: That's with a relatively conservative sea-level-rise scenario from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. FADEL: OK, that's Miami and New York. But we mentioned three places, including D. C. Not to make this about where I live, but what about D. C. ? STALETOVICH: Well, so a surprising finding from our reporting is that people in Washington, D. C. , mostly get spared from flooding in coming decades. But property is a different story. And that's because the district's founders unwittingly planned the city the way climate experts say modern coastal cities need to build. FADEL: Oh. STALETOVICH: Instead of lining - yeah. Instead of lining waterways with housing or businesses, they used it for parks and monuments and open spaces that offer a buffer against storm surge. FADEL: And those kinds of buffers won't really exist in the coming years in south Florida where you are, right? STALETOVICH: That's right because in Miami-Dade County, we haven't really heeded lessons from past hurricanes, despite repeated strikes or near misses. There's been explosive growth in areas that will see flooding when future storms come. Our analysis of the National Hurricane Center data shows that a storm like Hurricane Irma five years ago would put 463,000 people in harm's way, which is nearly double the number if that storm hit - if a storm like that hit today. FADEL: And how are south Florida residents preparing for the prospect of storm surge and flooding risks like this? STALETOVICH: Well, I talked with Tim Meerbott, who's the mayor of Cutler Bay, which is a small town in southern Miami-Dade that's extremely vulnerable to future flooding. The town also got hit by Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and Meerbott's house was destroyed. Like a lot of people, he rebuilt and stayed. I talked to him at his house, which backs up to a canal that he says will fill up to its banks during a rainstorm. TIM MEERBOTT: I have a hurricane-safe room in here. It's all CBS block, one door, no windows. And, great, I could hide there, but if the water starts coming up too high, what do I do? Hold my breath for, you know, a couple of hours? STALETOVICH: Meerbott thinks south Florida got too big too fast without being ready for more powerful hurricanes. He says the town is doing what it can to prepare - things like stricter building codes and elevating new construction. Brian Haus is a professor who studies storm surge at the University of Miami. BRIAN HAUS: Every bit of sea level that we add to this just makes this kind of scenario worse. STALETOVICH: Haus does some of his research in this huge 30,000-gallon tank that can replicate Category 5 hurricanes like Irma. HAUS: It would do tremendous, tremendous damage to structures, as well as - that's a first floor is completely flooded type of thing. Most of us don't have any way to evacuate into an attic or anything 'cause we don't have any attics, right? So. . . STALETOVICH: I also talked to Craig Emmanuel outside his house across from a lake in Cutler Bay. Last month, a heavy rainstorm triggered flooding that basically brought the lake to his front door. CRAIG EMMANUEL: You went to sleep on dry land, and you woke up, and, you know, the streets were flooded. I don't think anyone was really prepared for it to be as high as it was. STALETOVICH: Emmanuel grew up in an area not far away that was developed for Black veterans returning from World War II. He says Hurricane Andrew nearly destroyed his parents' house. They rebuilt, and they made it even bigger. So like a lot of people in south Florida, he swings from being optimistic, because south Florida has such a long history of rebuilding after hurricanes, to being incredibly worried about a future with worse flooding, especially for his two kids in middle school. EMMANUEL: Twenty years from now, when they are 34 and 32, will they be able to stay in south Florida? That's yet to be seen. FADEL: Now, Jenny, you've been working on this project with colleagues in Washington and New York for months. What's your big takeaway here? STALETOVICH: Well, the climate change amplifies all problems. Hurricanes are already hugely dangerous and costly. And if we look at storms just in the Atlantic in the last five years, they've killed thousands of people and cost about a half-trillion dollars in damage. What this tells us is the most lethal part of a hurricane, flooding, is going to get dramatically worse. We tend to have short memories after hurricane. Andrew in 1992 proved that, if you consider how much development has happened in the path of that storm. There's a certain amount of mitigation and resilience building you can do to protect the coast, but it's clear climate change and sea-level rise is going to be a multiplier, the kinds of storm surge that we've seen in the past. FADEL: WLRN's Jenny Staletovich, thank you so much. STALETOVICH: Thank you.

The Iowa native admits she didn't know what an abalone was until she arrived here as a grad student, but she learned quickly. AQUILINO: I basically manage a really specialized fertility clinic, spa and nursery for an endangered sea snail. CAMPBELL: There are seven species native to the California coast, and, in 2001, white abalone became the first marine invertebrate to be listed federally as endangered. It has the bad luck of being known as the most tender and delicious. And in the 1970s, it was nearly fished to extinction. Today, taking any wild abalone is prohibited in California. AQUILINO: The first thing we see when we walk in this room are pipes everywhere, bubbling seawater and rows and rows of troughs to hold all of our animals. CAMPBELL: There are about 20,000 abalone here, but many are difficult to see. In the juvenile culture rack, the smallest hatchlings are tiny - about the size of a vanilla bean speck in your ice cream. In the lab, the animals are grouped by age and size. AQUILINO: We call this the brood stock conditioning area. It's kind of like the Tinder for white abalone. CAMPBELL: Aquilino says it takes two to four years in the lab for these marine gastropods to grow from a speck to the inch-long juveniles ready for the ocean. The 10 biggest animals here were captured in the wild. These seniors are a bit larger than a softball, but they can't retire yet. Aquilino says they're some of her most prolific procreators. In the back corner of the lab, she points to Green 312 clinging to the side of her tank. AQUILINO: There's a special animal in here. She spawned 20 million eggs at one time. And that's our hope, is to get all these animals to spawn that much, regularly. CAMPBELL: But how exactly do the researchers coax this behavior? AQUILINO: Spawning white abalone is a really romantic process. We put them all in their own individual buckets. We put a love potion of hydrogen peroxide, play some Barry White, and hopefully they give us whatever gametes they have. CAMPBELL: You don't really play Barry White, do you? AQUILINO: We have. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF YOUR LOVE, BABE\")BARRY WHITE: (Singing) Can't get enough of your love, babe. CAMPBELL: With a little help from Barry, the lab hatches about 30,000 white abalone a year. But Aquilino believes they need to triple that number to be successful. AQUILINO: And the hope is that, if we can keep putting animals in the same site over and over again, four times a year for five or six years, that we can create those self-sustaining populations. CAMPBELL: The lab already produces more animals than it can store. Aquilino shares a text she just received - the future of white abalone. It's from a commercial farm that partners with the lab. The message includes pictures of troughs overflowing with her animals, ready to try their luck in the open ocean. Chad Campbell, NPR News, Bodega Bay, Calif. ASMA KHALID, HOST:   For thousands of years, abalone have been highly prized along the California coast. The once-abundant sea snails were collected for their meat and their shells were used as decorations, even currency. Now, wild abalone are struggling, and some are endangered. NPR's Chad Campbell introduces us to a marine biologist trying to save a species. CHAD CAMPBELL, BYLINE: At the UC Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory, we stand outside a locked door. There's a sign that reads, authorized personnel only.

He was in kindergarten. DEE DAVIS: I remember being out in the yard and watching my grandmother float by in a canoe because her car flooded out, and she had a bag of groceries in her lap. And she waved at me, and I waved at her. And it's like, I was 5 years old. I've never been able to let go of that image. KELLY: The North Fork Kentucky River crested at nearly 15 feet that year, a record that stood for more than half a century until last week. Last week's flood was more than 6 feet higher. Floodwaters actually broke the gauge. DAVIS: The water came up quick. It was violent. It was rough. KELLY: Davis is the publisher of The Daily Yonder, which covers rural America. He still lives in Whitesburg. When we talked to him, he had no running water, but his house is on a hill, and he points out others were hit harder. Thirty-five people are confirmed dead as of Monday afternoon, a number that is still expected to grow. The water washed out roads, knocked homes off their foundations. Davis says it reminded him of hurricanes he's covered. DAVIS: We spent some time in the Gulf Coast after Katrina and Rita looking at - the impact of those storms is very similar. When the flood comes, there's no talking to it. ZACHARY CAUDILL: It feels like overnight, everything's been taken away from me. KELLY: Eighteen-year-old Zachary Caudill lives in Whitesburg, too. He was on the front lines last week helping deliver food and water to neighbors who needed it. He says it is hard to see his hometown like this. CAUDILL: Places where I've grown up and places where I've spent so much of my childhood at, and it's completely gone. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: Climate change is making devastating scenes like these more common, and not just in Kentucky, but around the country. Davis says many parts of rural America are feeling it. DAVIS: It's changing agricultural practices. It's changing the way we build, and it's changing the way we plan. And if we don't take it seriously, we imperil ourselves. KELLY: CONSIDER THIS - climate change does not just mean a hotter world. In some places, it means a wetter one. We'll look at why catastrophic flooding is becoming more common and what communities can do to stay safe. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: From NPR, I'm Mary Louise Kelly. It's Monday, August 1. It's CONSIDER THIS from NPR. The search and rescue effort in Kentucky is ongoing. Crews are still trying to reach people cut off by washed-out bridges. For survivors, the scale of loss is coming into focus. MISTY THOMAS: Where I was yesterday in Breathitt County, the homes - the water has receded, but the homes are just full of sludge and mud. KELLY: Misty Thomas is executive director of the Western Kentucky Chapter of the Red Cross, which is assisting at more than a dozen shelters in the area. Sunday, she was with flood victims as they sorted through the wreckage. THOMAS: They were back in their homes, and they were taking these huge squeegees and just pushing the mud out the doors, and their yards were full of the debris from the inside, their lives, everything they own outside, piled up, completely destroyed. And it's heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking to watch them have to go through that. KELLY: Governor Andy Beshear has been out in the affected counties, too. He described a scene at an aid center filled with mountains of clothes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANDY BESHEAR: I got to tell you - it's tough to watch people sorting through clothes, trying to find the size that fits their family members when they have absolutely nothing. KELLY: The governor also highlighted moments of kindness, of generosity. Virtually anyone in Perry County who hadn't lost a house was volunteering at shelters and aid centers, he said. Kentuckians who were impacted by an outbreak of deadly tornadoes back in December pitched in, too, he told NPR. BESHEAR: The fire chief in Mayfield, one of the towns hit hardest by the tornadoes, got in an ambulance yesterday and drove to eastern Kentucky to help out. And the reason that he and the mayor wanted to do that was that the world was there for them in their time of need, and they wanted to be for eastern Kentucky - pretty incredible. KELLY: Looming over the recovery - the threat of more flooding. When Beshear spoke Monday morning, rain was coming down again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BESHEAR: If things weren't hard enough on the people of this region, there is severe storm potential today in all of the impacted areas. That is just not right. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: Destructive flooding like this has unfolded across the country this summer. Just days before the disaster in Kentucky, Saint Louis got more than 8 inches of rain in five hours. Buddha Poutthasith was in his car when floodwaters overtook it. BUDDHA POUTTHASITH: I just heard a big woosh and waves. And next thing you know, I'm in 3 - 4 feet of water. KELLY: Meanwhile, in northern Arizona, rain in the mountains is triggering flooding in homes below. Wildfires have burned away areas of forest that would normally have absorbed some of that water. Paul Fox (ph) in Flagstaff narrowly averted disaster. PAUL FOX: Our house almost flooded. We had a couple of neighbors who actually - these guys, these guys, a handful of neighbors - grabbed some sandbags and, you know, added of a couple rows. KELLY: And earlier this summer, there were those surreal scenes of flooding in and around Yellowstone National Park. NBC News aerial footage of a house sliding down a cliff face. . . (SOUNDBITE OF HOUSE FALLING)KELLY: . . . Bobbing downstream. Flooding like this used to be a once-in-a-generation-type disaster or even rarer. Speaking as the waters began to recede at Yellowstone, Park Superintendent Cam Sholly said it does not feel that way anymore. CAM SHOLLY: I've heard this is a thousand-year event, whatever that means. These days they seem to be happening more and more frequently. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: Floods like these are getting more common. And a major culprit is climate change. My colleague Asma Khalid talked with Rebecca Hersher from NPR's climate team about how a warmer planet translates to more flooding and what it means for the places most at risk. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Rebecca, what is going on? You know, when I think about climate change and flooding, I mostly think about sea-level rise. But that's not where all of this is happening. I mean, we're talking about cities far from any coastline. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Yeah. And, you know, there are many ways that climate change can cause floods. Coastal floods get a lot of attention, especially when they happen during a hurricane. But actually, inland flooding is more common. And the kind of devastating heavy rain that we've seen this week is something that climate scientists have predicted for many decades, that as humans keep burning fossil fuels, the atmosphere gets hotter, the air holds more moisture, and so when it rains, it rains harder. KHALID: And has that turned out to be true? HERSHER: Yeah. The climate models are correct, and actually, scientists can observe it in real time now, which is pretty scary. So heavy rain has increased all over the U. S. and in the Southeastern U. S. , including in Kentucky, it's increased by almost a third. KHALID: Wow. HERSHER: You know, that might not sound like a lot, but an extra inch of rain, if you think about it - if that falls in a short period of time, that is how you get a flash flood. KHALID: So explain that, because I do think it is shocking to see some of the damage that all of this rain has caused, particularly in Kentucky, as you mentioned. HERSHER: Yeah, the danger and the damage comes from moving water, and that can happen in two ways. So first, when a lot of rain is falling in a short period of time, the water doesn't have anywhere to go. It can't soak into the ground, especially if the ground is already saturated. So that causes the water to pool on the surface. And then if there's a hill, even a really small hill, one that you might not even notice, all that water starts to roll downhill. It gathers speed. It gathers power. It can pick up debris. And that is a flash flood. It's really dangerous. It can carry away cars. It can carry away houses, and it can kill people. KHALID: So how common is that type of flooding? You know, you said it is getting more frequent at this point. HERSHER: Yeah. And unfortunately, these kinds of floods, they're so frequent that they're a part of life in some places. There are towns and cities in the U. S. where flash floods happen every year or every other year. That's true in parts of southeast Texas and Louisiana, parts of the Midwest and Appalachia, where this week's floods happened. For example, last summer, there was a flash flood that killed nearly two dozen people in Tennessee. That same area was hit by very heavy rain this year. And it's important to say this is not just a U. S. problem. It's happening outside the U. S. as well. So heavy rain has caused deadly flash floods in Germany and Belgium, South Africa, India, China and Australia. And that's just in the last year. KHALID: So what can be done to warn people when a flood is about to happen? HERSHER: Well, that's actually something that the National Weather Service is really focused on. So local offices are watching for signs of heavy rain and then trying to warn people as early as possible if a flash flood is likely. And that's really important because so many of us get our weather warnings now directly on our phones, right? Your phone will flash, and you'll get an alert saying there's a flash flood warning for your area. And if that happens, you need to take it extremely seriously. And particularly don't drive on flooded roads. It's one of the main ways that people die in flash floods. Their cars just get swept away. KHALID: So, I mean, I've got to wonder, are there ways to make these floods less dangerous, or do we all sort of have to learn to live with this new reality? HERSHER: There are lots of ways to make them less dangerous. So basically you slow the water down, give it safe places to go. For example, have less pavement so the water can soak into the ground. You can build retention ponds, you know, those low marshy areas for excess water to collect. KHALID: Right. HERSHER: And in cities, you can make the pipes bigger. So a lot of U. S. cities were built 50, even 100 years ago. The storm water systems are not built for the heavy rain of today. It's expensive to make those pipes larger, but it's really important if you want to prevent streets from turning into rivers.

Some scientists say it's climate change; others say maybe earthquakes; still others suggest movement inside the Earth's core.

Well, this year, it kind of did by at least a whopping 1. 6 milliseconds. On June 29, 2022, the Earth spun just a little bit faster than normal, causing some outlets to report that it was the shortest day in history. But Duncan Agnew says not so fast. He is a geophysicist at the University of California, San Diego. DUNCAN AGNEW: It's been the shortest day since we started making measurements with atomic clocks. So that's 1960. SELYUKH: It was merrily the shortest day in my lifetime but not everyone's. AGNEW: There were shorter days in 1930. There were much shorter days in 1870. In the times of the Roman Empire, it was 30 milliseconds shorter. SELYUKH: Thirty milliseconds. Just for some context, there are 1,000 milliseconds in a second. So this is not why Rome fell. On average, Agnew says, the Earth is actually slowing down. 1. 4 billion years ago, for example, a day was less than 19 hours long. Isn't that mind-blowing? So why does the Earth speed up and slow down? AGNEW: It's a physics problem. SELYUKH: As Agnew explains, the Earth has gas and liquids that move around. For example. . . AGNEW: Inside the Earth is this giant ball of molten iron. SELYUKH: And there are irregularities in how it flows around. AGNEW: And as those currents change and shift around, that'll cause the solid part of the earth to rotate a little faster or a little slower. SELYUKH: Another force that could be at play, melting ice caps. That adds to the ocean and changes the Earth's shape. When you change your shape and your spin, you also change your speed, says Agnew. AGNEW: It's the effect you see in an ice skater. When she pulls her arms in, she starts spinning around really fast. SELYUKH: The fact is, says geophysicist Duncan Agnew, this is all really normal. You probably didn't even notice that you lost those 1. 6 milliseconds, but they do matter to some folks. The International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service has occasionally added leap seconds to keep clocks in line with the Earth's slowing rotation. But there's never been a negative leap second - a leap back second? The next opportunity for the service to adjust time is when the year ends. So I guess we'll have to wait until then to see if 2022 will put us out of our misery a hair sooner than usual. Five, four, three, one. Happy New Year.

Money in the Inflation Reduction Act could help you - yes, you - contribute to that goal - that is, if it passes the House, as it's expected to. NPR's Laura Benshoff explains how the bill would make it cheaper for more Americans to cut their climate-warming emissions. LAURA BENSHOFF, BYLINE: Most of the Inflation Reduction Act's climate benefits would come from changes that are just too big for individuals to make, like building more wind farms.

JAMAL LEWIS: Household decisions that you and I make on the machines that we choose to cook our food, heat and cool our homes and get us from place to place. BENSHOFF: He says replacing an old appliance is an opportunity. It's a chance to lower home energy costs and carbon pollution by switching to a more energy-efficient model. The Inflation Reduction Act would set aside billions of dollars for appliance rebate programs so that switching is a better deal. For example, if you replace your old furnace with a heat pump, you could get up to $8,000 off the sticker price. Lewis says these discounts are designed to put the technology within reach of more people, especially lower- and middle-income households.

CHRIS DAMMANN: Hello. Nice to be here on NPR. RASCOE: So help me to understand - what does cultivated cells mean? DAMMANN: Well, these are cells from any animal or any other organism that are being grown in a vessel. So you give them a nutritious solution, and they just grow as they would usually do in the - in an animal - for example, in our case, fish. But they do that in a big tank, for example, in a container that is controlled. RASCOE: And so how do you get the fish stick from that culture of cells? DAMMANN: Yeah. Many people ask that. So when you grow the cells and you harvest them from this big tank, you have just a big mass. It's, like, a little bit translucent. So it looks already like raw fish. And then you mix it with maybe some plant material, some plant proteins to give it a little bit of texture and structure that holds together. And you can extrude it in any form you like. So we can make fish sticks. We can make balls. But you could make anything else out of it. RASCOE: So the cells that you're using come from a fish, but no fish are harmed to make it. So would this be considered vegetarian, and are the cells alive? DAMMANN: The cells are alive, of course. They grow. They just don't grow in the fish. They grow outside of the fish. But we provide all the nutrients they need. The nutritional content will be the same. So you would have the same kind of proteins, the same kind of minerals, omega-3s. All of this you will have, but it's definitely not vegetarian because it's animal protein. So if you are allergic to fish, you will have an allergic reaction to our product. So it's really like fish. Yes. RASCOE: But I guess part of the reason why you would want to do this is because commercial fishing also has very serious environmental issues, right? So this process would address some of those environmental concerns. DAMMANN: Yes, absolutely. I think when you look at the industrial-style fisheries - so not the small ones, but the real industrial-style fishery is really destroying our oceans. There's so much bottom trawling and other fishing methods. There's just so much taken out of the ocean. And the other one is, of course, our oceans get more and more polluted. So a lot of fish has microplastics in there or can have some other environmental pollutions. Not all fish, but as a consumer, do you know which ones? So that is a real problem. And I think we are solving, you know, many of these by using basically one fish at the beginning, and then you can make enough out of it, you know, like a million fish. And of course, we have no impact from the environment on our products because it's a controlled environment. I mean, they are in a big, like, brewery-style building. It's sterile. So there is none of these mercury or microplastics in it. So I think there are two things that we address with this technology. RASCOE: What do you say to those consumers that might be put off by this idea of cultivated-cell fish product? People might be put off, like, I don't - it grew a lab? I don't know about that. DAMMANN: When you make cheese, when you make, you know, kimchi, you know, sour dough, yeah, that's cells that multiply exponentially. And we do the same thing.

And this year, 950 hunters signed up for the python challenge. That's a state sponsored snake hunt targeting one of Florida's most troublesome invasive species, the Burmese python. It may be too late to eliminate them, but as NPR's Greg Allen reports, python hunters say they are making a difference. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: At a python check station in Miami on the edge of the Everglades, Donna Kalil has just brought in her day's catch, turning it over to Holly Andreotta. HOLLY ANDREOTTA: Where did you find him? DONNA KALIL: He was close to Burns Lake, right on 41 - some big cypress. ANDREOTTA: Little guy. KALIL: Yeah, he's a little guy. ALLEN: This is the time of year that pythons are hatching and leaving the nest. This one is just a few months old but is already over two feet long. Kalil is a professional python hunter, one of about a hundred contractors paid year-round to find and eliminate the invasive snakes. Last year, she won in the python challenge's professional category, bringing in the most snakes - 19. KALIL: I knew that I had a set of skills to be able to help. I've been catching snakes all my life. I'm a herper from being a kid. My brothers were herpers as well, and I followed in their footsteps. ALLEN: Kalil is proud of her career total. She's brought in more than 600 pythons so far, working mostly at night, driving along levees and roads in the Everglades in her SUV with a specially designed python perch mounted on top. KALIL: I have two volunteers that sit up there. I have lights all around, and we basically just drive along. You know, once we see a python along the way, you know, somebody yells, python. I stop the car, get out, and I sneak up behind it and grab it by the neck and start wrestling. ALLEN: Kalil says this is a good time of year to be hunting pythons. She says they're on the move, and you might find a big one crossing a road or a levee. KALIL: The biggest one I got was 16 feet. It basically took three of us for a ride. I did grab it by the neck and held on. My friend - she jumped on the back of it. And we were literally riding that thing and basically wearing it out until we got it under control. So, yeah, it was a big fight. ALLEN: Not much is known about how pythons became established in Florida, except that they've been here now for about three decades. In this year's competition, a $10,000 top prize will go to the hunter who brings in the most pythons. Mike Kirkland, who manages the Python Elimination Program for the South Florida Water Management District, says eliminating them from the environment may no longer be possible. MIKE KIRKLAND: We might be past the point for full eradication, but I'm very optimistic that we are going to be able to reduce the population enough so that our native wildlife can return. ALLEN: A major question still not answered about pythons is how many are there in Florida? They're very difficult to spot in the wild, and most of the several thousand square miles of the Everglades is inaccessible except by airboat. Kirkland says human detection and removal has been the most effective way to combat pythons. In some areas near Everglades National Park, rabbits, possums and other small mammals that had been wiped out by the snakes have begun to return. At the check station, Joaquin Vila has just brought in his catch - another python hatchling. Vila says at least in areas where they can get access, he believes he and other hunters are putting a dent in the python population. JOAQUIN VILA: The other day we were talking about out here that we saw about eight deer. And some of the other guys that have been out here - they're like, man, I haven't seen that many in a while. So I think it is making a difference. ALLEN: Between contractors, novice hunters and the state-sponsored competition, more than 17,000 pythons have been removed over the last 20 years. That could be good news if we had some idea how many pythons were still out there. Greg Allen, NPR News, Miami.

GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: At a python check station in Miami on the edge of the Everglades, Donna Kalil has just brought in her day's catch, turning it over to Holly Andreotta. HOLLY ANDREOTTA: Where did you find him? DONNA KALIL: He was close to Burns Lake, right on 41 - some big cypress. ANDREOTTA: Little guy. KALIL: Yeah, he's a little guy. ALLEN: This is the time of year that pythons are hatching and leaving the nest. This one is just a few months old but is already over two feet long. Kalil is a professional python hunter, one of about a hundred contractors paid year-round to find and eliminate the invasive snakes. Last year, she won in the python challenge's professional category, bringing in the most snakes - 19. KALIL: I knew that I had a set of skills to be able to help. I've been catching snakes all my life. I'm a herper from being a kid. My brothers were herpers as well, and I followed in their footsteps. ALLEN: Kalil is proud of her career total. She's brought in more than 600 pythons so far, working mostly at night, driving along levees and roads in the Everglades in her SUV with a specially designed python perch mounted on top. KALIL: I have two volunteers that sit up there. I have lights all around, and we basically just drive along. You know, once we see a python along the way, you know, somebody yells, python. I stop the car, get out, and I sneak up behind it and grab it by the neck and start wrestling. ALLEN: Kalil says this is a good time of year to be hunting pythons. She says they're on the move, and you might find a big one crossing a road or a levee. KALIL: The biggest one I got was 16 feet. It basically took three of us for a ride. I did grab it by the neck and held on. My friend - she jumped on the back of it. And we were literally riding that thing and basically wearing it out until we got it under control. So, yeah, it was a big fight. ALLEN: Not much is known about how pythons became established in Florida, except that they've been here now for about three decades. In this year's competition, a $10,000 top prize will go to the hunter who brings in the most pythons. Mike Kirkland, who manages the Python Elimination Program for the South Florida Water Management District, says eliminating them from the environment may no longer be possible. MIKE KIRKLAND: We might be past the point for full eradication, but I'm very optimistic that we are going to be able to reduce the population enough so that our native wildlife can return. ALLEN: A major question still not answered about pythons is how many are there in Florida? They're very difficult to spot in the wild, and most of the several thousand square miles of the Everglades is inaccessible except by airboat. Kirkland says human detection and removal has been the most effective way to combat pythons. In some areas near Everglades National Park, rabbits, possums and other small mammals that had been wiped out by the snakes have begun to return. At the check station, Joaquin Vila has just brought in his catch - another python hatchling. Vila says at least in areas where they can get access, he believes he and other hunters are putting a dent in the python population. JOAQUIN VILA: The other day we were talking about out here that we saw about eight deer. And some of the other guys that have been out here - they're like, man, I haven't seen that many in a while. So I think it is making a difference. ALLEN: Between contractors, novice hunters and the state-sponsored competition, more than 17,000 pythons have been removed over the last 20 years. That could be good news if we had some idea how many pythons were still out there. Greg Allen, NPR News, Miami.

First, let's talk about what sweat is. The human body is basically a bag of liquid with a few bones and organs thrown in to make things interesting. Some of that liquid is in arteries and veins, but some of it is in the interstices, the spaces between cells and bones and organs. And it's that interstitial fluid that's critical to understanding sweat. Why? - because sweat. . . LINDSAY BAKER: Comes from the interstitial fluid in your body, so that's the starting point. PALCA: That's Lindsay Baker of the Gatorade Sports Science Institute. Yeah, that Gatorade. She's forgotten more about sweat than most people will ever know. I keep wanting to call her the sultan of sweat, but it's a bit of an obscure joke. Baker says sweat is released from special glands in the skin called ecrine glands. BAKER: We have about 2 to 4 million glands across our body surface. And this ecrine sweat is composed mostly of water and salt. PALCA: So that's what sweat is - basically just salt and water from the spare liquid sloshing around in your body. Question two, why do we sweat? We sweat to keep cool. When sweat evaporates, it cools the skin, and it cools the blood and the blood vessels near the skin. The cooler blood flows to the rest of the body, and we avoid overheating. Question three, does sweat stink? Surprising answer, mostly no. STEVE XU: Ecrine sweat is in large part pretty odorless. PALCA: Steve Xu studies sweat at Northwestern University. But, in fact, there is a stinky form of sweat. In addition to ecrine glands, Xu says there's something called apocrine glands. XU: They kind of exude a certain more protein-rich sweat. PALCA: And these apocrine glands are found mostly in the groin and armpits. Apocrine sweat contributes to the fragrance of compounds emanating from those areas. So there you are.

NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on why it's been doing this in national parks and forests and why some people say it should stop. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The gas is called sulfur hexafluoride. It's about 23,000 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. And it persists in the atmosphere for thousands of years. The gas mostly gets used by the electric power industry, but for decades, scientists have sometimes used it, too. BOB HALL: We always knew it was a greenhouse gas, but we always said, well, we're using just a tiny amount of it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Bob Hall is an ecologist at the University of Montana. He's bubbled this synthetic gas into streams to measure how quickly gases can move from the water into the atmosphere. That's important to know for understanding stuff like what role streams and rivers might play in climate change. HALL: The beauty of sulfur hexafluoride is we only have to add it in very tiny quantities, and it's really, really easy to measure, and it's perfectly unreactive. We're not doing anything to the ecosystem by adding it. It's not reacting with anything. It's not poisoning anything. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Recently, though, Hall stopped using this gas and switched to another one, in part because, to him, it just seemed ironic to release this powerful greenhouse gas when studying carbon dioxide and climate change. But sulfur hexafluoride is still used by one major ecology study. It's the National Ecological Observatory Network, aka NEON. NEON has been called the largest investment in ecological research in the United States ever. It will run for 30 years, making lots of different measurements at sites across the nation, in part to track the effects of climate change. Critics say a study like this shouldn't be releasing such a notorious gas when there's alternatives. CHANDRA ROSENTHAL: They're doing these experiments on public lands like national parks and national forests, which this doesn't fit with the mission of these agencies at all. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Chandra Rosenthal is with a watchdog group called Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. She says so far, NEON has released about 108 pounds of the gas. ROSENTHAL: That's equivalent to burning more than a million pounds of coal. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Her group has obtained internal records like emails. They show that in 2019, a government scientist at Yellowstone National Park questioned why NEON was releasing sulfur hexafluoride there. That scientist's concerns were soon shared with officials who oversee other public lands where NEON was using this gas. And the documents show they were unhappy. ROSENTHAL: But they haven't really had the authority to do anything about the fact that this stuff is being used. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In response to the questions raised by those officials, NEON did consult with technical experts who felt that the study could use far less of this gas, that it wasn't actually necessary for the study to keep taking these measurements year after year. Kaelin Cawley works at Battelle, the nonprofit research organization that operates NEON. She says the plan is to phase out this gas. KAELIN CAWLEY: We have discontinued it recently at several of our sites, but not all of them. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Now, the amount of gas used in this study is really, really small compared to the vast amounts of greenhouse gases being released by power production and other sources. Still, Walter Dodds gets the concerns. He's a streams researcher at Kansas State University who served as one of NEON's advisers. He says the climate crisis is making people rethink all kinds of things. WALTER DODDS: I think it may be, you know, an overreaction of sorts, but it's completely understandable as well. We all are worried about what our own footprints are. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The National Science Foundation, which funds NEON, told NPR that it supports the current effort to minimize its use of this gas. But Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility is asking this agency to stop releasing it on public lands immediately. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

The NPR Science Desk has taken it upon itself to explain the science of sweat. Today, NPR's Joe Palca tells us about sweat and sleep. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: People sweat when they exercise. Exercise warms the blood. Evaporating sweat cools the blood. The body temperature stays just right. When you sleep, there is no exercise, so do people really need to sweat when they're asleep? ED HARDING: Yes, they do. PALCA: Ed Harding studies sleep and temperature regulation at the University of Cambridge. Turns out our bodies want to be cool while we're sleeping. HARDING: We are sort of hardwired, if you like, to have a lower temperature during sleep than we do during wakefulness. PALCA: That means you could start sweating while you're asleep if you're under too many blankets because your body wants to stay cool, man. HARDING: If you're overheating, what's going to happen is you sweat a lot. Then you take off the bedding, and now you're freezing. And you wake up literally in a cold sweat. PALCA: Now you know why that can happen. And here's a fun fact. Harding says it helps to take a warm bath before going to sleep. HARDING: At face value, it seems quite paradoxical. PALCA: But remember, your body wants a lower temperature during sleep than during wakefulness. And a warm bath actually helps you cool off, at least after you get out. The water on your skin evaporates, just like sweat would, cooling the blood vessels near the skin and cooling your body. It does take a while for the cooling to occur. HARDING: If you try to sleep immediately after your bath, that's not going to work. PALCA: But if you wait a bit, maybe an hour, you'll be rewarded. HARDING: You will fall asleep quicker. And actually, if you measure the EEG, you sleep deeper. PALCA: How about that? Some news you can use from the NPR Science Desk's summer series on sweat. Joe Palca, NPR News.

ANDREW LIMBONG, BYLINE: On the CDC website, where it talks about monkeypox prevention, there's now a section dedicated to safer sex during monkeypox. But it doesn't specify that men who have sex with men are currently at the center of the outbreak, which it should, says Chris Beyrer, epidemiologist and incoming director of the Duke Global Health Institute. CHRIS BEYRER: You have to be specific about who's actually at risk and what are the transmission routes and the exposures - at the same time, not wanting to stigmatize that community. LIMBONG: Now, you can get monkeypox in other ways besides sex, such as touching fabrics that have been used by someone with monkeypox - so towels or linens. But the evidence so far suggests that that's extremely rare. Beyrer says one of the biggest public health challenges is around limiting risky behavior involving sex - so advising queer and gay people to reduce the number of sexual partners and avoid close contact with people you don't know - the exact type of messaging that harkens back to the early days of the HIV crisis.

LIMBONG: While men who have sex with men are currently at the center of the monkeypox outbreak, HIV/AIDS historian Jennifer Brier says that specific turn of phrase can be limiting. BRIER: Our sexual desire and our sexual practices are way more complicated than any phrase can give us. LIMBONG: All the more reason why it's important to talk about it. Andrew Limbong, NPR News.

MONA MINKARA: Thank you. Thank you for having me. KELLY: All right. So let's dive into this study. It's describing something called tactile graphics, which are graphics that, as the name suggests, you can trace with your finger. And start with the origins, because this is a technology built on a really old-fashioned art form, the lithophane. Describe it. MINKARA: So actually what it was, I think it was perceived that maybe a thousand years ago, people produced these lithophanes as a form of art. So if you can imagine, like, a thin piece of material, but you have different densities, and you shine light, then you'll have different shadows - right? - that kind of project. KELLY: OK, so like an engraving. MINKARA: Exactly. That's a lithophane. And so what Brian Shaw, professor Brian Shaw at Baylor University, was like, oh, my God, what if we apply this concept to science, to chemistry? Can we do it? And that's exactly what happened. And so this is remarkably revolutionary for somebody like me. So as everybody heard, I'm a blind professor of bioengineering. And I work with sighted students. And so one of the things that would be amazing about having these lithophanes is now we have this form of data. I can feel it, and my students can lift it up to the light and they can see it. So now we have a universality in communication in our science. KELLY: Something you can both work with at the same time. How have you been doing it? I'm assuming your sighted students were using graphs and charts on a piece of paper. What were you doing? MINKARA: So basically, what I've been doing, a very simple, cheap solution, is sometimes I'll have them print it out. And then I'll have another student or an access assistant take a hot glue gun and trace the plot. We wait until it dries and then I feel it. That's one simple example. KELLY: Oh, my gosh. It's just such an extra layer of work when you're already doing really challenging work. MINKARA: Yeah. Science needs to be made accessible. This would be amazing. KELLY: And I was trying to figure out why Braille wouldn't work. And then it started to seem obvious in the same way that written English doesn't convey everything that can be conveyed in a chart and a graph. Is it the same with Braille? MINKARA: Exactly. So Braille is just the letters, right? It's the words. KELLY: Now, we mentioned lithophanes are a very old form of art. They would originally have been made with porcelain or wax. I assume that's not what you're doing. How are you making them? MINKARA: The 3D printing materials, Yeah. KELLY: Oh, OK. MINKARA: Just, like, the right densities, that's the trick, right? Thin enough, so light shines through, and thick enough at the different parts of, you know, me as the blind person can feel it. And then the sighted student can, like, lift it up to the lights and see it. KELLY: One thing you and your colleagues note in the paper is, and I'll quote - \"the exclusion of students with blindness from chemistry is explicit and systematic. \" It sounds like this could represent such an exciting breakthrough, but that there's a lot more that needs to change. MINKARA: A hundred percent. We need to change our mentalities. We need to make sure that things like this are readily available. They're not very expensive. We need to change how we teach in a classroom. You know, as a blind person from a young age, I was discouraged from science because of, quote-unquote, \"how impractical it is. \" Well, you know what?

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANTHONY FAUCI: The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know, what the evidence - what the science is and know that's it, let the science speak, it is somewhat of a liberating feeling. MICHAEL SHEAR: I mean, you were basically banished for a few months there for a while. You feel like you're back now? FAUCI: I think so. (LAUGHTER)FAUCI: OK. KELLY: Banished by the previous occupant of the White House. Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease doctor, had tangled constantly and sometimes publicly with President Trump over his handling of the pandemic. The day after that press conference, I caught up with Fauci and asked him to elaborate on that liberating feeling. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FAUCI: The president - in this case, Biden - sat down with us literally a few minutes before I got on the podium in the White House press room and reiterated something he had already told us. He said, right now, everything we do is going to be based on science and truth. And if things go wrong and we make mistakes, we admit them and we try and fix them. KELLY: And what went through your head when you heard that? FAUCI: I said, hallelujah, you know? KELLY: After the year Fauci had just been through, that sense of relief was perhaps not surprising. Almost from the moment the pandemic hit, he had become a target for the right - and not just President Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)TUCKER CARLSON: Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight. \" The utter fraudulence of Tony Fauci is obvious now. JESSE WATTERS: Dr. Anthony Fauci, the mad scientist who locked down the country and injured our children. . . SEAN HANNITY: He is the left-wing new Green Deal socialist. Anthony flip-flop Fauci is once again back in the news after Senator Rand Paul. . . KELLY: Dr. Fauci is still to this day a favorite target in some corners of conservative politics. And that new chapter in the Biden administration would turn out to be his last as a public servant. This week, Fauci announced he would retire at the end of this year. FAUCI: I had been thinking about this, Mary Louise, now for over a year. KELLY: Earlier this week, we called Fauci again. That decision, he said, came down to timing, finding the right moment when the pandemic hopefully was under control. FAUCI: Turns out, it's clear that we will get COVID under control and make it much, much less impactful on our social order. But it's not going to be eradicated, and it's not going to be eliminated. So I felt the time was right to make an announcement now and give a bit of a long runway and just step down in December. Because I think by that time, Mary Louise, the pandemic will likely become more of an endemic situation, something that we can live with and doesn't disrupt us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: CONSIDER THIS - for nearly 40 years, Anthony Fauci has been leading America's fight against infectious diseases. Now he's stepping away. We'll talk with Dr. Fauci about his decision to leave and look at the twists and turns of his long and sometimes controversial career. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: From NPR, I'm Mary Louise Kelly. It's Thursday, August 25. It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. In the fall of 1984, Dr. Anthony Fauci was chief of the Laboratory of Immunoregulation at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. And he and his colleagues had just attempted a new kind of treatment for a patient with AIDS. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)FAUCI: We had hoped that if we could get the immune cells from the donor and put them into the recipient, that the recipient would have at least a partial normalization of the immune response. KELLY: That's Fauci on NPR in October 1984, his first appearance on our network. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)FAUCI: But as it turned out, there was no real effect on the clinical course of the recipient. He continued to do very poorly and ultimately died. KELLY: The treatment had failed. Just a week after that broadcast, Fauci became the director of the NIAID, a position he still holds. His early years at the helm were dominated by the AIDS crisis and by criticism that he was moving too slowly in response to that pandemic. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Not people. Test drugs, not people. KELLY: October 1988 - activists gathering at the FDA and NIH to protest the slow pace of drug development to fight the virus. One of their chants even called out Fauci by name. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I want to know why it takes five to 10 years in this country to test drugs that you can test in Europe in half the time, a quarter of the time. KELLY: That same year, a prominent AIDS activist published an open letter, writing, Anthony Fauci, you are a murderer. Fauci would later acknowledge that he initially saw the AIDS crisis too clinically through the lens of science and that, quote, \"I had to change. \" He came to sympathize with the activists and even invited a group of them to his office that day in 1988. Fauci had been thrust into a role that he would reprise decades later - public official at the center of a highly politicized fight over a deadly virus. As the years went on, Fauci would continue to be the public face of the federal government's response to disease outbreaks big and small. We went back through our archives for a sample. Here he is in 1997, talking about a small spike in avian flu. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)FAUCI: This particular flu, H5N1, has never before infected humans, which means the entire human population is essentially naive to this particular strain, which makes it all the more dangerous once a person is infected. KELLY: A month after 9/11, he reflected on the possibility of smallpox being used as a biological weapon. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)FAUCI: When you have, again, a real situation, for example, of the return of smallpox, potentially, as a bioterrorism event or the serious risk of that, then you go back and reevaluate the risk-benefit of vaccination. And that's something. . . KELLY: And then 2 1/2 years ago, a novel coronavirus arrived in the U. S. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)FAUCI: We now have five confirmed cases in the United States. And I would not be surprised at all if we start seeing more in the coming days to weeks. KELLY: That's Fauci in January 2020. Of course, we did start seeing more cases. And almost immediately, Fauci and Trump began to spar over the response to COVID-19. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN ROBERTS: Dr. Fauci, as was explained yesterday, there has been some promise with hydroxychloroquine as potential therapy for people who are infected with coronavirus. KELLY: At a press conference in March 2020, as the virus spread rapidly, Trump stood behind Fauci as he was asked whether hydroxychloroquine could help infected patients. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FAUCI: The answer is no. And the evidence that you're talking about, John, is anecdotal evidence. KELLY: But Trump had other thoughts. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: Without seeing too much, I'm probably more of a fan of that than - maybe than anybody. But I'm a big fan, and we'll see what happens. KELLY: That contradictory messaging would repeat itself as the months went on - Trump downplaying the virus or promoting unproven treatments; Fauci doing his best to stick to the science. And as the 2020 presidential election heated up, Trump's rhetoric became more personal. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots, these people, these people that have gotten it wrong. Fauci's a nice guy. He's been here for 500 years. He called every one of them wrong. KELLY: Trump's base agreed. Here's the crowd at a rally two days before the election. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) Fire Fauci. Fire Fauci. Fire Fauci. TRUMP: Don't tell anybody, but let me wait till a little bit after the election. (CHEERING)KELLY: Of course, after the election, Fauci wasn't Trump's to fire anymore. And that brings us back to where we began - a new start in the Biden administration. COVID wasn't over, though, and Fauci was not out of the crosshairs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RAND PAUL: Dr. Fauci, do you still support funding of the NIH funding of the lab in Wuhan? KELLY: That's Kentucky Senator Rand Paul at a hearing in May of last year accusing Fauci of covering up U. S. involvement in coronavirus research in China. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the theory that the virus had escaped from a lab in Wuhan had become a focus for many on the right. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FAUCI: Senator Paul, with all due respect, you are entirely and completely incorrect. KELLY: The two had sparred before, and they would spar again. Just this week, Senator Paul said he would investigate Fauci if Republicans win back the Senate this fall. And now Fauci's retirement looms. COVID cases have been dropping lately, but the daily average is still more than twice as high as a year ago. So when I spoke with Fauci this week, I wanted to return to a theme we had covered many times these last 2 1/2 years. I was looking at the transcripts of our past conversations. I have asked you over and over as this thing has - I don't even know what the right verb is - as we have lived through this pandemic, where we are in the arc of this thing. It sounds like you don't think we're ever going to say goodbye to COVID, but that by the end of this year, you are hopeful we will be living with it. It will be manageable. We can go about our lives. FAUCI: I believe so. But it's not guaranteed, Mary Louise, because there are things that we can do to make that more possible. We only have - 67% of the population of this country is vaccinated, and only a half of those are boosted. The fall is coming up. We have a bivalent BA. 5 vaccine boost that will be available by early to mid-September. If we can get the people who've not been boosted to get boosted, and certainly those who've not been vaccinated to get vaccinated, we could be where you and I are talking about now, where we want to be, as we get into the end of this year and next year - that the virus will be at a low enough level as to not be a great perturbing of our social order. KELLY: Speaking of getting vaccinated - we're talking right now about COVID, but does it weigh on you to be leaving when we're not at the end of the Coronavirus pandemic, and now we're looking at monkeypox and, of all things, a resurgence of polio? FAUCI: Well, I - let's take each of these separately, Mary Louise. First of all, with monkeypox, unlike the early years of HIV, we know what the pathogen is. We have diagnostics. We have therapeutics. And we have antivirals. So we just need to implement and make accessible to the people at risk. And we will be able to control monkeypox if we do it correctly. Polio - there's a case of paralytic polio in New York. Polio is 99% preventable by vaccines. If you want to stop polio dead in its tracks, get the children who are unvaccinated vaccinated, and you and I would not be talking about polio. KELLY: Well, exactly. We know that that is the answer. And yet here we are talking about polio in New York. FAUCI: Right, exactly. And that's because if you look at certain places in New York, such as in Rockland County, only about 60% of the children are vaccinated. And in some sections of the county, as few as 37% are vaccinated. That's unacceptable. We've got to get the children vaccinated. KELLY: One more question on COVID. We all know so much more about COVID than we did back in March 2020, including you. With the exquisite benefit of hindsight, is there anything you wish you could go back and do differently? FAUCI: Of course, Mary Louise. There are many things that we would do. But it's just one of those things. If we knew then what we know now, we would have done a lot of things differently. We didn't know the capability of this virus to spread, particularly when people are without symptoms. We didn't understand fully that it was aerosolized. We didn't fully appreciate a number of things in January and early February that if we did, we certainly would have done things differently. KELLY: Anything stand out to you? FAUCI: Well, I think it's the issue - you know, we often get criticized for having people, you know, restrict their activity and wear masks. Back then, if we knew that the virus was insidiously under the radar screen spreading, we would have been much more aggressive of asking people to avoid congregate settings indoors and to wear masks. Absolutely. KELLY: Let me step you back a little bit. I know you have said you hope to spend some of your time this next chapter encouraging young people to enter government service. You and I have talked about how vicious the politics can be that come with that work. I know you've experienced that firsthand. How are you going to make the case to young people when public health in this country has become so politicized? People like you have become targets of anger, even violence. FAUCI: Well, despite the negative aspects that you just mentioned, there are so many beautiful things about science. A feeling of gratification and contribution to mankind - that's what I'm going to stress to the younger generation of scientists and people who are considering going into science. Public service is an extraordinary profession, and I want to encourage young people to do that. They should not be put aback by the politicization. That is there. It's unfortunate, but we can do it even in that context. KELLY: Is there a moment you will tell them about that will stick with you - a sight, a person, a patient? FAUCI: Yes, of course. You know, particularly in the early years of HIV, when we were taking care of ill people, all of whom were dying - and then now we wind up with a situation where we have drugs, anti-virals, that are literally giving these people normal life. That is a feeling that is just wonderful - to go from absolute disaster up to a life-saving drug. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: Dr. Anthony Fauci, reflecting on this moment in the pandemic and his decision to step down after 38 years as the top infectious disease doctor in America.

We'll talk with Dr. Fauci about his decision to leave and look at the twists and turns of his long and sometimes controversial career. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KELLY: From NPR, I'm Mary Louise Kelly. It's Thursday, August 25. It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. In the fall of 1984, Dr. Anthony Fauci was chief of the Laboratory of Immunoregulation at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. And he and his colleagues had just attempted a new kind of treatment for a patient with AIDS. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) FAUCI: We had hoped that if we could get the immune cells from the donor and put them into the recipient, that the recipient would have at least a partial normalization of the immune response. KELLY: That's Fauci on NPR in October 1984, his first appearance on our network. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) FAUCI: But as it turned out, there was no real effect on the clinical course of the recipient. He continued to do very poorly and ultimately died. KELLY: The treatment had failed. Just a week after that broadcast, Fauci became the director of the NIAID, a position he still holds. His early years at the helm were dominated by the AIDS crisis and by criticism that he was moving too slowly in response to that pandemic. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Not people. Test drugs, not people. KELLY: October 1988 - activists gathering at the FDA and NIH to protest the slow pace of drug development to fight the virus. One of their chants even called out Fauci by name. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I want to know why it takes five to 10 years in this country to test drugs that you can test in Europe in half the time, a quarter of the time. KELLY: That same year, a prominent AIDS activist published an open letter, writing, Anthony Fauci, you are a murderer. Fauci would later acknowledge that he initially saw the AIDS crisis too clinically through the lens of science and that, quote, \"I had to change. \" He came to sympathize with the activists and even invited a group of them to his office that day in 1988. Fauci had been thrust into a role that he would reprise decades later - public official at the center of a highly politicized fight over a deadly virus. As the years went on, Fauci would continue to be the public face of the federal government's response to disease outbreaks big and small. We went back through our archives for a sample. Here he is in 1997, talking about a small spike in avian flu. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) FAUCI: This particular flu, H5N1, has never before infected humans, which means the entire human population is essentially naive to this particular strain, which makes it all the more dangerous once a person is infected. KELLY: A month after 9/11, he reflected on the possibility of smallpox being used as a biological weapon. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) FAUCI: When you have, again, a real situation, for example, of the return of smallpox, potentially, as a bioterrorism event or the serious risk of that, then you go back and reevaluate the risk-benefit of vaccination. And that's something. . . KELLY: And then 2 1/2 years ago, a novel coronavirus arrived in the U. S. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) FAUCI: We now have five confirmed cases in the United States. And I would not be surprised at all if we start seeing more in the coming days to weeks. KELLY: That's Fauci in January 2020. Of course, we did start seeing more cases. And almost immediately, Fauci and Trump began to spar over the response to COVID-19. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN ROBERTS: Dr. Fauci, as was explained yesterday, there has been some promise with hydroxychloroquine as potential therapy for people who are infected with coronavirus. KELLY: At a press conference in March 2020, as the virus spread rapidly, Trump stood behind Fauci as he was asked whether hydroxychloroquine could help infected patients. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FAUCI: The answer is no. And the evidence that you're talking about, John, is anecdotal evidence. KELLY: But Trump had other thoughts. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: Without seeing too much, I'm probably more of a fan of that than - maybe than anybody. But I'm a big fan, and we'll see what happens. KELLY: That contradictory messaging would repeat itself as the months went on - Trump downplaying the virus or promoting unproven treatments; Fauci doing his best to stick to the science. And as the 2020 presidential election heated up, Trump's rhetoric became more personal. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots, these people, these people that have gotten it wrong. Fauci's a nice guy. He's been here for 500 years. He called every one of them wrong. KELLY: Trump's base agreed. Here's the crowd at a rally two days before the election. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) Fire Fauci. Fire Fauci. Fire Fauci. TRUMP: Don't tell anybody, but let me wait till a little bit after the election. (CHEERING) KELLY: Of course, after the election, Fauci wasn't Trump's to fire anymore. And that brings us back to where we began - a new start in the Biden administration. COVID wasn't over, though, and Fauci was not out of the crosshairs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RAND PAUL: Dr. Fauci, do you still support funding of the NIH funding of the lab in Wuhan? KELLY: That's Kentucky Senator Rand Paul at a hearing in May of last year accusing Fauci of covering up U. S. involvement in coronavirus research in China. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the theory that the virus had escaped from a lab in Wuhan had become a focus for many on the right. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FAUCI: Senator Paul, with all due respect, you are entirely and completely incorrect. KELLY: The two had sparred before, and they would spar again. Just this week, Senator Paul said he would investigate Fauci if Republicans win back the Senate this fall. And now Fauci's retirement looms. COVID cases have been dropping lately, but the daily average is still more than twice as high as a year ago. So when I spoke with Fauci this week, I wanted to return to a theme we had covered many times these last 2 1/2 years. I was looking at the transcripts of our past conversations. I have asked you over and over as this thing has - I don't even know what the right verb is - as we have lived through this pandemic, where we are in the arc of this thing. It sounds like you don't think we're ever going to say goodbye to COVID, but that by the end of this year, you are hopeful we will be living with it. It will be manageable. We can go about our lives. FAUCI: I believe so. But it's not guaranteed, Mary Louise, because there are things that we can do to make that more possible. We only have - 67% of the population of this country is vaccinated, and only a half of those are boosted. The fall is coming up. We have a bivalent BA. 5 vaccine boost that will be available by early to mid-September. If we can get the people who've not been boosted to get boosted, and certainly those who've not been vaccinated to get vaccinated, we could be where you and I are talking about now, where we want to be, as we get into the end of this year and next year - that the virus will be at a low enough level as to not be a great perturbing of our social order. KELLY: Speaking of getting vaccinated - we're talking right now about COVID, but does it weigh on you to be leaving when we're not at the end of the Coronavirus pandemic, and now we're looking at monkeypox and, of all things, a resurgence of polio? FAUCI: Well, I - let's take each of these separately, Mary Louise. First of all, with monkeypox, unlike the early years of HIV, we know what the pathogen is. We have diagnostics. We have therapeutics. And we have antivirals. So we just need to implement and make accessible to the people at risk. And we will be able to control monkeypox if we do it correctly. Polio - there's a case of paralytic polio in New York. Polio is 99% preventable by vaccines. If you want to stop polio dead in its tracks, get the children who are unvaccinated vaccinated, and you and I would not be talking about polio. KELLY: Well, exactly. We know that that is the answer. And yet here we are talking about polio in New York. FAUCI: Right, exactly. And that's because if you look at certain places in New York, such as in Rockland County, only about 60% of the children are vaccinated. And in some sections of the county, as few as 37% are vaccinated. That's unacceptable. We've got to get the children vaccinated. KELLY: One more question on COVID. We all know so much more about COVID than we did back in March 2020, including you. With the exquisite benefit of hindsight, is there anything you wish you could go back and do differently? FAUCI: Of course, Mary Louise. There are many things that we would do. But it's just one of those things. If we knew then what we know now, we would have done a lot of things differently. We didn't know the capability of this virus to spread, particularly when people are without symptoms. We didn't understand fully that it was aerosolized. We didn't fully appreciate a number of things in January and early February that if we did, we certainly would have done things differently. KELLY: Anything stand out to you? FAUCI: Well, I think it's the issue - you know, we often get criticized for having people, you know, restrict their activity and wear masks. Back then, if we knew that the virus was insidiously under the radar screen spreading, we would have been much more aggressive of asking people to avoid congregate settings indoors and to wear masks. Absolutely. KELLY: Let me step you back a little bit. I know you have said you hope to spend some of your time this next chapter encouraging young people to enter government service. You and I have talked about how vicious the politics can be that come with that work. I know you've experienced that firsthand. How are you going to make the case to young people when public health in this country has become so politicized? People like you have become targets of anger, even violence. FAUCI: Well, despite the negative aspects that you just mentioned, there are so many beautiful things about science. A feeling of gratification and contribution to mankind - that's what I'm going to stress to the younger generation of scientists and people who are considering going into science. Public service is an extraordinary profession, and I want to encourage young people to do that. They should not be put aback by the politicization. That is there. It's unfortunate, but we can do it even in that context. KELLY: Is there a moment you will tell them about that will stick with you - a sight, a person, a patient? FAUCI: Yes, of course. You know, particularly in the early years of HIV, when we were taking care of ill people, all of whom were dying - and then now we wind up with a situation where we have drugs, anti-virals, that are literally giving these people normal life. That is a feeling that is just wonderful - to go from absolute disaster up to a life-saving drug.

HUANG: That's Heather Dingwall, a human evolutionary biologist. And she was walking to her job as a postdoc at UPenn. There she studies organs in the skin, like hair follicles and, of course, sweat glands. Sweat glands are actually coiled tubes that bring water from inside your body to the surface. DINGWALL: You're effectively moving the heat from your body to that water droplet. HUANG: As the water droplet evaporates, it takes the heat off your skin. Now, a lot of animals don't sweat, but humans do. And we don't know exactly when it started. There's no fossil record of ancient sweat glands because the soft tissue of the skin falls apart. But Dingwall says it's an adaptation that likely came around a long time ago. DINGWALL: Probably around the time when the environment was getting drier and warmer. And so that would be around, like, 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 million years ago. HUANG: This was in East Africa, where modern humans emerged. Before then, early humans lived in the cool shade of the forest. They had short bodies covered in thick hair to stay warm. Then the climate and landscape changed. Grasslands replaced forests. And humans spent a lot more time in the sun, where they had the opposite problem. They needed to stay cool. So having a body covered in sweat glands became an advantage. DINGWALL: So you might be able to forage for longer, hunt for longer, collect more food. Or even if it's just - it could be as simple as, like, not dying of heat stroke. HUANG: Whatever benefits humans got from sweat must have been huge because sweating requires you to keep drinking lots of water. DINGWALL: And if you lose too much water, then you become dehydrated. And also, you will die. HUANG: Humans, of course, haven't died off. Instead, we've thrived thanks to our sweat. It's core to who we are, even more so than our giant brains, which evolved much later.

A new report reveals that sexual harassment and sexual assault are major problems at U. S. Antarctic facilities. The report was commissioned by the National Science Foundation, which runs the Antarctic program. The report found that nearly three-quarters of women working there felt sexual harassment was an issue. Nearly half were worried about sexual assaults. NPR's Joe Palca has been reading through the 273-page report, and he's here in the studio to tell us about it. Hey, Joe. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: What are some of the revelations in the report? PALCA: Well, one of the things that jumps out at you is how pervasive this problem seems to be. They quoted one of the people they interviewed as saying, every woman I know down there has had an assault or harassment experience that occurred on ice - on ice is what they call working down there. And this is a sentiment that they heard from many, many different people. The report also said that many people didn't trust the officials they were supposed to report to when they had a problem because they thought, A, there might be reprisals, or, B, they were thinking that these people were more interested in protecting the agencies than protecting the people. SHAPIRO: Is there something about working in Antarctica that makes this more of a problem? PALCA: Well, I've been to Antarctica, and it's very remote. And even though the internet has made it smaller, it's just not a place that you can walk down the street and see anybody. Much of the year, these spaces are totally inaccessible. The sun disappears for months in the winter. And that means the staff doesn't have anywhere to go or anyone to talk to. I spoke with Madeline Nash (ph). She's an associate dean at the Australian National University. She studies harassment in Australia's Antarctic program. MEREDITH NASH: You're so isolated and so detached from the sort of normal roles in society that often it makes it sort of, for lack of a better word, it makes it easier to get away with inappropriate behavior that probably wouldn't be condoned, you know, back in normal life.

And now, to be fair, Nash says it was NSF that commissioned the study, so they're aware there's a problem.

ROBERTA MARINELLI: It wasn't surprising to me to hear some of the stories that we heard. It's certainly disappointing. PALCA: Marinelli says one of the things she thinks will improve the situation is to make it easier and less fraught for people to report incidents of harassment. MARINELLI: But more important than that is we have to create an environment in which this kind of behavior just isn't tolerated. SHAPIRO: Those sound like the right words, but is there the will to actually do something? PALCA: Well, who can say for sure? There are some structural issues that make it difficult to make changes in the Antarctic. I mean, there's the military that transports people, their contractors, their scientists who have their own rules and institutions - the rules they have to live by. So coming up with a strategy that's going to be acceptable to everyone is going to be a challenge. But at the end of the day, this is NSF's responsibility. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Joe Palca. Thanks, Joe. PALCA: You're welcome. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   Unfortunately, there are no continents on the planet without sexual harassment, and that includes Antarctica. A new report reveals that sexual harassment and sexual assault are major problems at U. S. Antarctic facilities. The report was commissioned by the National Science Foundation, which runs the Antarctic program. The report found that nearly three-quarters of women working there felt sexual harassment was an issue. Nearly half were worried about sexual assaults. NPR's Joe Palca has been reading through the 273-page report, and he's here in the studio to tell us about it. Hey, Joe. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: What are some of the revelations in the report? PALCA: Well, one of the things that jumps out at you is how pervasive this problem seems to be. They quoted one of the people they interviewed as saying, every woman I know down there has had an assault or harassment experience that occurred on ice - on ice is what they call working down there. And this is a sentiment that they heard from many, many different people. The report also said that many people didn't trust the officials they were supposed to report to when they had a problem because they thought, A, there might be reprisals, or, B, they were thinking that these people were more interested in protecting the agencies than protecting the people. SHAPIRO: Is there something about working in Antarctica that makes this more of a problem? PALCA: Well, I've been to Antarctica, and it's very remote. And even though the internet has made it smaller, it's just not a place that you can walk down the street and see anybody. Much of the year, these spaces are totally inaccessible. The sun disappears for months in the winter. And that means the staff doesn't have anywhere to go or anyone to talk to. I spoke with Madeline Nash (ph). She's an associate dean at the Australian National University. She studies harassment in Australia's Antarctic program. MEREDITH NASH: You're so isolated and so detached from the sort of normal roles in society that often it makes it sort of, for lack of a better word, it makes it easier to get away with inappropriate behavior that probably wouldn't be condoned, you know, back in normal life. PALCA: So imagine if it's your supervisor doing the harassing. It's not like you can go down the hall and complain. That supervisor's supervisor might be thousands of miles away. SHAPIRO: Has a problem like this been documented before? PALCA: Well, Nash says many people who've worked in Antarctica know it's an ongoing issue.

But NPR's Rebecca Hersher reports irreversible climate tipping points are looming. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Climate tipping points are exactly what they sound like - big changes that happen with just a little nudge, like crossing over the center of a seesaw. For example, there's a temperature threshold above which the ice sheet in Greenland will totally melt, no matter what. David McKay is one of the authors of the new study. DAVID MCKAY: Yes, so if you got to the point that, say, the Greenland ice sheet had passed its threshold and was going to collapse, even if we stopped global warming dead, it would just keep on going for centuries and millennia until the whole thing had collapsed. HERSHER: The question is, how hot does it need to get to trigger that tipping point? The new study says about 1. 5 degrees Celsius of global warming would do it. And other tipping points also become likely around 1. 5 degrees of warming - the West Antarctic ice sheet melts away, an ocean current in the North Atlantic stops circulating, most coral reefs completely die. MCKAY: Most of those have our best estimate. But their tipping point is somewhere around 1. 5 degrees. HERSHER: Right now the Earth is about 1. 1 degrees hotter than it was in the late 1800s. So we're just a few tenths of a degree away from 1. 5. And 1. 5 degrees also has significance in the world of climate change policy. Under the Paris Climate Agreement, countries are trying to limit global warming to between 1. 5 and 2 degrees. MCKAY: And this paper really supports the fact that, yeah, 1. 5 isn't just an arbitrary number. It really would reduce the likelihood of these things. Clearly, 1. 5 is better than 1. 9 or 2 degrees. HERSHER: The good news is that it's possible to keep global warming to about 1. 5 degrees if countries follow through on all their current promises to cut greenhouse gas emissions. But there's basically no wiggle room. Erin Pettit is a climate scientist at Oregon State University who studies ice. She says even if only some of the ice melts, a lot of people will still be in danger. ERIN PETTIT: We could be several feet of sea level rise just in the next century. So many vulnerable people live on that coastlines and in those flood-prone areas. HERSHER: And that's the crux of it.

Earlier today, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency put out a statement saying the risk of an accident at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had, quote, \"significantly increased. \" He called for an immediate nuclear safety zone around the plant. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RAFAEL GROSSI: Let me be clear. The shelling around Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant must stop. CHANG: NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has been tracking these developments and joins us now. Hi, Jeff. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Hi there, Ailsa. CHANG: OK. So can you just catch us up on the latest? What exactly is happening right now? BRUMFIEL: Right. So this is a Ukrainian plant. It's been occupied by Russia since March, but Ukrainians continue to operate it. And it's been supplying power to both Russian- and Ukrainian-held territory. The current situation really started in August. There was this big uptick in shelling. Both sides blame each other for that. But at the start of this month, that shelling led the last main power line connecting the plant to the grid to go down. And about four days after that, a backup line went down. That means the entire plant has being cut off from the electricity grid for about four days. And that's not good because nuclear plants need power. CHANG: And explain why that is. BRUMFIEL: Right. So these plants obviously produce electricity, but they also require it to operate all their safety systems and, most importantly, their cooling systems. Pumps to keep water moving through the cores and keep them from overheating need to keep running. If they stop, a meltdown is possible. CHANG: OK. But you said that they've been without power from the grid for four days now. Do we know how they've been keeping the plant safe during that time? BRUMFIEL: Yeah. Interestingly, this type of reactor is able to run in something called islanding operation mode. That basically means that they keep the reactor on or keep one of the reactors on but turn it way down so it's not producing a lot of power. It's a pretty cool trick. And it can power the rest of the plant, but it can't go on forever because the other equipment just isn't designed to run at low power like this. And Grossi also says the workers are a factor. They live in a nearby town that's lost power, water and sewage. He's concerned that the staff will have to leave for their own safety. And that's another reason that the plant's Ukrainian owners are discussing whether to shut it down. CHANG: So if they do shut down the last reactor at the plant, does that mean this crisis will be over? BRUMFIEL: So unfortunately not. It actually makes things a little bit worse in the short term. I mean, if you think of a nuclear plant like cooking on a stove, you might think it's like a stove. You can turn down the stove, and it just turns off. But it's actually more like cooking on charcoal. So even when you're done, those coals stay hot. CHANG: Right. BRUMFIEL: And that means water needs to keep going to the cores. I spoke to a nuclear engineer named Steve Nesbit with the American Nuclear Society. He says all plants are prepared for this kind of emergency. They have backup generators to keep the water pumping. STEVE NESBIT: We don't want to go on the diesel generators, but it's a situation you can abide by for a while. BRUMFIEL: And in the case of Zaporizhzhia, the IAEA says they normally have about 10 days of fuel on site, but it might be a little less 'cause we know they've had to run those generators a little bit. CHANG: OK. So if they shut the reactor down, the clock starts ticking. They'll need to get more fuel to the site for those generators. I don't want to speculate too much here, but what would be the worst-case scenario at that point? BRUMFIEL: Well, the worst-case scenario is the generators run out of fuel, the reactors heat up, and there might be a meltdown. But just before we go, I want to say, this won't be a Chernobyl-like crisis. These are much newer reactors. They're safer. They have containment buildings that could potentially help. The IAEA doesn't want to test any of this stuff. And for that reason, they're calling on all sides to cut it out, knock it off right now. CHANG: That is NPR's Geoff Brumfiel.

DAVID LEVERING: It's obviously quite barren and rocky now, but in the Cretaceous, where we're standing would have been the bottom of a sea. CONDOS: It's hard to imagine, but 80 million years ago, this dry, desolate landscape sat beneath the waves of the Western Interior Seaway, which stretched from the Arctic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. Back then, sea monsters patrolled these waters - bus-length reptiles with razor-sharp teeth, giant carnivorous fish, clams the size of car hoods. LAURA WILSON: My favorite description I'd heard of the Western Interior Seaway is Hell's Aquarium. CONDOS: That's Laura Wilson, a paleontologist with the Sternberg Museum in nearby Hays. She studies prehistoric sea turtles that survived on what was a very hot greenhouse planet. And her research could inform conservationists about how today's turtles might adapt to a warming climate. Her work is just the latest chapter in a surprisingly rich tradition here that shaped our understanding of ancient ocean life for more than a century. WILSON: I consider western Kansas the birthplace of American paleontology. CONDOS: From swimming mosasaurs to flying pteranodons, discoveries from western Kansas now grace the halls of world-class museums in New York, London and Germany. Sternberg Museum collections manager Aly Baumgartner says most visitors find it hard to believe that this often overlooked region plays such a pivotal role in the scientific world. ALY BAUMGARTNER: It's fun to tell people from Kansas how important this is because we are often the butt of jokes, and it shouldn't be the case. Like, the history of Kansas includes sea monsters. Like, how cool is that? CONDOS: In the museum basement, she slides open drawer after drawer of specimens. Many of them can fit in your hand - shells, teeth, toes. In all, this collection is home to more than 20,000 fossils. And that is what continues to draw researchers here from as far away as Japan, Brazil and Australia. So what makes dry-as-dust western Kansas so special? Well, it's one of the few spots on earth where the rock around these fossils is more delicate than the fossils themselves. These badlands are made of soft chalk, so scientists can gently brush it away without wrecking the fragile skeletons. An hour west of the Castle Rock Badlands, Chuck Bonner flips through photos from decades of family fossil expeditions. He remembers his dad putting together plesiosaur bones on the dining room table and cleaning fossils by warming them up in their oven. On the wall hangs a childhood portrait of his sister at a fossil hunt, using a white cloth to shade her head from the sun. CHUCK BONNER: That's my diaper. So that's how long I've been in the fossil biz. I was just born into it. CONDOS: He's given some to big museums in LA or Chicago, but most sit right here in the Keystone Gallery in rural western Kansas, where visitors can gawk at his pizza-sized fish skulls and wall-length reptile skeletons. For Bonner, fossil hunting isn't about fame or money. It's about the thrill of discovery, the chance to unearth a new piece of bizarre aquatic history in this unexpected place. And when people ask him which fossil is his favorite, he says the next one. For NPR News, I'm David Condos in Gove County, Kan. JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   For generations, scientists and students wanting to learn about prehistoric oceans have flocked to a place that's about as far from an ocean as you can get - dry, dusty western Kansas.

(SOUNDBITE OF FOOTFALL ON TRAIL)RAE SOLOMON, BYLINE: When it rains in Colorado's mountains, the mushroom hunters follow close behind. ALAN ROCKEFELLER: Oh, wait, wait. . . SOLOMON: Take Alan Rockefeller. ROCKEFELLER: . . . This is a good one. SOLOMON: He's a serious mushroom hunter and has become a well-known expert in the science known as mycology. And he's just found something interesting sprouting up from the moist forest floor at 9,000 feet above sea level. ROCKEFELLER: So this bright, yellow Russula - this looks like the one I was finding in Arizona that smells strongly like bananas when it dries - pretty sure it's a new species. SOLOMON: Rockefeller travels the world to identify, describe and analyze the DNA of wild mushrooms. ROCKEFELLER: You know, I found the exact same thing in Michoacan, and it also occurs in British Columbia. SOLOMON: But he's excited to find it here, in Colorado, because that means he can add pieces to the incomplete mycological map. ROCKEFELLER: The mushrooms don't get anywhere randomly, so they're, you know, associated with the same or similar tree, or they got carried by an animal. But once you have enough points on the map, you can start to figure out a little bit more about what it's doing in the ecology. SOLOMON: Rockefeller is deep in it, but he is not associated with the university. There are no letters after his name. He doesn't have a degree in biology or any degree at all. He didn't need it for his first career as a professional hacker. Rockefeller is very much an outsider scientist - one at the leading edge of a movement of outsiders making big contributions to mycology. JAMES CHELIN: And that's exactly what we're doing here - is that we are advancing the science rather than just going and finding something to eat. SOLOMON: James Chelin, also on the foray with Rockefeller, is still a computer guy by day. He's also the vice president of the Pikes Peak Mycological Society. He leads groups of the curious and the dedicated up winding, often unpaved mountain roads to help them find and identify wild mushrooms. CHELIN: If we find something to eat, it's a bonus, so chanterelles are great. SOLOMON: He's a gateway figure of sorts, escorting casual foragers deeper into the science of mycology. CHELIN: Talking about identifying stuff not known to science - it's like, we kind of know that there's some different ones, but we don't totally know. And until we start looking at spores under a microscope and we start doing sequencing. . . SOLOMON: It's common for new mushroom species to turn up in Colorado during a good monsoon season. ANDREW WILSON: These last two seasons have been exceptional. SOLOMON: Andrew Wilson has a bunch of letters after his name, including a Ph. D. in biology. He's Denver Botanic Gardens' chief mycologist. WILSON: Because there's been quite a bit of diversity coming up with all the rains, sometimes they all become a blur. SOLOMON: That's why he appreciates outsiders like Chelin and Rockefeller. WILSON: The vast majority of our collections are from those citizen-science-collected specimens. SOLOMON: The outsiders are extra eyes on the ground, but they also pitch in for the intense process of documenting those new species in the scientific literature.

The storm is remarkable not only for the damage it caused to cities along the coast, but the flooding it brought to inland communities. And powerful storms like Ian are more likely as the Earth gets hotter because of climate change. Rebecca Hersher from NPR's climate team joins us now. Rebecca, thanks for being with us. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Hi, Scott. SIMON: How did climate change affect this storm? HERSHER: Well, it all goes back to the basics of climate change - you know, heat. The planet is about two degrees Fahrenheit hotter than it was in the late 1800s. And that means the ocean water where hurricanes are born is warming up. All that heat is fuel. So what happened here is when Ian was still a baby hurricane, basically, it moved over abnormally hot water. Some of the water on the surface of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico was nearly 90 degrees, which is significantly hotter than normal for this time of year. And all that heat helped Ian get really big and really strong. And studies actually show that around the world, climate change is making big, strong hurricanes more common. And that's even though the total number of storms is not going up. SIMON: Ian gained strength quickly before it hit Florida. It went from a tropical storm to a hurricane in less than a day, and then it became a major hurricane. Is all that also fueled by climate change? HERSHER: Yeah. And this is actually a very active area of climate research because there is evidence that exactly this kind of rapid intensification, as you've talked about - it's getting more common as the Earth heats up. And we've seen it in recent years here in the U. S. , for sure. You know, it happened to Hurricane Harvey in Texas, Hurricane Michael in the Florida Panhandle, Laura and Ida in Louisiana, and now Ian. And the very simple idea is that when the water is abnormally hot, it helps storms grow really quickly. But the other thing to remember is that wind conditions also play a big role. And it's less clear how climate change might be affecting that part of the equation. SIMON: What about all the flooding we're seeing? HERSHER: Well, there are two ways that climate change can influence flooding. And let's start with storm surge 'cause that was such a big part of Ian. And that's when a storm pushes ocean water inland. And storm surge from Ian caused enormous amounts of damage. You know, entire neighborhoods are just gone. And the more powerful the storm, the more dangerous the storm surge sort of as a rule. There's another way that climate change can affect storm surge, and that's sea level rise. Remember, global warming is causing oceans to rise slowly and steadily. And there are parts of Florida where ocean water is already flooding streets, even on sunny days. So if you imagine that that's the baseline, that makes the flooding worse when a storm like Ian does make landfall. SIMON: And what about the areas that are far from where Ian made landfall? - because there are parts of central Florida that got more than two feet of rain from Ian. HERSHER: You know, it all goes back to that extra heat. You know, as a storm like Ian moves across hot water, it sucks up moisture, and hotter air can hold more water vapor. So when Ian hit land, it was holding a tremendous amount of moisture. And all of that moisture - it fell as rain. And studies have shown that recent storms dumped more rain than they would have if climate change wasn't happening. And actually, there's a really preliminary analysis that shows that Ian dumped at least 10% more rain in Florida than it would have without global warming. Now, there's one other thing that is really, really important here. Rain does not just fall close to where the storm hits land. It can fall hundreds, even thousands of miles away - in places where people thought they were safe, right? And historically, flooding is the single most dangerous hazard from hurricanes. So as the Earth does get hotter, more and more people will need to be prepared for this kind of weather during hurricane season. SIMON: Rebecca Hersher from NPR's climate team. Thanks so much. HERSHER: Thanks. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   More than a million people were still without power in Florida last night in the wake of Hurricane Ian. The storm is remarkable not only for the damage it caused to cities along the coast, but the flooding it brought to inland communities. And powerful storms like Ian are more likely as the Earth gets hotter because of climate change. Rebecca Hersher from NPR's climate team joins us now. Rebecca, thanks for being with us. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Hi, Scott. SIMON: How did climate change affect this storm? HERSHER: Well, it all goes back to the basics of climate change - you know, heat. The planet is about two degrees Fahrenheit hotter than it was in the late 1800s. And that means the ocean water where hurricanes are born is warming up. All that heat is fuel. So what happened here is when Ian was still a baby hurricane, basically, it moved over abnormally hot water. Some of the water on the surface of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico was nearly 90 degrees, which is significantly hotter than normal for this time of year. And all that heat helped Ian get really big and really strong. And studies actually show that around the world, climate change is making big, strong hurricanes more common. And that's even though the total number of storms is not going up. SIMON: Ian gained strength quickly before it hit Florida. It went from a tropical storm to a hurricane in less than a day, and then it became a major hurricane. Is all that also fueled by climate change? HERSHER: Yeah. And this is actually a very active area of climate research because there is evidence that exactly this kind of rapid intensification, as you've talked about - it's getting more common as the Earth heats up. And we've seen it in recent years here in the U. S. , for sure. You know, it happened to Hurricane Harvey in Texas, Hurricane Michael in the Florida Panhandle, Laura and Ida in Louisiana, and now Ian. And the very simple idea is that when the water is abnormally hot, it helps storms grow really quickly. But the other thing to remember is that wind conditions also play a big role. And it's less clear how climate change might be affecting that part of the equation. SIMON: What about all the flooding we're seeing? HERSHER: Well, there are two ways that climate change can influence flooding. And let's start with storm surge 'cause that was such a big part of Ian. And that's when a storm pushes ocean water inland. And storm surge from Ian caused enormous amounts of damage. You know, entire neighborhoods are just gone. And the more powerful the storm, the more dangerous the storm surge sort of as a rule. There's another way that climate change can affect storm surge, and that's sea level rise. Remember, global warming is causing oceans to rise slowly and steadily. And there are parts of Florida where ocean water is already flooding streets, even on sunny days. So if you imagine that that's the baseline, that makes the flooding worse when a storm like Ian does make landfall. SIMON: And what about the areas that are far from where Ian made landfall? - because there are parts of central Florida that got more than two feet of rain from Ian. HERSHER: You know, it all goes back to that extra heat. You know, as a storm like Ian moves across hot water, it sucks up moisture, and hotter air can hold more water vapor. So when Ian hit land, it was holding a tremendous amount of moisture. And all of that moisture - it fell as rain. And studies have shown that recent storms dumped more rain than they would have if climate change wasn't happening. And actually, there's a really preliminary analysis that shows that Ian dumped at least 10% more rain in Florida than it would have without global warming. Now, there's one other thing that is really, really important here. Rain does not just fall close to where the storm hits land. It can fall hundreds, even thousands of miles away - in places where people thought they were safe, right? And historically, flooding is the single most dangerous hazard from hurricanes. So as the Earth does get hotter, more and more people will need to be prepared for this kind of weather during hurricane season. SIMON: Rebecca Hersher from NPR's climate team. Thanks so much.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Theories say the explanation may be hidden in the electric dipole moment of the neutron. It's not a moment as in a moment in time. It refers to the neutron being slightly more football shaped than perfectly spherical. SIMON: That, of course, our colleague, correspondent Joe Palca. He's made an art form out of explaining the incredibly difficult to explain - you know, like the electric dipole moment. After 30 years - 30 years - of covering science for NPR, Joe is retiring. Joe, say it ain't so. PALCA: Yeah, can't really - I decided. But, you know, I ask myself, why am I leaving? - 'cause I still love what I do. And I think the answer is it just felt like it was time. And it's better to leave when people wish you wouldn't than. . . SIMON: (Laughter). PALCA: . . . Wait until the other turns out to be the case. SIMON: Better to jump than be pushed, right? PALCA: Yeah, something like that. SIMON: Aw. Well, we will miss you, but we have a lot to ask you on your way out of the building, OK? You've been our guide to so many important stories over the years. What drove you into science reporting? PALCA: I think the interesting part to me is - like, that question you asked, what's the electric dipole moment? And by the way, it's the electric dipole moment. . . SIMON: Excuse me, you asked that question. PALCA: Oh, right. SIMON: I merely quoted it. It had never occurred to me in all my life. But, yes. PALCA: Well, exactly. You're perfectly right. And I never heard of it either. And I didn't know what it meant or anything. But I knew that a lot of people were spending a lot of time looking for it. And there's something magical about the search for something that's so obscure but potentially so important. Obviously, a lot of people thought this was a story about corned beef sandwiches and were disappointed when they had to learn about the electric dipole moment of the neutron. But I feel that there's a beauty in that and that if people can be shown that beauty or help them see that beauty, that you have a window on - that's wonderful. SIMON: Joe, tell us about covering the Mars rover landings from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. PALCA: Well, I got sent there for the first time for Mars in 1997, when there was this little mission called Pathfinder, which was - compared to other NASA missions, it was a little more like, let's go down to the barn and build a spaceship kind of thing. It didn't have thousands of engineers. It was a small team. And that mission was successful. Then the next time there was a landing, they sent David Kestenbaum, and the lander crashed and was destroyed on Mars. And then they said, well, let's go back to Palca. And I did the next four in a row, and they all succeeded - and then several more in a row. So I've actually covered all the successful Mars landings since 1997, and the only one that failed was the one when they foolishly assigned David Kestenbaum to the story. So NASA is actually quite nervous that I'm stepping away. SIMON: Yes. And my gosh, with good reason. PALCA: Yep. SIMON: You know, we have a clip from your piece about the second Mars rover landing back in 2004. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)ROB MANNING: At this time, we are five minutes, 55 seconds after entry. We should be bouncing on the ground. PALCA: Bouncing on the ground protected by airbags, that is. If the airbags didn't inflate, the rover wouldn't bounce so much as splat. But they did inflate. MANNING: We're getting a bounce to signal. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Yeah. MANNING: We're getting a bounce signal. PALCA: You know, when I hear that, the hair still stands up on the back of my neck 'cause that's Rob Manning who's saying that. And, you know, I got to know him, and I hear his excitement. And it's pretty powerful. SIMON: And what's it like to cover a moment that is part of history? PALCA: Well, you want to be honest to the moment. And there were some people who said, oh, Joe, you know, you're getting too excited. You're making it sound, you know, like you're a cheerleader. And I'm thinking, no, I'm not being a cheerleader. I'm talking about that moment. It was amazing. You know, you can go back and say, well, should we have spent the money, and did it work, and did we get enough out of it? And that's fine. But at that moment, it was pretty spectacular. SIMON: Joe, there's a tragic moment I think both of us remember - February 1, 2003. The Columbia space shuttle fell apart on reentry over the skies of Texas. We were both in the studio that day for our live coverage. PALCA: I remember it really well. Gwen Thompkins called my house shortly after nine that morning and she said. . . SIMON: Gwen - Gwen was our editor then. . . PALCA: Yeah, that's right. And she said, the shuttle is delayed. And my first thought was, no. Delayed is not good because there's no, like, go around and try again. And so I jumped in my car and came down to the studio, and we tried to figure out what was going on, you know, that was - nobody knew. And I didn't know that much about the mission, but I knew about the program, and I was able to add some perspective, I guess. SIMON: Yeah. All the science we've learned about from you - what stands out for you that you learned and were able to pass on to so many? PALCA: I think - you know, there's another one you may not have heard of called CRISPR. It's a biological technique for altering genes or clipping out genes and things like that. And when I first read about CRISPR, I had no idea what it was. And I still - if you pressed me, I couldn't exactly tell you how it works, but I know what it does. And when I heard this from the woman who did it, I thought, this woman is going to win the Nobel Prize. And yeah, she won the Nobel Prize - Jennifer Doudna. SIMON: Joe, I think a lot of us - a high point for WEEKEND EDITION listeners was you made a pickle glow. Do you remember that? PALCA: Yeah. You guys decided to do a live show, and somebody said, hey, Joe, can you come up with a demo that is cool-looking? SIMON: Well, we do - a live show before an audience. PALCA: Yeah. Well - sorry. That's what I meant. And we did this live. I mean, I can't believe we tried it. It might have been a big failure, but turned out it wasn't. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)PALCA: So let's plug it in and see what happens. You can see it's - now, I don't know if you can see Scott, but there just - there's a little bit of smoke coming out of the end. SIMON: It's a pickle, Joe. I don't. . . PALCA: Well, now, just wait a minute. SIMON: Oh, wait. I see some smoke. PALCA: Yes, you see some smoke. SIMON: I see some smoke coming out of the end. It looks like - oh, my word - is that. . . (CHEERING)SIMON: The pickle is ablaze. The pickle's aglow. Wow. You know, I sound as excited as if - another moon landing (laughter). PALCA: Well, you know, glowing pickles have that effect on some people. What can I say? It was a - it was a great moment. Kind of silly. Not the most serious piece I've ever done, but it was fun. And it did have a bit of science. SIMON: But you touch on something which I think has really enlivened your work. Sometimes there doesn't have to be an obvious application. It's just marvelous to know and to observe the majesty of science. PALCA: Yeah. There's a famous question that somebody was asking in Congress, actually, about the Fermilab, which was national accelerator. And this senator was asking him, well, how is this going to help the defense of America? And the scientist says, it's not. And he said, not at all? He said, no. It's just going to make America more worth defending. And I think it's part of our culture to explore the natural world. And it makes us better for it. And some things we'll learn, and they may be stuck on a shelf and never turn out to be all that relevant - and some things that'll be fantastically relevant and change the way we think of ourselves. SIMON: Yeah. Well, Joe, thank you for everything you've done for us and meant to us over these past 30 years. And it is a sad honor for me to say one last time - NPR's Joe Palca. Thanks so much. PALCA: Scott, it's been my pleasure.

And I didn't know that much about the mission, but I knew about the program, and I was able to add some perspective, I guess. SIMON: Yeah. All the science we've learned about from you - what stands out for you that you learned and were able to pass on to so many? PALCA: I think - you know, there's another one you may not have heard of called CRISPR. It's a biological technique for altering genes or clipping out genes and things like that. And when I first read about CRISPR, I had no idea what it was. And I still - if you pressed me, I couldn't exactly tell you how it works, but I know what it does. And when I heard this from the woman who did it, I thought, this woman is going to win the Nobel Prize. And yeah, she won the Nobel Prize - Jennifer Doudna. SIMON: Joe, I think a lot of us - a high point for WEEKEND EDITION listeners was you made a pickle glow. Do you remember that? PALCA: Yeah. You guys decided to do a live show, and somebody said, hey, Joe, can you come up with a demo that is cool-looking? SIMON: Well, we do - a live show before an audience. PALCA: Yeah. Well - sorry. That's what I meant. And we did this live. I mean, I can't believe we tried it. It might have been a big failure, but turned out it wasn't. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) PALCA: So let's plug it in and see what happens. You can see it's - now, I don't know if you can see Scott, but there just - there's a little bit of smoke coming out of the end. SIMON: It's a pickle, Joe. I don't. . . PALCA: Well, now, just wait a minute. SIMON: Oh, wait. I see some smoke. PALCA: Yes, you see some smoke. SIMON: I see some smoke coming out of the end. It looks like - oh, my word - is that. . . (CHEERING) SIMON: The pickle is ablaze. The pickle's aglow. Wow. You know, I sound as excited as if - another moon landing (laughter). PALCA: Well, you know, glowing pickles have that effect on some people. What can I say? It was a - it was a great moment. Kind of silly. Not the most serious piece I've ever done, but it was fun. And it did have a bit of science. SIMON: But you touch on something which I think has really enlivened your work. Sometimes there doesn't have to be an obvious application. It's just marvelous to know and to observe the majesty of science. PALCA: Yeah. There's a famous question that somebody was asking in Congress, actually, about the Fermilab, which was national accelerator. And this senator was asking him, well, how is this going to help the defense of America? And the scientist says, it's not. And he said, not at all? He said, no. It's just going to make America more worth defending. And I think it's part of our culture to explore the natural world. And it makes us better for it. And some things we'll learn, and they may be stuck on a shelf and never turn out to be all that relevant - and some things that'll be fantastically relevant and change the way we think of ourselves. SIMON: Yeah. Well, Joe, thank you for everything you've done for us and meant to us over these past 30 years. And it is a sad honor for me to say one last time - NPR's Joe Palca. Thanks so much.

People convey messages by what they say and also the way they say it. And the voice may also help doctors to diagnose conditions. Dr. Yael Bensoussan directs the Health Voice Center at the University of South Florida. YAEL BENSOUSSAN: When we talk about the human voice, we talk about the sound that the vocal cords make, sounds like E, the way that the vocal cords vibrate, but also the way we speak. And speech is the way we articulate the sound, the way the sound goes into what we call our resonators - the nose cavity, the mouth cavity - and the way we use our breathing to talk. LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Dr. Bensoussan says the voice gives her clues to five main categories of conditions. BENSOUSSAN: The first one is neurological disorders, like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS. Then we have voice disorders, like laryngeal cancer. Then we have mood disorders. We know that we can find a lot of changes in voice in depression and mood disorders. Fourth categories is respiratory disorders. People with lung diseases can cough a different way. And then the last one is pediatric disorders, like autism and speech delays. INSKEEP: So what do those variations sound like? Here's an example - a voice with vocal fold paralysis from the Voice Foundation at St. John's University. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: The blue spot is on the key again. How hard did he hit him? FADEL: And here's the voice of someone with cancer in their larynx, also from the Voice Foundation at St. John's University. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: The blue spot is the key again. How hard did it hit him? FADEL: And a voice of someone diagnosed with Parkinson's from a company called SpeechVive. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: When sunlight strikes rainbows in the air, they act like a prism and form a rainbow. BENSOUSSAN: Somebody with Parkinson's disease not only has a lower voice so that usually the frequency of the voice is a little bit lower; the speed of the way they speak is a little bit lower, more monotonous. FADEL: Now with funding from NIH, Dr. Bensoussan and her co-director on the project are attempting to build an app to help diagnose diseases by listening to the quality of someone's voice. BENSOUSSAN: We're developing the database for researchers to have access and also the tool to capture the voice. INSKEEP: Yeah. As more people upload their voices to this app and the database grows, the algorithm's disease detection accuracy may improve. The researchers plan to include many voices to ensure their data is reflective of the population. BENSOUSSAN: Training an algorithm on a group of 30 white males that are all 70 years old is not going to give good accuracy. And that's why serving the remote communities and underserved communities - it's so important. We want to capture the voices of these people as well that are underrepresented to make sure that the tools we develop are applicable to them. FADEL: So can an app like this replace a regular medical screening in the future? Dr. Bensoussan says, no. She says the app will only flag signs of disease. BENSOUSSAN: A family doctor, for example, that's in a remote community could use our tools and record the voice of the patients, put in the history, and the app could say, there's a very high chance this is cancer, actually. You should definitely have them seen by an expert in a very timely manner. INSKEEP: Of course, if you're giving clues about yourself through your voice, that does raise privacy concerns. So the doctor says they have a team of bioethicists on board. BENSOUSSAN: We know that technology can do crazy things. So it's kind of our job and our responsibility to make sure we put boundaries to that. INSKEEP: Dr. Bensoussan says with the help of other researchers, it should take around four years to develop a tool that can help doctors with diagnosis and screening.

(SOUNDBITE OF BEEPING)MARTINEZ: That's right - the original table tennis arcade game from the 1970s. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports that this novel achievement is part of a larger effort to understand how brain cells learn. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: A living brain has a kind of intelligence that a computer usually lacks. Take, for example, the average person's ability to make a cup of tea, says Brett Kagan, the chief scientific officer of Cortical Labs in Melbourne, Australia. BRETT KAGAN: You might have never been in someone else's house, but with a bit of rummaging and searching you can probably make a decent cup of tea as long as they've got the ingredients. HAMILTON: But even a powerful computer would struggle with that task. So Cortical Labs has been trying to understand how living brain cells acquire their intelligence. Kagan says the Pong experiment was a way for the company to answer a central question about a network of brain cells. KAGAN: If we do allow these cells to know the outcome of their actions, will they actually be able to change in some sort of goal-directed way? HAMILTON: To find out, the scientists used a system that links a network of brain cells to a computer. First, the computer generated a game of Pong. Then it began sending signals to the cells, telling them where the ball was. At the same time, Kagan says, the computer began monitoring signals sent by the cells. KAGAN: And what we did is we took that information, and we allowed it to influence this Pong game that they were playing so they could move the paddle around. HAMILTON: The cells just had to figure out how to control the paddle's movement. To help them learn, Kagan says, the scientists provided the cells with something you might call motivation. It came in the form of electrical stimulation. KAGAN: If they hit the ball, we gave them something predictable - so very simple, predictable stimulus was the same every time. When they missed it, they got something that was totally unpredictable - white noise, a different white noise every time. HAMILTON: Brain cells like predictable stimulation. So they began to learn how to send signals that would move the paddle in front of the ball. The brain cells never got that good, but human brain cells seemed to play a bit better than mouse brain cells. And Kagan says they all did pretty well, considering that the entire network contained fewer cells than the brain of a cockroach. KAGAN: If you could see a cockroach playing a game of Pong and it was able to hit the ball twice as often as it was missing it, you would be pretty impressed with that cockroach. HAMILTON: Kagan says the results, which appear in the journal Neuron, hint at a future in which biology helps computers become more intelligent. But Steve M. Potter, an adjunct associate professor at Georgia Tech, says that future is probably still a long way off. STEVE M POTTER: The idea of a computer that has some living components is exciting, and it's starting to become reality. However, the kinds of learning that these things can accomplish is quite rudimentary right now. HAMILTON: Even so, Potter says, the Pong-playing system is a great tool for doing research. POTTER: This is sort of a semi-living animal model that one can use to study all sorts of mechanisms in the nervous system. HAMILTON: Including learning. Jon Hamilton, NPR News.

SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:  And like Mary Louise, I also turned 50 last year. KELLY: (Laughter) Who knew? PFEIFFER: Short Wave is NPR's daily science podcast. And to celebrate, its hosts, Emily Kwong and Aaron Scott are here to - actually, we're going to let them explain what they're here to do. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)EMILY KWONG, BYLINE: Welcome to Gee Golly Whiz Bowl, Short Wave's science quiz show. I also turned - no, no. (LAUGHTER)KWONG: I turned 3 yesterday. KELLY: Happy birthday to us all. (LAUGHTER)KWONG: So hey, both of you. We're a daily science podcast that considers the science, and we believe that science is for everyone. AARON SCOTT, BYLINE: We love to talk about space, climate change, physics, critters. We bring it all. And today, we have a few questions for you to make sure you've been paying attention in science class. KELLY: Oh, boy. All right. SCOTT: Welcome. KELLY: (Laughter). KWONG: Putting you in the hot seat. All right, Sacha, Mary Louise, let's start with a newsy question. Last week, the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded for what kind of research? (SOUNDBITE OF CLOCK TICKING)KELLY: I have no idea. Sacha? PFEIFFER: No. I read the headline, and now I realize I cannot tell you, like, what exactly that physicist did. KELLY: OK. KWONG: All right. (SOUNDBITE OF BUZZER)KWONG: I'm going to help you out. The answer to the question is quantum physics. KELLY: OK. KWONG: So three scientists shared this award for experiments showing that two particles - let's say Mary Louise Kelly and Sacha Pfeiffer - could behave like a single unit even when far apart, a phenomenon which is known as quantum entanglement. And that innovation is what is allowing for quantum computers, which tech companies are investing billions in developing. KELLY: Cool. KWONG: I talked about this with Geoff Brumfiel. He saw this computer in real life. And he explained to me why these computers are able to go so much faster with the help of Google engineer Marissa Giustina. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: So first, imagine a regular computer is like a board game with square spaces, and you're trying to get to a diagonal space. KWONG: Can I move diagonally like in checkers? BRUMFIEL: No. No, you can't. MARISSA GIUSTINA: You have to take two steps - one up and one to the left or something. BRUMFIEL: So then imagine a quantum computer has hexagonal spaces. KWONG: Oh, like Settlers of Catan. BRUMFIEL: Yep. Exactly. GIUSTINA: If you are on a hexagonal board or a board with diagonals, then you can do that in one step. KWONG: So with a quantum computer, it's a faster way to make the same exact moves. Get it? KELLY: It's starting to make sense. KWONG: OK. All right. KELLY: Yeah. KWONG: Yeah. This is the kind of science we like on Short Wave. For us, it's all about maintaining curiosity for how things actually work. SCOTT: Next question - this is a completely different field - what is this animal? (SOUNDBITE OF BABY BONOBO VOCALIZING)KELLY: Is it a baby monkey? SCOTT: Getting really close. Here's our answer. (SOUNDBITE OF BABY BONOBO VOCALIZING)KWONG: Poor baby bonobo. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: Here's something Dr. Jonas Mukamba told us. He's the lead veterinarian at the sanctuary. JONAS MUKAMBA: (Speaking French). HAMILTON: What he's saying is that, with bonobos, the females dominate and that a female is always the head of the group. SCOTT: So this is a story that Jon Hamilton reported about research in a bonobo sanctuary and what it's teaching us about how people - how we - evolved. KELLY: I never would have guessed that was a bonobo. But I do speak French, and he said the females are the boss. (LAUGHTER)KELLY: Oh, yeah. I'm all in. KWONG: That's right. You heard it here first translated on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. All right. I think the score is kind of 1 to 0. Are we going to give this point to Mary Louise? KELLY: Yes. KWONG: Our producers are nodding yes. SCOTT: Let us keep going. Emily Kwong is the kind of host who loves heading out for Short Wave, sometimes into very challenging situations. Which of the following has she not done for our show - run a marathon, hung out with giant bears, crawled into a toxic cave looking for wriggling worm blobs or recalled her past life in the circus? PFEIFFER: I'm going to give a practical answer, which is that Emily. . . SCOTT: OK. PFEIFFER: . . . Did not climb into a toxic cave because NPR would have a serious employee liability problem. KELLY: (Laughter). KWONG: Sacha, I most certainly did not. But you know who did? PFEIFFER: Who did? SCOTT: Right here. Right here. So kind of cheap, but no point for that one. (SOUNDBITE OF BUZZER)SCOTT: It was a trick question. (SOUNDBITE OF BOOING)SCOTT: It wasn't Emily. It was actually me. It was for a series we did about science taking place in our public lands. And to your point, I had to put on a breathing apparatus and crawl into this cave to find these little worms that only live in sulfuric water in the spring in this cave. DAVID STEINMANN: And if you look, you can see clumps of worms everywhere. SCOTT: Wow. They really are everywhere. I'm mean, it's stunning. STEINMANN: I'm just going to collect a couple of worms real quickly. SCOTT: The worm blobs look like little blood-red sea anemones wriggling in this stream bed. And they live off the bacteria that in turn lives off the sulfur. So it's easy to see why scientists looked at places like this sulfur cave to dream up what life might look like on other planets. PFEIFFER: I hope, Aaron, you haven't had to file any worker's comp paperwork for injuries or toxins inhaled in that cave. SCOTT: Nope. My air started to run out, but I still had plenty to get out of the cave. It wasn't that big, so it was nothing but kind of fulfilling a childhood fantasy. I'd stood at the edge of this cave and looked in as a kid and always wanted to explore it. And thanks to Short Wave, I got to go in. KWONG: By my estimation, the score is 1 to 1. You are tied. Aaron, next question. SCOTT: Perfect. Our next topic is moving on to genetics. Short Wave did an entire series on the different kinds of tastes that we called Taste Buddies. Mary Louise and Sacha, I would love if you would tell me what taste evolved to keep us from poisoning ourselves. PFEIFFER: My husband happens to be a seventh-grade science teacher, and he teaches genetics, so I feel like I. . . KELLY: Oh, unfair advantage that should have been disclosed at the get-go, but go on. KWONG: This may be a conflict of interest I'm detecting. PFEIFFER: I feel like I have to take a shot at this just because I live with a science teacher. SCOTT: Yes, please. Go for it. PFEIFFER: I am going to say that it is bitterness that is the tipoff. (SOUNDBITE OF BELL)SCOTT: You are correct. This is a scientist we talked to - Masha Niv - explaining it. MASHA NIV: So bitter, as the common paradigm says, it has to protect from poisons because in the world around us, there are plants and there are insects and there are lots of natural chemical compounds around us. And we kind of need these receptors to say, OK, it's something new. Let's first be a little bit careful about it, a little bit averse to it. SCOTT: OK. So I think our final tally is 1 to 1. It's a tie. KWONG: Hurray. SCOTT: Which is. . . KELLY: Hurray. We're all the winners. SCOTT: . . . So very NPR. Yes. (LAUGHTER)PFEIFFER: Participation trophies. KWONG: Goodness. But seriously, we love the work you do on this show. It's an honor to be here. And this is truly what Short Wave is about - deep dives into the science that makes up our universe and drives the day's headlines. PFEIFFER: Thank you, and happy 3rd birthday. KELLY: To hear a fuller version of our quiz, you can check out today's episode of Short Wave. PFEIFFER: Short Wave is NPR's daily science podcast. And Emily Kwong and Aaron Scott are its hosts. Thanks again. SCOTT: Thank you. KWONG: Thank you so much. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   You may know that, last year, NPR and ALL THINGS CONSIDERED turned 50. So did I, while we're at it.

(SOUNDBITE OF CLOCK TICKING) KELLY: I have no idea. Sacha? PFEIFFER: No. I read the headline, and now I realize I cannot tell you, like, what exactly that physicist did. KELLY: OK. KWONG: All right. (SOUNDBITE OF BUZZER) KWONG: I'm going to help you out. The answer to the question is quantum physics. KELLY: OK. KWONG: So three scientists shared this award for experiments showing that two particles - let's say Mary Louise Kelly and Sacha Pfeiffer - could behave like a single unit even when far apart, a phenomenon which is known as quantum entanglement. And that innovation is what is allowing for quantum computers, which tech companies are investing billions in developing. KELLY: Cool. KWONG: I talked about this with Geoff Brumfiel. He saw this computer in real life. And he explained to me why these computers are able to go so much faster with the help of Google engineer Marissa Giustina. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: So first, imagine a regular computer is like a board game with square spaces, and you're trying to get to a diagonal space. KWONG: Can I move diagonally like in checkers? BRUMFIEL: No. No, you can't. MARISSA GIUSTINA: You have to take two steps - one up and one to the left or something. BRUMFIEL: So then imagine a quantum computer has hexagonal spaces. KWONG: Oh, like Settlers of Catan. BRUMFIEL: Yep. Exactly. GIUSTINA: If you are on a hexagonal board or a board with diagonals, then you can do that in one step. KWONG: So with a quantum computer, it's a faster way to make the same exact moves. Get it? KELLY: It's starting to make sense. KWONG: OK. All right. KELLY: Yeah. KWONG: Yeah. This is the kind of science we like on Short Wave. For us, it's all about maintaining curiosity for how things actually work. SCOTT: Next question - this is a completely different field - what is this animal? (SOUNDBITE OF BABY BONOBO VOCALIZING) KELLY: Is it a baby monkey? SCOTT: Getting really close. Here's our answer. (SOUNDBITE OF BABY BONOBO VOCALIZING) KWONG: Poor baby bonobo. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: Here's something Dr. Jonas Mukamba told us. He's the lead veterinarian at the sanctuary. JONAS MUKAMBA: (Speaking French). HAMILTON: What he's saying is that, with bonobos, the females dominate and that a female is always the head of the group. SCOTT: So this is a story that Jon Hamilton reported about research in a bonobo sanctuary and what it's teaching us about how people - how we - evolved. KELLY: I never would have guessed that was a bonobo. But I do speak French, and he said the females are the boss. (LAUGHTER) KELLY: Oh, yeah. I'm all in. KWONG: That's right. You heard it here first translated on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. All right. I think the score is kind of 1 to 0. Are we going to give this point to Mary Louise? KELLY: Yes. KWONG: Our producers are nodding yes. SCOTT: Let us keep going. Emily Kwong is the kind of host who loves heading out for Short Wave, sometimes into very challenging situations. Which of the following has she not done for our show - run a marathon, hung out with giant bears, crawled into a toxic cave looking for wriggling worm blobs or recalled her past life in the circus? PFEIFFER: I'm going to give a practical answer, which is that Emily. . . SCOTT: OK. PFEIFFER: . . . Did not climb into a toxic cave because NPR would have a serious employee liability problem. KELLY: (Laughter). KWONG: Sacha, I most certainly did not. But you know who did? PFEIFFER: Who did? SCOTT: Right here. Right here. So kind of cheap, but no point for that one. (SOUNDBITE OF BUZZER) SCOTT: It was a trick question. (SOUNDBITE OF BOOING) SCOTT: It wasn't Emily. It was actually me. It was for a series we did about science taking place in our public lands. And to your point, I had to put on a breathing apparatus and crawl into this cave to find these little worms that only live in sulfuric water in the spring in this cave. DAVID STEINMANN: And if you look, you can see clumps of worms everywhere. SCOTT: Wow. They really are everywhere. I'm mean, it's stunning. STEINMANN: I'm just going to collect a couple of worms real quickly. SCOTT: The worm blobs look like little blood-red sea anemones wriggling in this stream bed. And they live off the bacteria that in turn lives off the sulfur. So it's easy to see why scientists looked at places like this sulfur cave to dream up what life might look like on other planets. PFEIFFER: I hope, Aaron, you haven't had to file any worker's comp paperwork for injuries or toxins inhaled in that cave. SCOTT: Nope. My air started to run out, but I still had plenty to get out of the cave. It wasn't that big, so it was nothing but kind of fulfilling a childhood fantasy. I'd stood at the edge of this cave and looked in as a kid and always wanted to explore it. And thanks to Short Wave, I got to go in. KWONG: By my estimation, the score is 1 to 1. You are tied. Aaron, next question. SCOTT: Perfect. Our next topic is moving on to genetics. Short Wave did an entire series on the different kinds of tastes that we called Taste Buddies. Mary Louise and Sacha, I would love if you would tell me what taste evolved to keep us from poisoning ourselves. PFEIFFER: My husband happens to be a seventh-grade science teacher, and he teaches genetics, so I feel like I. . . KELLY: Oh, unfair advantage that should have been disclosed at the get-go, but go on. KWONG: This may be a conflict of interest I'm detecting. PFEIFFER: I feel like I have to take a shot at this just because I live with a science teacher. SCOTT: Yes, please. Go for it. PFEIFFER: I am going to say that it is bitterness that is the tipoff. (SOUNDBITE OF BELL) SCOTT: You are correct. This is a scientist we talked to - Masha Niv - explaining it. MASHA NIV: So bitter, as the common paradigm says, it has to protect from poisons because in the world around us, there are plants and there are insects and there are lots of natural chemical compounds around us. And we kind of need these receptors to say, OK, it's something new. Let's first be a little bit careful about it, a little bit averse to it. SCOTT: OK. So I think our final tally is 1 to 1. It's a tie. KWONG: Hurray. SCOTT: Which is. . . KELLY: Hurray. We're all the winners. SCOTT: . . . So very NPR. Yes. (LAUGHTER) PFEIFFER: Participation trophies. KWONG: Goodness. But seriously, we love the work you do on this show. It's an honor to be here. And this is truly what Short Wave is about - deep dives into the science that makes up our universe and drives the day's headlines. PFEIFFER: Thank you, and happy 3rd birthday. KELLY: To hear a fuller version of our quiz, you can check out today's episode of Short Wave. PFEIFFER: Short Wave is NPR's daily science podcast. And Emily Kwong and Aaron Scott are its hosts. Thanks again. SCOTT: Thank you. KWONG: Thank you so much.", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But what does climate change sound like? Some scientists who study glaciers have been listening. AMART\u00cdNEZ, HOST:  They use underwater microphones known as hydrophones. Grant Deane, a research oceanographer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, says that gives them a deeper insight into how fast the glaciers are melting. GRANT DEANE: I think the audio offers advantages that are difficult to get elsewhere. Pictures won't tell you what's going on under the water. MARTIN: What does a glacier sound like? This is the Hans Glacier in southwestern Spitsberg, between Norway and Greenland. (SOUNDBITE OF WATER FLOWING AND ICE CRACKING)DEANE: When you put a hydrophone in the water, you hear all kinds of things. You hear the ice melting, sure. You also hear ice breaking off the ice drift. And our very first job was to catalog those different sources, understand their properties and make sure that we can distinguish one source from another. MART\u00cdNEZ: So what does that rapid drip sound to scientists about glacier melt? Here's Oregon State University glaciologist Erin Pettit. ERIN PETTIT: I can listen to these sounds and actually get a feel for what the glacier is doing just from listening. And if we listen enough and we know something about the glacier behavior, we can link that together and think of it as a whole system and how the sound can give us clues to changes before our eyes might notice. MARTIN: And deciphering those audio clues could mean getting more accurate forecasts of sea level rise, says Grant Deane. DEANE: If we can count the bubbles being released into the water from the noises that they make, we can figure out how quickly the ice is melting. We need to understand these things if we're going to predict sea level rise accurately. MART\u00cdNEZ: Sea level rise presents a serious problem. Deane says even a small increase will make that problem worse. At least we know the scientists are listening.

That means no doctor's office visit or a prescription to get them. And it could mean less expensive options for millions of people in this country with hearing loss. Nina Keck reports on aging for Vermont Public. And she's here to tell us more about the new devices. Welcome. NINA KECK, BYLINE: Thank you. CHANG: So, Nina, I understand you've actually been talking a lot about these over-the-counter hearing aids with your mom. Tell us what's. . . KECK: Right. CHANG: . . . Intrigued her so much about these new options? KECK: We were actually out shopping, browsing over-the-counter hearing aids at Best Buy yesterday. And like a lot of people, I think the price point is what's the biggest plus for her, plus convenience. My mom is in her late 80s, and like a lot of Americans, she put off getting prescription hearing aids longer than she probably should have mostly because of how much they cost. And just to explain to people that haven't gotten hearing aids before, they're really expensive. They can cost anywhere from $2,000 a pair up to 6,000 or more. CHANG: Wow. KECK: So they're a big-ticket item. And Medicare and most private insurance doesn't cover them. So my mom is excited about the price point. And she's also been seeing TV ads for over-the-counter hearing aids a lot lately, like this one for a brand called Lively. (SOUNDBITE OF AD)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: They cost thousands less. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: It's insanely user friendly. You take the hearing test online. The doctor programs in settings. You don't even need to go in to an office. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: They're delivered to your door in a few days, and you're up and running in no time. KECK: Delivered to your door, super convenient - I mean, it almost makes it sound like it's fun to get your hearing aids figured out. CHANG: And so easy. Well, how are these hearing aids different from, like, prescription hearing aids or some of the other devices that have been sold for years in drugstores? KECK: Yeah, you're probably talking about some of the low-cost headsets you might see to boost your TV or devices, like hunters or bird watchers wear, that amplifies sound. These are not those. Those are amplification devices. And to avoid confusion, you're going to want to look for the words hearing aid on the package to know that you are in fact getting a hearing aid. If it says that, it'll have customizable volume control, and it'll have met these new FDA standards for things like safety and labeling and effectiveness. The other difference between these new over-the-counter devices and the prescription devices that have been available is you don't go through a specialist. So you don't have an audiologist kind of holding your hand through the process. Consumers will do that themselves. And if they're tech savvy, that might be a breeze - downloading an app, working with a web interface. But, you know, going through - or thinking about my mother going through this process, someone who's not so tech savvy, who's got vision problems, I can see that being an issue. Kelley Rohrer, an audiologist at Rutland Regional Medical Center in Vermont, says she's getting all kinds of calls from people asking about these new devices. KELLEY ROHRER: I do love that there's some hype because it's getting the word out about hearing loss and hearing devices and destigmatizing all of them. But there's definitely the possibility of people spending money on something that's just not going to work for them. CHANG: But how do you avoid that? Like, I'm sure a lot of people are going to want to buy these. What advice do you have for them? KECK: Yeah. I think just main thing is, make sure you can get your money back. Have a long return window, at least 30 days, long warranty. And make sure whatever you buy has a lot of customer support backing it so if you need help, you can easily get it. Audiologists also recommend anyone experiencing hearing loss get a hearing test first to rule out any medical issues. CHANG: Nina Keck is a senior reporter with Vermont Public. Thank you, Nina.

Some mosquitoes seem especially drawn to certain people. They just fly away from others. Why is that? Leslie Vosshall and her team of researchers at the Rockefeller University decided to find out. She's the head of the laboratory of neurogenetics and behavior there. Dr. Vosshall, thanks so much for being with us. LESLIE VOSSHALL: My pleasure. Can't wait to talk about mosquito magnets. SIMON: Well, are you one? I mean, what gave you a personal interest in this? VOSSHALL: You know, I'm somewhere in the middle. I'm not that interesting to them. We worked on this because everybody wants to know, and for 15 years, every day, someone asks me, why am I always attacked at every picnic, and why are my children ignored? Why's my husband ignored? And so we decided to really attack it and do the science. SIMON: What's the short answer? VOSSHALL: The short answer is high levels of carboxylic acid on your skin. Carboxylic acids are that natural moisturizer that we all have that keeps our skin barrier healthy. SIMON: So do we make ourselves a magnet when we slather sun cream on or something? VOSSHALL: None of this makes any difference. The mosquitoes are really cuing into the natural fatty acids on the skin, and you can't strip them off, and you can't cover them up with perfume or anything. So that's why the magnets that we found at the beginning of the study, three years later, were still the peak-performing mosquito magnets. SIMON: Wow. I guess that's just our lot in life. Help us understand how you conducted the study. VOSSHALL: So the whole study was done with Aedes aegypti, which is a dangerous mosquito that spreads dengue, yellow fever, Zika, chikungunya. And so they love humans. They specialize on humans. They don't care about animals. And the way we did this is we - it involved pantyhose. So this was a big pantyhose experiment. We had people wear nylon stockings on their arms. We cut those smelly nylons into little pieces and used them as bait and then asked hungry female mosquitoes to choose between nylon No. 1 and nylon No. 2. We did over 2,500 contests in this big tournament to identify the most attractive person of them all. SIMON: The way you describe it, there is no way out. I mean, if you're just born that way, you're born that way. VOSSHALL: I don't know if that's comforting news. I think for the people who are magnets, at least you know that you have more carboxylic acids, and that's the reason why. SIMON: Yeah. Once you know this part of the puzzle, if I might put it this way, maybe people can develop some kind of treatment, something as simple as a repellant or maybe just - I don't know - series of inoculations that people might take. VOSSHALL: You're on the right track. So I think that that's why the basic science is important, is that until you figure out what it is, you can't figure out how to do the next step. So carboxylic acid levels really mean that you're going to be a magnet, so let's reduce them. Let's - maybe a skin cream that will change the chemistry of your skin, maybe beneficial bacteria that interact with our skin differently to make us less smelly. So there's lots of options, and the first step is the science that gives us the answer. SIMON: Is smelly a scientific term? VOSSHALL: I try to make the work accessible, yeah. I could say olfactory function, but let's go with smelly. SIMON: No, I absolutely agree. Leslie Vosshall, professor at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Rockefeller University, thanks so much for being with us. Oh, sorry - just a little something on my neck. VOSSHALL: It's been so great speaking with you. Thank you so much for your interest in our work. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   Now a story about a bunch of real bloodsuckers - not vampires, politicians or even journalists - mosquitoes. Some mosquitoes seem especially drawn to certain people. They just fly away from others. Why is that? Leslie Vosshall and her team of researchers at the Rockefeller University decided to find out. She's the head of the laboratory of neurogenetics and behavior there. Dr. Vosshall, thanks so much for being with us. LESLIE VOSSHALL: My pleasure. Can't wait to talk about mosquito magnets. SIMON: Well, are you one? I mean, what gave you a personal interest in this? VOSSHALL: You know, I'm somewhere in the middle. I'm not that interesting to them. We worked on this because everybody wants to know, and for 15 years, every day, someone asks me, why am I always attacked at every picnic, and why are my children ignored? Why's my husband ignored? And so we decided to really attack it and do the science. SIMON: What's the short answer? VOSSHALL: The short answer is high levels of carboxylic acid on your skin. Carboxylic acids are that natural moisturizer that we all have that keeps our skin barrier healthy. SIMON: So do we make ourselves a magnet when we slather sun cream on or something? VOSSHALL: None of this makes any difference. The mosquitoes are really cuing into the natural fatty acids on the skin, and you can't strip them off, and you can't cover them up with perfume or anything. So that's why the magnets that we found at the beginning of the study, three years later, were still the peak-performing mosquito magnets. SIMON: Wow. I guess that's just our lot in life.

We have got some frustrating news for you. You see, the vast majority of plastic that Americans are putting into recycling bins is not actually getting recycled. That's the finding of a new report out today from Greenpeace. And this may not be surprising for those of you who have followed NPR's own reporting, which found that oil and gas companies misled the public for years into believing that plastic could be recycled, even though they knew it wasn't true. Plastic waste, I mean, it's now expected to triple by 2060, all while the amount of plastic that's recycled into new things continues to drop dramatically. Here to sort through all of this is NPR investigative correspondent Laura Sullivan. Hi, Laura. LAURA SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: OK, so this is going to be really confusing for a lot of people, right? Like, we all see these recycling trucks pull up to the curb, haul away plastic, all these specialized recycling bins in parks and airports. Like, what is going on? SULLIVAN: Yeah. So for 30 years now, the public has hoped with every bottle and strawberry container and yogurt cup that they thoughtfully put in those bins that that plastic was going to go on to a happy new life somewhere as something else. But the truth is that it's not, and it likely never has. Greenpeace's report confirms what a lot of environmentalists have been saying for a while now, that aside from a few soda bottles and containers like milk jugs, there are no markets for used plastic trash. It's not economically feasible to collect it, to sort it or to sell it. And new plastic is cheap, and it's easy to make. CHANG: I mean, it's kind of breathtaking. What about all the plans that we have heard about over the years for soda bottles and other plastics to be in some so-called closed loop where. Like. The plastic is recycled and reused again and again? What happened to that? SULLIVAN: Right. So what the science is showing now is that even in the best scenarios, plastic can only be recycled once or twice before the chemicals break down. And this Greenpeace report notes that that plastic also becomes more toxic every time it's broken down. It's very different from steel and aluminum. I mean, you can melt and reform steel and aluminum for decades. And, you know, even if you do turn a few soda bottles into new shoes or jackets or carpets, it's just a temporary stop. Eventually, those shoes and carpets are going to become trash, too. CHANG: Well, then, Laura, if none of this plastic is really recyclable, then where is that recycling truck taking it? SULLIVAN: What the Greenpeace report found is that even though it may first go to a recycling center on that truck, that most of it is just getting landfilled, and some of it is winding up in poor countries or in the oceans. This is backed up by a lot of government numbers. After three decades of trying to recycle, the amount of plastic that actually gets turned into something new has now dropped to around 5%. And that will probably continue to get worse because every year, the amount of plastic produced increases. I wanted to get a sense of what this really looks like on the ground, so I reached out to Trent Carpenter, who runs Southern Oregon Sanitation. Carpenter told his customers a couple years ago that when it came to plastic, they could only put soda bottles and jugs into their recycling bins - no other plastic. TRENT CARPENTER: We really had to re-educate individuals that a great deal of that material is ending up in a landfill. It's not going to a recycling facility and being recycled. It's going to a recycling facility and then being landfilled someplace else because they can't do anything with that material. SULLIVAN: Carpenter told me that putting most plastic in a bin is just an expensive way to send it to a landfill. CHANG: Then why are so many trash haulers and even officials saying, go ahead, put your clamshells and all this other plastic into recycling bins? SULLIVAN: Right. I asked Carpenter this very question. This is what he told me. CARPENTER: It's easier, to be perfectly honest. Politically, it's easier to just say, gosh, we're going to take everything and we think we can get it recycled and then look the other way. That's greenwashing at its best. CHANG: I mean, this is really depressing. What are people supposed to do? SULLIVAN: Environmentalists really want to bring the conversation back to deposit bills, which can improve the conversation for plastic bottles. But they really want people to look at what they're holding in their hands and saying this is actually trash. It's not going to be turned into something else. CHANG: That is NPR's Laura Sullivan.

Dana Cronin reports. DANA CRONIN, BYLINE: The world's food system accounts for a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the private sector is a huge part of that, says Ricardo Salvador with the Union of Concerned Scientists. RICARDO SALVADOR: They're invested in the system which generates greenhouse gas emissions. And essentially, they are trapped by, you know, the need to continue to not only be profitable, but to grow their profits. CRONIN: A chunk of those emissions come from the farms that grow ingredients for these companies, including corn, potatoes and rice. And a group of 12 mega food corporations, including Mars, PepsiCo and McDonald's, are trying to reduce that footprint by paying farmers to farm more sustainably - farmers like Will Cannon, who I talked to on the phone from the seat of his combine, harvesting his 1,000 acres of corn and soybeans near Prairie City, Iowa. WILL CANNON: You know, when push comes to shove, you know, part of being sustainable is you have to be economically sustainable, right? CRONIN: To sequester carbon on his farm, Cannon does things like plant cover crops, which trap carbon all winter long. He avoids tilling his soil as much, which keeps carbon in the ground. And the way he's made it economically sustainable is through food corporations PepsiCo and Unilever, who are helping foot the bill for what's commonly called regenerative agriculture. That type of partnership could become more common as a coalition of major food companies plans to scale up the amount of regenerative farmland. Grant Reid is the outgoing CEO of Mars and heads this industry task force. GRANT REID: If we do that, that will take 600 million tons of greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere. CRONIN: Six hundred million metric tons, by the way, is the equivalent to the annual emissions of 161 coal-fired power plants. It's not the first regenerative agriculture commitment we've seen from big food corporations. Last year, PepsiCo committed its entire global farming footprint - about 7 million acres - to more sustainable practices. So far, they've only tackled a few hundred thousand of those acres, though Chief Sustainability Officer Jim Andrew says that's to be expected in the first year. JIM ANDREW: You're really building capabilities. You're building tools. You're building a set of partners on a global basis. You know, these things don't happen overnight. CRONIN: And scaling that system across 12 different companies and supply chains won't be easy, especially because no two supply chains are the same. What works for a rice farmer in India might not work for a corn farmer in Iowa, says Grant Reid. REID: There's no one size fits all, all right? So there's not one crop, one company, one country that's identical. So you can't be too prescriptive. CRONIN: And the plan's lack of precision could make it difficult to track progress, especially when there's no real standardized definition of regenerative agriculture. There's no step-by-step guide or menu of requirements for regenerative farming, which can make it hard to verify that these corporate commitments are really helping combat climate change, says Ricardo Salvador with the Union of Concerned Scientists. SALVADOR: In addition to being verifiable, it needs to be permanent. Because if it's not permanent, then in essence, it's not really helping us with climate change. CRONIN: In other words, we need more farmers like Will Cannon to really make a dent in climate change. For NPR News, I'm Dana Cronin. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   Ahead of the international climate change conference in Egypt next week, major food corporations today announced a plan to address their greenhouse gas emissions connected to agriculture supply chains. Dana Cronin reports. DANA CRONIN, BYLINE: The world's food system accounts for a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the private sector is a huge part of that, says Ricardo Salvador with the Union of Concerned Scientists. RICARDO SALVADOR: They're invested in the system which generates greenhouse gas emissions. And essentially, they are trapped by, you know, the need to continue to not only be profitable, but to grow their profits. CRONIN: A chunk of those emissions come from the farms that grow ingredients for these companies, including corn, potatoes and rice. And a group of 12 mega food corporations, including Mars, PepsiCo and McDonald's, are trying to reduce that footprint by paying farmers to farm more sustainably - farmers like Will Cannon, who I talked to on the phone from the seat of his combine, harvesting his 1,000 acres of corn and soybeans near Prairie City, Iowa. WILL CANNON: You know, when push comes to shove, you know, part of being sustainable is you have to be economically sustainable, right? CRONIN: To sequester carbon on his farm, Cannon does things like plant cover crops, which trap carbon all winter long. He avoids tilling his soil as much, which keeps carbon in the ground. And the way he's made it economically sustainable is through food corporations PepsiCo and Unilever, who are helping foot the bill for what's commonly called regenerative agriculture. That type of partnership could become more common as a coalition of major food companies plans to scale up the amount of regenerative farmland. Grant Reid is the outgoing CEO of Mars and heads this industry task force. GRANT REID: If we do that, that will take 600 million tons of greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere. CRONIN: Six hundred million metric tons, by the way, is the equivalent to the annual emissions of 161 coal-fired power plants. It's not the first regenerative agriculture commitment we've seen from big food corporations. Last year, PepsiCo committed its entire global farming footprint - about 7 million acres - to more sustainable practices. So far, they've only tackled a few hundred thousand of those acres, though Chief Sustainability Officer Jim Andrew says that's to be expected in the first year.

Do you feel dread or anger? Or maybe if you're a morning person, it makes you feel excited because you associate it with the start of your day. Be it positive or negative, a new study shows how the brain associates the sound of an alarm or any memory with a feeling. Hao Li is a researcher at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and one of the authors of this study. He joins us now. Welcome. HAO LI: Hi. RASCOE: So your study refers to something called emotional valence. Can you first tell me what that is? LI: Yeah. So essentially, all the behaviors in our lab have been motivated by either there's a good memory or bad memory. So emotional valence just refers to the value that we put on our memories. RASCOE: OK. So this makes me think of that song \"The Way We Were\" by Barbra Streisand. Stay with me, now. I've been listening to the version by Gladys Knight, and she says memories may be beautiful, and yet what's too painful to remember, we simply choose to forget. So it's talking about the different types of memories and why we might remember good things over bad things. Is that kind of why you wanted to do this research? LI: Yes, exactly. It's really close to our daily life. So that's one of the big motivations for me to study neuroscience, particularly study how our brain thinks and how the memory is stored. RASCOE: And so let's say I smell or taste something that makes me feel comforted. What's happening in my brain that associates that feeling with that memory? LI: So this goes back to our 2015 study where we identified these two populations of neurons in the amygdala that selectively responds to good or bad memories. So it's almost like two separate railway tracks that one leads to reward and one leads to punishment. RASCOE: What was your approach to finding out how this emotional valence is determined? LI: Essentially, we use rodents models, specifically mice. We train the mice to perform this task where they hear a sound, and a few seconds later, the sound is followed by either a sugar water reward or a mild shock punishment. So over multiple trials, we'll learn that sound A is predictive of reward, which is the sugar. The sound B is predictive with a full shock, which is punishment. So we can then observe the animals' behavior during the presentation of this tone to see whether or not animal have learned that this is a good sound or otherwise the bad sound. RASCOE: And what you found was that they were able to associate that sound with either a good thing or a bad thing. LI: Yeah. Essentially, we use this task to model whether the animal have learned a good and bad memory. And what we found is this signaling molecule that's called neurotensin that can work as almost a switch operator that can turn on and off good and bad memory. RASCOE: And, I mean, do we know if the same rules apply to human brains? LI: Yes. Yes. A lot of studies have shown that human brains are using a very similar circuit to rodent brains in terms of emotional or memory processing or learning those basic survival skills. RASCOE: So would there be, like, an evolutionary reason for these findings? I mean, it seems like it would make sense that if you hear something that should be associated with danger, it would be good to remember that. LI: Yeah, I think it's most likely it's a revolutionary reason, right? Because, you know, if there's a danger, you want to avoid, run away, but if you're hungry, you can wait. But you don't want to wait if the tiger is coming at you. So evolutionarily, the brain circuits have been prompt to punishment over reward. RASCOE: So then I got to ask because it almost seems like in modern day with humans, we can be anxious and remember those bad experiences that we don't want to remember as much. Are there practical ways that scientists or medical professionals could use your findings to help with people who may have a lot of negative feelings? LI: Yeah. So I think there's a big potential because if you think all those mental health disorders, there's either too much reward or too much negative feeling, right? But if there's a molecule that can reverse this and make them feel happy again or make them learn things to be happy, they can potentially help them to overcome or recover from these diseases. RASCOE: Hao Li is a researcher with the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. Thank you so much for talking to me about this. It was very interesting. LI: Thank you for having me.

Emily Kwong and Brit Hanson from NPR's Short Wave podcast explored that very question with the botanist and plant ecologist Tanisha Williams. She told them the changing leaves start with environmental cues, like the days getting shorter. TANISHA WILLIAMS: So once they have these cues saying, like, oh, wintertime is coming, the falling of the leaves and the changing of the colors are all in preparation for the tree to hunker down and basically hibernate in the wintertime. Then all of this magical stuff starts to happen in the leaf. EMILY KWONG, BYLINE: OK, like what? BRIT HANSON, BYLINE: Well, it actually has to do with the magic of - drumroll, please - photosynthesis. KWONG: Yes. OK. HANSON: Right? Yeah, photosynthesis. It's this cool process of how plants harness energy from sunlight and water and carbon dioxide to make food for themselves. KWONG: Yeah, casual plant alchemy. HANSON: Exactly. It's pretty amazing. And as you may remember from biology class, in order for photosynthesis to happen, as a first step, a tree needs to find a way to capture the sunlight. And leaves are how that happens. But to be even more specific, it's the pigments inside the leaves that do this, that capture the sunlight. KWONG: And by pigments, do you mean colors? HANSON: Sort of. So stick with me here, Emily. There are a handful of different pigments in each leaf, and each of these pigments absorbs sunlight and reflects the rest of it. KWONG: OK. HANSON: So the color that we see on the leaves depends on the light that each of the pigments is reflecting. KWONG: Oh. HANSON: So let's start with the color green. WILLIAMS: So the reason why we see all of this green color in the leaves is because of the pigment known as chlorophyll. And that is what we see during the summer and spring months because there's a lot of sunlight. KWONG: So basically, the more sunlight there is, the more green we see. HANSON: Yes, because of chlorophyll, the green pigment in the leaf. And this is the pigment that's the most responsible for kick-starting that process - photosynthesis. But that starts to change once those environmental cues set in. KWONG: Yeah, I love the word cues because it reminds me of stage actors being cued. . . HANSON: Yes. KWONG: . . . For a costume change. HANSON: Yep. KWONG: Right? Like the leaves are, oh, it's my turn to transform. But in this case, it's less daylight and colder temperatures. HANSON: Exactly. So as the tree starts to get ready for winter and the chlorophyll has stopped showing off this, you know, sort of green show. . . KWONG: Yeah. HANSON: . . . We can start to see another pigment - carotenoid. WILLIAMS: Carotenoids are where we're going to get that yellow and orange color. KWONG: Oh, OK. So chlorophyll equals green leaves, and carotenoids equals yellow and orange leaves. HANSON: Yes. And for some trees, right here, this is where the colors stop. But for others, Tanisha says there's one more pigment to go. WILLIAMS: Then we can get into the red color. And the red color is produced by pigments called anthocyanins. HANSON: So one thing that Tanisha pointed out is that sort of in the background of this whole process, why the leaves are changing color, the tree is also entering what she calls hibernation mode, so sort of slowing down the flow of nutrients out to the limbs; basically hunkering down to conserve energy so it can make it through the winter. KWONG: This sounds like what I do. HANSON: (Laughter) Exactly. KWONG: I will not move from this couch. HANSON: No one can make you. KWONG: No. HANSON: So after a leaf has cycled through its pigments, it starts to run out of energy. WILLIAMS: And it starts to die off. And also, it starts to weaken at the stem right there. So wind and as we're walking through leaves, we're kicking them and things like that to drop the leaves off the tree. KWONG: I had no idea so much was going on inside each leaf. HANSON: And, you know, when I was talking with Tanisha, Emily, I kind of realized, like, when I take my afternoon walk through my neighborhood, I haven't really been appreciating how hard the leaves are working, you know, for this amazing production. WILLIAMS: Once you start learning about them. . . HANSON: Yeah. WILLIAMS: . . . Then your lenses change. You just see the world differently.

The private sector could play a huge role. The problem is that not enough private funding is making its way to the places that need it most, low-income countries. Michael Copley of NPR's Climate Desk is following the United Nations climate talks that are being held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Hey, Michael. MICHAEL COPLEY, BYLINE: Hey. How are you? NADWORNY: So, for starters, how much money is the world going to need to deal with climate change? COPLEY: I mean, the numbers are really mind-boggling. So one big bank has said we'll need $32 trillion just this decade to stop emitting carbon by about mid-century. And that's what scientists say needs to happen to keep us from getting to the point where catastrophic impacts from climate change become a lot more likely. Now, that number doesn't even account for the billions that are needed to pay for the impacts that are already happening, especially in developing countries like Pakistan, which was hit with devastating floods this summer, and countries in East Africa that are suffering through a years-long drought. NADWORNY: So what's the role of these financial institutions in the private sector? COPLEY: You know, I think investors see an opportunity to make a lot of money in stuff like renewable energy projects and electric vehicles. And those things are going to be really important for cutting emissions. But right now, it doesn't look like that investment is getting to developing countries in a big way. So in 2020, industrialized countries provided around $83 billion in financing to help developing countries deal with climate change. Only about 13 billion of that came from the private sector. NADWORNY: Is there much talk at this year's climate conference about ways to get more private investment to low-income countries? COPLEY: There is. And a lot of the focus right now is on development banks. So these are institutions like the World Bank that were set up to really fight poverty. And the idea is they provide money and other resources to developing countries to help them grow, and by doing that, they reduce financial risk and help attract private investment. But people right now are saying the development banks really need to change how they operate. One of the big criticisms is that they often use loans to distribute money and that those loans add to the debt burdens of countries that are already struggling financially. Mia Mottley is the prime minister of Barbados. Here's what she had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRIME MINISTER MIA MOTTLEY: How many more countries must falter, particularly in a world that is now suffering the consequences of war and inflation? And countries therefore are unable to meet the challenges of finding the necessary resources to finance their way to net zero. NADWORNY: So there's a lot of criticism of how these financial institutions are operating. Are they going to change? Is there any sense of that? COPLEY: So that's the hope. Ten of these banks put out a statement recently saying they'll provide more support to countries that are trying to address climate change. But world leaders also say that it's in the private sector's interest to do more to help these poorer countries deal with climate change. Here's Philip Davis, prime minister of the Bahamas. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRIME MINISTER PHILIP DAVIS: I'm not here to tell the private sector to give up caring about profits. I'm here to say that in a world of profound instability, your profits are very much in danger. COPLEY: You know, I think the issue is - we're talking right now about changing how development banks operate and changing how investors think. And the fact is the clock on climate change is ticking, and it's these developing countries who are most vulnerable to it that are feeling that pressure the most. NADWORNY: That's NPR's Michael Copley. COPLEY: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ELISSA NADWORNY, HOST:   Governments alone can't throw money at climate change and expect progress. The private sector could play a huge role. The problem is that not enough private funding is making its way to the places that need it most, low-income countries. Michael Copley of NPR's Climate Desk is following the United Nations climate talks that are being held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Hey, Michael. MICHAEL COPLEY, BYLINE: Hey. How are you? NADWORNY: So, for starters, how much money is the world going to need to deal with climate change? COPLEY: I mean, the numbers are really mind-boggling. So one big bank has said we'll need $32 trillion just this decade to stop emitting carbon by about mid-century. And that's what scientists say needs to happen to keep us from getting to the point where catastrophic impacts from climate change become a lot more likely. Now, that number doesn't even account for the billions that are needed to pay for the impacts that are already happening, especially in developing countries like Pakistan, which was hit with devastating floods this summer, and countries in East Africa that are suffering through a years-long drought. NADWORNY: So what's the role of these financial institutions in the private sector? COPLEY: You know, I think investors see an opportunity to make a lot of money in stuff like renewable energy projects and electric vehicles. And those things are going to be really important for cutting emissions. But right now, it doesn't look like that investment is getting to developing countries in a big way. So in 2020, industrialized countries provided around $83 billion in financing to help developing countries deal with climate change. Only about 13 billion of that came from the private sector. NADWORNY: Is there much talk at this year's climate conference about ways to get more private investment to low-income countries? COPLEY: There is.

The most vulnerable countries take the brunt. Still, global emissions reached their highest levels last year, while Russia's invasion of Ukraine throws energy supplies worldwide into turmoil. Amid all of that, another U. N. climate conference - COP27 - is taking place. Leaders from around the world have gathered in Egypt to try, once again, to commit to plans to address the climate crisis. Former U. S. Vice President Al Gore, who has been urging the world to take the climate crisis seriously for decades now, spoke at the opening ceremony with yet another blunt warning. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AL GORE: We are all here today because we continue to use the thin blue shell of atmosphere surrounding our planet as an open sewer. MARTIN: The former vice president is just back from Egypt, and he was kind enough to come by our studios in Washington, D. C. , to talk about the conference, the outlook for climate action, as well as a new organization he's helped launch that says it can trace emissions to individual power plants and oil and gas fields around the globe. And he's with us now. Welcome, Mr. Vice President. Thank you for coming. GORE: Well, thank you. Thank you so much for having me. MARTIN: So we just heard you speaking at the opening ceremony of COP27 in Egypt. You painted a pretty grim picture of what we face. Well, it's hard to imagine somebody else with your credibility on this issue. You spoke at the 1992 Rio climate summit. You made it a defining issue as a senator and as vice president and your 2000 presidential campaign. Your film, \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" I think it's fair to say, shifted the conversation still, as I think you know better than anybody. And as you just alluded to in your opening remarks, we just don't seem to be moving the needle and slashing emissions. We're burning more fossil fuels than ever. Is there anything you're seeing that gives you hope that we aren't going to just keep kicking the can down the road? GORE: In all my presentations, I try to maintain a balance between the dire warning that's absolutely essential. But there's also a lot of hope, and I try to always have that presented prominently. I'll give you some examples. Of course, we can start with the passage of the biggest climate legislation in the history of the world, the Inflation Reduction Act, in August, which is the genuine item. It's amazing. And then one month later, Australia's voters turned Australia in a completely new direction - off of coal and toward leadership on renewable energy. And then a month after that, Brazil's voters voted to stop destroying the Amazon. And all the while, there are technological advances that have made it easier to solve this crisis if we'll just act. MARTIN: So one of the points you made in the speech is actually something we're going to talk about later on this program, which is the way that so many of the crises that beleaguer governments around the world are, in fact, connected to each other and they're connected to climate. I'm just going to play a short clip from your speech at the conference. Here it is. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GORE: Experts are predicting as many as 1 billion climate migrants crossing international borders in the balance of this century. Think of the millions that are crossing borders now and the xenophobia and authoritarian populism that is caused by a large surge of refugees. And then imagine, if you will, what a billion climate refugees would do. It would end the possibilities of self-governance. We have to act. MARTIN: So, Mr. Vice President, you have access to a lot of people that the rest of us don't. Is that message resonating? Do people - do kind of the leaders that you interact with around the world see these connections in the way that you just described? GORE: In the main, yes. We have seen a tremendous amount of movement in the right direction. I have to caution that the fossil fuel industry and their financial supporters have built up a legacy of political and economic power and influence over the last century that has given them effective control over the policymaking process. In some countries, even at times in our country, that control was broken with the legislation passed last summer here. But they still control many governments. And yet, in spite of that, the people of countries around the world are besieged by these climate-related extreme events. Every night on the television news is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation and the floods, the downpours, the droughts, the rising sea level, the tropical diseases spreading poleward and so many - and the refugee crises that are very real. There are many specific examples related to climate already. And I think that is now beginning to overtake the political inertia that the big polluters try to keep in place. MARTIN: Let's talk about Russia's attack on Ukraine. I mean, it sent rich countries scrambling for natural gas and other fossil fuels. We've already talked about the fact that fossil fuel emissions last year are as high as they've ever been. What impact do you think this has had on all the discussions that we're having on the - I mean, people seem to act as if it's just a choice between, you know, doing the right thing. But in some countries, you know, doing the right thing means leaving, at risk of freezing to death over the winter. GORE: Yeah. MARTIN: And so isn't it a little more complicated than that? And how do you think about that in the current moment? GORE: The short-term impact, particularly in Europe, is that the withdrawal of Russian fossil fuel supplies from Europe put them in grave danger of people freezing to death in the winter. And so obviously they have a moral imperative to replace those fuels in order to avoid catastrophe. But there is a longer-term impact, which is this blackmail by Russia has awakened the European countries to what Ronald Reagan and every president since has warned against, and that is if they become too dependent on an autocratic petrostate, they're going to lose their independence of thought and action. And I think that on balance, it's going to be a spur to a faster transition. However, the influence of the fossil fuel industry, which I mentioned earlier, is now being put to use in trying to get them to sign long-term contracts for more new pipelines that would create a risk of even more dependency on fossil fuels over a longer period of time, which, of course, would mean more emissions and a much higher risk of climate catastrophe. MARTIN: And along those lines, you launched a nonprofit, Climate TRACE, that says it's zeroed in on the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters. Could you just tell me a little bit more about that? GORE: We introduced this global inventory in Egypt at the COP, and it uses artificial intelligence. And here is why that's necessary. Using satellites - we use more than 300 different satellites from half a dozen different countries - you can look directly at methane emissions and measure them. But if you're trying to look directly at CO2 emissions, the so-called signal-to-noise ratio makes it almost impossible because the air is so saturated with CO2 now. We've been emitting so much of it. But if you look at the same sites in multiple wavelengths - you look at the smoke plumes, you look at the infrared heat signature, you can measure the ripples of water in the cooling pond, how many of the fan blades are turning, the internet data streams - and you combine all of that into these machine-learning algorithms, you can get an extremely accurate measurement. We have measured all of the power plants in the entire world - oil and gas production in the entire world, virtually every large ship in the world, every large plane in the world, every single one of the significant emitting sites - and we can tell you how to change suppliers if you're an industry, how to reduce your scope 3, scope 1 and 2. . . MARTIN: Yeah, see that's what I was going to ask you. What are we supposed to do with this? Like, you get this information. What are you hoping people will do with it? GORE: Well, there are - well, first of all, 75% of all the emissions in the world are coming from countries that have made a net-zero pledge. Now that they have the information, now that they know exactly where it's coming from, they have tools that will enable them to reduce their emissions. There are lots of companies that have made net-zero commitments. And when they analyze their supply chains, they can pick suppliers and subcontractors that have a fraction of the emissions of others that they are now using. MARTIN: Are any corporate entities or governments using this technology right now? Do you have. . . GORE: Yes. MARTIN: . . . Can you tell us how they're using it? GORE: Yes. We have actually already entered into working agreements with six subnational governments in Mexico, in Europe and in Africa. And they are using it extensively now. We started with the 72,000 largest. But by the end of next year, we will have essentially all of them - many millions of them. And as the secretary general of the United Nations said last Wednesday when he introduced our program, he said this will make it impossible for people to cheat. And he's right about that because cheating is impossible with this. . . MARTIN: You sound really excited about it. GORE: I am excited about it because in the 30 years since the world has been negotiating how to deal with the climate crisis, nobody has ever known where all this global warming pollution is coming from. And we know the general sectors where it's coming from, but now we know, with precision, exactly where it's coming from. And we know that some sectors have been vastly underreporting oil and - the oil and gas industry, we found their emissions are three times higher than they have been telling the United Nations. And there are a few other examples of where - I'm not saying that they purposely cheating. Maybe it was an oversight. Maybe it was an accident. But all of the accidents have been in the same direction, and they've all been consistent with some of those companies intentionally lying to publics to try to prevent the formation of a political consensus necessary to reduce the emissions. MARTIN: I can argue that the 2000 election, which had to have been a disappointment to you, kind of - sort of started the era of questioning the election apparatus. Would you agree? I mean, I - the fact that we're still debating about whether elections in the United States are done correctly, the fact that people - we have people refusing to concede if they don't like the outcome, I just have to ask, does this bring anything up for you? What are your thoughts about it? GORE: Well, you know, in 2000, after the Supreme Court decision, I made the public statement that I disagree with the Supreme Court's decision, but I accept it. And I called then-Governor Bush and offered my concession. I just think that's the right thing to do. I will tell you what inspires me. In this election just held, there were a lot of candidates for state offices - such as secretary of state, which typically will give that individual the responsibility to handle elections - who were election deniers. Every single one of them was defeated by the American voters. I think the American voters redeemed the dignity of American democracy in this election. MARTIN: Let's just be clear. Not all election deniers were defeated. Election deniers who were seeking to - positions that would have allowed them to administer elections were defeated. Statewide candidates, secretaries of state - they were defeated. GORE: I think there is a pattern that really stands out when you look at these election results. And these results were really in stark contrast to the historical trend for a first midterm election for an incumbent president's party. The antidote for despair is action. If you're worried about it, become an election official. Help register people to vote. Defend the integrity of our democracy. I have always felt that American democracy is more resilient than we sometimes give it credit for being. And I think the American people stood up and spoke very clearly in this election. And they said, we don't want to go down that road toward chaos and the denial of the truth. You know, climate denial and election denial are really first cousins. It's - they're both an example of people believing that they can create their own reality if the one we all share is somehow inconvenient for them. If the truth of our circumstances is not to their liking, they just want to have a triumph of the will. They want to be able to say, OK, I want it to be this way, and I declare it so. But there is a shared reality, and we do debate and discuss with one another and we refine our understanding of the best available truth by testing it in dialogue and democratic discourse. And it's sometimes messy, and it's almost always difficult. But as Churchill said, it's the best system - it's the worst system except for any other that's ever been created. MARTIN: That's the former vice president of the United States, Al Gore. He's a founding partner and chairman of Generation Investment Management and the founder and chairman of the Climate Reality Project. Former Vice President Gore, thank you so much for joining us. GORE: Thank you. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   Disasters that seem ripped from the pages of the Bible fill the news. The most vulnerable countries take the brunt.

Every single one of them was defeated by the American voters. I think the American voters redeemed the dignity of American democracy in this election. MARTIN: Let's just be clear. Not all election deniers were defeated. Election deniers who were seeking to - positions that would have allowed them to administer elections were defeated. Statewide candidates, secretaries of state - they were defeated. GORE: I think there is a pattern that really stands out when you look at these election results. And these results were really in stark contrast to the historical trend for a first midterm election for an incumbent president's party. The antidote for despair is action. If you're worried about it, become an election official. Help register people to vote. Defend the integrity of our democracy. I have always felt that American democracy is more resilient than we sometimes give it credit for being. And I think the American people stood up and spoke very clearly in this election. And they said, we don't want to go down that road toward chaos and the denial of the truth. You know, climate denial and election denial are really first cousins. It's - they're both an example of people believing that they can create their own reality if the one we all share is somehow inconvenient for them. If the truth of our circumstances is not to their liking, they just want to have a triumph of the will. They want to be able to say, OK, I want it to be this way, and I declare it so. But there is a shared reality, and we do debate and discuss with one another and we refine our understanding of the best available truth by testing it in dialogue and democratic discourse. And it's sometimes messy, and it's almost always difficult. But as Churchill said, it's the best system - it's the worst system except for any other that's ever been created. MARTIN: That's the former vice president of the United States, Al Gore. He's a founding partner and chairman of Generation Investment Management and the founder and chairman of the Climate Reality Project. Former Vice President Gore, thank you so much for joining us.

And liftoff. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  That's the sound of NASA's Artemis I rocket as it lifted off this week after months of delays. Its cargo, the Orion spacecraft, on its way to a lunar orbit. No humans on board, but it's part of NASA's preparation to send two astronauts, including the first woman and first person of color, back to the moon as early as 2025. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"UNIVERSO CURIOSO DE LA NASA\")NOELIA GONZALEZ: (Speaking Spanish). MARTIN: While blazing a path back to the moon, NASA is also blazing a new trail in a different way - tracking the mission's progress with its first Spanish-language podcast. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"UNIVERSO CURIOSO DE LA NASA\")GONZALEZ: (Speaking Spanish). MARTIN: That is Noelia Gonzalez, the host of \"Universo Curioso De La NASA\" or \"NASA's Curious Universe. \" The podcast, which actually launched late last year, is part of a wider push, NASA en Espanol, that includes live launch broadcasts and YouTube videos in Spanish. And joining us now from the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland is the host of \"Universo Curioso De La NASA,\" Noelia Gonzalez, who just returned from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Noelia Gonzalez, thank you so much for joining us. GONZALEZ: Thank you for having me, Michel. MARTIN: Congratulations to all at NASA on the Artemis launch and for the podcast, too. I mean - I don't know - that just must have felt great. GONZALEZ: It does. And it just makes you smile. It was just incredible. MARTIN: Well, tell us, if you would, about the wider push to engage with a Spanish-speaking audience. What are some of the other projects that you have going, and why do you think it matters? GONZALEZ: Yeah, so NASA en Espanol was launched in 2019, but it was just to formalize something that was already being born thanks to the Hispanic workforce in the agency that is just so eager to communicate with their, you know, their communities. And so we have the podcast that is our latest effort, but we also do broadcasts in Spanish. For example, in 2021, we did the landing on Mars in Spanish, you know, hosted by Diana Trujillo, flight director that was also very involved in the mission of Perseverance Rover and also the helicopter Ingenuity. And when Perseverance first landed on Mars, Diana shouted, (speaking Spanish), meaning, we have arrived - (speaking Spanish). And that was - it's just a broadcast that keeps growing in numbers. And people really, really responded to that, you know, the fact that we are providing them with these very important mission milestones that NASA has in their own language. MARTIN: Just thinking off the top of your head, are there any interviews you've had that stand out to you or are there any particular interviews that have really resonated with the audience? GONZALEZ: Definitely. To me, they're all my favorite. I did an interview with Ivette Rivera Aponte. And she's a civil engineer. And she's involved in many systems related to the SLS rocket that we just launched. And she is just so enthusiastic about the mission and her job. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"UNIVERSO CURIOSO DE LA NASA\")IVETTE RIVERA APONTE: (Speaking Spanish). GONZALEZ: This is my favorite soundbite because it just gives me goosebumps. She's basically saying that the kids that are now in school are the ones who are going to take us to Mars. And so we have that in mind all the time when we communicate in Spanish. We are trying to inspire the next generations of kids and youth that, you know, maybe, you know, gain an interest in space and exploration because of these products, this communication product that we are providing them. MARTIN: You know, I just can't help but see parallels in some of your work highlighting the contributions of Latinos and Latinas at NASA. And I'm thinking about - remember that film, \"Hidden Figures,\" that showed how three African American women were key to launching John Glenn into orbit? And it kind of reminds me of that. But I'm also hearing what you're saying about, like, this is laying the groundwork for the future. And what do you think is the end goal of the project? Is it, in part, to inspire parents who may speak Spanish but whose children are bilingual to continue to encourage their children on this path? Is it, in part, to let the audience know that, like, this is for everyone, that space is for everyone? Is it, in part, to sort of lift up the Spanish speakers at NASA? What do you think is the end goal? GONZALEZ: I think it's all of that that you just mentioned. When we first launched - the first pilot podcast that we did about Webb, and we had all these comments from people, you know, immigrants who are bilingual in the U. S. And they speak mainly English, and they are so passionate about space. And then they were telling us how they were able to share with their parents who do not speak English, only Spanish, you know, something that they cared about and they were interested about. And just seeing the podcast being that link between, you know, that family and allowing them to, you know, get together and discuss these missions and talk about this, that was, you know, it's just one of the goals, of course. But then, yeah, I mean, we also get comments from parents who are excited about their kids being able to, you know, watch this broadcast, listen to this podcast and just, you know, oir this video about the Ingenuity Mars helicopter. One of the main goals is to inspire our audience, to inform them. Of course, maybe they are not very familiar with this NASA mission, maybe they are, and they just want to learn more. But, of course, we want to show them then that this is for them as well. MARTIN: You know, there are going to be skeptics. There are going to be people who will question, you know, the value of doing a broadcast in Spanish. And for those who do, what would you say? GONZALEZ: Spanish is the second-most-spoken language in the U. S. , in the world is also the second-most-spoken language. It is expected to keep growing. And these figures are not hidden. They are there. And we're trying to put them forward and show them and speak about them and talk about their stories, their journey to NASA, their journey to working in space exploration and at the agency. And so this is just the beginning. MARTIN: I can imagine. And also, just looping back to where we started our conversation, you were part of the live broadcast the NASA en Espanol team hosted online as the Artemis I rocket prepared to blast off for the moon. This is the most powerful rocket ever. And I just - you know I'm jealous, OK, so I'll just try to contain that. But you saw this in person, and then you got to share that with your listeners. Can you just describe what was that like? GONZALEZ: Yeah. So it was like the whole thing wrapped around you. Like, you were inside the launch. You know, you were not just looking at it. You were feeling delight that - all of a sudden, it was daylight, you know, the launch hub in the middle of the night. And then I felt like I was thinking, OK, we are making history. This is history and witnessing history in the making, and also thinking of all the people that we know, that we've spoken to and interviewed that contributed to this mission. I was thinking, they made this happen. They did it. They succeeded. They just succeeded. A little bit of nostalgia, too, because we were seeing the SLS leave Earth forever. You know, we got used to seeing it on the pad and talking about it. Ultimately, it was a wonderful experience. And I really hope I don't forget the memory that I have of it. MARTIN: That was Noelia Gonzalez, the host of NASA's first Spanish-language podcast, \"Universo Curioso De La NASA. \" You can find current episodes of the show on NASA's website as well as Apple Podcasts. Noelia Gonzalez, congratulations on everything. Thank you so much for joining us. GONZALEZ: Thank you so much, Michel. It was great to be here with you today.

Actually, in this bar, pretty much everybody is a brain scientist. Excuse me. I'm looking for neuroscientists. We are. . . . MATT SZUROMI: I don't know if I technically fall in that category. EMMA HUELS: We are neuroscientists and. . . SZUROMI: I'm an enthusiast. HUELS: We don't have Ph. D. s yet. HAMILTON: Don't be fooled. The enthusiast is Matt Szuromi, who works in the lab at the University of Michigan. SZUROMI: I do dynamical modeling for seizures, epilepsy. HAMILTON: His friend Emma Huels is also from the University of Michigan. HUELS: I study the role of different cortical regions in consciousness, using anesthesia and psychedelics and looking at how they change the brain. HAMILTON: Matt, Emma and the two other scientists at their table have spent the day at Neuroscience 2022, the five-day annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience. Emma says it's not like the other professional meetings she goes to. HUELS: There'll be, like, hundreds of people. But in terms of thousands of people that are flooding the streets of San Diego, and you can look around and everybody has some sort of interest in the brain - like, that's very special. HAMILTON: Two tables over, I find several other brain scientists who are a bit further along in their careers. NICOLAI URBAN: Hi, I'm Nicolai Urban. I'm the head of the Light Microscopy Core at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience. HAMILTON: A place that helps researchers study even the smallest detail of a brain cell. Urban says this year's meeting is a big deal because COVID-19 prevented in-person events in 2020 and 2021. URBAN: We tried virtual meetings, but there is just no comparison. There is none of the interpersonal engagement. You don't strike up spontaneous conversations. You don't meet people in the hallways. You don't just, like. . . TAMARA MARKOVIC: You don't walk into a bar and see everyone, do you? HAMILTON: That was Tamara Markovic from Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. She studies brain changes associated with drug addiction. This is just one bar in San Diego's Gaslamp Quarter. On this evening, pretty much any place with a good happy hour is teeming with brain scientists from around the world. The neuroscience meeting is so big that many scientists have to stay at distant hotels and take a bus to the convention center each morning. Some will head off to lectures by the world's leading brain scientists. (APPLAUSE)HAMILTON: But the real action takes place in a vast hall where less famous scientists present their work on posters and chat with anyone who shows an interest. KANATHIP JONGMEKWAMSUK: I am Kanathip Jongmekwamsuk from Thailand. HAMILTON: From Thailand? JONGMEKWAMSUK: Yes. Just call me Tan. HAMILTON: Tan is studying how language processing changes in the brain over a person's lifespan. Not far away is Max Crayen, standing in front of his poster.

HAMILTON: SFN as in Society for Neuroscience. Crayen's poster is about - well, I'll let him tell you. CRAYEN: Using camera-guided electrode micrograph navigation for precise 3D positioning of electrodes in brain target volumes.

But there's actually a lot that we can do about that. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We often talk about the wildfire and its climate change like it's an act of God. No. Own up to and take responsibility for what you've created and contributed to. CHANG: The new podcast The Big Burn explores the history of wildfire management in the West, starting with the very first people on that land - Indigenous people. CUTCHA RISLING BALDY: All the things that we would do or even that any fire scientist would do right now, Native people have always been doing to care for the landscape. CHANG: And it looks at how we can use that knowledge to protect our forests and lands today. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: All right, guys. What are you fire lighters standing around here for? Go forth, and set your own fires (laughter). CHANG: Well, here with me now is Jacob Margolis, host of The Big Burn podcast from KPCC and LAist Studios. Hey, Jacob. JACOB MARGOLIS, BYLINE: Hey. CHANG: So, you know, when we talk about wildfires, we normally talk about, like, the devastating consequences because people - they lose their lives, their homes. Wildlife habitat disappears. But in your podcast, you talk about there being good fires versus bad fires. Can you just explain what is the difference, the way you understand it? MARGOLIS: Yeah. So we often frame all fires as bad, but the thing is fire is absolutely necessary for healthy and resilient landscapes here in California. Lots of the fires that we're seeing, especially the bad fires that end up moonscaping everything, are a result of not allowing enough good fire on the landscape. And that good fire would be something like National Park staff going out and actually deliberately setting a fire in a forested area to kind of clean up debris that would otherwise drive these really big and violent fires. It's something called prescribed burning, which is really important. CHANG: OK. And you actually attended a prescribed fire in northern California. Can we just hear a clip of that? MARGOLIS: You can see when it hits leaves that have been sitting in a shady spot, the fire kind of has trouble catching. But then it hits a blackberry bramble that's been sitting in a patch of sun, and it just explodes. (SOUNDBITE OF FIRE CRACKLING)MARGOLIS: Even from 10 feet away, the heat is just too much. You got to move. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Yeah, I believe it was bumped down the line and in the middle. MARGOLIS: Led by the pros, the dance becomes clear. They light something on fire. It rages and eventually calms down and smolders, clearing out brush, leaving the larger trees licked by fire but still alive. CHANG: I mean, Jacob, as someone who's covered wildfires for so many years, was it strange to see this intentional fire? Did it change your perception of fire at all? MARGOLIS: Oh, my gosh. So I've grown up only around fires that have been absolutely terrifying, destroying neighborhoods. CHANG: Yeah. MARGOLIS: So as soon as they lit this landscape on fire, all this adrenaline just flooded into my body. But as I saw it kind of settle in, I saw the experts do what they needed to do, I was truly in awe. And it made me sad, ultimately, that I've only felt, like, this really deep fear around fire most of my life. And I really hope that every listener out there gets to experience a prescribed burn because it completely changed my perspective of how I feel about fires in general. CHANG: Well, Cal Fire only started ramping up its prescribed burning in the last decade or so, but as you talk about in the podcast, Indigenous people in our state have been studying and using these techniques for ages, right? MARGOLIS: Yeah. Any idea that people have of California, like, before colonizers showed up as this untouched Eden or however it's framed by John Muir is wrong. The landscapes here were healthy in part because for millennia, Native American tribes throughout the state had actively managed our landscapes. They'd do things like they'd pull up oak trees to help with acorn production. And they'd regularly use fire to clean up debris, to do things like kill bugs and promote certain types of growth so that they could harvest materials for medicine, things like baskets. And so they've had this really complex and deep understanding of how to keep the world around them healthy that Westerners have often disregarded. CHANG: Exactly. And what's so illuminating about this podcast is you go into a lot of, well, frankly, the racist history that paved the way for decades of fire suppression. Can you just explain that connection some more, especially as it related to the California Gold Rush? - because I found that just eye-opening. MARGOLIS: Yeah. Native Americans in California had, you know, this really intimate relationship with the land from both a spiritual and practical standpoint. And these practices have been developed and shared over thousands of years. And then they were torn from the land violently, especially after gold was discovered around 1850, which Cutcha Risling Baldy, a Native American scholar, told me all about. RISLING BALDY: You get a massive influx of primarily white male settlers. So they're finding ways to get at as much gold as they can. And they're clear-cutting forests. They're destroying habitats for wildlife. And then they're removing Native people from the different areas by - in some cases, they're taking water cannons and spraying their villages off the sides of mountains. CHANG: God. MARGOLIS: It was a genocide that was endorsed by the government. And after Native Americans were removed from their lands, their burning practices were also prohibited, which marks the beginning of what is a century and a half of fuel buildup in our forests that now, in conjunction with climate change, is driving the moonscaping fires we're seeing. CHANG: Well, you go on to describe the buildup of a sort of fire industrial complex that's dead set on putting out fires as soon as they start. Can you talk about how that began? MARGOLIS: Yeah. Fire was this uncontrollable thing on landscapes we wanted to control for things like lumber. So in the early 1900s, you see this big buildup of the U. S. Forest Service Firefighting Force, the establishment of wildfire suppression techniques, the building of fire lookouts. And we really had this framing of fire as the enemy to be destroyed. It's really codified in the 1930s when something called the 10 a. m. policy is put into place. And this is an order that all fires need to be put out across the continent basically as quickly as possible. And so after that, we start using leftover machines of war like helicopters and planes to start fighting fires and build up these army-like fire suppression forces. And this is all happening in conjunction with us pushing developments further and further out into areas that do burn. And the thing is, as we've seen, you can't put out all the fires no matter how hard you try. So now we're dealing with the consequences of all that suppression. And we're dealing with what I'd say are anti-fire attitudes, if you will, that don't leave room for nuance a lot of the time. CHANG: That's right because even though there is more awareness today of good fire and traditional Native American management practices, there is still largely a culture of fire suppression which guides how the state manages fire and all the expectations of people who live here in California. A lot of them want to see fires go away. How do you unwind all of that, especially in an era where wildfires are getting larger and more destructive? MARGOLIS: Yeah. I just think we've lived in an unrealistic place with fire for so long that we're being, like, forced to reckon with the reality we need to accept. We're not going to suppress our way out of it. We need to stop thinking of fire as only as the enemy. We need to let some fires burn instead of putting them out right away. And we need to do more prescribed burns. And in turn, people have to be OK with smoke throughout more of the year, with the additional risk that prescribed burns bring because though they rarely escape, it does happen. So ultimately, at the end of the day, we do need a radical rethinking of fire. It is starting to happen. But my feeling, to be honest, is that it's not happening fast enough. CHANG: That was Jacob Margolis, host of the new podcast from LAist Studios and KPCC called The Big Burn. Thank you so much for your work, Jacob. MARGOLIS: Thanks for having me.

In times of drought, they ensure a supply of drinking water. However, many of those manmade lakes are at risk of disappearing. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers has a plan that could help, and it is using a reservoir in Kansas as its test. Celia Llopis-Jepsen of the Kansas News Service reports. CELIA LLOPIS-JEPSEN, BYLINE: Half of Tuttle Creek Reservoir in Manhattan, Kan. , is just gone. It filled up with silt, soil washing off farms like this one upstream, where Kansas is trying to slow the erosion. ANDY KLINE: One farmer nearby said, I wish we could have done this project 15 years ago because I've lost about 15 acres of cropland. All right. Keep going. LLOPIS-JEPSEN: Andy Kline works for the Kansas Forest Service. He plops thousands of acorns and walnuts into the ground for a thick buffer of woods between the river and the cornfield. Three and a half football fields worth of dirt piled as high as the Empire State Building pour into this reservoir each year. John Shelley is with the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. JOHN SHELLEY: If something is not done, then there won't be water during, you know, major drought periods. There just won't be water. LLOPIS-JEPSEN: Topeka and parts of the Kansas City Metro depend on this reservoir during times of drought. But reservoirs in Kansas and throughout the country are filling with mud. So the Corps will try a new twist on a technology called water injection dredging, using it to create an underwater mudslide. ADMIN HUSIC: Yeah, you can kind of imagine it as sort of like - kind of like an avalanche. LLOPIS-JEPSEN: Admin Husic is professor of water resources at the University of Kansas. HUSIC: And I think if Kansas were to approve this as a successful concept, it would be a big jump forward. LLOPIS-JEPSEN: Here's how it would work. Tuttle Reservoir has exit gates at the base of the dam. Engineers want to flush mud through those gates. So they'll lower pipes down to the lake bed and pummel it with water, like turning on a Jacuzzi, because the lakebed slopes downhill, so they hope the mud will slide down to the dam, out the exit and into the river. This worries Amy Burgin. She's a scientist at the Kansas Biological Survey. AMY BURGIN: Rivers are not pipes. They're active biological communities. LLOPIS-JEPSEN: Federal engineers have tested the lake mud for farm chemicals like pesticides and feel confident it is not a risk to the Kansas River. But Burgin is not convinced. BURGIN: This will impact water quality. And how that reverberates through the system is unknown. LLOPIS-JEPSEN: Too much mud at the wrong time of year could hurt river life. Heidi Mehl agrees. She works for the Nature Conservancy in Kansas. HEIDI MEHL: You know, a large slug of fine sediment can really choke fish habitats and affect their breeding success. LLOPIS-JEPSEN: Still, Mehl says getting the mud moving again might be good since many plants and animals need cloudy rivers to thrive. Plus, dams throughout the country are holding back mud that used to flow freely and replenish eroding land. And if existing reservoirs fill up with too much mud, that could lead to other environmental problems. MEHL: We're likely going to see proposals for new dams and new reservoirs, which would mean new valleys flooded, lands and towns lost.

It stretches more than 350 miles off Florida's coast, from Palm Beach to the Keys. It's a diverse ecosystem and a tourist attraction, and it helps protect the coast from storm surges, providing valuable economic benefits. But development, human activity and climate change have forced Florida's coral reef into a steep decline. Now a plan's underway to insure its long-term survival. NPR's Greg Allen reports. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: In Orlando, in a nondescript warehouse behind an auto dealership, there's a place that's been described as a Noah's Ark for coral. JUSTIN ZIMMERMAN: The lights should start to be coming on soon. ALLEN: Justin Zimmerman opens the door to a large space filled with open saltwater tanks, all of them holding coral. ZIMMERMAN: There are 16 300-gallon aquariums. And there's a little bit of noise. That's from the pumps. What you're looking at now, those are actually moon lights. So those are simulating the moon cycle. That's what tells the corals when to spawn. ALLEN: Corals are tiny marine animals that live in large colonies. As a species, they're ancient. They predate the dinosaurs. Three years ago, SeaWorld, in partnership with Disney and Florida's Fish and Wildlife Foundation, opened this facility - the Coral Rescue Center. Concerned about the precipitous die-off on the reefs, hundreds of corals from 18 different species were collected in the Florida Keys and brought here for safekeeping. Zimmerman says with near perfect conditions, the corals have thrived and even begun to reproduce under their care. ZIMMERMAN: Our staff will come in. They'll watch the corals. We'll turn the flow off so we can see them better. A lot of corals may spawn. Their eggs and sperm are buoyant, so they'll float to the top. We can collect those, let them fertilize, and then we'll settle the baby corals, the larvae, after they develop, on little tiles. ALLEN: The baby corals increase the genetic diversity of species that are facing a myriad of threats to their long-term survival. Andy Bruckner, a researcher with the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, says the most recent threat has been stony coral tissue loss disease. ANDY BRUCKNER: That probably killed more coral in Florida than any other single event has. It affects these big boulder corals that grow much more slowly and that are more important in terms of building the framework, the structure, that all these other corals live on. ALLEN: There is some hope now that the disease has peaked and may subside, but the damage it's done is substantial, adding to devastation that's left many vibrant, colorful reefs now largely gray and lifeless. Scientists and divers agree - Florida's coral reefs have declined dramatically since the 1960s and '70s. Since then, the reefs have lost as much as 95% of their coral cover. Bruckner says there's no single smoking gun responsible for the devastation. There are local stresses, like damage done to reefs by boat anchors or irresponsible divers and fishermen. Regional issues include poor water quality and overfishing. BRUCKNER: And the global stressor, the one that's probably the No. 1 factor that's affecting reefs and ultimately could be responsible for their demise if we don't take steps to address this, is climate change. ALLEN: The warming oceans cause thermal stress, leading to bleaching events and making corals more susceptible to disease. Another concern is ocean acidification from the growing amount of carbon dioxide absorbed from the atmosphere. The sharp decline of Florida's Barrier Reef, the third largest in the world, and the growing threats to its long-term survival have mobilized a broad coalition of activists, scientists and government officials. Sarah Fangman is the superintendent of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, which includes nearly all of Florida's reefs. SARAH FANGMAN: These are the only reefs like it that we have in the continental United States. We don't have a spare Florida reef system. And so we must do something. ALLEN: For the past three years, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, has been spearheading a project to restore several of the best-known coral reefs in the Florida Keys. It's an effort that involves environmental groups, research institutions and government agencies. Now Fangman is pushing for the adoption of a new set of regulations to expand protections for the reefs. The measures are critical, she says. But she's a realist. No matter what steps are taken, it won't be possible now to restore the reefs to the way that they used to be. FANGMAN: Those conditions no longer exist. So what we need to do is give our corals a chance in current conditions to thrive and to be resilient. ALLEN: Scientists say Florida's coral reef system was at its peak 7,000 years ago. But Lauren Toth, a researcher with the U. S. Geological Survey, has some potentially good news. As part of a recent study, she looked at what would happen to reefs where restoration efforts are currently underway. LAUREN TOTH: Not only would the reefs switch back to growth, potentially, and not be eroding anymore, but the high-end estimate that we found for how much growth could occur was as high as what we saw 7,000 years ago. ALLEN: Among those closely involved in restoring coral reefs, there's an almost surprising sense of optimism. In Key Largo, several divers have just returned from a day transplanting elkhorn corals onto an ailing. All are volunteers, including Mary Doerr, who describes herself as a marine biology nerd. She says it was great to see the new growth of newly transplanted coral, but the reef is far from healthy. MARY DOERR: It definitely doesn't have the richness and diversity of fish, and it doesn't have sort of the complex branching structures and the real depth of character and structure that a healthy reef has. ALLEN: Since 2007, a group based in the Florida Keys, the Coral Restoration Foundation, has been working to show it's possible to restore declining reefs and bring them back to vitality. The group has pioneered the use of underwater offshore nurseries where it grows coral. When they're large enough, the new corals are transplanted back onto established reefs. So far, more than 200,000 corals have been outplanted. The group's CEO, Scott Winters, says, working with other groups, Coral Restoration Foundation developed a construction plan to rebuild the endangered reefs, beginning with one of the best known - Carysfort Reef. Winters says there's now more coral on Carysfort than any time in the last 15 years. SCOTT WINTERS: Almost everything you see on Carysfort Reef now is a direct result of our activity to put corals back out there. And more importantly, they're thriving, and they are sexually reproducing. ALLEN: Winters says the goal is to bring back the coral populations to a level where they can once again begin rebuilding the reefs on their own. Scientists hope that if they keep the reefs healthy and thriving, corals will develop the genetic diversity that may help them continue to grow and to adapt to long-term threats, including climate change. Greg Allen, NPR News. Key Largo, Fla. A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST:   One of the nation's most prized environmental jewels, its Coral Barrier Reef, is also one of its most endangered. It stretches more than 350 miles off Florida's coast, from Palm Beach to the Keys. It's a diverse ecosystem and a tourist attraction, and it helps protect the coast from storm surges, providing valuable economic benefits. But development, human activity and climate change have forced Florida's coral reef into a steep decline. Now a plan's underway to insure its long-term survival. NPR's Greg Allen reports. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: In Orlando, in a nondescript warehouse behind an auto dealership, there's a place that's been described as a Noah's Ark for coral. JUSTIN ZIMMERMAN: The lights should start to be coming on soon. ALLEN: Justin Zimmerman opens the door to a large space filled with open saltwater tanks, all of them holding coral. ZIMMERMAN: There are 16 300-gallon aquariums. And there's a little bit of noise. That's from the pumps. What you're looking at now, those are actually moon lights. So those are simulating the moon cycle. That's what tells the corals when to spawn. ALLEN: Corals are tiny marine animals that live in large colonies. As a species, they're ancient. They predate the dinosaurs. Three years ago, SeaWorld, in partnership with Disney and Florida's Fish and Wildlife Foundation, opened this facility - the Coral Rescue Center. Concerned about the precipitous die-off on the reefs, hundreds of corals from 18 different species were collected in the Florida Keys and brought here for safekeeping.

The move is aimed at addressing criticism that the current policy is discriminatory while also helping to alleviate a nationwide blood shortage. NPR health correspondent Rob Stein is covering the story. Hey, Rob. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: So what are the current restrictions on men who have sex with men giving blood, and why were they put in place? STEIN: These restrictions date back to the early days of the AIDS epidemic and were designed to protect the blood supply from the AIDS virus. Originally, gay and bisexual men were completely prohibited from donating blood out of fears they would contaminate the blood supply with HIV. But over the years, as testing improved and the understanding of the epidemic has evolved, these restrictions have gradually been eased. In 2015, the FDA lifted the total ban on blood donations by gay and bisexual men and instead said they could donate as long as they hadn't had sexual contact with other men for at least a year. When the pandemic caused a blood shortage in 2020, the FDA shortened that to three months. But all this has long been criticized as unnecessary, counterproductive and discriminatory, and now the agency says it's reassessing the current policy. SHAPIRO: And what's the proposal for the new policy? STEIN: You know, NPR has learned that the new policy under consideration would allow anyone to donate regardless of their gender and sexual identity as long as they haven't engaged in risky sexual behavior in the past three months. That would include having had anal sex or new or multiple partners, injecting drugs or having engaged in sex work. This would bring the U. S. blood donation policy more in line with policies in other countries like, you know, Canada. SHAPIRO: How would this policy actually work? Like, what would implementation look like? STEIN: Yeah, right. Anyone who wants to donate blood would first have to answer a new questionnaire designed to screen out risky donors. This questionnaire would be based on the results of a study of about 1,600 gay and bisexual men that was designed to develop a set of screening questions that would identify potential donors who are most likely to be infected with HIV. The FDA says it's reviewing the results of that study as it works out the exact details of the new policy to make sure it encourages as much donation as possible while also ensuring the safety of the blood supply. Blood banks already routinely screen donated blood for HIV. SHAPIRO: So what's the reaction been to this? STEIN: You know, it's been pretty positive so far. This is something that many groups have been pushing for for years, including the American Medical Association, the American Red Cross and advocates for the LGBTQ community. Here's Tony Morrison from the group GLAAD, which has long criticized the current policy. TONY MORRISON: It's a discriminatory policy that assumes that HIV is a gay disease, and it is very much not. This is what we have been advocating for for many, many years. STEIN: That said, he says his group is waiting for more details to make sure the new policy goes far enough. In the meantime, infectious disease experts I talked to are welcoming the change. Here's Dr. Bruce Walker at the Massachusetts General Hospital. BRUCE WALKER: I think one could even make an argument that we'll be in a safer situation if individual risk is assessed because that's not done to the degree that it could be done right now to identify people that might slip through. STEIN: The agency is expected to formally propose the new guidelines sometime in the next few months, and then it would gather public comment and issue a final new policy sometime later next year. SHAPIRO: NPR health correspondent Rob Stein. Thanks. STEIN: You bet, Ari.

But if you've seen prices of eggs going up at the store, inflation may not be the only reason. The country is in the middle of the worst poultry health disaster in our history. A highly contagious bird flu virus has led to the deaths of nearly 53 million birds. The virus has hit flocks in nearly every state, and the spread doesn't show signs of stopping anytime soon. Joining us to talk about all this is NPR's Bill Chappell, and he's with us now. Thank you so much for joining us. BILL CHAPPELL, BYLINE: Sure thing. MARTIN: So obviously, people in the industry knew about this and have been dealing with this for months. But part of the reason we're talking about this now is that this outbreak seems to be surging. Is that right? And why? CHAPPELL: Well, this past week, the deaths from this avian influenza outbreak surpassed the outbreak of 2014 to '15. But the situation's really different now from what it was then. Experts I was speaking to said two big things are different. This virus is thriving in wild birds, and it's managed to stick around through the summer. It usually dies, just like human influenza would die off during the summertime. This one has stuck around, and now we're back into a new surge in the winter. MARTIN: So tell me more about this, like how this virus is spreading. CHAPPELL: Well, in that last outbreak, people were seeing the virus moved from farm to farm. So they focused on things like using disinfected and making sure workers used different boots and equipment when they moved from a barn to another barn. That seemed to help, but this outbreak is now driven by wild birds migrating around the country. And they can fly everywhere because wild birds like ducks can be infected with this virus and seem fine and not show any symptoms. But if this virus reaches a chicken, the CDC says it'll probably be dead within 48 hours with multiple organs affected. MARTIN: That's an extraordinary number of deaths. And I was wondering, is that because the birds are dying from the virus, or are they being culled, as it were? I mean, it's such an antiseptic word, but basically, are. . . CHAPPELL: Yeah. MARTIN: . . . Poultry farmers having to basically destroy their flocks in order to contain this virus? CHAPPELL: Well, yeah. I think antiseptic is the word and the point because they really - I mean, to go even further, they say it's depopulating a flock, depopulating a place. One case of this is enough to trigger that mechanism. And in a couple of cases earlier this year, we had farms that had to do away with 5 million birds just to prevent cases spreading further. MARTIN: So what kind - I mean, look, I don't want to minimize the effect this has to have on farmers and on the animals themselves, which I just think has to be just very traumatic for everybody involved with this. But I do have to ask what effect this is having on consumers and on the prices we see at the grocery store. CHAPPELL: Well, if you like to eat chicken, you're not so bad off. This version of the influenza virus doesn't affect broilers. That's what they call the chickens that are raised for meat. Here's Amy Hagerman. She's an assistant professor at Oklahoma State University. She specializes in agricultural economics. AMY HAGERMAN: The chicken that most people think of, their chicken tenders, their chicken sandwiches, you know, all of those things, their chicken breasts that they like to cook at home, they haven't tended to have the same kinds of impacts. CHAPPELL: But Hagerman tells me egg-laying hens are a completely different story. Turkeys are also affected by this a lot. And some of those egg-laying operations in particular are massive - like, millions of birds. And when one of them has to go offline, it can really disrupt the supply chain and cause prices to go up here in the U. S. MARTIN: So before we let you go, what about vaccines? Is that an option? CHAPPELL: Right. I mean, we've all been trained - kind of the process of a pandemic in these last few years - vaccines kind of - you look for them. But there are lots of challenges with that. I mean, we're talking about international trade partners that might not allow vaccines to be used to fight this. And if it did happen, there would be the question of timing. Like with people, two doses of vaccine would probably be necessary to cause an animal to become immune, and then they'd have to clear the virus before they could be harvested. It could also bring up brand-new problems, like how can you be sure if a vaccinated bird isn't infected with this really terrible virus, but it's just not showing symptoms because it's vaccinated? MARTIN: That's NPR's Bill Chappell. Bill, thanks so much for your reporting. It's a - this is a difficult story but thank you for bringing it to us. CHAPPELL: Sure thing. I agree. Thanks, Michel.

SHAYLEE RAGAR, BYLINE: Newly elected and returning Montana lawmakers were buzzing recently during their first gathering at the state capitol in Helena since the November election - including Representative-elect Zooey Zephyr. Have you spent much time in the Capitol? ZOOEY ZEPHYR: I testified in the Capitol in '21, and that was the only time. RAGAR: Zephyr, originally from Billings and now a resident and soon-to-be representative of Missoula, testified often during the 2021 legislative session in opposition to bills targeted at transgender Montanans like a proposal to ban trans women and girls from participating in women's sports. Here she is in January that same year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ZEPHYR: The image of, quote, \"trans women ruining the integrity of women's sports\" paints a false picture of life as a trans woman. It incorrectly claims that we have a competitive advantage. And it misses why trans people transition in the first place, which is to lead a happier life. RAGAR: Next month, Zephyr will return to the Capitol halls as Montana's first openly transgender woman elected to the state's legislature, sitting next to some of those same lawmakers who voted for those anti-trans bills. ZEPHYR: Watching bills pass through the legislature by one vote, I cried. And I thought to myself, I bet I could change one heart. I bet I could change one mind. We need representation in that room. I'm going to try to get in there. RAGAR: And Zephyr is not alone in bringing that representation. She'll be joined by Representative-elect S. J. Howell, Montana's first trans nonbinary legislator elected to office this year. Even though this is a win for Democrats, Montana is still getting redder. Republicans will more than dominate the legislature and could continue to push on restrictive policies like making it harder for trans Montanans to update the gender marker on their birth certificates. This issue was top of mind for at least one voter who I spoke with at a polling place in rural Montana on Election Day. CHRISTINE HOLMES: Governor passed that you can't have your gender changed on your birth certificate. RAGAR: Christine Holmes, a trans woman in Deer Lodge, says she has little hope things will change in Montana. HOLMES: And I believe that you should if you are who you think you are and know who you are. RAGAR: Lawmakers have begun drafting legislation to bring next session. And a few Republicans have already requested proposals restricting health care for trans minors and attendance at drag shows. In the past, Republicans have said these kinds of measures are aimed at protecting young people. Zephyr is realistic about the challenges she'll face in pushing back against legislation she says is harmful to the state's LGBTQ community. But she is optimistic. ZEPHYR: Representation is not a guarantee that you can stop harmful legislation from going through, but it is the best defense we have against bills that hurt vulnerable communities. RAGAR: She points to her election as proof that there is support for representation. That's underlined by the historic year that LGBTQ candidates had in state legislatures across the country. A hundred and ninety-six were elected, according to the Victory Fund. Zephyr says a top issue her constituents want her to prioritize is legislation to boost access to affordable housing. And she plans to work across the aisle on that and other issues. She says she'll be able to find shared goals with Republicans, even those who disagree with her. ZEPHYR: It is the day-in, day-out conversations with people, the humanizing effect of working with someone and working with someone who, over the course of the legislative session, will get to know that I have a nuanced life and that I have genuine beliefs, and so do they. RAGAR: Montana Democrats have found allies in moderate Republicans before. And that also gives Zephyr hope. She'll start that work in earnest when she's sworn into Montana's 68th legislative session on Jan. 2. For NPR News, I'm Shaylee Ragar in Helena, Mont. SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:   It was a record year for LGBTQ candidates in races for state legislatures across the country. Soon, those lawmakers will file into state capitals in a year where many of their colleagues may file anti-LGBTQ legislation. That includes Montana, a state that passed multiple bills against transgender rights in recent years and where Republicans won even more seats in the state legislature.

That's the question that delegates from around the world are trying to answer this week at the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. It kicked off in Montreal, Canada. And NPR's Nathan Rott joins us to talk about what's at stake. Hey, Nate. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning. MARTIN: Good morning. Let's just take that central question right off the bat. Is that really how scientists see this - that we have a broken relationship with nature? ROTT: Well, if you believe the head of the U. N. , yeah, scientists from around the world and David Attenborough, then, yes. I think it is fair to say that the answer to that is yes. You know, a million species are at risk of extinction globally, many within decades, because of human actions. We're dealing with a global pandemic, the type of which scientists say are more likely to occur the more damage is done to nature. And obviously, the threat of climate change, which is very related to biodiversity, is almost unfathomably huge. MARTIN: Right. So what do people in this biodiversity space want to see happen from this convention? ROTT: Yeah, so the people I've talked to said that they want to see an almost Paris Climate Agreement-level commitment from the countries at this convention. If you don't remember, the Paris Climate Agreement included pledges from all of its members to cut climate-warming emissions. It remains, you know, the foundation of the world's fight against climate change. Conservationists and scientists want to see the same kind of ambitious pledges established for biodiversity. I talked to Rebecca Shaw, the chief scientist at the World Wildlife Fund, about this yesterday, and she says the reason steps are being taken to address climate change is because we are already living with its effects. REBECCA SHAW: It's because the impacts have become unbearable globally. Like, you can't ignore it anymore. We're there on the nature side. It's the nature loss and its implications expresses itself community by community around the globe. ROTT: But she says those cumulative losses are just as great as what we're seeing in terms of climate impacts and the livability of the planet. MARTIN: So what would a Paris Agreement for nature look like? ROTT: So the draft framework they've laid out, generally speaking, would aim to protect ecosystems that are still intact and restore the ones that are not. That's, you know, the broadest way of putting it. Part of that pledge is to protect 30% of the planet's land and water by the year 2030. This is something that the Biden administration is already doing here in the U. S. , but it's also a plan that's raised some concerns from Indigenous people that land could be taken from them in the name of conservation, similar to what happened with Native Americans with the creation of national parks here in the U. S. I talked to Viviana Figueroa, an Indigenous Argentine who's taking part in the negotiations, about this yesterday, and she says there needs to be a recognition of Indigenous peoples' roles in conservation and protections of Indigenous lands. VIVIANA FIGUEROA: There is a lot of evidence that shows that the traditional lands and territories managed by Indigenous people are the most important areas when it comes to biodiversity. ROTT: So that statement is backed up by science, and there has been a big push by the United Nations in recent years to do a better job of taking Indigenous perspectives into account when it comes to these issues. But this is a negotiation, and as we saw at the climate conference in Egypt last month, these big conventions rarely end with everyone getting what they want. MARTIN: NPR's Nathan Rott. Thank you.

YENNY SEO: I actually don't know. But, I mean, as an example, I have come across faces that I remember seeing from when I was younger than 10, so. . . ZOMORODI: Oh, wow. SEO: Yeah. So I have come across, like, schoolteachers or classmates or people I remember in my neighborhood when I lived there as a child. And it's a lot harder to explain where I've seen them. ZOMORODI: Oh, so you're saying it's more just a sense of familiarity? SEO: Yeah. And it's almost like this intuition or this kind of ping. And I know - like, I am so confident I've seen that face before. That happens instantly. ZOMORODI: This is Yenny Seo, and she is what's called a super-recognizer. SEO: So super-recognizer - firstly, I find that term very cringey. (LAUGHTER)ZOMORODI: Oh, no. SEO: Basically what it is is super recognizers people who are maybe on the top 1-2% who are very good at remembering faces. And I'm told that it's about 80% or so of the faces that we see, we remember. So it's very high in comparison to the average person. ZOMORODI: Yenny knew she was always good at recognizing faces. But about five years ago, she realized that her ability was really unusual. SEO: I just turned on the TV, and I happened to come across this show about people with different abilities. And I saw this gentleman was based in the U. K. , and he was a police officer. And they made him do a test where he was standing in a really big train station with lots of people going through. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"INCREDIBLE MEDICINE\")UNIDENTIFIED TV PERSONALITY: You've got to try and find my four actresses who have hidden themselves away in the crowd or be wandering around. SEO: And he was shown photos of, I think, a handful of different faces. And he had to pick out the people that he'd seen in the photo. But the trick was they would, you know, put a wig on them, or they would be wearing a different hat or glasses. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"INCREDIBLE MEDICINE\")UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Black leather jacket, bluejeans. UNIDENTIFIED TV PERSONALITY: Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Things that (inaudible). SEO: And he was able to, I think, pick them all out.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"INCREDIBLE MEDICINE\")UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Is it the lady in the black jumper, cream top and bluejeans? UNIDENTIFIED TV PERSONALITY: Brilliant. ZOMORODI: Yenny took some tests online, and she did really well. So she got in touch with a researcher in Australia, where she lives, who confirmed that she was indeed a super-recognizer. SEO: I ended up visiting the lab in Sydney, and they put some sort of sensor - a detector. So they saw where my eye movements - how it worked when I was exposed to a face. And it's not that I pinpoint on one feature. I would not focus on the eyes or nose or mouth or the shape of the face. It's just the whole. The face as a whole leaves kind of an imprint in my head. ZOMORODI: So have you ever found, like, your ability useful, then - like - other than, like, you know, fun party trick? SEO: Yeah. I mean, when I was in uni, I worked at a clothing store. And we - I mean, I ended up catching a shoplifter because we had a team meeting, and there was a particular shoplifter who would repeatedly steal, like, the highest-priced item in the store. And they had this CCTV footage of her, and it was just this really grainy black-and-white photo. And they showed it to us during our team meeting in the morning, and they stuck it on the wall. And I looked at it, and I was like, all right. I don't know if I'll be able to catch that person. I didn't really think much about it. An hour or so into my shift, that exact person walked in, and I just knew straight away it was that person. Even though the photo was really grainy, I just knew. ZOMORODI: What did you do? SEO: We had security guards in our store, so I just had to - we were wearing walkie-talkie type of things, and I just told them, yeah, she's here. She's just walked into the store. So maybe you guys should go and have a chat with her. They ended up catching her. And then they had to call the cops in. And so that was my one crime-fighting experience. (LAUGHTER)ZOMORODI: From what I understand, a lot of super-recognizers work in or work with law enforcement - is that - or in some kind of security capacity. Is that not something that you sort of thought, well, you know, I could actually make money off of this? SEO: Yeah. I mean, at one point I think I did consider it. But I think - like, it's still very new, and the research in this area is still developing. I know, like, countries like the U.

Fusion is the process that powers the sun. Scientists have been struggling for decades to make it work here on Earth. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has this report on the breakthrough and what it could mean. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: To give you a sense of just how long this took, listen to President Biden's science adviser, Arati Prabhakar. She remembers working on nuclear fusion in 1978. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ARATI PRABHAKAR: You got to picture this. I'm wearing my bellbottoms. I've got long, black hair. And I show up, and I'm a 19-year-old kid, and they give me a laser to work on. BRUMFIEL: Prabhakar was working at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. And the job was this - to try and use that laser to squish lightweight atoms of hydrogen together until they fused. It's a process known as nuclear fusion, and it can generate enormous amounts of power with no greenhouse gases. She worked on it for the summer, and then she left. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRABHAKAR: I went off and didn't do anything more about fusion, but the people I worked with and their successors kept going. BRUMFIEL: And today, decades later, they announced they'd finally done it. The breakthrough came at Livermore's $3. 5 billion National Ignition Facility. Mark Herrmann is the scientist in charge. He says there's been lots of setbacks and disappointments along the way, but the team never gave up. MARK HERRMANN: Ultimately, that determination and grit is really what enabled this exciting success. BRUMFIEL: Last week, researchers pointed to 192 laser beams at a tiny diamond sphere the size of a peppercorn. Inside was hydrogen fuel. The lasers went zap. The peppercorn imploded. And the fuel ignited in a fusion burn that released more energy than the lasers put in. They measure energy in something called megajoules, and this fusion made about 3. 15 megajoules, which sounds cool, but it's not exactly that simple because lasers actually need a lot of juice from the electricity grid to work. HERRMANN: The laser pulled more than 300 megajoules off the grid. And then the fusion energy that came out was, again, about 3 mega joules. BRUMFIEL: In other words, the facility still used way more power overall than it produced. Ryan McBride is a nuclear engineer at the University of Michigan who wasn't involved in this breakthrough. He says today's milestone is important. RYAN MCBRIDE: It is a big scientific step. BRUMFIEL: But, he says, there are several more obstacles to making laser fusion work. To generate steady power would require lasers to zap multiple pellets every second. MCBRIDE: So it's like (vocalizing). You know, that's a lot of pulsing. There's a debris field left as these things are blasted. And you'd have to, like, clear that debris and then inject another one, have all the lasers hit it. BRUMFIEL: Day after day for months and years. McBride says he doubts laser fusion could produce electrical power anytime soon. MCBRIDE: It's many decades, as far as I can see. BRUMFIEL: Meanwhile, the U. S. is seeking to cut its greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, a target that looks to be too close for fusion to help. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News.

SCHMITZ: As Geoff just mentioned, for the first time ever in a laboratory, researchers were able to generate more energy from fusion than they used to start the process. The total gain was around 150%, which sounds astounding. But how realistic is it that this will be able to create clean, safe electricity anytime soon? HSU: Well, I think this achievement was a big step in the sense that before, we questioned whether this was even possible, right? SCHMITZ: Right. HSU: In theory, we knew it could be done. But it's like flipping a switch. Last week, we didn't - people questioned whether it was possible. Today, we know it is possible. So I think that's the important piece. SCHMITZ: And this happened in a U. S. Department of Energy lab. What are other countries doing? Are we - it makes me wonder if we're entering into an era where we see a nuclear fusion race. HSU: Yes, indeed. Other countries are increasing their investments in this area, both because of increasing technical readiness, as we just saw, but also the strong market pull for an energy technology that fusion - of fusion characteristics. So they are investing strongly, many other countries. SCHMITZ: And which countries are sort of in the lead on this, other than the United States, obviously? HSU: Well, the U. K. has has declared an ambition to bring a fusion pilot plant online by 2040. And, of course, the People's Republic of China is investing very strongly. SCHMITZ: And let's talk about the infrastructure that this will require. How much is this going to cost? Are we investing enough money in this now to make this viable in the future? HSU: Yeah, that's a great question. You know, when people ask, how long will it take? - to me, it's more about our collective will and how much we invest. And so I think we know what needs to be done. And it's a collective will to get there. In terms of infrastructure, I think there's many opportunities and needs. If we are to have a fusion energy economy, there's a lot of opportunities in high-tech components, materials and manufacturing. We would like to be able to secure these supply chains in America and with our allies. But also, we can repurpose existing infrastructure. For example, decommissioning power plants would be a win-win, saving costs for fusion developers and also bringing benefits to local communities because fusion is clean. SCHMITZ: And are we going to see money in the budget for this in the years to come now that this discovery has been made? HSU: Well, even if I knew the answer to that, I couldn't say it here. I'd have to refer those questions to the Department of Energy public affairs folks. SCHMITZ: But, Scott, when we look at the infrastructure that's required for nuclear fusion to actually be viable, we're thinking about things like especially skilled professionals, people who understand how this works. At this stage, do we have enough people trained in this to make this happen? HSU: So that's a great question. We really do need to build our workforce. I think in the hardcore fusion plasma physics, we have a good number of people. But to do all the rest of the things to get to viable commercial fusion energy, we need to grow our workforce in many different areas to bring fusion to technical and commercial viability.

He's the director of the Plasma Science and Fusion Center at MIT. Dr. Whyte, this is being called a breakthrough in the search for limitless, clean energy. In a few words, how would you explain this to someone who knows very little about this? DENNIS WHYTE: Right. So in fusion, what you're doing is literally fusing or pushing together these hydrogen atoms. They turn into helium. This is what happens in our sun as well, too. And when that happens, that can release large amounts of net energy. So what we've been - the achievement of this, which sounds a little bit like science fiction, that you have to achieve extremely high temperatures. . . SCHMITZ: It does, yeah. WHYTE: . . . Like over 50 million degrees - has eluded us about making net energy out of any single sort of event of this. So if confirmed this morning by the secretary of energy, this is indeed a breakthrough. SCHMITZ: Later this morning, we expect to hear scientists say that they have achieved ignition. What does that mean? WHYTE: Right. So the definition varies slightly between the different ways that you approach fusion. But the definition that was provided by the National Academies was that for this particular approach to fusion, which uses lasers, that when the amount of fusion energy exceeded the input laser energy, then that was the definition of ignition. There's various other definitions which matter for making it economically viable. SCHMITZ: And as I understand it, they're generating no electricity. And they are using vastly more electricity than they get out in fusion. But the lasers need a lot of electricity, right? So this experiment still took energy off the grid? WHYTE: That's correct. I mean, to be clear, they were not even attempting to make electricity out of it. SCHMITZ: Yeah. WHYTE: And, in fact, this is one of the other aspects that needs to improve, is that you need to get fairly high levels of gain to make this a viable energy source, you know, to be a practical power plant. But getting over the threshold scientifically of seeing net energy is a major accomplishment because you see for the first time sort of the physical conditions of which will be required for a power plant as we extrapolate forward. SCHMITZ: Dr. Whyte, given what we know now, how long do you estimate it'll take for scientists to be able to replicate this discovery on a broader scale so that societies can actually use this type of energy? And what steps will we need to take to do that? WHYTE: Right. Well, the exciting thing is that this has been pursued, you know, by science, scientists around the world, including in the United States, obviously, for many decades. And we've made important progress scientifically towards this. But what's changed in the context of this, of what we think - we anticipate with this announcement, is that, indeed, the advent of a private sector in fusion also indicates about both the push and the - you know, because of climate change - and the pull that's coming from the commercial sector about getting to the point where we can actually put this on the grid. And there is a push to try to do this within the next decade. It is difficult. The technology is difficult. But these are these kinds of advances that provide hope to us that, in fact, we're on the right path. SCHMITZ: Dennis Whyte is the director of the Plasma Science and Fusion Center at MIT.

S. scientists are announcing a big advance in nuclear fusion. A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST:  Now, that's the process that powers our sun. And if - if - it could be brought to Earth, it would mean nearly limitless clean energy. SCHMITZ: Joining us now is NPR science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel. Good morning, Geoff. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Good morning, Rob. SCHMITZ: So, Geoff, break down this breakthrough for us. BRUMFIEL: Right. So last week at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, scientists did something they've never done in a laboratory setting before. They got more energy out of a nuclear fusion reaction than they put into it. SCHMITZ: Wow. BRUMFIEL: And there are some caveats. We'll get to those caveats in a minute. But this is a big deal because nuclear fusion is very hard to make happen on Earth. Basically, fusion is the process of sticking lightweight atoms together. When they fuse, when they glom together, they release a ton of energy. But getting them to stick is really tough. SCHMITZ: This is very exciting. How did they do this? BRUMFIEL: With lasers. It's like the. . . SCHMITZ: Lasers. BRUMFIEL: . . . Classic science - pew-pew-pew (ph) laser science. They have this multi-billion dollar facility called the National Ignition Facility. It's pretty much the most powerful laser on Earth. And basically, all these laser beams are pointed at one teeny, tiny target made of gold and depleted uranium. Inside that target is an even tinier sphere of diamond - about the size of a peppercorn. And inside that are different isotopes of hydrogen. So basically 192 laser beams go in. The energy squeezes all that hydrogen together until it ignites and burns, kind of like the head of a match. But this is a real brute-force approach to making nuclear fusion happen. SCHMITZ: This is fascinating. How much power did that produce? BRUMFIEL: Well, here's the sort of caveat part. It wasn't all that much. SCHMITZ: OK. BRUMFIEL: So the experiment did generate more power out than the lasers put in, but the lasers themselves require a ton of electricity to operate. So actually, they still ended up using a lot more power than they got out the other end. And this is just sort of the start of the problem with this whole laser approach. SCHMITZ: OK. BRUMFIEL: I spoke to Ryan McBride, a nuclear engineer at the University of Michigan, and he said if you wanted to make electricity, you'd need to zap several of these diamond targets every second. RYAN MCBRIDE: So that's like (vocalizing). You know, that's a lot of pulsing. There's a debris field left as these things are blasted. And you'd have to, like, clear that debris, inject another one, have all the lasers hit it. BRUMFIEL: And you have to do that over and over for days and months and years. And at the moment, they can only zap a target once a week. So power is a long way off. SCHMITZ: OK. Does this have any other uses? BRUMFIEL: Yeah, it turns out the exploding target is actually like a thermonuclear weapon. And, in fact, the main job of the National Ignition Facility, or NIF, as it's known, is to make sure our aging nuclear weapons still work. MCBRIDE: We no longer test nuclear weapons. And so they've built machines like NIF as surrogates to doing actual tests since we haven't tested since 1992. BRUMFIEL: And so this is a big deal for that side of things as well because it means that weapons physicists can make sure their calculations are correct. SCHMITZ: So bottom line, Geoff - this sounds huge, like Thomas Edison lightbulb huge. But maybe it's not going to change the world just yet. BRUMFIEL: Yeah, it's a big step forward. But the scientists I spoke to said fusion energy remains decades away. And to put things in perspective, the U. S. has tried to cut its carbon emissions in half by 2030, which is only a few years away. So I don't think this is going to solve the climate crisis. But on the bright side, it does show that humans are good at solving tough problems. So maybe don't count us out just yet. SCHMITZ: NPR's Geoff Brumfiel. Thanks, Geoff. BRUMFIEL: Thank you, Rob.

So actually, they still ended up using a lot more power than they got out the other end. And this is just sort of the start of the problem with this whole laser approach. SCHMITZ: OK. BRUMFIEL: I spoke to Ryan McBride, a nuclear engineer at the University of Michigan, and he said if you wanted to make electricity, you'd need to zap several of these diamond targets every second. RYAN MCBRIDE: So that's like (vocalizing). You know, that's a lot of pulsing. There's a debris field left as these things are blasted. And you'd have to, like, clear that debris, inject another one, have all the lasers hit it. BRUMFIEL: And you have to do that over and over for days and months and years. And at the moment, they can only zap a target once a week. So power is a long way off. SCHMITZ: OK. Does this have any other uses? BRUMFIEL: Yeah, it turns out the exploding target is actually like a thermonuclear weapon. And, in fact, the main job of the National Ignition Facility, or NIF, as it's known, is to make sure our aging nuclear weapons still work. MCBRIDE: We no longer test nuclear weapons. And so they've built machines like NIF as surrogates to doing actual tests since we haven't tested since 1992. BRUMFIEL: And so this is a big deal for that side of things as well because it means that weapons physicists can make sure their calculations are correct. SCHMITZ: So bottom line, Geoff - this sounds huge, like Thomas Edison lightbulb huge. But maybe it's not going to change the world just yet. BRUMFIEL: Yeah, it's a big step forward. But the scientists I spoke to said fusion energy remains decades away. And to put things in perspective, the U. S. has tried to cut its carbon emissions in half by 2030, which is only a few years away. So I don't think this is going to solve the climate crisis. But on the bright side, it does show that humans are good at solving tough problems. So maybe don't count us out just yet. SCHMITZ: NPR's Geoff Brumfiel. Thanks, Geoff.

SHAPIRO: Well, how close are we? NPR science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel is here to answer that question. Hey, Geoff. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Hi there. SHAPIRO: I remember, when I was in high school, I heard about fusion as kind of this magic bullet to solve the world's energy problems. That was decades ago. Why has it taken so long to reach this point? BRUMFIEL: Right. So if you'll let me do a little nuclear physics 101 here, I can explain it. SHAPIRO: Go for it. BRUMFIEL: Basically, fusion is the act of sticking two lightweight atoms together. And at their cores, atoms have protons. Protons are positively charged. And so just like the end of a magnet, they'll repel each other. So to push them together takes a lot of energy. It takes heating to hundreds of millions of degrees. And so that creates a situation where, like, you can't do it on earth because it will just melt any box you put it in, so you have to suspended in magnetic fields and - or use lasers. It just gets more and more complicated. And that's really it. There's no one thing, but it's just a really tough problem. SHAPIRO: Why is it worth the effort to solve this really tough problem? What makes it such a great accomplishment? BRUMFIEL: Well, what you get out the other end, if you can make it work, is pretty much clean, limitless energy. Fusion. . . SHAPIRO: Star power. BRUMFIEL: Star power. SHAPIRO: Literal star power. BRUMFIEL: Literal star power because the sun runs on fusion. So we have another source of nuclear energy, which is conventional nuclear energy, but it creates nuclear waste. It feels kind of dangerous. SHAPIRO: That's splitting atoms instead of shoving them together, right? BRUMFIEL: Exactly. Exactly. And the problems there, we know, I think, all too well, and we struggle with them. Fusion is something where the reactors could be shut off much more easily, and they would produce less nuclear waste. So it feels both safer and cleaner. SHAPIRO: And is this breakthrough that was announced yesterday the achievement of all of these dreams people have had for decades? BRUMFIEL: Well, yes and no. So let me explain. This was done using a giant laser facility. And basically what they did was they took 192 laser beams, and they crushed a tiny pellet of fusion fuel. And they did indeed get more energy out than the laser beams put in. And that's a huge breakthrough for the field. The problem is that those lasers have to be plugged into the wall. SHAPIRO: (Laughter). BRUMFIEL: And so it turns out that the energy that you need to get out of the wall is much, much higher. So they, in fact, got probably a little under 1% of the energy overall that they had to put into the entire system. SHAPIRO: But it is one significant step forward, according to the energy secretary. So what's the next step and the step after that? What does the path ahead look like? BRUMFIEL: Well, there are several different approaches to fusion. And they all have their challenges, and they're all struggling. And for the laser thing, you would have to have a much more efficient laser, obviously. You'd have to be able to do it many times a second, which means firing the laser over and over again. You'd have to have better targets. There's, like, just this laundry list of technical and engineering achievements you'd need to get through. And frankly, it's going to take decades. SHAPIRO: So it's not going to be the solution to climate change that we're looking for if we want to cut emissions in half by the end of the decade, which is the Biden administration's goal. But is there a reason to be hopeful about this? BRUMFIEL: You know, the thing about it is, fusion is a really tough technical problem. And in some sense, climate change is the same thing. Climate change itself is a very tough problem. There's no silver bullet. You just got to keep working at it. So I think the one thing fusion shows is, when humans work on a tough problem, they can make progress. And that's what I take away from it. There's not always a magic solution. That doesn't mean we can't get stuff done. SHAPIRO: NPR's Geoff Brumfiel. Thanks for the optimism and the reality check. BRUMFIEL: Thank you.

High up in the mountains across the U. S. , rapid growth of algae, or algal blooms, are turning melting snow pink. They further darken the surface of the snow and make it melt more quickly, and scientists are trying to understand what's causing them and how they impact water levels in drought-prone areas. One of those scientists is Robin Kodner, an associate professor of environmental science at Western Washington University. And she's here to talk with us today. Welcome to the show. ROBIN KODNER: Thank you. RASCOE: So first, where does the pink color come from? KODNER: So when the algae cells are growing in the snow, they produce a red-colored pigment that turns the snow pink, or if the algae are in really high numbers, they can turn the snow red. And that pigment helps act as, like, a sunscreen for the algae. It helps protect them from high light levels. RASCOE: How does the pigmented algae affect the snow? KODNER: So the melting snow habitat is natural for the algae. However, if they're growing at really high concentrations, they darken the snow's surface, which increases the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the snow. And that then increases the rate of snow melt. RASCOE: Are these blooms becoming more common? 'Cause you said it's not unusual to have the algae there, but is it new? KODNER: That's an excellent question, and I feel like, as a scientific community, we're still trying to figure that out. There haven't been that many people around the world studying snow algae, but we'd predict that they would be getting worse or more intense as the climate warms and snowpack and glacier snow melts more regularly and earlier in the season. But we're still collecting the data to say for sure. RASCOE: Does the speed of the snow melt matter for resources? Like, how does it affect that? KODNER: So when snowpack melts, it provides water resources through rivers to downstream ecosystems and communities. And if the snow melts very quickly in spring or summer months, you can get flooding events and then droughts later in the season. So the rate of snow melt can impact how much water is available throughout the summer season. RASCOE: So it sounds like if the blooms are getting larger, that may not be a good thing? KODNER: Yeah. I feel like it's difficult to say good or bad. If snow algae blooms are increasing over time, and in particular if they're increasing on snow that's protecting glaciers in the summer, then it could be considered sort of a harmful bloom. RASCOE: I understand that your lab has a project now where you're asking people to submit samples and photos when they think they see pink snow. Can you tell us a little bit about that? Like, what are you hoping to use that data for? KODNER: We need a large data set, and so the best way to create this data set is to get help from the community. And people are out hiking and climbing and backcountry skiing all the time, and they are the eyes of this project. And so through the app that we created, people can make an observation when they think they see pink snow and take a picture and send it to us. RASCOE: What's the name of the app? KODNER: The app is called the Living Snow Project, and this type of data allows us to survey across large areas over long periods of time to address the question, are they changing? Are things getting worse? RASCOE: That was Robin Kodner, associate professor of environmental science at Western Washington University. Thanks so much for speaking with us today. KODNER: Thank you.

Christmas Eve is nearly here, and Santa is hard at work preparing for his big night. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN\")JACKSON 5: (Singing) Santa Claus is coming to town. Santa Claus is coming to town. RASCOE: Now, a lot of people may wonder, how does Santa deliver gifts to about 2 billion kids in one night? Well, here's an answer for you - physics. Gaute Einevoll is a physicist at Norwegian University of Life Sciences. He's written about the physics of Santa's big night and joins us now from Oslo. Welcome. GAUTE EINEVOLL: Thank you. Thank you. RASCOE: OK, let's start with the biggest questions on people's minds. How does Santa, one person, move quickly enough to deliver all of these gifts to all of these children? I mean, 'cause there's only 24 hours in a day. EINEVOLL: Yeah, it's true. But luckily, all the good children are living all across the world. So there's, like, different time zones. So he has actually a little bit more than 24 hours, maybe more like 30 hours. Another thing that helps is that I think in U. S. , typically, Santa comes by in the middle of the night. In Europe, at least in Norway, he comes in the evening. RASCOE: What about the speed? Does he have to go really, really fast? EINEVOLL: Yeah, he has to go really, really fast. But I mean, we are used to living in three dimensions, right? Left, right, straight ahead and up and down. Modern physics, especially something called string theory, has shown that it could be more than three dimensions. Things which are far away in, like, three dimensions can be really close in four dimensions. And if you were living on a sheet of paper and then you feel, like, two points far away on this sheet of paper when it's lying out straight, when you curl up the paper, these two points can be very close, right? If you're just able to jump through the paper - much, much shorter distance. RASCOE: So what about the weight of all those gifts? EINEVOLL: I think he's using space, right? We just - like, we have the International Space Station going in orbit. We think that he makes a lot of the presents up in space also, using materials from, like, asteroids and whatever - like, comets and stuff. So, like, we'll also be - humans are planning to do maybe in the future. So we think that he has a lot of gifts stored up there also, which are just sort of filled up there during the year. And when Christmas Eve comes, then you can have all this little sort of gifts, packages returning to Earth. RASCOE: Well, you know, my kids are very interested in how Santa knows whether they are naughty or nice. And I really want to be able to tell them because I tell them that he knows when they're acting up. EINEVOLL: No, that's true. So again, this is where modern science comes in to help. Well, it seems like in many of these, like, Christmas hats or these woolen caps that children use, Santa has some recording electrodes that is recording their brain signals from the children's heads. And then from that, he can sort of find out whether is naughty or nice. It's quite a big problem to get all this information. This is maybe also an important role for Rudolph. And how does Santa get all these signals that is coming from all these hats, from all these children? Well, they need strong antennas, and they shouldn't be too far away. So I think we believe that Rudolph's antlers and then, of course, Santa maybe has to find out and to analyze all the signals - probably have some very strong computers up there. RASCOE: Speaking of computers and stuff like that, there's a lot of automated technology nowadays. Do you think that Santa could be using any of that to make his job easier? EINEVOLL: Absolutely. I think - particularly, I mentioned this thing of dropping gifts from outer space. I think drones are probably helping Santa because we are sort of getting more, more and more people. We have more children and maybe more of them are nice also. . . (LAUGHTER)EINEVOLL: . . . So Santa should use all technologies available. RASCOE: Before I let you go, I want to set the record straight. There is some controversy that is percolating right now about whether Santa lives in Norway or Finland. EINEVOLL: Yes. Yeah. RASCOE: Like, what is your take on that? EINEVOLL: I thought this was settled long time ago. Of course he lives in Norway. RASCOE: (Laughter). EINEVOLL: Santa spends a lot of time on the North Pole. He, like, resides at the North Pole, right? And it's even in our name. RASCOE: Yes, Norway. EINEVOLL: Exactly. RASCOE: (Laughter). EINEVOLL: Our friends in Finland are a little bit cheeky when they sort of - (laughter) they claim that he lives up in the north of Finland. As we know, there are also some, like, wannabe Santas. But the true Santa, the one that really comes to the children, he lives in Norway. RASCOE: Gaute Einevoll is a Santa expert and physicist at Norwegian University of Life Sciences. Thank you so much and Merry Christmas. EINEVOLL: Merry Christmas to you, too.

And I really want to be able to tell them because I tell them that he knows when they're acting up. EINEVOLL: No, that's true. So again, this is where modern science comes in to help. Well, it seems like in many of these, like, Christmas hats or these woolen caps that children use, Santa has some recording electrodes that is recording their brain signals from the children's heads. And then from that, he can sort of find out whether is naughty or nice. It's quite a big problem to get all this information. This is maybe also an important role for Rudolph. And how does Santa get all these signals that is coming from all these hats, from all these children? Well, they need strong antennas, and they shouldn't be too far away. So I think we believe that Rudolph's antlers and then, of course, Santa maybe has to find out and to analyze all the signals - probably have some very strong computers up there. RASCOE: Speaking of computers and stuff like that, there's a lot of automated technology nowadays. Do you think that Santa could be using any of that to make his job easier? EINEVOLL: Absolutely. I think - particularly, I mentioned this thing of dropping gifts from outer space. I think drones are probably helping Santa because we are sort of getting more, more and more people. We have more children and maybe more of them are nice also. . . (LAUGHTER) EINEVOLL: . . . So Santa should use all technologies available. RASCOE: Before I let you go, I want to set the record straight. There is some controversy that is percolating right now about whether Santa lives in Norway or Finland. EINEVOLL: Yes. Yeah. RASCOE: Like, what is your take on that? EINEVOLL: I thought this was settled long time ago. Of course he lives in Norway. RASCOE: (Laughter). EINEVOLL: Santa spends a lot of time on the North Pole. He, like, resides at the North Pole, right? And it's even in our name. RASCOE: Yes, Norway. EINEVOLL: Exactly. RASCOE: (Laughter). EINEVOLL: Our friends in Finland are a little bit cheeky when they sort of - (laughter) they claim that he lives up in the north of Finland. As we know, there are also some, like, wannabe Santas. But the true Santa, the one that really comes to the children, he lives in Norway. RASCOE: Gaute Einevoll is a Santa expert and physicist at Norwegian University of Life Sciences. Thank you so much and Merry Christmas. EINEVOLL: Merry Christmas to you, too.

Since the Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, some doctors say they're hearing from a growing number of male patients who want vasectomies. NPR's Sarah McCammon has that story. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: When I met Dustin May at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Saint Louis recently, he was still recovering. How are you feeling? DUSTIN MAY: Kind of walking like a penguin, like a little waddle - but otherwise, not too bad. Yeah. MCCAMMON: May and his girlfriend, Courtney Price, are still in their 20s. But she says they both feel certain they don't want children. COURTNEY PRICE: I've always known. I've never had that desire for children. And people find that weird. But I just don't have that, like, maternal urge. So like, our first date, we did talk about it. And I'm like, kids? He's like, no. I'm like, thank God. MCCAMMON: Price says she's tried several different types of birth control. And they all had unpleasant side effects. After more than three years together, May says he felt it was his turn to take action, especially after this summer's Supreme Court decision allowed a near-total abortion ban to take effect here in Missouri, where they live. So May signed up for a vasectomy, an outpatient sterilization procedure that blocks the release of sperm. MAY: And taking a step as a man. It shouldn't just be on women, you know? And if she got pregnant, an abortion would be something that we'd consider, considering we don't want kids. This is a step to prevent that. MCCAMMON: This Planned Parenthood in St. Louis used to provide abortions until the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling was released in June. But on the day I visited, the health center was hosting a free vasectomy clinic involving dozens of vasectomies at three different locations over three days. Normally, if they're not covered by a patient's insurance, Planned Parenthood charges up to $1,000, including follow-up care. Dr. Esgar Guarin was visiting from Iowa to help out. ESGAR GUARIN: What has happened is that since Roe v. Wade was overturned, many men have realized that they, perhaps, have been absent in contraception, particularly in permitting contraceptive decisions. MCCAMMON: As soon as the decision was released, Guarin says his vasectomy practice saw a surge in website traffic. And the number of patients coming in for procedures nearly doubled from June to July. And his practice isn't alone. A spokesperson for the American Urological Association says that while national data isn't available yet, around the country, health care providers have reported increasing demand for vasectomies. I spoke to several of them. Here's Dr. Sarah Vij, an assistant professor of urology at the Cleveland Clinic. SARAH VIJ: Our procedure volumes that we're doing for vasectomies are at, like, sky-high record rates. Like, we've never done this many. MCCAMMON: In New York, Dr. Meera Shah, chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, is seeing something similar. MEERA SHAH: They've been thinking about getting the vasectomy for a really long time. And then, you know, what's happening in this country has motivated them that much more to get the vasectomy. MCCAMMON: Shah says there can be downsides. She tells patients that vasectomy reversals are sometimes possible, but never guaranteed. Here's how she describes an ideal candidate. SHAH: Someone who is absolutely sure and says, you know, I understand this is a permanent method of sterilization. And I either do not want children or I'm done having children. MCCAMMON: Shah says some patients choose to freeze their sperm before the procedure in an effort to keep more options open should they decide to try to have a child in the future. Another patient at the Planned Parenthood in St. Louis, Collin Mack, told me he's been wanting a vasectomy for several years. COLLIN MACK: But I waited because I don't like making rash decisions. MCCAMMON: Until now. Mack says he worries about the lack of access to abortion. And he likes the idea of being in control of his fertility. At 24, he says he feels confident in his decision. But he did take one step just in case he ever changes his mind. MACK: Yeah, I've frozen some sperm. That was, like - I talked with my grandparents. I kind of played the card of, like, well, if you guys want me to have kids - because you guys seem the most upset about this procedure - you guys should invest some money in me freezing the sperm. MCCAMMON: Storing sperm usually costs several hundred dollars a year, according to Johns Hopkins medicine. Dr. Guarin says many of his recent patients have been younger men, often in their 30s, as well as couples who'd been relying on female partners for contraception and no longer feel confident doing so. GUARIN: I hope this is an inflection point in reproductive rights in America for the participation of men. MCCAMMON: In addition to being permanent, he says, vasectomies are relatively quick, about 10 minutes for a skilled surgeon. And they're less invasive than permanent sterilization procedures for women like tubal ligation - one more reason, he says, he hopes men will become a bigger part of the conversation about contraception.

COHN-HOFT: In the first half-hour of the day, we could hear 50 different species of birds and not see a single one. SIEGLER: It's now 5:30, and the faint light of dawn is just beginning to peek through the towering canopy. We have our headlamps on because it's still pretty dark, in case we step on a snake. Channeling Indiana Jones - I mean, there was a viper sighting near the toilets last night. But no snakes we can see now anyway, just more exotic sounds - critters, parrots. It makes you feel like you're far away from everything. COHN-HOFT: You just get so much information from hearing. SIEGLER: Just by listening, Mario Cohn-Hoft and his team recently discovered two never-before-known species of potoo birds. They also found what they believed to be the world's loudest bird - the white bellbird. (SOUNDBITE OF SCREAMING PIHA CALLS)SIEGLER: About a mile from camp, we stumble on its runner-up.

ARI DANIEL, BYLINE: A few years back, Jesse Delia, now a biologist at the American Museum of Natural History, was in Panama. He was wrapping up a field study on a type of glassfrog. And he brought a handful of these translucent frogs, each no bigger than a half-dollar coin, to the lab for a photo shoot. JESSE DELIA: I wanted to get some photos of the glassfrog bellies. And so I put them in petri dishes. You could see the circulatory system. It was red with red blood cells. DANIEL: And then it wasn't. DELIA: When I came back later, it was gone. It was crazy. DANIEL: As if the arteries and veins filled with red blood had just melted away. He then took a video of the glassfrog's pumping and seemingly bloodless heart. Delia sent it to his collaborator, Carlos Taboada, a biologist at Duke University. CARLOS TABOADA: It was colorless. It was insane. DANIEL: Not even the telltale red streak of a vessel in the frog's belly was visible. TABOADA: I had never seen anything like that. DANIEL: The biologists wanted to know, how did the frogs hide their blood? Where did all those red cells go? In a new paper out in the journal Science, Delia says they now have an answer. DELIA: They hide most of their red blood cells in their liver. DANIEL: Their liver, which is coated in reflective crystals. During the day, while the glassfrogs are asleep on green leaves, they're vulnerable to predators, so they cram their livers full of red blood cells to become super transparent, far less visible to those who'd eat them. As they sleep, those red cells transport very little oxygen. DELIA: It means that they probably have some specialized metabolism, some alternative process that allows them to keep their cells alive during transparency. DANIEL: Then, at night, when the frogs become active, and they're going about their regular business of feeding and mating, the amphibians release their red blood cells back into circulation. In the dark, predators no longer rely on visual cues. Rather, they detect vibrations in the leaves or use chemical signals. Once it's daytime, the cycle begins anew. Carlos Taboada again. TABOADA: They pack, like, 90% of their red blood cells in a really, really small volume. Normally, those conditions can trigger, like, some clotting disorders. DANIEL: It's a remarkable adaptation that allows these little frogs to pull off their vanishing act. Ari Daniel, NPR News.

And when scientists want to learn about its earliest history, they turn to a mineral that serves as an almost perfect geologic clock. As part of our series Finding Time, NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce looks into a mineral that's been called the time lord. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The mineral is zircon. Not to be confused with cubic zirconia, the synthetic diamond look-alike, zircon forms naturally. It can be reddish or golden. There's some big, polished ones in the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. They're in a case just past the Hope Diamond. MICHAEL ACKERSON: So these are pretty zircons. These are zircons that are clear enough, have enough color that they were actually faceted as gemstones. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Michael Ackerson is a geologist who studies zircons. The ones back in his office are teeny tiny. To the naked eye, they look like crud or sand. He sticks them under the microscope and lets me have a peek. So here's this microscope. Let me see if I can do this. Geez, I hate looking through microscopes. OK. Oh, my goodness. How pretty is that? ACKERSON: Yeah. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They look like little diamonds or something. You said they weren't going to be pretty. ACKERSON: (Laughter). GREENFIELDBOYCE: He tells me that one of the crystals I'm looking at is 4. 32 billion years old. Zircons are the oldest known pieces of earth that still exist on the surface today. The oldest go back as far as 4. 37 billion years. ACKERSON: They are really the best markers of Earth's time or the history of the Earth. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Ackerson says a zircon crystal originally forms in magma - hot molten rock. Other minerals do too. Together, they'll make up, say, a granite mountain that slowly weathers away. ACKERSON: Most of the minerals don't survive. So things like quartz, things like feldspar, they're chemically or physically weathered and eroded to a point where they're no longer quartz and feldspar. Zircon - and one of the main reasons that zircon is so useful - is that zircon is very resilient. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The hardy crystals persist and eventually end up incorporated into another rock as it's forming. That means scientists can crush up the Earth's oldest rocks and pick through the debris to find little grains of zircon that are even older. To know a zircon's exact age, they zap it with a laser. JOSHUA GARBER: So welcome to our lab. This corner is all of the instruments that we use to date zircon. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Joshua Garber at Penn State University showed me how he sticks a little zircon into this machine that blasts off minuscule pieces. GARBER: So then I, you know, torture them in an argon plasma to break them down to their smallest constituents. And then I very precisely measure the number of atoms that are hitting a detector at the end. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The important atoms are uranium and lead. A growing crystal of zircon loves uranium and will take it in. But zircon hates lead. That means if you find lead inside, it pretty surely came from the decay of uranium, which happens at a steady rate like the ticking of a clock. Jesse Reimink is a geologist at Penn State. He says it's almost as if zircons were designed to be a timekeeper. JESSE REIMINK: If you believed in a higher power, you'd say, oh, the higher power created this mineral with this specific system because it is so perfect for Earth. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But looking at the chemical makeup of a zircon can do more than just reveal its age. It can also give scientists clues about the conditions that existed when that zircon got created. Ackerson says people used to think the early Earth was a hot, glowing hellscape for its first 500 million years. But the oldest zircons found on Earth show that's not so. ACKERSON: We know from just this one collection of zircon crystals that the Earth had continents, which we didn't think was possible, that were interacting with liquid water oceans. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says tiny zircons provide a unique window into deep time, letting us explore big philosophical questions about how our planet's early years set the stage for life.

COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #2: (As Alexa) I added milk to your shopping list. SHAPIRO: You might even be listening to this podcast because AI software recommended it to you. Artificial intelligence is seeping more deeply into every corner of our existence. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: This piece of art right here, believe it or not, was created using AI or artificial intelligence, and it is stirring up a conversation of what is considered art. SHAPIRO: CONSIDER THIS - artificial intelligence is baked into our daily lives, but this recipe is still cooking. We'll look at the leaps in AI over the last year and what might be coming next. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: From NPR, I'm Ari Shapiro. It's Thursday, December 29. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. In the last year, something strange has happened. Friends have morphed into fairy princesses and astronauts. TV scripts, poetry and cover letters written by bots have sounded a whole lot like the creations of real humans. In short, 2022 has felt like a turning point for AI. NPR's Bobby Allyn reports on some new tools that showcase the power and the peril of this technology. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: There are two crazes taking the internet by storm right now. The first is an image generator called Lensa. You upload a bunch of selfies to the app and it spits out a batch of hyperrealistic avatars - you in space, you as an anime character. All of them have one thing in common - as one person put it on Twitter, you, but 20% hotter. Oren Etzioni runs the Seattle-based Allen Institute for AI. OREN ETZIONI: They've really taken this technology and they tied it with people's ego and their vanity. And that combination has proven to be almost irresistible. ALLYN: The second tool causing lots of buzz is called ChatGPT. It's a bot that can hold a conversation or answer questions a lot like a human. You ask it something, and it starts responding in a way that can freak you out pretty fast. I asked it to place a Chipotle order in the speaking style of Donald Trump, and it said, quote, \"all right, folks, let me tell you - this Chipotle order is going to be huge - the best Chipotle order you've ever seen, believe me. We're talking about a big, beautiful burrito bowl. \" It went on from there. With such a gift for language, it did make me wonder, will ChatGPT one day replace me? ETZIONI: It's pretty funny, right? Are you going to be out of a job? Of course, I'm probably going to be out of a job because you don't really need me. You could just take those questions, feed them into the ChatGPT, and it'll give you pretty plausible answers. ALLYN: It may seem like AI has all of a sudden gotten really, really good, but Etzioni likes to say AI's overnight success has been 50 years in the making. Some of the most advanced AI tools are being developed secretly by tech giants like Google and Facebook. The companies aren't ready to publicly release them, in part because the ways they can be abused is still being studied. But startups, like the companies behind Lensa and ChatGPT, have another approach. Release the tools publicly, see how they're used, then try to put up guardrails to prevent abuse. Obviously, sending tools this powerful into the wild will produce all sorts of results. Jen King studies privacy and AI at Stanford. She's noticed one thing ChatGPT does that's concerning. JEN KING: You can give it a prompt to explain something in terms that make it sound extremely legitimate, but the underlying facts are actually incorrect. ALLYN: For instance, I asked ChatGPT to generate a job cover letter for me, and it made a passable one. But it also said I worked for a newspaper in a city I used to live in but never actually worked for. Some AI researchers have a name for this - hallucinating. AI researcher Etzioni says, though ChatGPT can answer questions in a way that seems persuasive, nothing it says should be taken as fact. ETZIONI: A colleague of mine referred to ChatGPT as a mouth without a brain. ALLYN: With Lensa, one problem many users are reporting is that the avatars produced tend to overly sexualize women. Sometimes, the app will even create a completely naked cartoon version of you, even if all you gave the app were photos of your face. King with Stanford says this is because Lensa, like most AI tools, is trained using vast amounts of data from the internet. And it's the internet, so there's lots of pornography. KING: Some of these companies are really training their models on what I would call the internet's toxic waste. And so to me, it's no surprise that we see these effects. ALLYN: The company behind Lensa has responded to people who have complained about their avatars being sexualized. It says it has tweaked its AI algorithm so that nudity is avoided. And if your avatar does have nudity, the company says it should now be blurred. Not everyone is upset with their Lensa avatars. There already are reports of people bringing their Lensa portraits to plastic surgeons for inspiration. Bobby Allyn, NPR News. SHAPIRO: So was 2022 the year that advancements in artificial intelligence made the world a much scarier place? Or does it just feel that way? Put another way, did I write this introduction, or did a chat bot? Brian Christian is author of the bestselling book \"The Alignment Problem,\" and he's here to help us look back and forward at the impact AI is having on our lives. Good to have you here. BRIAN CHRISTIAN: Thank you. It's a pleasure. SHAPIRO: Well, in addition to everything we just heard about, this was also the year that a piece of art generated by AI won a prize at the Colorado State Fair. This was the year a Google engineer claimed that an AI chat bot was sentient, even though many experts later downplayed his claim. Put all this together and, like, what kind of a headline would you write about AI in 2022? CHRISTIAN: I think this is really the year that AI research went mainstream. A lot of these systems have been kind of brewing within research labs for the last several years, but this is really, I would say, the grand debut in terms of actually having real-world impact and being the kind of thing that now millions of people are actively using every day. SHAPIRO: So if this isn't necessarily new technology, but newly public technology, what does that mean? Like, what does it mean that all of this is now publicly recognizably in our faces? CHRISTIAN: I think a lot of the concerns that people had about this technology that existed in the academic literature as hypothetical problems have now become real problems that we need to figure out and muddle through in real time. Whether that's the sort of concerns of plagiarism or using intellectual property, whether that is, you know, the ability to create misinformation and toxic speech - all of these things that people had been worrying about as possible downstream consequences of this technology, well, now, you know, the rubber has hit the road, and we actually have to deal with it. SHAPIRO: The abstract suddenly became real. CHRISTIAN: Very much. SHAPIRO: So when you hear about these kinds of new advances, where do you emotionally land on the spectrum between excited and terrified? CHRISTIAN: I wouldn't say that I'm on the spectrum between excited and terrified. I would say I feel very excited and very terrified. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Both can coexist at the same time. CHRISTIAN: Indeed. SHAPIRO: What's the thing that most excites you about it? And then I'll ask you the thing that most terrifies you about it. CHRISTIAN: The thing that most excites me is that it feels to me - and, you know, not everyone is going to agree with this - but it feels to me that the field of AI is finally delivering on the sort of philosophical promise that the field has had going back to the 1940s and '50s of trying to unlock, if you will, the secrets of intelligence - trying to rediscover some of the principles that evolution itself has found for how thinking works. And so for me, it feels like, after, you know, 70 years of trying various things, we have hit, if you will, the philosophical paydirt. And so that's what's really kind of riveting for me - is what this ends up teaching us about ourselves - about the nature of cognition itself. SHAPIRO: And what keeps you up at night? CHRISTIAN: What keeps me up at night is, I would say, this concept that in the field is called the alignment problem, which is that. . . SHAPIRO: Conveniently, the title of your book. CHRISTIAN: Yes. Yes. I've spent many years sleepless about this. And the alignment problem is the idea that we build these systems to do some particular mathematical task that we can define really easily in the code, but that's not often what we actually want the system to do. So for example, these language models are trained to be essentially autocomplete on steroids. They're really good at predicting the next word that you're going to type or a missing word in a document. But when we use them, we expect something else, which is we expect them to use language in a way that's helpful and honest and polite and free of bias and truthful. But that's not actually the incentive structure that we gave them. We just told them to make good predictions. SHAPIRO: What's the one big AI innovation that you are holding your breath to see - whether in a positive or negative way? CHRISTIAN: I think that we currently have systems that can do amazing things with language. We have systems that can do amazing things with visual imagery. There are a lot of exciting advances in robotics, and I think there is a sense of collective holding of breath to see what happens when we can actually integrate these things together. What does it mean to have a system that can both use language in this seemingly human-level fluency, but also move around the world physically and understand what it's looking at? I think that's the road that we're on at the moment. SHAPIRO: What - is that, like, a robot that moves through the world? Is that a virtual-reality, immersive ecosystem? Like, what is that? CHRISTIAN: I think we're probably going to see a little bit of all of the above. So that might be domestic robots that, you know, help fold your laundry or something like that. I think it's, in the shorter term, more likely to be assistants that help you on your computer, but they can actually see what's on your screen. So they could navigate a website for you and purchase your airline tickets or do a bunch of, you know, scholarship research for you on the internet - that sort of thing. I think those systems are going to be more and more a part of just how we navigate the world digitally and then in the longer run physically, too. SHAPIRO: Something to look forward to in 2023. That is Brian Christian. He writes about the human implications of computer science, and he's author of the book, \"The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning And Human Values. \"Oh, by the way, I did write that introduction. Brian Christian, thanks a lot. CHRISTIAN: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. I'm Ari Shapiro.

He's known as the father of genetics because his experiments with pea plants established the basic rules of heredity. And to commemorate the 200 years since Mendel's birth, some researchers decided to dig him up and analyze his genes. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce explains. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Gregor Mendel was a scientist and also an Augustinian friar at a monastery in Brno, the second largest city in the Czech Republic. A couple years ago, local researchers were talking about how to mark this major anniversary of his birth. Sarka Pospisilova is a geneticist. She says the ideas included a festival, a scientific conference, a statue. And then a colleague asked her - hey, how about doing a genetic analysis of Mendel himself? SARKA POSPISILOVA: So that was the beginning. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She's the vice rector for research at Masaryk University in Brno. Even though the idea seemed a little crazy, she went around to different specialists there. POSPISILOVA: So I asked the anthropologist, who had experiences with analyses of remains of various historical persons. So I asked how to do that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The project actually seemed doable if religious leaders at the monastery would give the OK. POSPISILOVA: They had to ask the Augustinians in Prague and the bishop, and also, finally, they should get approval of the Augustinians in Rome. GREENFIELDBOYCE: With permission granted, the research team could get to work. Molecular biologist Filip Pardy says it felt momentous. FILIP PARDY: Because Gregor Mendel is a person that is taught at the first course of genetics, you know, at the university - so everybody feels that he is very important, especially here in Brno. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says Mendel used math to study patterns of inheritance when looking at things like flower color and plant height. PARDY: He analyzed a set of about 25,000 plants to actually get his numbers right and to create the formulas. So in this regard, he was also kind of a visionary and one step ahead. GREENFIELDBOYCE: When Mendel's tomb was excavated, it contained five coffins, stacked one on top of the other. It seemed that Mendel's was at the bottom. It was lined with some newspapers that were dated shortly before he died, but the researchers weren't totally sure. Pardy says they wanted better evidence. PARDY: So we actually came up with this idea of going through his personal possessions because we knew we needed some reference material to actually confirm his identity. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Local museum curators let them swab Mendel's microscope, his glasses, his papers. Inside one of his favorite books on astronomy, the researchers found a hair. By looking at DNA from all that and comparing it to DNA in the skeleton, they felt certain that they'd found Mendel's body. They sequenced all of his genes and found genetic variants linked to diabetes, heart problems, kidney disease. Geneticist Daniel Fairbanks, who's written a book on Mendel, says one of his variants was particularly intriguing. DANIEL FAIRBANKS: He suffered throughout his life from some sort of either psychological or neurological disorder that caused him to have very severe nervous breakdowns. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And his DNA shows a variant in a gene linked to epilepsy and other neurological issues. FAIRBANKS: That may well have been an inherited condition. And that was a fascinating discovery, I think, that these scientists made. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So what would Mendel have thought of having his DNA removed and sequenced? Would he have preferred to rest in peace? Fairbanks says he's pondered this. FAIRBANKS: I tend to think, from what I know about him, that he may very well have been happy with this. But of course, we can't directly ask him. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He points out that, just before dying, Mendel did ask that an autopsy be done on his body. In death, as in life, he wanted everything examined scientifically. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.
