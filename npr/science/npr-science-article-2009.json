Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep. Today in \"Your Health,\" helping older people give up their cars. Mile for mile they have the highest driving fatality rate of any group other than new teenage drivers. But getting older people to stop driving takes more than just telling them to give up the car keys. Many people need their cars because of where they live. NPR's Joseph Shapiro has the story of one woman who's come up with an alternative. JOSEPH SHAPIRO: Through the work she does, Katherine Freund has watched what happens when older people can no longer drive safely. Often they do something surprising when it's time to give up their car. Ms. KATHERINE FREUND (Founder, Independent Transportation Network): People generally leave their vehicles in their driveway, I would say - this is an estimate - six months after they can't drive anymore. Sometimes they get in the seat behind the wheel and visit it. SHAPIRO: Not drive it. Just. . . Ms. FREUND: Visit it. You know, people do that. That's common. SHAPIRO: That's because, especially for older people, cars are not just useful, they're pretty powerful symbols. Ms. FREUND: Cars are just machines, but they represent mobility and independence and freedom. And long after people can safely drive them anywhere at all, they still have that symbolic meaning of independence and freedom. SHAPIRO: So the car sits in the driveway unused. But after a while the car insurance comes due or it's time for the car inspection. Ms. FREUND: That's when they get given to the grandchildren or sold to the neighbors for a song. And that was one of the reasons that I began thinking there must be a better thing to do with this car. SHAPIRO: The better thing, Katherine Freund figured out, was how to let people give that car away and then use its value to pay for a car service. The money, it might be hundreds or even thousands of dollars, goes into an account that pays for someone to come pick them up and drive them where they need to go. Freund started that not-for-profit car service over 13 years ago. It's called the Independent Transportation Network. ITN now exists or is starting up in 12 communities around the country after Freund made it work in her hometown of Portland, Maine. (Soundbite of knocking) Ms. BETH PAULSEN-OLMSTEAD (Driver, Independent Transportation Network): Good morning. Ms. RUTH BOWMAN: I am ready for you. Ms. PAULSEN-OLMSTEAD: Hey, Ruth. How are you doing? Ms. BOWMAN: Fine, thanks. SHAPIRO: Today Ruth Bowman needs a ride from her home in South Portland. One of the ITN drivers, Beth Paulsen-Olmstead, helps Bowman into the front seat of a red, four-door sedan. Ms. PAULSEN-OLMSTEAD: Watch that roof. Here comes your door. (Soundbite of car door) SHAPIRO: There's no blaring sign on the side of the car. It doesn't look like the handicap van has come to pick up the old lady. The idea is to make it look like your daughter or a friend has come by to give you a lift, which is why the drivers and their passengers become friends. Ms. BOWMAN: Well, I remember how much sugar you put in your rhubarb. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. BOWMAN: You don't have to do that. Ms. PAULSEN-OLMSTEAD: No? BOWMAN: No. Ms. PAULSEN-OLMSTEAD: You're going to turn me healthy, Ruth. Ms. BOWMAN: (Laughing) Yeah. SHAPIRO: The ride service is a bit cheaper than a taxi because ITN is a nonprofit and some of its drivers are volunteers. Here in Portland, ITN charges a $4 pickup fee and then it's a dollar and a half for each mile. Ms. BOWMAN: Monday morning I go to yoga. It's easy-does-it yoga. It's just wonderful. We pick up Margaret Raymond(ph). She's 95 years old. So we get a small discount when there are two sharing. SHAPIRO: Ruth Bowman also uses the ride service to visit her husband, Dick, who lives in an elegant assisted living facility downtown. He moved here after he fell down several times at home and Ruth had to call an ambulance for paramedics to get him up. It's been tough for Ruth and Dick Bowman to keep getting around as they get older, but they say they do the best they can. Ms. BOWMAN: I am 92 plus. I'm so proud of it. (Soundbite of laughter) Professor DICK BOWMAN (Retired Professor of English Literature): Well, she robbed the cradle. I'm only 91. SHAPIRO: Dick Bowman is a character. Today he's wearing a red plaid sport coat over a green plaid shirt. He's got a plaid bowtie and argyle socks. Usually his pants are plaid too, but today just a drab khaki. Around his neck he proudly wears the medallion he got from alcoholics anonymous to represent his 25 years of sobriety. He's a retired professor of English literature. Professor BOWMAN: They all call me the professor because when I got out of Mercy Hospital - a month's treatment - Dr. Stanley Evans who ran the hospital said, Professor, you're not here to correct our English. You're here to cure your disease. SHAPIRO: Twenty-five years ago, it was his family that came together and demanded that he stop drinking. Two years ago, his children showed up again, this time to tell him it was time to stop driving. He'd had a couple of fender benders, the last one when driving his Volvo he scraped another car in the parking lot at his tennis club. Professor BOWMAN: But it's much harder to get along without an automobile than it is without alcohol for civilization. It's a very automotive civilization. SHAPIRO: Now he uses ITN to do errands and go to the theater. He gets rides to AA meetings, including the one he leads at the county jail. When Ruth saw her husband still able to get around even without his car, she started to think about giving up driving too. Ms. BOWMAN: Suddenly, I woke up one morning and I thought, I don't want to be in an accident, I don't want to kill anybody. I've lost my self confidence on backing up and goodbye car. SHAPIRO: Katherine Freund is listening to this conversation. She's smiling because this is why she created ITN. Ms. FREUND: Did it make a difference to you to know that it was here when you were ready? Ms. BOWMAN: Yes. Oh, it did. I wouldn't have had the courage to give up my car. Ms. FREUND: You make me very happy. That's what we work for. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. FREUND: That's wonderful. SHAPIRO: Freund started ITN after her own son was struck and seriously injured by an older driver. The driver had dementia. Her son was just three years old. Ryan recovered. He's 24 now, a recent college graduate, and working to help nonprofit groups. But for years Freund wouldn't talk publicly about how it was the accident that led her to start her own nonprofit alternative to driving for older people. Ms. FREUND: Because I wanted the issue to stand on its merit. I didn't want people to say, oh, she's just crusading because her little boy got hurt or she has a guilty conscience or any of that kind of stuff. SHAPIRO: What she realized was that it does little good to ask people to give up their cars if they don't have an affordable reliable way to go door to door. Ms. FREUND: I think that older people in their heart of hearts, if they're struggling with driving, somewhere they know it. There's this simultaneous denial and somehow they know it at the same time. SHAPIRO: And that gets to the advice Freund gives for dealing with one of the toughest issues facing families with aging parents, how to have the conversation about when it's time to stop driving. Ms. FREUND: To me the most important thing about this conversation is to have it in a loving and supportive way. A lot of people think that this needs to be some sort of an intervention where you get all the adult children together and you put your parents there and you confront them with this driving problem. Well, sometimes that needs to happen, but I think that that is extremely rare. I think really if adult children will say to their parents, I want you to be as independent as you want to be and I want to help you do that. SHAPIRO: Freund says the key is to talk to parents before they have difficulty driving and to talk about what alternatives exist for when they do. Few communities have an independent transportation network or anything like it, but public buses might work or a door-to-door paratransit service for people with disabilities. Many people rely on rides from family and friends.  Freund and her siblings had this conversation with her own aging parents not long ago. It wasn't easy. But a few months later when her father's back problem stopped him from driving, Freund's mother surprised her. She had already figured out that one of their neighbors was a taxi driver who could help. Joseph Shapiro, NPR News.  STEVE INSKEEP, host:  On New Year's Day, it's Morning Edition from NPR News.

During that time, large North American mammals like the woolly mammoth went extinct. It's also about the time when people in the Middle East invented agriculture. A report published today in Science Magazine says the trigger for all of that could have been extraterrestrial. Joining us now to talk about this is NPR science correspondent Richard Harris, and Richard, what evidence do they have that an impact triggered this cold snap? RICHARD HARRIS: Well, Alex, it all comes down to itty-bitty diamonds, and when I say itty-bitty, I mean microscopic or maybe even too small to see through a microscope. And what these - a group of scientists, there're nine of them, headed by Douglas Kennett at the University of Oregon, and what they did was they looked at a layer of Earth that's about 12,900 years old, and they found what they believed are these tiny, tiny diamonds buried in that layer of Earth. And they say, well, how could those diamonds have gotten there? And their leading hypothesis is some high-pressure, high-temperature impact may have generated those diamonds and left them scattered over - well, they've looked in at least a half a dozen sites across North America, and they see these little diamonds everywhere. COHEN: So, is there any physical evidence of this kind of impact? HARRIS: That's one of the problems that they're facing. They do not actually have an impact crater the way we have some ideas of where, maybe, the giant comet that hit the Earth 65 million years ago and wiped out the dinosaurs. There's some ideas about where that was, but there's no evidence actually of being - having the Earth actually pummeled by individual comets, giant comets or giant asteroids. So, their hypothesis says, well, maybe there were a swarm of these things that hit the atmosphere, they broke up into the atmosphere, and so, they ended up having this shockwave material spread around. Presumably, they kicked up a bunch of dust and did things like that, as these giant airborne explosions hit the Earth, but no, there are no impact craters. COHEN: So, how could comets bursting in air create an extended cold snap? HARRIS: Well, that's another question that they would have to answer and they haven't yet, but certainly, if you put up enough dust, if you create big fires and so on, you know that you can enough particles in the atmosphere to cool down the Earth, at least for a short period of time. Doing that for 1,000 years or 1300 years, which is about how long this cold snap lasted, mm, that's a little bit tough to understand. COHEN: So, if not comets, what else might have caused this sort of cold snap? HARRIS: Well, there is actually a pretty good and well-established hypothesis about what actually happened 1300 years ago. There was giant lake of fresh water that spilled into the North Atlantic - this was sort of leftover water from the last ice age - and all this water affected the ocean circulation in the North Atlantic and stopped a conveyor belt of both water and air that was bringing warm air up from the equatorial regions to higher latitudes. And that's been the leading hypothesis for what caused this event, which is called the Younger Dryas. And so, somehow or other, they would have to figure out how the comet impact/collision event would fit in with this pretty well-established idea that there was this huge burst of fresh, cold water that went into the North Atlantic. COHEN: So, how will all this get sorted out? HARRIS: Well, more data are needed, I think, is what scientists are fond of saying, and this is certainly a case where that is true.

I'm Ira Flatow. Up first, we're ringing in the New Year with science. Two-thousand nine is chock full science anniversaries. For example, it's the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth, the 150th anniversary of the publication of \"The Origin of Species. \" 400 years ago this year, Galileo first turned his telescope toward the skies and Johannes Kepler published the first two laws of planetary motion. And to honor these anniversaries, the Coalition on the Public Understanding of Science has designated 2009 as a Year of Science. Here to tell us about the science celebrations in store for us this year is Lee Allison. He is the state geologist of Arizona, president of the Arizona Geological Society and one of the organizers of the Year of Science 2009. He joins us by phone from his office in Tucson. Welcome to Science Friday. Dr. LEE ALLISON (Director and State Geologist, Arizona Geological Survey; President, Arizona Geological Society): Thank you, Ira. Happy New Year and Happy Year of Science. FLATOW: Happy Year of Science to you. I'm going to be up in Boston this weekend helping join that celebration. Tell us, what else is going on? Dr. ALLISON: Well, we're really excited that you're going to be the official launch tomorrow at a biological conference to launch Year of Science, but we're actually linking hundreds, and probably thousands now, of activities all over the country, all year long, big and small. And it's a grassroots event - series of events. So, what we're trying to do is get groups and activities and programs that already do things in science and public education and outreach to link together and share some resources, share some common branding and logos and themes and work together to promote the role of science in society. FLATOW: This seems like a particularly good year to start the Year of Science. Dr. ALLISON: I think so. The - in the last few years, we've seen America rethink its role in dealing with science and there's been growing grassroots efforts - and it's across all segments, in academia, in government, and in industry, recognizing that we haven't been investing the resources into science and paying attention like we should've. And the economy is suffering in part because of that and we're falling behind. And so, there's support from all over the country and saying, yeah, we need to go back and rethink about science and society. And let's do that by celebrating it. FLATOW: And how can people find out about science events near them or in their town? Dr. ALLISON: Well, at the Year of Science website, yearofscience2009. org, and I think it's linked on your webpage, we've got lists of events and some search tools to help people figure out what's going on in everyone's communities. Just type in your zip code and up comes a list of things that are already there. And we want to invite people today who are listening to register their sites. If you've got some kind of activity, link it in with the Year of Science activities already under way and register it, so that everyone else can find out what's going on. FLATOW: So, you're sort of creating a science social network?  Dr. ALLISON: Absolutely. That's a key component of what we're doing. When we started forming this coalition a couple of years ago, we recognized that everybody we talk to has some kind of program going on or multiple programs, and we weren't aware of what each other were doing. So, by linking, sharing best practices, learning from each other and leveraging some very limited resources, what we've found is that we're building a much bigger series of events than we could try to do on our own. FLATOW: Now, the last time there was this huge national groundswell of interest in science was back in the '60s, during the moon shot era. Do we need something like that again? Dr. ALLISON: You know, a lot of people want to see another one of those Sputnik moments that really galvanize society. And I think most of us recognize that that was a unique event. And we're not going to see that repeated as it is. But we have seen a growing groundswell all across every segment of society in the last two to three years of coming back and rethinking the way we deal with science in there. And I think the election here just a few months ago has reinforced that, that President-elect Obama seems to be getting it, in terms of the role of science in society. And we're seeing that at the state levels as well. And so, we're not going to have another Sputnik moment, but we're coming at it from a different perspective. FLATOW: Are you going to have different foci - focus - I haven't used that word in a long time. . . (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: For every month of the year? Dr. ALLISON: Yeah, that's one of the fun things. January is the nature and process of society. But February, with the anniversary of Darwin's birth, is going to be evolution. March is physics and technology. And so, each month - and you can see the themes on our Web site - we have a different theme tying in generally with some big events happening across the country. So, every month has a different theme and a variety of events going on. FLATOW: So, how will you know, when the year is up, whether you have been successful or not? Dr. ALLISON: I think we're already successful. Ground roots are - ground roots? I'm sorry. Grassroots support has really taken off. We're getting organizations joining the network every day. We now have something like over 475 groups that are participating. They collectively represent over a million scientists and science educators across the country. And we're seeing networks starting to form locally. We now have 14 regional hubs that have formed when people started discovering that the museum down the street and the elementary school around the corner all had some science programs. And those groups are working together. So we're seeing a grassroots development in communities all over the country. So, I think we've got a major success already. FLATOW: Well, good luck to you. Give us the details on how to find out more about it one more time. Dr. ALLISON: Year - www. yearofscience2009. org. FLATOW: And if they melt that server, (Laughing) you can go to sciencefriday. com, where we have a mirror backup to getting to that server. Thank you very much and good luck to you. Dr. ALLISON: Thanks very much, Ira. FLATOW: You're welcome. Lee Allison is state geologist of Arizona and the president of the Arizona Geological Society and one of the organizers of Year of Science 2009.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is Talk of the Nation, Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow. Up first, we're ringing in the New Year with science. Two-thousand nine is chock full science anniversaries. For example, it's the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth, the 150th anniversary of the publication of \"The Origin of Species. \" 400 years ago this year, Galileo first turned his telescope toward the skies and Johannes Kepler published the first two laws of planetary motion. And to honor these anniversaries, the Coalition on the Public Understanding of Science has designated 2009 as a Year of Science. Here to tell us about the science celebrations in store for us this year is Lee Allison. He is the state geologist of Arizona, president of the Arizona Geological Society and one of the organizers of the Year of Science 2009. He joins us by phone from his office in Tucson. Welcome to Science Friday.  Dr. LEE ALLISON (Director and State Geologist, Arizona Geological Survey; President, Arizona Geological Society): Thank you, Ira. Happy New Year and Happy Year of Science.  FLATOW: Happy Year of Science to you. I'm going to be up in Boston this weekend helping join that celebration. Tell us, what else is going on?  Dr. ALLISON: Well, we're really excited that you're going to be the official launch tomorrow at a biological conference to launch Year of Science, but we're actually linking hundreds, and probably thousands now, of activities all over the country, all year long, big and small. And it's a grassroots event - series of events. So, what we're trying to do is get groups and activities and programs that already do things in science and public education and outreach to link together and share some resources, share some common branding and logos and themes and work together to promote the role of science in society.  FLATOW: This seems like a particularly good year to start the Year of Science.  Dr. ALLISON: I think so. The - in the last few years, we've seen America rethink its role in dealing with science and there's been growing grassroots efforts - and it's across all segments, in academia, in government, and in industry, recognizing that we haven't been investing the resources into science and paying attention like we should've. And the economy is suffering in part because of that and we're falling behind. And so, there's support from all over the country and saying, yeah, we need to go back and rethink about science and society. And let's do that by celebrating it.  FLATOW: And how can people find out about science events near them or in their town?  Dr. ALLISON: Well, at the Year of Science website, yearofscience2009. org, and I think it's linked on your webpage, we've got lists of events and some search tools to help people figure out what's going on in everyone's communities. Just type in your zip code and up comes a list of things that are already there. And we want to invite people today who are listening to register their sites. If you've got some kind of activity, link it in with the Year of Science activities already under way and register it, so that everyone else can find out what's going on.  FLATOW: So, you're sort of creating a science social network?   Dr. ALLISON: Absolutely. That's a key component of what we're doing. When we started forming this coalition a couple of years ago, we recognized that everybody we talk to has some kind of program going on or multiple programs, and we weren't aware of what each other were doing. So, by linking, sharing best practices, learning from each other and leveraging some very limited resources, what we've found is that we're building a much bigger series of events than we could try to do on our own.  FLATOW: Now, the last time there was this huge national groundswell of interest in science was back in the '60s, during the moon shot era. Do we need something like that again?  Dr. ALLISON: You know, a lot of people want to see another one of those Sputnik moments that really galvanize society. And I think most of us recognize that that was a unique event. And we're not going to see that repeated as it is. But we have seen a growing groundswell all across every segment of society in the last two to three years of coming back and rethinking the way we deal with science in there. And I think the election here just a few months ago has reinforced that, that President-elect Obama seems to be getting it, in terms of the role of science in society. And we're seeing that at the state levels as well. And so, we're not going to have another Sputnik moment, but we're coming at it from a different perspective.  FLATOW: Are you going to have different foci - focus - I haven't used that word in a long time. . .  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: For every month of the year?  Dr. ALLISON: Yeah, that's one of the fun things. January is the nature and process of society. But February, with the anniversary of Darwin's birth, is going to be evolution. March is physics and technology. And so, each month - and you can see the themes on our Web site - we have a different theme tying in generally with some big events happening across the country. So, every month has a different theme and a variety of events going on.  FLATOW: So, how will you know, when the year is up, whether you have been successful or not?  Dr. ALLISON: I think we're already successful. Ground roots are - ground roots? I'm sorry. Grassroots support has really taken off. We're getting organizations joining the network every day. We now have something like over 475 groups that are participating. They collectively represent over a million scientists and science educators across the country. And we're seeing networks starting to form locally. We now have 14 regional hubs that have formed when people started discovering that the museum down the street and the elementary school around the corner all had some science programs.

Braille's alphabet of raised dots has helped those without sight read and write. Mike Hudson is the director of the Museum for the American Printing House for the Blind in Louisville, Kentucky, where celebrations are being held. And he joins us from member station WFPL. Welcome to the program, Mike. Mr. MIKE HUDSON (Museum Director, American Printing House for the Blind): Thank you, Liane. HANSEN: What is your organization doing to mark Braille's birthday? Mr. HUDSON: We're celebrating all things French, and so not only looking at Braille's life and the code that he invented, but also the music, the literature, and the food of the day. HANSEN: Can you give us just a little thumbnail biography of Braille and, as you say, his code? Mr. HUDSON: Well, he was born in 1809 in a little village outside of Paris, France. And by the time he was six, he had gone blind. He was lucky that he lived in the only country in the world that actually had a school for kids that were blind or visually impaired where he was exposed to the only books that had been made for the blind anywhere in the world, and those were in raised letters.  They were very hard to learn how to use. And at some point, a man named Charles Barbier, a soldier, tested a system of writing with dots at the school. And Braille took that system, adapted it, and made it into the system that we use today - the code, as I say - basically a substitution code of using dots instead of the letters that sighted people use. HANSEN: Can I ask what kind of artifacts do you have in the museum? Mr. HUDSON: The oldest artifact we have is from 1786. It's actually the only copy that we know of, of one of those raised-letter books that was in that school for the blind in Paris. HANSEN: It's now common to see Braille underneath the buttons of an elevator or on the automatic teller machines. I wonder, are there some new technologies -emerging ones maybe - that might eventually make Braille obsolete? Mr. HUDSON: Here's the thing about Braille. Braille allows someone to actually read and write, whereas almost every other technology that we've come up with really is just kind of a complicated way of reading, not writing.  HANSEN: And so it won't be obsolete, but it could exist on a computer keyboard, for example. Mr. HUDSON: Exactly. HANSEN: Well, I guess this is the time to say, all hail to Louis Braille. Mr. HUDSON: Without Braille, a lot of personal memory that's out there would not ever have been written down. HANSEN: Mike Hudson is museum director at the American Printing House for the Blind.

Dungeness crabs show up in markets and restaurants during the holidays. Fresh crabs are only easy to find for a few weeks, and during this time the crabs provide a burst of flavor at the table, as well as a burst of income for fishermen. They also account for a thriving fishery that is suffering from its own success. Here's NPR's Richard Harris. RICHARD HARRIS:  It's 3:40 AM and I am at the harbor in Crescent City, California. Folks here are preparing their crab boats to go out for what promises to be an insanely long day of pulling crabs out of the Pacific Ocean. Already, quite a number of the slips are empty, and the boats are idling and getting ready to head out to sea on what is thankfully a very calm-looking day. Mr. BRETT FAHNING (Crab Fisherman):  Good morning! HARRIS:  Good morning Unidentified Man:  Good morning. HARRIS:  Crab fisherman Brett Fahning has invited me to spend the day with him and his crew on the Rogue, his 58-foot long fishing boat. Mr. FAHNING:  I bought this crab boat in 2004. HARRIS:  Fahning is a baby-faced 35, and sports a goatee. Under the boat's blazing lights he pilots the Rogue out of the harbor at 4 AM sharp and heads out to sea. This port is a mere shadow of what it was decades ago. Two-thirds of California's commercial fishermen have abandoned their business in the last 15 year, but Dungeness crab is one bright success story. The rules for keeping this fishery healthy are simple. Fishermen only catch large male crabs, and only in a defined season. Mr. FAHNING:  It's just like a no-brainer sustainable fishery. It always has been, and it's not like - they had to change anything from how it started. HARRIS:  Natural cycles do make the crab populations boom and bust, but biologists say fishing is no threat to the crabs. That's true, even though there's an absolute frenzy when the season first opens. Mr. FAHNING:  It's kind of a derby fishery. Most of the production - and I don't know the stats offhand, but an educated guess is that 80 percent of the crab are caught in the first two weeks. HARRIS:  There are only so many crabs, and they get scooped up fast during the bonanza days. After that, it's slim pickings, so there's a race to grab them before they're gone. And more fishermen are joining the derby every year, meaning less crab per vessel. Boats that once caught other species are now turning to Dungeness crabs. That includes vessels that used to go out for salmon, until that fishery collapsed a few years ago. Mr. FAHNING:  Since we haven't had that, more guys are kind of focusing on Dungeness crab. And investing in Dungeness crab, meaning they're buying more pots, more gear, upgrading their boats. HARRIS:  It's become an arms race to catch crab, and, as a result, economist Steve Hackett at nearby Humboldt State University says there's a huge over-investment in the crab fishery. There are something like 170,000 crab pots off California, about three times as many as you'd need to catch all the crabs in a season. Those excesses also make crabbing less profitable. And the race for crab is dangerous. It's the deadliest fishery on the West Coast, with fatalities just about every year. Fahning says some fishermen are just too anxious to get in on the early days of the race, weather be damned. Mr. FAHNING:  I mean, I know what kind of boat I have here. It's an old wood boat. I'm obviously not going to go and fish in conditions that I shouldn't be fishing in. And you just have to use your head and be safe. And a lot of times, guys don't do that. HARRIS:  Captains also fall asleep at the end of their long, long days, and run up into the rocks. So safety and money issues have led crab fishermen to establish a task force to find ways to make their business more rational. A rational season would also mean more fresh crab. Right now, with the huge burst at the beginning of the season, most sweet Dungeness gets frozen. Mr. FAHNING:  OK, I better pay attention here. HARRIS:  Brett Fahning slows his boat as he arrives at his first string of crab pots. He has about 450 in the water, and they need to start pulling them well before dawn if they have any hope of harvesting all their crabs today.  (Soundbite of winch)  HARRIS: Standing on deck behind the wheelhouse, Bobby Kissinger uses a winch to pull up a crab pot. It takes just a few seconds to bring the cage up through 120 feet of water. The crew scoops out a couple of writhing crabs, brown, glistening, about two pounds apiece. They toss them into a bin, re-bait the trap, and toss it overboard.  You're going to do that 400 times today? Mr. BOBBY KISSINGER (Crab Fisherman):  400 plus, yeah. We get in a zone and we stay there for 12 to 18 hours. HARRIS:  As soon as one pot is done, the boat is up to the next one. Kissinger and his deck mate Andy Allen have their timing down to the second. Allen says most important is Bobby's control over the winch, which keeps the 100-pound crab pots from flying out of control.  Mr. KISSINGER:  Yes, everything's riding on that hand. If his hand slips, makes the wrong move, then we're dead men. HARRIS:  Pot after pot comes onboard. Five crabs in one, a dozen in another. Nothing but giant starfish in some.  Brett Fahning watches the action from the wheelhouse. He's a transplant from Wisconsin, educated as an oceanographer, but hooked on the business and sport of fishing. As each crab pot comes up, he eyes it eagerly, to gauge his luck. Mr. FAHNING:  Pretty inconsistent, huh? It's all right, though, huh? HARRIS:  So how's this year panning out? Mr. FAHNING:  I think it's going to pan out OK. It's not going to be a disaster. HARRIS:  This is a slow year for crabs, but Fahning thinks he can earn enough, at least, to pay his bills. Fishermen could potentially make life easier for the entire crab industry if they could find ways to slow their expensive and dangerous arms race. Mr. FAHNING:  There's been suggestions of, let's make it a daylight fishery only. No lights are allowed, you can only go fishing during the day. With the idea that's going to slow things down. Or limit the amount of pots is another one. But I don't think it's fair to try and equalize, to socialize the industry. HARRIS:  Sure, he says, the situation now isn't ideal, but he likes the risks and rewards of the crab business. Mr. FAHNING:  I think it's the independence, really. It'd be pretty hard for me to go back and get a real job after this. I think it's really that. I mean, and ocean, you know, there's the romantic part of it, too. But I think it's just mostly the independence. The romanticism kind of wears off a little bit after a while, after you've been doing it for a while. HARRIS:  And it's that independent streak, found in so many fishermen, that will make it tough for the crab industry to agree on any changes. But they'll try.  Finally, around 7:30 in the evening, the Rogue ties up again in Crescent City with 4,000 pounds of crab in its hold. The crew members go their separate ways, but they will be back in about eight hours, and racing out again to their pots. Richard Harris, NPR News. INSKEEP:  Richard continues tomorrow with new California fishing rules that are intended to protect both fish and those who catch them. I'm looking now at photos taken onboard a crab trawler and inside a California crab shack. You can find them in an audio slide show at npr. org.

TEXT: From NPR News this is All Things Considered. I'm Michele Norris. MELISSA BLOCK, host: And I'm Melissa Block. Billions of years ago, the first life on Earth emerged from a primordial stew of chemicals. Exactly how that happened is a central question in biology. Now, two researchers have created some molecules that can do remarkably lifelike things, as NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce explains. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: If you ask biologist Gerald Joyce to describe the fateful day in Earth's history when non-living chemicals first transformed themselves into life, he'll say, oh, yeah, that day. Dr. GERALD JOYCE (Biologist, Scripps Research Institute): Yeah, it was a late Tuesday afternoon and the sun was a little dimmer in those days. But no, I mean, we don't know exactly how it happened or even nearly exactly how it happened. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says it had to have been roughly four billion years ago. Somehow, a bunch of chemicals came together into something that could copy itself and evolve. Dr. JOYCE: That's what we and others are interested in because that's sort of, you know, the tipping point between chemistry before and biology after. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He and his colleague Tracey Lincoln work at the Scripps Research Institute in California. They've now come up with some simple molecules that actually can replicate and sort of evolve, at least within the limits of their little test tube world. I asked Joyce if he felt they had synthesized life. Dr. JOYCE: No. So, you know, we need to be really careful here. This thing is not alive. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Do you think someone could argue that it is alive? Dr. JOYCE: I think someone could. In fact, I know people who have, you know. But most - and I'm not trying to be cute here - most, including myself, very strongly believe this is not yet, or at least not yet it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The reason he says it's not life is that it doesn't have the capacity for open-ended evolution. The molecules can't develop any totally new tricks. But what they can do has got scientists pretty excited. The molecules are short bits of RNA. That's a chemical cousin to DNA, and it may have existed before DNA in life's history. The first thing Joyce and Lincoln managed to do was develop a couple of short stretches of RNA. They were actually able to make copies of each other over and over, as long as they were given the right parts to put together. Joyce says he remembers the day when his colleague realized that the molecules really were replicating. Dr. JOYCE: Well, she just came, you know, running into my office with, you know, with the data in her hands. So, it was one of those kind of, oh boy, moments. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But even though no one had done this before, he says something that just copies itself over and over again is, well, kind of boring. He wanted to see if the molecules could be a bit more creative. So Joyce and Lincoln developed more self-replicating RNA pairs. They made a dozen of them all slightly different but similar enough that their basic parts could mix and match. Dr. JOYCE: OK, so now there are lots of replicators. And then we put the whole mix of replicators in a pot at the same time with a whole collection of parts and let them compete to see who can use the parts the most efficiently. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The RNA pairs got busy making exact copies of themselves, but sometimes an RNA molecule would grab a different part and make a new combination, a kind of mutant replicator that then copied itself. And a few of these mutants were really, really good at making copies. Dr. JOYCE: And then as many generations of growth proceeded, the fit ones dominated the population. GREENFIELDBOYCE: A report on this experiment was published this week by the journal Science. It's impressed other scientists interested in early life. Andy Ellington is a biochemist at the University of Texas at Austin.  Dr. ANDY ELLINGTON (Biochemist, University of Texas): The significance here is the events that Gerry has shown in the test tube is equivalent in many ways to an event that must have happened many billions of years ago. GREENFIELDBOYCE: An event, he says, that led to us. Dr. ELLINGTON: We are descendants of a long path that started with some molecules that are doing exactly what Gerry's molecules have done, which is replicate and acquire functionality. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Ellington says people who doubt evolution have argued that simple molecules could never do those things, but this experiment shows they can. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.  MICHELE NORRIS, host:  . . TEXT: From NPR News this is All Things Considered. I'm Michele Norris.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  And I'm Melissa Block. Billions of years ago, the first life on Earth emerged from a primordial stew of chemicals. Exactly how that happened is a central question in biology. Now, two researchers have created some molecules that can do remarkably lifelike things, as NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce explains.

We've been hearing this for a while. And over the last two decades, many fisheries in U. S. waters have scaled back sharply to make fishing here more sustainable. In California, two-thirds of commercial fishermen have left the business. Now some are concerned that if the industry gets much smaller, some fishing ports will collapse altogether. NPR's Richard Harris traveled to northern California, where new rules are being developed to protect both the fish and the fishermen. RICHARD HARRIS: There's a bustle of activity at the Caito fish processing plant tucked away in Fort Bragg, California. Crab boats are unloading their writhing catches and huge crates of flatfish are being dumped out and shoveled onto a conveyor belt. It's a scene of great bounty from the sea.  Jim Caito watches happily as some 75 people crack crabs, sharpen their knives and slice and skin fish in his cool and spacious plant. Mr. JIM CAITO (Owner, Caito Fish Processing Plant): We are in our fillet room - fillet and thickening room. They're filleting groundfish right now, packing it for fresh market. They're filleting Dover sole right now. HARRIS: So this is sort of an assembly line? Because it looks like, are those the sole up there, sort of the whole fish? Mr. CAITO: Those are the whole fish that they're filleting. You can call it an assembly line. HARRIS: A disassembly line, I guess. Mr. CAITO: It's a fillet line, is what you call it. HARRIS: The fish will be packed and trucked south to San Francisco and points beyond, where the succulent fillets are sought and savored as part of a healthy diet. The bustle is a scene Jim Caito's father enjoyed, and his grandfather, and his great-grandfather, who arrived on these shores in the late 1880s. Mr. CAITO: Our ancestors came over from Italy, landed in San Francisco and they were processing groundfish, and we just kind of followed suit. Family business. As a kid I filleted. HARRIS: And you still have all your fingers. Mr. CAITO: Uh-huh. I got a few cuts, but I still have all my fingers.  (Soundbite of seagulls) HARRIS: Step out on the dock in front of Caito's, though, and things don't look so bountiful. Up and down the harbor are empty buildings. Thirty years ago, this port was home to half a dozen processing plants. Mr. CAITO: And they're all gone. We're the only ones left. HARRIS: These days, only seven boats head out to sea from Fort Bragg to trawl the bottom for Dover sole, cod, whiting and similar species. That means business is slow next door to Caito's, where Tommy Ancona's fishing supply store has been in business for 40 years. Mr. TOMMY ANCONA (Owner, Fishing Supply Store): People always say this, oh my God, the fishing industry has gone away, it's gone away. Well, you know what? You got to kind of think back at how it's evolved. HARRIS: Back in the heyday, he says, fish were treated like they were giant redwood trees or gold, something to be extracted for quick profit. But in the past couple of decades, rules designed to stop that overexploitation inevitably meant cutting back on the number of boats. Mr. ANCONA: We're down to a core group of fishermen now. HARRIS: Five years ago, many fishermen who trawled for groundfish agreed to give up their boats for a lump sum of cash. That dramatically reduced the size of the fleet. There are now only about 160 bottom trawlers left in California, Oregon and Washington. And the ones who remain, though by constitution fiercely independent people, now work within a very complex set of rules and regulations. Mr. ANCONA: It's not a wide open industry any more. It's all highly regulated and so you know, if there's anything going wrong, it's in the management. HARRIS: Ancona says there are things going wrong, so he's part of an effort to change the management rules, which are set by a federal commission called the Pacific Fishery Management Council. Thanks to the council's efforts, the fish are doing OK, he says. It's now the industry that's in trouble.  (Soundbite of metal striking metal) HARRIS: Two hundred miles up the coast, Randy Smith is gearing up his bottom trawler in Crescent City. His boat is one of just three at this port that still goes out for groundfish like sole. (Soundbite of metal striking metal) Mr. RANDY SMITH (Fisherman): Where's that boom tack? Unidentified Man: I don't know, buddy. HARRIS: With a heavy beard and a baseball cap, this 51-year-old fisherman says things are good for him personally. Mr. SMITH: Right now, trawl fisheries is actually better than I've ever seen it. There's more fish now than any time in my life. HARRIS: That's basically because there are far fewer boats out there trying to catch the fish. Even so, Randy Smith's share of the catch didn't increase as much as he expected when he agreed to buy out his colleagues. That's partly because the allowable catch factors in a certain amount of waste. Mr. SMITH: Right now we're on a two month quota. We're given so much fish that we can catch in two months, period. Well, that creates waste, because when you meet the quota and you go over the quota, you got to throw fish away. HARRIS: Dead fish just get dumped overboard. Smith says he can't help that if he wants to work within the rules. Mr. SMITH: The nets on the bottom and you can't see it, and if you tow for 15 minutes too long you could have too much fish. HARRIS: To address that and other problems, the Pacific Fishery Management Council recently approved a major change to the rules. They're instituting a new scheme called individual transferable quotas.  Here's how they work. Smith will get a quota he can fill throughout an entire year, so he'll only have one deadline to worry about, not six. And he doesn't have to catch all the fish himself. He can buy, sell or trade quotas. So for example, if he accidentally catches too many Dover sole, he can get on the radio and buy shares of Dover quota from another fisherman instead of dumping his fish, dead, back into the sea. Randy Smith says whether it works for him or not depends on the details, which are yet to be worked out. Mr. SMITH: I don't know if it's going to be a good or a bad thing yet. HARRIS: The whole thing makes him uneasy about the future. Mr. SMITH: I have five kids and none of them are going to go fishing. I mean, I can still make a real good living, you know. Some of the kids went to college and stuff. But I don't know where things are headed. I don't like it. HARRIS: It's not just the change in fishing rules that worries him. He's concerned that more and more areas will be declared off limits to bottom trawling, since the nets can disturb delicate cold-water coral on the seafloor.  (Soundbite of seagulls)  HARRIS: Back in Fort Bragg, the potential rule changes are also worrisome to Jim Caito at the fish processing plant. He expects that about half the fishermen who get the quotas will eventually just sell them off, leaving the fleet even smaller than it is today. Mr. CAITO: You shrink it down that small, the boats are going to have a lot of fish to catch. There's no question about that. HARRIS: But there may be only three or four boats left in Fort Bragg to provide him with groundfish throughout the year. Mr. CAITO: You know, it could be that our vessels here sell their quota or lease their quota to someone in Oregon or Washington, and want to retire and get out of the business and we're left with no fish. And if we don't have groundfish, I mean, we won't be here to do crabs, salmon. Because without groundfish, you won't be able to stay in business. HARRIS: He says the fishing port simply can't get much smaller and still hope to survive. Richard Harris, NPR News. MONTAGNE: This is NPR News.

I'm Ira Flatow. We're going to be switching gears now and talk about the science of the swindle. Can psychology explain why some swindlers, like Bernie Madoff, why are they so successful? Well, my next guest has some thoughts on the subject. He lost a sizable chunk of his retirement savings in Madoff's swindle scheme and - get this - he's a psychologist specializing in gullibility. Stephen Greenspan is author of \"Annals of Gullibility: Why We Are Duped and How to Avoid It. \" He's emeritus professor of educational psychology at the University of Connecticut. He joins us from the studios of KCFR in Denver. Welcome to Science Friday. Dr. STEPHEN GREENSPAN (Psychiatry, University of Colorado; Emeritus, Educational Psychology, University of Connecticut; Author, \"Annals of Gullibility: Why We Get Duped and How to Avoid It\"): Thank you, Ira, very happy to be here. FLATOW: How do you feel about all of this? I mean, are you going to be the only person who makes money on this because your book is out now? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. GREENSPAN: Very possibly. FLATOW: Do you feel, like, more ashamed that this happened to you, or do you feel like I was duped or swindled myself? Dr. GREENSPAN: Well, I'm in very good company, Ira. FLATOW: Yeah, you are. Dr. GREENSPAN: A lot of people a lot smarter than me have been duped, including people who are extremely knowledgeable about finance. I look upon this as an opportunity to learn something from - personally. Certainly, I know a lot more about finance and what to do or not to do in the future, but hopefully, I will also be able to help other people. And I. . . FLATOW: Take apart what happened to us here. How did all these very, very smart people get duped? Dr. GREENSPAN: Well, I'm interested in the duped, because, in fact, most of the literature on swindles focuses on the swindler, and obviously, I would like to know more about Madoff, and obviously, it's important to know something about swindlers. But there has been very little work on the duped and on gullibility generally. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. GREENSPAN: In fact, it's a bit of a misnomer to call this a segment on the science of gullibility. It's really the pre-science. . . FLATOW: Because we don't have much science. . . Dr. GREENSPAN: Of gullibility. FLATOW: On gullibility yet. Dr. GREENSPAN: No, there's very little research. Actually, there's one preeminent researcher in Japan named Professor Yamagishi at Hokkaido University; he's really one of the few people who's doing research on gullibility. He's very interested in the relationship between trust and gullibility. And what he found is really very interesting. There's a general belief, certainly in Japan, that distrusters are less gullible because they're more suspicious and more socially effective than people who are high on trust. But in fact, it's quite the opposite, Ira. People who are high trusters are generally less gullible and more socially effective. And it's not that they have been gulled; everybody has been gulled at some point or another. It's just that they look upon a gulling episode as something to learn from. And they don't apply it to people in general; they only apply it to the situation or the person who took advantage of them. So, they can grow from experience, and that's what I hope I can do, and that's what I hope listeners can do. FLATOW: Why is it that even a psychologist like yourself was able to be - who studies gullibility - was able to be duped by this? Dr. GREENSPAN: Well, I may know a lot about psychology, but I don't know a lot about finance. FLATOW: So, you're. . . Dr. GREENSPAN: And all of us have. . . FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. GREENSPAN: All of us have our areas of strength and weakness, and we tend to be - and this was also extraordinarily difficult scam to see through. I would not have fallen for the Nigerian Internet scam. . . (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. GREENSPAN: Inheritance scam, and in fact, have resisted that, but when everybody I know is jumping on the bandwagon, it seemed too good to pass up. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. 1-800-989-8255, if you'd like to talk about gullibility, talking with Stephen Greenspan, author of \"Annals of Gullibility: Why We Are Duped and How to Avoid It. \" And it does seem to be that - as you mention, trust - people went to this - from the news reports we hear - people went into it from word of mouth from people they trusted. Dr. GREENSPAN: Well, there're four factors in my theory of gullibility. And my hope is - and so far, psychologists and certainly all the investors who've emailed me have - feel that this framework, which was in the Wall Street Journal piece last Saturday, helps to explain it. And there are four factors, and in any given individual or situation, it might be a little different, but I believe these explain, pretty much, the Madoff phenomenon. FLATOW: What factors are there? Dr. GREENSPAN: One is situations. What has been described by Robert Shiller as the feedback-loop theory of Ponzi schemes, as well as investment manias in general, is that when everybody you know is saying this is a great deal; it's tremendous pressure. It's sort of \"The Emperor's New Clothes\" phenomenon. In fact, I start off my book by talking about folktales, such as \"The Emperor's New Clothes,\" as sort of the archetype for gullibility. And cognition, very few people have the skills to see through something this complicated, and that certainly explains my - part of my trust. And then, I happen to be a somewhat trusting person and also somewhat impulsive, and that's not a good thing to be when you're talking about your lifesavings. And finally, emotion enters into it. Not necessarily greed; it could just be fear of losing money. And people who invested in the Madoff scheme - I don't think they were truly greedy. What they wanted was the safety and security, and that's sort of the irony here: by seeking something safe, they wound up losing everything. FLATOW: And I guess you can apply these four factors of gullibility not just to the Madoff scheme, but to other kinds of gullibility, other kinds of situations. Dr. GREENSPAN: Oh, absolutely. I mean, I devote five pages in my book to financial gullibility and about another 200 pages to many other different kinds of stories about gullibility. And the theory, this four-factor theory, of gullibility applies to all these situations. In fact, what really got me interested in this topic, Ira, had to do with the problem of false confession to murder, particularly in young people and also in people with cognitive disabilities. My primary reputation as a scholar is really in the area of intellectual disabilities. And I got into this because of the case in 1982 in Connecticut involving Richard LaPointe, the man with the congenital brain malformation, who, in a very stressful interrogation, confessed to a murder that nobody - none of his friends, of which I consider myself one - believes he could have possibly done. FLATOW: Hmm. And you. . . Dr. GREENSPAN: And the situations involved are simply, when you're in an interrogation, they use extremely effective techniques - they have something called the Reed method, which can break down anyone. Anyone listening here could be broken down by that method. And the cognitive aspects of it, people - police officers pretend to be your friend, they want you to come in and help them solve the case, or they tell you that they want to help you, but in fact, that's not really what they have in mind. Very people - few people, including a very educated friend of mine, doesn't understand, you don't have to talk to the police. When they suspect you of a crime, you have the right to walk out of there. It doesn't matter what - whether they like that or not. And then personality, people with cognitive impairments, including the elderly - to cover up their limitations, they tend to become very compliant and willing to participate. And finally, emotion enters in because there're few situations more terrifying than being interrogated for a murder. And also exhaustion; these interrogations typically start late at night, and they go for hours and sometimes for 12 or 20 hours. And we've known from research that when you're exhausted and sleep-deprived, you'll agree to anything, and you don't think very straight. FLATOW: Yeah. But we can - can't we be gullible as a society, too? As a mass of people and we think something is true or not, like you said, \"The Emperor's New Clothes\"? I mean, there are some people who say we're gullible to believe that $700 billion is going to solve this financial crisis. Dr. GREENSPAN: Possibly, but I mean, here are two good examples: Mark Twain wrote a novel called \"Pudd'nhead Wilson\" about the gullibility of a whole town that believed that an African-American child was white. And of course, he was the great genius of gullibility in his fiction, all of his books, certainly, Mark Twain - certainly \"Tom Sawyer,\" with the fence-painting scene, certainly \"Huckleberry Finn,\" which is all about gullibility. And then of course, look at the political situation in this country. After the second victory of George W. Bush, a huge headline in London's Daily Mirror said, how can 92 million people - whatever the number was - be so dumb? A lot of people consider the belief in weapons of mass destruction in Iraq is a form of mass gullibility. In fact, the New York Times in its mea culpa actually said, you know, we were gullible. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. How can we, as parents, then - our kids who are watching all of this and learning about the Madoff scandal and living through the Gulf War in Iraq, how can we train our kids to avoid getting hoodwinked, then? Dr. GREENSPAN: Well, actually, it was a famous philosopher - I think it was Epictetus who said, if you use clear thinking, you won't be hoodwinked. I mean, children are more gullible than adults. That's the reason we don't allow them, as a society or as a legal system, to marry or to sign contracts or to be interrogated, for that matter. And Richard Dawkins, in fact, says that gullibility is something that's built in through evolution, because if there's a gullible gene or a meme, you're less likely to be run over or touch a hot stove because you tend to listen to your parents when they tell you not to do these things. The problem is, where's the turn off system? And in fact, there are some people who argue, such as Stuart Vyse and others - he's a professor at Connecticut College - who would argue that a lot of the gullibility of adults is a function of being conditioned through these memes, which Dawkins calls toxic memes, rather than - a meme is a unit of information that's imparted socially, and that's how we learn to be competent in society. FLATOW: Let me go to the phones. 1-800-989-8255. Maya in Englewood, Ohio. Hi, Maya. MAYA (Caller): Hello, how are you doing? FLATOW: Fine. How are you? MAYA: I'm great. I was calling to ask the psychologist, what exactly did you fall for, just so that, you know, hopefully I don't fall for the same scheme. Because I heard you talking, and your didn't discuss the financial situation that you fell for and lost your - some of your retirement savings. Dr. GREENSPAN: Thanks for asking that, Maya. Actually, my situation is even more complicated than just investing with Madoff, because I don't remember even being told - Madoff's name even being mentioned when I invested. In fact, when I got a call from my financial adviser saying - telling me that this Ponzi scheme had happened, and he mentioned Bernie Madoff. I said, who is Bernie Madoff, and what does he have to do with me? I was invested in one of the 15 feeder funds. Mine is the Rye Fund, which is part of the Tremont, Oppenheimer, MassMutual, so it's a very reputable fund. And that's another situational aspect that kind of sucked me in, because I was dealing with, you know, extraordinarily reputable companies, and they were getting management fees. I assumed they were doing due diligence, and they - at the very least, they could recognize fraud. And they didn't. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. You know, there are scientists who say that it's the experts who have the hardest time realizing that they're being duped. Dr. GREENSPAN: Well, and you know, one universal aspect of human psychology is we all try to cover up our limitations and pretend we know more than we don't. And a lot of these experts, such as Mr. Chase in Los Angeles, who apparently was a major - I mean, basically, what we have here are cults around individual advisers, rather than around Mr. Madoff, and. . . FLATOW: Well, I'm trying to imply something a little different. For example, when you have people who are gullible about pseudoscience, you know, when you have Uri. . . Dr. GREENSPAN: Oh, yeah. FLATOW: Uri Gellar, people like that, who scientists try to test out, and they get - they can't find, you know, where the problems are occurring, it's the other magicians who step up and say, well, you have to be a magician to understand a magician, you know? Dr. GREENSPAN: Absolutely. FLATOW: Or James Randy says, I can find that - I can do that same sort of stuff, but you go in a scientist, you don't know what to look for. Dr. GREENSPAN: Yeah. Well, I mean, there's a myth about scientists as being incredibly rational and resistant to hokum. But in fact, there's a psychologist at the University of Oregon named Ray Hyman, who actually was a professional magician earlier in his life, and he tells an interesting story about a professor of astrophysics at a university in Germany. He's sort of the father of astrophysics, wrote the initial book on astrophysics. He went to a demonstration by a spiritualist from New York and - named Slade - and he did all these amazing things, like making a rope tie and untie itself and a tablet with writing appearing, and he was so persuaded by this that he went out and wrote a book on spiritualism as involving a fourth dimension that only certain sensitive people can tap into. And what Hyman's explanation is that great scientists, such as this one, are intuitive; they're not rational. They're - all the great breakthroughs occur through intuition. The problem is, when you're intuitive and you move into a field you don't know anything about, such as spiritualism, you can make a fool of yourself. And that's, in fact, what happened with the cold-fusion hoax, which - not hoax, but fiasco - of a few years ago, where two chemists at University of Utah - Pons and Fleischman - decided they had solved the problem of fusion by doing an experiment at room temperature. Turned out to be they were totally deluded, and the problem is, they didn't know anything about physics, they didn't know anything about fusion, and they weren't aware of their own limitations. Anyone, no matter how smart, can be duped because of their self-deception and because of their failure to talk to others. For example, if they'd talked to others, they would have found out that the same experiment had been done 50 or 60 years ago in Germany. . . FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. GREENSPAN: Earlier in Germany and didn't work, so. . . FLATOW: Well, that's part of the swindle, I guess, is keeping you from finding out the truth. We're talking about the psychology of being duped this hour on Science Friday from NPR News, talking with Richard Greenspan, emeritus professor of educational psychology, University of Connecticut. What about, you know, something your mom told you, if it looks too good to be true, it is too good to be true, Stephen? Dr. GREENSPAN: Well, I'm Stephen, anyway. I'm not Richard, but then. . . FLATOW: I said Richard? Oops, I meant Stephen. I'm sorry. Dr. GREENSPAN: Thank you. Well, my mom had a lot more wisdom in hindsight than I gave her credit for. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. GREENSPAN: And the one thing she told me, my late mom, told me was to - not to be so willing to do whatever my friends told me. And part of that is, I blame my mom, too, because I grew up in the days before polio vaccination. And like Howard Hughes, I didn't know what another kid looked like until I was in school because she was afraid I'd catch polio; that's what made Hughes a germphobe(ph). And because I became so desperate to be liked by others, I would go along with them. In fact, the first gullibility episode I ever had in, I think, the fourth or fifth grade was when a popular kid told me to go into a store and say a dirty word, which I didn't know the meaning of. And of course, I did it because I wanted them to like me, and I came out and everybody was laughing their heads off. And I should point out, the shopkeeper chased me out of the store with a broom. So, it was the first episode - that was the first instance that I can remember of finding out that someone who pretends to be your friend may not be. And I still have this tendency to want to be a nice guy and that's obvious - and do what people tell me, and that's obviously not a good idea. FLATOW: And that's. . . Dr. GREENSPAN: Particularly when we're talking about. . . FLATOW: That's one - and that's one of the keys to gullibility is wanting to. . . Dr. GREENSPAN: Absolutely. FLATOW: Go along with the crowd, being a nice guy. . . Dr. GREENSPAN: Yeah, well, it's all four of these factors. They all came together; it was a perfect storm for me. Situation: Everybody was making money. Cognition: Didn't know anything about finance, particularly anything this complicated. Personality: A tendency to be kind of trusting. And an emotion: It seemed like too good a deal to pass up. FLATOW: Yeah, and so, they all came together at the same time. And you just. . . Dr. GREENSPAN: So, I think the one thing I would tell people is don't be impulsive. Take time to think it over. Take time to talk to other advisers, and most of all, when it comes to money, diversify. Don't put everything in one basket. What we have here is a kind of religious faith in Madoff, or even more importantly, in this particular scheme. And we always have to be aware of the possibility that what looks too good to be true could be, in fact, too good to be true. FLATOW: All right, Stephen, thank you for taking time to be with us today, and good luck to you. Dr. GREENSPAN: My pleasure, Ira. FLATOW: Stephen Greenspan is emeritus professor of educational psychology at the University of Connecticut and author of \"Annals of Gullibility: Why We Get Duped and How to Avoid It. \" We're going to take a short break. And this is something you can believe to be true: We're going to come back after this break, I hope - if everything works out - and switch gears and talk about new advances in diabetes research. So, stay with us. We'll be right back. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. You're listening to Science Friday from NPR News.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to Science Friday on NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. We're going to be switching gears now and talk about the science of the swindle. Can psychology explain why some swindlers, like Bernie Madoff, why are they so successful? Well, my next guest has some thoughts on the subject. He lost a sizable chunk of his retirement savings in Madoff's swindle scheme and - get this - he's a psychologist specializing in gullibility. Stephen Greenspan is author of \"Annals of Gullibility: Why We Are Duped and How to Avoid It. \" He's emeritus professor of educational psychology at the University of Connecticut. He joins us from the studios of KCFR in Denver. Welcome to Science Friday.  Dr. STEPHEN GREENSPAN (Psychiatry, University of Colorado; Emeritus, Educational Psychology, University of Connecticut; Author, \"Annals of Gullibility: Why We Get Duped and How to Avoid It\"): Thank you, Ira, very happy to be here.  FLATOW: How do you feel about all of this? I mean, are you going to be the only person who makes money on this because your book is out now?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. GREENSPAN: Very possibly.  FLATOW: Do you feel, like, more ashamed that this happened to you, or do you feel like I was duped or swindled myself?  Dr. GREENSPAN: Well, I'm in very good company, Ira.  FLATOW: Yeah, you are.  Dr. GREENSPAN: A lot of people a lot smarter than me have been duped, including people who are extremely knowledgeable about finance. I look upon this as an opportunity to learn something from - personally. Certainly, I know a lot more about finance and what to do or not to do in the future, but hopefully, I will also be able to help other people. And I. . .  FLATOW: Take apart what happened to us here. How did all these very, very smart people get duped?  Dr. GREENSPAN: Well, I'm interested in the duped, because, in fact, most of the literature on swindles focuses on the swindler, and obviously, I would like to know more about Madoff, and obviously, it's important to know something about swindlers. But there has been very little work on the duped and on gullibility generally.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. GREENSPAN: In fact, it's a bit of a misnomer to call this a segment on the science of gullibility. It's really the pre-science. . .  FLATOW: Because we don't have much science. . .  Dr. GREENSPAN: Of gullibility.  FLATOW: On gullibility yet.  Dr. GREENSPAN: No, there's very little research. Actually, there's one preeminent researcher in Japan named Professor Yamagishi at Hokkaido University; he's really one of the few people who's doing research on gullibility. He's very interested in the relationship between trust and gullibility. And what he found is really very interesting. There's a general belief, certainly in Japan, that distrusters are less gullible because they're more suspicious and more socially effective than people who are high on trust.  But in fact, it's quite the opposite, Ira. People who are high trusters are generally less gullible and more socially effective. And it's not that they have been gulled; everybody has been gulled at some point or another. It's just that they look upon a gulling episode as something to learn from. And they don't apply it to people in general; they only apply it to the situation or the person who took advantage of them. So, they can grow from experience, and that's what I hope I can do, and that's what I hope listeners can do.  FLATOW: Why is it that even a psychologist like yourself was able to be - who studies gullibility - was able to be duped by this?  Dr. GREENSPAN: Well, I may know a lot about psychology, but I don't know a lot about finance.  FLATOW: So, you're. . .  Dr. GREENSPAN: And all of us have. . .  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. GREENSPAN: All of us have our areas of strength and weakness, and we tend to be - and this was also extraordinarily difficult scam to see through. I would not have fallen for the Nigerian Internet scam. . .  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. GREENSPAN: Inheritance scam, and in fact, have resisted that, but when everybody I know is jumping on the bandwagon, it seemed too good to pass up.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. 1-800-989-8255, if you'd like to talk about gullibility, talking with Stephen Greenspan, author of \"Annals of Gullibility: Why We Are Duped and How to Avoid It. \" And it does seem to be that - as you mention, trust - people went to this - from the news reports we hear - people went into it from word of mouth from people they trusted.  Dr. GREENSPAN: Well, there're four factors in my theory of gullibility. And my hope is - and so far, psychologists and certainly all the investors who've emailed me have - feel that this framework, which was in the Wall Street Journal piece last Saturday, helps to explain it. And there are four factors, and in any given individual or situation, it might be a little different, but I believe these explain, pretty much, the Madoff phenomenon.  FLATOW: What factors are there?  Dr. GREENSPAN: One is situations. What has been described by Robert Shiller as the feedback-loop theory of Ponzi schemes, as well as investment manias in general, is that when everybody you know is saying this is a great deal; it's tremendous pressure. It's sort of \"The Emperor's New Clothes\" phenomenon. In fact, I start off my book by talking about folktales, such as \"The Emperor's New Clothes,\" as sort of the archetype for gullibility.  And cognition, very few people have the skills to see through something this complicated, and that certainly explains my - part of my trust. And then, I happen to be a somewhat trusting person and also somewhat impulsive, and that's not a good thing to be when you're talking about your lifesavings. And finally, emotion enters into it. Not necessarily greed; it could just be fear of losing money. And people who invested in the Madoff scheme - I don't think they were truly greedy. What they wanted was the safety and security, and that's sort of the irony here: by seeking something safe, they wound up losing everything.  FLATOW: And I guess you can apply these four factors of gullibility not just to the Madoff scheme, but to other kinds of gullibility, other kinds of situations.  Dr. GREENSPAN: Oh, absolutely. I mean, I devote five pages in my book to financial gullibility and about another 200 pages to many other different kinds of stories about gullibility. And the theory, this four-factor theory, of gullibility applies to all these situations. In fact, what really got me interested in this topic, Ira, had to do with the problem of false confession to murder, particularly in young people and also in people with cognitive disabilities. My primary reputation as a scholar is really in the area of intellectual disabilities. And I got into this because of the case in 1982 in Connecticut involving Richard LaPointe, the man with the congenital brain malformation, who, in a very stressful interrogation, confessed to a murder that nobody - none of his friends, of which I consider myself one - believes he could have possibly done.

In an unusual experiment, scientists have discovered something romantic about the sounds of mating mosquitoes; the male and female of one species perform a duet of truly operatic skill. NPR's Christopher Joyce has this story about a flight of acoustic fancy. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: Sometimes scientists do strange things, like anesthetizing mosquitoes and gluing them to a tiny string or tether. When the mosquitoes wake up, well, neurobiologist Ron Hoy can explain. Dr. RON HOY (Neurobiology and Behavior, Cornell University): We tethered a female, got her flying, and then took a tethered male and brought the male within a couple of centimeters of the flying female, and then the interaction would begin. JOYCE: The interaction being - well, no, not what you think - not at first, anyway. The female mosquito, of the species Aedes aegypti, will not mate with just any male who flies by. First, the male must produce the right flight tone. (Soundbite of flight tone) JOYCE: That's the sound made by his beating wings. Dr. HOY: When the male now is brought close to the female, what we see is an acoustic interaction. There's going to be variation of the flight tones; the male will adjust whatever he's been doing to bring about a match. JOYCE: What they do is vary the pitch of their flight tones until they're a perfect duet. The male's pitch is at about 600 cycles per second; the female's, a little lower, at 400 cycles per second. In music, he's roughly a D, and she's about a G. And then, something very special happens. . . (Soundbite of flight tones) JOYCE: If you listen closely, you can detect a third tone - an overtone, in musical terms - fainter, more ghostly than the two main mosquito tones, up at 1200 cycles per second. OK, it's no \"Madame Butterfly,\" but hey, these are bugs. The important thing is, once the mosquitoes detected this overtone, they mate. At his laboratory at Cornell University, Hoy tested this by creating just the 1200Hz overtone with audio equipment. When he played it for mosquitoes, they responded to it. Dr. HOY: The interesting thing about mosquitoes is that, you know, if you're tone deaf, you're going to be squat out of luck, aren't you? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. HOY: Because you're not going to catch that modulation. So, I think this is pretty amazing stuff. JOYCE: And mysterious. Why would mosquitoes do this? Hoy says producing the perfect pitch might be some kind of proof of male mosquito macho. Certainly, singing for sex isn't that unusual in animals. Rex Cocroft, a behavioral biologist at the University of Missouri, has recorded lots of bugs doing that, but he says the mosquito duet is one of a kind. Dr. REX COCROFT (Behavioral Sciences, University of Missouri): We think of insects as being masters of timing and rhythm and not so much masters of pitch. JOYCE: Now, humans are also masters of pitch, and some scientists wonder whether we learn some musical rules by listening to animals, even mosquitoes. Dr. COCROFT: So, for example, when people were writing early melodies, like Gregorian chants, well, when you have a large jump up in frequency, then you tend to drop down stepwise, and people were asking, well, do animals show similar kinds of rules? JOYCE: If that sounds crazy, consider this: The interval between the male mosquito's tone and the female's is quite close to what musicians call a perfect fifth. (Soundbite of perfect fifth piano notes, staccato) JOYCE: In fact, composers for centuries considered the interval of a fifth to be the most euphonious. (Soundbite of perfect fifth piano notes, carried out) JOYCE: So, if mosquitoes have it right, all you need to do is find a melody with an interval of a fifth, and you're guaranteed romantic success. (Soundbite of song \"Feelings\") (Soundbite of flight tones) Mr. ALBERT MORRIS: (Singing) Feelings, nothing more than feelings. . . JOYCE: The mosquito research appears in this issue of \"The Journal: Science. \" Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

The experiment took place above 27,000 feet up on Mount Everest. Four mountaineering physicians unzipped their down suits and exposed their groins, all for the sake of science. They extracted samples of their own blood at freezing temperatures to measure the effects of altitude on blood oxygen levels. Dr. Mike Grocott headed the team. He joins us from Southampton, England. Doctor, I've got to ask. I mean, they've got high altitude chambers these days. Why did you have to go up to Mount Everest to take a blood sample from your groin? Dr. MIKE GROCOTT (Co-director, Center for Aviation, Space, and Extreme Environment Medicine, University College London): There have been previous studies taking these sort of measurements in chambers. Interestingly, the results have - are different. They're not as low. And that may be because climbers, because they're exercising quite heavily for a long period of time, actually develop some fluid in their lungs. SIMON: And why not just take the blood sample from your fingertip? Dr. GROCOTT: In order to know what the heart and lungs are sending out to the tissues, you need to take the sample from an artery. And you can find them in various places. So the place we classically think of is in the wrist. Unfortunately, when it's relatively cold, those arteries tend to constrict down. They become very small and very hard to get a needle in. SIMON: So how cold was it? Dr. GROCOTT: It was probably a little bit over freezing. But that was because we descended from the summit, and we were in a small shelter. We originally had planned to take the blood on the summit, but it was about minus 25 there with 20 knots of wind.  SIMON: So what did it feel like? Dr. GROCOTT: I guess it felt slightly strange. Certainly, the climbers around us thought it was slightly strange that we were pausing to take blood samples from our groin. SIMON: (Laughing) Yeah, I mean that's not recommended mountaineering technique, is it, to get up at that altitude and drop trou? Dr. GROCOTT: It's unusual. SIMON: Well, let's hope. Dr. GROCOTT: (Laughing) Yeah. SIMON: And what did you learn? Dr. GROCOTT: Firstly, the values that we found are extraordinary low. It's amazing that we were able to function effectively given those low numbers. And that maybe alters a little bit our understanding of what - given sufficient time and the time factor, the fact that we'd had a period of time to acclimatize - but given sufficient time, it is extraordinary how much humans can adapt. And there may be implications that lead from that to the care of patients.  The reason I say that is because when patients become critically ill, we use high levels of oxygen and mechanical ventilation to maintain a level of oxygen in the blood. Now, sometimes using the supplemental oxygen used in ventilation can itself be causing harm. And what we speculate is that it may be that if we aimed for a slightly lower target in some patients who've had a duration of time to adapt to the low oxygen level, we may be able to do less of these potentially harmful interventions, and thereby overall the patient benefits. SIMON: Well, Dr. Grocott, good climbing to you in the future, sir. Dr. GROCOTT: (Laughing) That's very kind. Thank you. Bye-bye. SIMON: Dr. Mike Grocott.

Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. A couple of stories today in \"Your Health. \" In a few minutes we'll hear how children with mild autism learn to improve their social skills. Now, they'll look at the debate on whether mothers can influence the gender of their babies. A British study found that women who ate lots of breakfast cereals, salt, and potassium were more likely to give birth to baby boys. As NPR's Allison Aubrey reports, there are still plenty of skeptics. ALLISON AUBREY: If you remember high school biology, you may recall that it's the father who determines gender, right? If the man contributes a sperm bearing an X chromosome, the embryo becomes female. A Y sperm produces a male baby. And as far as statistician Stanley Young is concerned, that's the end of the story. Dr. STANLEY YOUNG (Assistant Director of Bioinformatics, National Institute of Statistical Sciences): The female has relatively little, in fact nothing to do with the gender of the child. AUBREY: Young is a bioinformatic's expert at the National Institute of Statistical Sciences. He says last spring when a prestigious British journal published a paper titled \"You are What your Mother Eats,\" it prompted overnight buzz and thousands of Google hits. The paper concluded that what women eat in the months before they become pregnant does influence gender. But Stanley Young wasn't convinced. Dr. YOUNG: The biological reasoning did not seem reasonable to me, and I looked at the statistics, but that didn't look reasonable either. AUBREY: A British researcher at the University of Exeter named Fiona Mathews is the author of the paper. She says she understands Young's skepticism, but she says a growing body of research into evolutionary biology has scientists asking new questions. They're trying to understand what happens to embryos in utero, after sex is determined.  Not all embryos make it to birth. So perhaps the mother's environment, diet, or overall health does promote the survival of one gender over the other. With this thinking in mind, Mathews and her colleagues surveyed about 700 British mothers about their pre-pregnancy diets, asking about intake of lots of foods. She says it turned out that women who ate the most calorie-dense diets were more likely to deliver boys, but just slightly. Dr. FIONA MATHEWS (Biologist, University of Exeter, England): If you went from being a woman in the lowest third of energy intake to upping your calories so that you're now in the top third of energy intake, you're switching your probability of having a boy from being about 45 percent to about 56 percent. AUBREY: So, still close to 50-50 odds. Statistician Stan Young says he won't be convinced unless these findings can be replicated. And he says women shouldn't be led to believe that they can manipulate the odds of having a boy. Allison Aubrey, NPR News.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host:  This is Morning Edition from NPR News. Good morning.

What would you say is the best job in America, according to the new survey by CareerCast. com? Remember sitting in a ninth grade algebra class thinking, you know, why do I need to know this? I mean, when is this ever going to come out handy in my life - studying all this mathematics? Well, it turns out, your algebra teacher may have known a thing or two, because according to the results of this new survey, the number one job in America is mathematician. And the equations don't stop there. Of the top 10 jobs, nine out of the 10 of these jobs use math and could be classified as science-related jobs. Joining me now is Tony Lee. He's publisher of CareerCast. com and JobsRated. com. He joins us by phone. Welcome to Science Friday. Mr. TONY LEE (Publisher, Career. Cast. com and JobsRated. com): Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: Wow. We like to hear that kind of stuff. Mr. LEE: Well, it's great. And when the survey came out with mathematician as the number one ranked job, we heard from lots of elementary and middle school teachers who said, finally, I can put something up on the bulletin board to show the students there's a reason they need to pay attention in this class. FLATOW: (Laughing) We're all sitting there saying, I'm never going to use an upstream-downstream problem. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Well, here's the answer to that. How did you decide the top 10? What were the factors that went into the judging? Mr. LEE: Well, we've actually been doing this study for a number of years, and we've been refining the research over the years. We look at a lot of different criteria, but the criteria that stands out most as most important is the environment of the position, meaning, do you have control over your daily activities? Your income level, the employment outlook - are people hiring, you know, in that field? The physical demands of the job - you know, can you actually get hurt, you know, in your work? And then the stress levels and then there are lots of other components, but if you look at those - and we've come up with kind of a numerical equation - that's how we found out that a lot of the top jobs tend to be science-oriented, math-oriented, where a lot of the bottom jobs, sadly, are more physical-type jobs, outdoors, with a lot of physical demand. FLATOW: Lumberjack was your least desirable job. Mr. LEE: Yeah. Lumberjack ended up the worst job in the country, and of course we heard from some lumberjacks, who said I love what I do. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. LEE: Sadly though, you know, the one who was most vocal came back and said, you know, I've been a lumberjack for 20 years; I've only broken my leg twice and my collar bone once. It's not that bad. FLATOW: There you go. How many\u2026 Mr. LEE: Those of us in offices say, yeah, well, that's still not so good. FLATOW: Let's - so, your top - some of your top 10 jobs are mathematician, actuary, statistician, biologist, software engineer, computer systems analyst, industrial engineer and accountant - all in the top 10, all requiring math skills. But, you know, I don't want to upset any of the actuaries out there but, you know, the number two ranked job, actuary - you know, even Woody Allen says, can you think of anything more boring than being an actuary? (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. LEE: Well, you talk to actuaries, you know, and they tell you that they love their job because it's very math-oriented, and you're determining the length of things. You know, actuaries typically work for insurance companies, but now they work in lots of places, and they're determining how long you're going to live, how long a bridge is going to last, you know, lots of fairly interesting things, if you're into, you know, the statistical side of life. FLATOW: I know, my daughter has a career set to be an accountant, and she loves it, so I can understand that there're, you know, there are these people who love to do the number crunching there. Mr. LEE: Absolutely. FLATOW: Have you heard from the math teachers saying other things like, keep the studies going, and give us more of this? Mr. LEE: (Laughing) Yeah. I think they'd to keep the study going as long as math teacher - or mathematician ends up number one every time. We've probably heard more from folks like biologists and industrial designers saying, you know, I think my job's number one, and they've given the rationale as to why. It's a lot of fun to see people debating over why they think their job is better or why they think their job is worse. So, if you go to JobsRated. com, we have all those discussions going. People can contribute as to why they think their job is better or worse. FLATOW: Let's go to Barry in Arizona. Hi, Barry. BARRY (Caller): Oh, hi. Thank you. The one issue I have is, like, there doesn't seem to be that many jobs for science and math nowadays. How can you - how does your Web site help people in those fields? I have a PhD in the sciences. Mr. LEE: Well, a couple of things. One, the ranking is actually of 200 jobs total, so within the 200, there are actually quite a few more science and math-based jobs. And then two, our site is actually a job database with hundreds of thousands of positions, and there are thousands of jobs available today in most of these fields. So, I'd encourage you to go in and take a look. FLATOW: Craig in Quakertown, PA. Hi, Craig. CRAIG (Caller): Hey, what's going on? FLATOW: Hey. CRAIG: Hey, I have a - I just want to put my two cents in. You know, the mathematical equation that they came up with had nothing to do with the fact that people are actually happy with what they do for a living. Mr. LEE: Yeah, no. That's great. That is a great point. And I think the point that we need to make clear is there are people extremely happy doing jobs that no one else would want. You know, dairy farmer, taxi driver, commercial fisherman are all jobs that landed on our worst list. Yet, there's some very happy commercial fishermen out there. This is meant as a guide. This isn't a definitive, you know, decision - you should not have these jobs. It's to help primarily those folks who are either going through a career change because they've lost their job or they're unhappy, or students - you know, middle school, high school, college students - who are thinking, you know, I'm debating between this direction or that, you know, which has the best long-term outlook in terms of hiring, the best income, the most - least likelihood that I'm going to get laid off or hurt on the job? That's what this study is really to be used for as a guide. FLATOW: Talking about the best jobs in America this hour on Talk of the Nation, Science Friday from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Tony Lee. Let me see if I can get one quick question in before you go. (Soundbite of telephone dialing) (Soundbite of man talking on the phone) FLATOW: Oops. Wrong one.  (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: I don't know what happened there. Next. Unidentified Man (Caller): Are you there? FLATOW: Yes, go ahead. Unidentified Man: Yeah, I'm a wastewater operator, and I'd like to know where that job falls into. FLATOW: A wastewater operator. Mr. LEE: A wastewater operator is a little too - we only did 200 jobs. I will tell you that, unfortunately, at a very different level than what you do, but garbage collectors did end up at the bottom of the list. But remember, if you're a wastewater operator and you're working in a clean environment inside, you're not out in the cold or our in the heat, you've got kind of a controlled environment, and you have control over your day - you don't have fierce deadlines and not someone standing over your shoulder - then it's probably going to rank as a better job, as opposed to a worse one. FLATOW: Well, Tony, thank you for taking time to be with us today and good luck on the jobs. Mr. LEE: Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: Tony Lee is publisher of CareerCast. com and JobsRated. com. You can get links to his Web site on our Web site also.  IRA FLATOW, host:  Up next - the top careers in the country. What would you say is the best job in America, according to the new survey by CareerCast. com? Remember sitting in a ninth grade algebra class thinking, you know, why do I need to know this? I mean, when is this ever going to come out handy in my life - studying all this mathematics? Well, it turns out, your algebra teacher may have known a thing or two, because according to the results of this new survey, the number one job in America is mathematician. And the equations don't stop there. Of the top 10 jobs, nine out of the 10 of these jobs use math and could be classified as science-related jobs. Joining me now is Tony Lee. He's publisher of CareerCast. com and JobsRated. com. He joins us by phone. Welcome to Science Friday.  Mr. TONY LEE (Publisher, Career. Cast. com and JobsRated. com): Thank you, Ira.  FLATOW: Wow. We like to hear that kind of stuff.  Mr. LEE: Well, it's great. And when the survey came out with mathematician as the number one ranked job, we heard from lots of elementary and middle school teachers who said, finally, I can put something up on the bulletin board to show the students there's a reason they need to pay attention in this class.  FLATOW: (Laughing) We're all sitting there saying, I'm never going to use an upstream-downstream problem.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Well, here's the answer to that. How did you decide the top 10? What were the factors that went into the judging?  Mr. LEE: Well, we've actually been doing this study for a number of years, and we've been refining the research over the years. We look at a lot of different criteria, but the criteria that stands out most as most important is the environment of the position, meaning, do you have control over your daily activities? Your income level, the employment outlook - are people hiring, you know, in that field? The physical demands of the job - you know, can you actually get hurt, you know, in your work? And then the stress levels and then there are lots of other components, but if you look at those - and we've come up with kind of a numerical equation - that's how we found out that a lot of the top jobs tend to be science-oriented, math-oriented, where a lot of the bottom jobs, sadly, are more physical-type jobs, outdoors, with a lot of physical demand.  FLATOW: Lumberjack was your least desirable job.  Mr. LEE: Yeah. Lumberjack ended up the worst job in the country, and of course we heard from some lumberjacks, who said I love what I do.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. LEE: Sadly though, you know, the one who was most vocal came back and said, you know, I've been a lumberjack for 20 years; I've only broken my leg twice and my collar bone once. It's not that bad.  FLATOW: There you go. How many\u2026  Mr. LEE: Those of us in offices say, yeah, well, that's still not so good.  FLATOW: Let's - so, your top - some of your top 10 jobs are mathematician, actuary, statistician, biologist, software engineer, computer systems analyst, industrial engineer and accountant - all in the top 10, all requiring math skills. But, you know, I don't want to upset any of the actuaries out there but, you know, the number two ranked job, actuary - you know, even Woody Allen says, can you think of anything more boring than being an actuary?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. LEE: Well, you talk to actuaries, you know, and they tell you that they love their job because it's very math-oriented, and you're determining the length of things. You know, actuaries typically work for insurance companies, but now they work in lots of places, and they're determining how long you're going to live, how long a bridge is going to last, you know, lots of fairly interesting things, if you're into, you know, the statistical side of life.  FLATOW: I know, my daughter has a career set to be an accountant, and she loves it, so I can understand that there're, you know, there are these people who love to do the number crunching there.  Mr. LEE: Absolutely.  FLATOW: Have you heard from the math teachers saying other things like, keep the studies going, and give us more of this?  Mr. LEE: (Laughing) Yeah. I think they'd to keep the study going as long as math teacher - or mathematician ends up number one every time. We've probably heard more from folks like biologists and industrial designers saying, you know, I think my job's number one, and they've given the rationale as to why. It's a lot of fun to see people debating over why they think their job is better or why they think their job is worse. So, if you go to JobsRated. com, we have all those discussions going. People can contribute as to why they think their job is better or worse.  FLATOW: Let's go to Barry in Arizona. Hi, Barry.  BARRY (Caller): Oh, hi. Thank you. The one issue I have is, like, there doesn't seem to be that many jobs for science and math nowadays. How can you - how does your Web site help people in those fields? I have a PhD in the sciences.  Mr. LEE: Well, a couple of things. One, the ranking is actually of 200 jobs total, so within the 200, there are actually quite a few more science and math-based jobs. And then two, our site is actually a job database with hundreds of thousands of positions, and there are thousands of jobs available today in most of these fields. So, I'd encourage you to go in and take a look.  FLATOW: Craig in Quakertown, PA. Hi, Craig.  CRAIG (Caller): Hey, what's going on?  FLATOW: Hey.  CRAIG: Hey, I have a - I just want to put my two cents in. You know, the mathematical equation that they came up with had nothing to do with the fact that people are actually happy with what they do for a living.  Mr. LEE: Yeah, no. That's great. That is a great point. And I think the point that we need to make clear is there are people extremely happy doing jobs that no one else would want. You know, dairy farmer, taxi driver, commercial fisherman are all jobs that landed on our worst list. Yet, there's some very happy commercial fishermen out there. This is meant as a guide. This isn't a definitive, you know, decision - you should not have these jobs.  It's to help primarily those folks who are either going through a career change because they've lost their job or they're unhappy, or students - you know, middle school, high school, college students - who are thinking, you know, I'm debating between this direction or that, you know, which has the best long-term outlook in terms of hiring, the best income, the most - least likelihood that I'm going to get laid off or hurt on the job? That's what this study is really to be used for as a guide.  FLATOW: Talking about the best jobs in America this hour on Talk of the Nation, Science Friday from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Tony Lee. Let me see if I can get one quick question in before you go.  (Soundbite of telephone dialing)  (Soundbite of man talking on the phone)  FLATOW: Oops. Wrong one.   (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: I don't know what happened there. Next.  Unidentified Man (Caller): Are you there?  FLATOW: Yes, go ahead.  Unidentified Man: Yeah, I'm a wastewater operator, and I'd like to know where that job falls into.  FLATOW: A wastewater operator.

I'm Ira Flatow. We're going to go switch gears and talk about an anniversary. Yes, 50 years ago, two scientists thought up the term \"pheromone. \" They used the new word to describe a chemical messenger released by the female silkworm moth, a silkworm moth, to attract males. It was the first pheromone chemically identified in the scientific literature. But since then, scientists have catalogued these chemical messengers for bees and lobsters and the elephants and ants and even the lowly bacteria. Of course, if you Google pheromones, a bunch of hopeful ads pop up. You get premium human pheromones, 100-percent money-back guarantee. You'll also get pheromone cologne, sex pheromones, the only proven brands seen on TV guaranteed to attract sex now. But despite all the hype for human love potion based on pheromones, scientists still have not been able to conclusively identify these elusive compounds in humans, though my next guest says we may be finally on the right track. He has an essay this week in the journal Nature, highlighting the history of pheromone research. Tristram Wyatt is the author of \"Pheromones and Animal Behavior: Communication by Smell and Taste. \" He is also a senior researcher in the Department of Zoology at the University of Oxford in England. Welcome to Science Friday, Dr. Wyatt. Dr. TRISTRAM WYATT (Senior Research Associate, Department of Zoology, University of Oxford): Thanks for making me welcome. Good evening. FLATOW: Good evening to you. Give us the day - go back in history to those - the first pheromones. Did researchers know what they had then? Dr. WYATT: Well, chemical communication wasn't new in 1959. There're been lots of stories. But it really was, as you said, the very first time in 1959 that the chemistry had been tracked down, and it was an amazing task, given the techniques they had at that time available. So, it would've taken something like half a million silk moths to get enough material for Butenandt, the Nobel Prize-winner, to actually identify Bombykol, that first sex pheromone. FLATOW: And - but this is a concept that goes way back to the ancient Greeks, does it not? Dr. WYATT: Indeed, the ancient Greeks knew that a female dog in heat was enormously attractive to male dogs, and they knew it was some kind of secretion, although they obviously couldn't put their finger on it. FLATOW: And how many pheromones - fast-forward today - how many different animals have we recognized pheromones working in? Dr. WYATT: Well, probably many, many thousands of pheromones have actually been identified so far as the chemistry is concerned, but we're particularly good at working on moths. And that's partly because with the very good agricultural system of universities in the U. S. and the importance of crops over the years, there's been lots of money going into studying those pheromones because of the potential use as a sort of green pest control. But apart from that, we also know the chemical identity of pheromones in everything, as you mentioned, from lobsters to salamanders, possibly some birds. Almost any animal you mention is likely to use a pheromone, and that turns out to be the rule rather than the exception, even if we haven't identified it yet. FLATOW: Right. Dr. WYATT: And ironically, one of the only ones we don't know still is that female dog pheromone, even though every dog owner. . . (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. WYATT: Knows that it's incredibly powerful. FLATOW: By - then we must also assume by extension that there are human pheromones that we haven't identified yet. Dr. WYATT: Very much so. They've - I think humans, well, as in all the areas of science, humans are hard to work on, and part of it is the complexity of our behavior. But it's also because the main probable place that pheromones come from is our armpits. The reason for saying that is not just because they're gross. . . (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. WYATT: But because they gain their special smells when we reach puberty. They're slightly more smelly in the male than the female. And everything points, just in the same way as in other animals, that these ought to be the sources of pheromones. The problem is that wonderful bouquet, an acquired taste, that wonderful bouquet is very complex. So, there are thousands of different molecules in that mixture, and tracking down which ones are the pheromones is a much harder task even than working on moths. FLATOW: Wow. Wasn't there a study a couple of years ago of putting sweat on - above the lips of women. . . Dr. WYATT: Yep. FLATOW: To sniff in and they were - their hormones kicked in when they smelled this? Dr. WYATT: Yeah. There's some very nice studies. So, what we're looking at is very good evidence. . . FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. WYATT: For one kind of pheromone, which we call primer pheromones. So, it doesn't have an instantaneous effect like the dog pheromone, bringing in the dogs, the male dogs, from miles away. This is a much more subtle thing that lasts over a longer period and acts not on behavior directly, but acts on the hormones. One of the studies you're mentioning is Martha McClintock, now at the University of Chicago, and she originally had done some very nice work on menstrual synchrony, the way that women's periods start to synchronize if they're living in a close proximity like in a dorm. And in 1998, she continued that work and showed it, just as you've mentioned, that an extract from the underarm of one woman could affect the menstrual cycle of another if it was put on the upper lip of the woman receiving. So, it's something that you can sniff. And the nice thing about her study was it was all done double blind and there were also some good solvent controls, so we know it's not the alcohol or whatever it is that the sweat was dissolved in. Despite that good physiological evidence - and this other nice evidence from George Preti at the Monell Institute in Philadelphia, looking, in that case, male secretions and the effect on female hormone release - despite all that good evidence, it is elusive. We know that it's in the solution somewhere, but nobody to date has identified what the molecules are that are having this effect. When they do, we'll be able to say we've got the first human pheromone. Until then, we have good indications that these primer pheromones - no molecule identified. But sadly, all those things that you find in Google - and it's just the same in the UK - sadly, they could increase your confidence through a placebo effect. But sadly, there's no evidence that they actually work to make people irresistible. I wish they did. FLATOW: Yeah, me, too. 1-800-989-8255 is our number, 1-800-989-TALK, talking with Tristram Wyatt about pheromones on Science Friday. So, it's a question - is it a question that there are too many things in there to isolate and you'd have to try each one of them? Or then - or might be a combination of things or what? Dr. WYATT: Well, it's a bit of both, and that is actually one of the problems. If you take an extract, especially from a mammal, that has all these compounds in, you run it to a gas chromatograph, as you probably know, and that separates out each of the molecules into a single peak, if you're lucky. And the problem with a mammal secretion is with all that bacterial fermentation happening in the underarm - which is actually, really, how the smell works; it relies on bacteria to create the smell - given that incredibly complex odor, you've got perhaps 1,000 molecules to look through, and the biologically interesting ones won't necessarily be the biggest peaks. So, that's the first one. You can't just go for the high mountains. You have to look in the valleys as well. And as you said, it may not just be one compound acting by itself; it may be a combination. And that's something they found in moths very early on, and we know in mice that some of their pheromones are two compounds working together, and only if the two are presented together do you get the effect. So, it is a very complex situation. FLATOW: Hmm. It's even more complex when you think that if it's been shown that human armpit sweat is a trigger - we don't know what's in there. . . (Laughing) It's something that's so repulsive to people to begin with is actually the attractant. Dr. WYATT: Well, you could have too much of a good thing. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. WYATT: In the ancient Greek, actually, one poet was giving some advice to a friend of his, and he was saying, so long as your armpits start, or rather, keep smelling like goats, you're never going to find a partner. So, although we might think that it's a relatively recent thing to find armpits a bit much, it does go back awhile. It is also rather difficult study in modern society because we do have an aversion now to any human odor, and that is culturally driven; it's perfectly possible to find it attractive. And there's a wonderful and, I think, true story about Napoleon, writing back to Empress Josephine from the Russian campaign. And he's telling her apocryphally - actually, you can see the letter on the Internet - don't wash; I'm coming home soon. And this is two weeks before he's going to get home. So, he was actually a real enthusiast. FLATOW: Hmm. Maybe it's true. Maybe the ancient Europeans, I mean, a few hundred years ago, who didn't take a bath for a month. . . Dr. WYATT: Yes. FLATOW: Maybe they knew something we didn't know. Dr. WYATT: Indeed. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. WYATT: I think we also habituate. If you're around it all the time, then you stop smelling it. FLATOW: I have a question, 1-800-989-8255, from James in Caledonia, Michigan. Hi, James. JAMES (Caller): Hi, there. FLATOW: Hi, there. Go ahead. JAMES: Great show. Hi. My question is whether - what is it that compels my wife to try to smell my t-shirts or my sweatshirt, my sweaters? And I'd happily take the answer offline. FLATOW: Yeah. We will, too. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: What is there about that? Is that a pheromone, or is that something else? Dr. WYATT: Well, I think it just means he's irresistible. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. WYATT: That's - well, there's all sorts of things going on there. Part of it is things that may not actually be pheromones but may be what we call signature odors each of us have partly through genetics, partly through the bacteria and partly through what we eat. So, it's a really complex mixture of odors that each of us produces that's very characteristic. One of the nice things that has been done is that if you ask people to actually put it to the test, don't use a picture, but actually use smell, they're very good at identifying their partner, their children, their babies, and the babies also recognize their mothers and fathers. So, smell is very important even if we don't normally think about it. One thing we do know is that the smell of a partner is actually very comforting, and we choose partners possibly because they smell really nice to us. So, it's actually no surprise that if the two of you are very well suited, that she enjoys sniffing your smell. It probably means a lot to her. FLATOW: Hmm. Are all the pheromones, are they used for some sort of mating purpose? I mean, I know - that we've had E. O. Wilson on talking about leaving - ants leave trail scents and things like that. Dr. WYATT: Yeah. Well, E. O. Wilson was one of the pioneers, and in fact, very early on, in 1963, he had a fantastic Scientific American article on just this topic called \"Pheromones. \" His early work, and he was one of the first people to do it, was working on fire ant pheromones in the trails. And you're right; basically, almost every aspect of social insect life is driven by pheromones. So, you've got those trail pheromones; you've also got alarm pheromones, which he also worked on, so that if one ant is attacked, they release the alarm pheromone, and ants from all over rush over and attack the predator. They also have sex pheromones just the same as other animals for the queen and king, as it were, to meet on a nuptial flight. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. WYATT: But all sorts of aspects of the social life of the social insects is driven by pheromones. FLATOW: Interesting. Dr. WYATT: Including their nest building. FLATOW: Interesting. Talking with Tristram Wyatt on Science Friday from NPR News. Could there not also be human ones, when we talk about, I can smell the fear in him, you know? Those kinds of pheromones? Dr. WYATT: There is suggestive work from various groups, one in Texas and one on Long Island, looking at just that. We're at that kind of stage where we have suggestions of pheromones. We have a bio-essay(ph); we have a test that we could use to identify what molecules are. But we're at a very early stage. And someone's made a nice analogy. If you think back to the heart drug, digitalis, well, a long time back, a couple of hundred years back, we were using the actual foxglove flower. So, your physician would actually be prescribing so many flowers taken from the foxglove. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. WYATT: Eventually, the active ingredient, the active molecule, was identified, synthesized, and now your physician can give you a precise dose. There was always a risk before, actually, because, depending on the season, the flowers would either be very strong or not strong. So, every time you took the drug from the flower, original thing like a tea, you were putting yourself at risk. So, where we are with pheromones with these things about fear and other ideas is the suggestive behavioral work, some magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showing some kind of effect. There's been some physiological work, too, but that's only the beginning of actually working out if there really is a molecule and then a stage further identifying what those molecules might be. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let's see if we can get a phone call in from Bailey in Michigan State University. Hi, Bailey. BAILEY (Caller): Hi. How are you today? FLATOW: Hi, there. Quickly, please. BAILEY: I have heard anecdotal evidence of male iguanas attacking women who are on their menstrual cycle in a way that would be similar to how they would attack a female for mating. Is there any evidence of pheromones affecting trans-species? Dr. WYATT: Well, there are, and the most fantastic example is, perhaps, the bolus spider in the Southern states of the U. S. And the spider quite illegally synthesizes moth pheromones that are so exact that they attract male moths of that species, and when the moth gets close, the spider throws out its bolus - it's basically like a spider's web in a little gob of goo like a bolus - and it catches the moths and brings it in. But you're right; there are other species interactions, because if you're sending out a signal, then basically anybody else can overhear it. Now, those anecdotes, if you could actually quantify those and substantiate them, might give you a way of looking for what the human pheromone was. If this turn out to be a widespread occurrence, then that would give you a clue. If you could find out what the lizard pheromone was, that would give you a way into the human one. So, that's, actually, quite an intriguing idea. FLATOW: All right. Well, we're going to have to leave that for the next episode of Know Your Pheromones. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Dr. Wyatt, thank you for taking time to be with us. It's fascinating, absolutely fascinating stuff, and thank you for being - staying up late in Great Britain for us today. Dr. WYATT: Thank you. My pleasure. FLATOW: You're welcome. Tristram Wyatt is the author of \"Pheromones and Animal Behavior: Communication by Smell and Taste. \" He's also a senior researcher in the Department of Zoology in the University of Oxford in England.

And the nice thing about her study was it was all done double blind and there were also some good solvent controls, so we know it's not the alcohol or whatever it is that the sweat was dissolved in.  Despite that good physiological evidence - and this other nice evidence from George Preti at the Monell Institute in Philadelphia, looking, in that case, male secretions and the effect on female hormone release - despite all that good evidence, it is elusive. We know that it's in the solution somewhere, but nobody to date has identified what the molecules are that are having this effect. When they do, we'll be able to say we've got the first human pheromone. Until then, we have good indications that these primer pheromones - no molecule identified. But sadly, all those things that you find in Google - and it's just the same in the UK - sadly, they could increase your confidence through a placebo effect. But sadly, there's no evidence that they actually work to make people irresistible. I wish they did.  FLATOW: Yeah, me, too. 1-800-989-8255 is our number, 1-800-989-TALK, talking with Tristram Wyatt about pheromones on Science Friday. So, it's a question - is it a question that there are too many things in there to isolate and you'd have to try each one of them? Or then - or might be a combination of things or what?  Dr. WYATT: Well, it's a bit of both, and that is actually one of the problems. If you take an extract, especially from a mammal, that has all these compounds in, you run it to a gas chromatograph, as you probably know, and that separates out each of the molecules into a single peak, if you're lucky. And the problem with a mammal secretion is with all that bacterial fermentation happening in the underarm - which is actually, really, how the smell works; it relies on bacteria to create the smell - given that incredibly complex odor, you've got perhaps 1,000 molecules to look through, and the biologically interesting ones won't necessarily be the biggest peaks. So, that's the first one. You can't just go for the high mountains. You have to look in the valleys as well. And as you said, it may not just be one compound acting by itself; it may be a combination. And that's something they found in moths very early on, and we know in mice that some of their pheromones are two compounds working together, and only if the two are presented together do you get the effect. So, it is a very complex situation.  FLATOW: Hmm. It's even more complex when you think that if it's been shown that human armpit sweat is a trigger - we don't know what's in there. . .  (Laughing) It's something that's so repulsive to people to begin with is actually the attractant.  Dr. WYATT: Well, you could have too much of a good thing.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. WYATT: In the ancient Greek, actually, one poet was giving some advice to a friend of his, and he was saying, so long as your armpits start, or rather, keep smelling like goats, you're never going to find a partner. So, although we might think that it's a relatively recent thing to find armpits a bit much, it does go back awhile. It is also rather difficult study in modern society because we do have an aversion now to any human odor, and that is culturally driven; it's perfectly possible to find it attractive. And there's a wonderful and, I think, true story about Napoleon, writing back to Empress Josephine from the Russian campaign. And he's telling her apocryphally - actually, you can see the letter on the Internet - don't wash; I'm coming home soon. And this is two weeks before he's going to get home. So, he was actually a real enthusiast.  FLATOW: Hmm. Maybe it's true. Maybe the ancient Europeans, I mean, a few hundred years ago, who didn't take a bath for a month. . .  Dr. WYATT: Yes.  FLATOW: Maybe they knew something we didn't know.  Dr. WYATT: Indeed.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. WYATT: I think we also habituate. If you're around it all the time, then you stop smelling it.  FLATOW: I have a question, 1-800-989-8255, from James in Caledonia, Michigan. Hi, James.  JAMES (Caller): Hi, there.  FLATOW: Hi, there. Go ahead.  JAMES: Great show. Hi. My question is whether - what is it that compels my wife to try to smell my t-shirts or my sweatshirt, my sweaters? And I'd happily take the answer offline.  FLATOW: Yeah. We will, too.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: What is there about that? Is that a pheromone, or is that something else?  Dr. WYATT: Well, I think it just means he's irresistible.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. WYATT: That's - well, there's all sorts of things going on there. Part of it is things that may not actually be pheromones but may be what we call signature odors each of us have partly through genetics, partly through the bacteria and partly through what we eat. So, it's a really complex mixture of odors that each of us produces that's very characteristic. One of the nice things that has been done is that if you ask people to actually put it to the test, don't use a picture, but actually use smell, they're very good at identifying their partner, their children, their babies, and the babies also recognize their mothers and fathers. So, smell is very important even if we don't normally think about it. One thing we do know is that the smell of a partner is actually very comforting, and we choose partners possibly because they smell really nice to us. So, it's actually no surprise that if the two of you are very well suited, that she enjoys sniffing your smell. It probably means a lot to her.  FLATOW: Hmm. Are all the pheromones, are they used for some sort of mating purpose? I mean, I know - that we've had E. O. Wilson on talking about leaving - ants leave trail scents and things like that.  Dr. WYATT: Yeah. Well, E. O. Wilson was one of the pioneers, and in fact, very early on, in 1963, he had a fantastic Scientific American article on just this topic called \"Pheromones. \" His early work, and he was one of the first people to do it, was working on fire ant pheromones in the trails. And you're right; basically, almost every aspect of social insect life is driven by pheromones. So, you've got those trail pheromones; you've also got alarm pheromones, which he also worked on, so that if one ant is attacked, they release the alarm pheromone, and ants from all over rush over and attack the predator. They also have sex pheromones just the same as other animals for the queen and king, as it were, to meet on a nuptial flight.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. WYATT: But all sorts of aspects of the social life of the social insects is driven by pheromones.  FLATOW: Interesting.  Dr. WYATT: Including their nest building.  FLATOW: Interesting. Talking with Tristram Wyatt on Science Friday from NPR News. Could there not also be human ones, when we talk about, I can smell the fear in him, you know? Those kinds of pheromones?  Dr. WYATT: There is suggestive work from various groups, one in Texas and one on Long Island, looking at just that. We're at that kind of stage where we have suggestions of pheromones. We have a bio-essay(ph); we have a test that we could use to identify what molecules are. But we're at a very early stage. And someone's made a nice analogy. If you think back to the heart drug, digitalis, well, a long time back, a couple of hundred years back, we were using the actual foxglove flower. So, your physician would actually be prescribing so many flowers taken from the foxglove.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. WYATT: Eventually, the active ingredient, the active molecule, was identified, synthesized, and now your physician can give you a precise dose. There was always a risk before, actually, because, depending on the season, the flowers would either be very strong or not strong. So, every time you took the drug from the flower, original thing like a tea, you were putting yourself at risk. So, where we are with pheromones with these things about fear and other ideas is the suggestive behavioral work, some magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showing some kind of effect. There's been some physiological work, too, but that's only the beginning of actually working out if there really is a molecule and then a stage further identifying what those molecules might be.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let's see if we can get a phone call in from Bailey in Michigan State University. Hi, Bailey.  BAILEY (Caller): Hi. How are you today?  FLATOW: Hi, there. Quickly, please.  BAILEY: I have heard anecdotal evidence of male iguanas attacking women who are on their menstrual cycle in a way that would be similar to how they would attack a female for mating. Is there any evidence of pheromones affecting trans-species?  Dr. WYATT: Well, there are, and the most fantastic example is, perhaps, the bolus spider in the Southern states of the U. S. And the spider quite illegally synthesizes moth pheromones that are so exact that they attract male moths of that species, and when the moth gets close, the spider throws out its bolus - it's basically like a spider's web in a little gob of goo like a bolus - and it catches the moths and brings it in. But you're right; there are other species interactions, because if you're sending out a signal, then basically anybody else can overhear it. Now, those anecdotes, if you could actually quantify those and substantiate them, might give you a way of looking for what the human pheromone was. If this turn out to be a widespread occurrence, then that would give you a clue. If you could find out what the lizard pheromone was, that would give you a way into the human one. So, that's, actually, quite an intriguing idea.  FLATOW: All right. Well, we're going to have to leave that for the next episode of Know Your Pheromones.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Dr. Wyatt, thank you for taking time to be with us. It's fascinating, absolutely fascinating stuff, and thank you for being - staying up late in Great Britain for us today.  Dr. WYATT: Thank you. My pleasure.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Tristram Wyatt is the author of \"Pheromones and Animal Behavior: Communication by Smell and Taste. \" He's also a senior researcher in the Department of Zoology in the University of Oxford in England.

Wild animals can be hard to find. Some hide by scurrying into burrows. Others scamper up trees or dive underwater. For the field biologist, there is passion in the search for the quarry. Our next story is a tribute to that search. It's from scientist turned independent radio producer Ari Daniel Shapiro. Dr. ARI DANIEL SHAPIRO (Independent Radio Producer): I've spent part of my life as a killer whale biologist. I'm fascinated by both the whales and the lengths we go to to study them. Dr. VOLKER DEECKE (Research Fellow, Sea Mammal Research Unit, University of St. Andrews, Scotland): Killer whales are great animals. They fascinate me a lot. Dr. SHAPIRO: That's a friend of mine, Volker Deecke. He makes his living researching killer whales. Dr. DEECKE: I love the challenge of having to think like a killer whale. You know, having to strip your biases as a terrestrial, visually based mammal, and now have to try and understand what life might be like for an animal that lives in a three-dimensional world where vision is not very useful, where sound travels for large distances. Dr. SHAPIRO: I studied killer whales for my graduate work. So I get what it's like to imagine myself thinking and moving like a killer whale. In the field, I've had unbelievably vivid dreams of encountering the very whales I was hoping to find by day. Back home, I've heard emergency sirens outside, and mistaken them for a band of roving killer whales that have somehow come ashore to put out a fire. (Soundbite of killer whales) Dr. SHAPIRO: Whales are mythic and real at once.  Dr. DEECKE: The one thing that I always notice about whales is people use them as a canvas, you know? The white whale, people just color them in and project whatever they want onto them. And the less you know about an animal, the more you can do that. You know, once you actually have the full knowledge of what the animal is about, it takes away that freedom to project your ideas into it, what it should be, and what it should be doing. Dr. SHAPIRO: So before we go any further, let's color in the killer whale a bit. They live in every ocean and hug the coastlines of every continent. Each population feeds on something different. In Norway, they eat fish, mostly herring. In Alaska, one of the populations eats marine mammals, including seals and porpoises. Killer whale feeding involves two basic phases. They locate and pursue their prey, and then they attack and eat it. In one very obvious way, killer whales that eat fish behave differently from those that eat marine mammals. (Soundbite of Norwegian killer whales) Dr. SHAPIRO: These are the Norwegian fish eaters. They're loud. They call to one another a lot. They echolocate using sound like an acoustic strobe light to scan their surroundings and find fish. Now, here's a recording of the Alaskan mammal eaters in pursuit.  (Soundbite of Alaskan killer whales) Dr. SHAPIRO: They're absolutely silent. The seals and porpoises they eat have excellent hearing, and a vocal killer whale would tip them off and help them escape. So the killer whales keep quiet. But hearing in fish tends to be poor. So it's OK for killer whales to be chatty. It may be that they're informing one another of where they are, or maybe they're just excited. Both types of killer whales, those that eat fish and those that eat marine mammals, spend a lot of time in pursuit, waiting for and following their prey. And it's not unlike how killer whale researchers spend their time waiting for the whales to show up - chatting with one another, scanning the water from a windy bluff.  Dr. DEECKE: I mean, you're just looking for little irregularities in the water. Anything vertical really sticks out on this horizontal landscape. Dr. SHAPIRO: Volker is speaking from Fitful Head, a lookout in the south of the Shetland Islands, which are about 80 miles to the north of Scotland. I visited him and a field team of three this summer in Shetland, where they were studying the killer whales. One of the big questions was whether the Shetland whales eat fish or mammals. The team wanted to watch the animals in action, look for evidence of fish scales or marine mammal guts in the water, and listen for the presence or absence of killer whale vocal activity. But to get close enough, they first had to find them by spotting the animals from a distance. And that takes a lot of waiting. Here's Andy Foote, a killer whale biologist and one of the field team members scanning the water for whales. Mr. ANDY FOOTE (Killer Whale Biologist): I think when you first get into working with whales, you almost jump at every wave or marker buoy. And as you get a little bit more experienced, you sort of actually don't exclaim at and have an outburst at the first sight. You wait for it to come up a second time and make sure, and you're like, ha, OK. Just that sense of excitement, where all of a sudden your - the hairs on the back of your neck stand up a little bit, and then you've got your whale. Dr. SHAPIRO: Day after day, while we stood there looking for whales and not seeing any, there were often tourists and locals observing us, trying to make out why we watched the waters around us so intently, so hopefully. Some folks understood what brought us there, like this fellow, Gordon(ph). GORDON: When I was a kid, a teenager, we used to go bus spotting. Ever heard of that? We used to go around and take numbers of the buses. Dr. SHAPIRO: Oh, yeah. GORDON: And we had special books with all the buses in them and all the different types of buses - double-decker, single-deckers. And we used to go in different carriages and sit behind the wheel and vroom, vroom, vroom, you know? Dr. SHAPIRO: That was your thing. GORDON: That was my thing. Dr. SHAPIRO: So you can understand how you could get really interested in something? GORDON: I can understand how a person could be interested in a worm or a killer whale or a bird or whatever. Dr. SHAPIRO: But some bystanders weren't quite so convinced, like Tom(ph). TOM: Could I do it? Not really. Dr. SHAPIRO: How long would you wait up here? TOM: Well, if I thought I was going to see one, I'd probably stay a half-hour or an hour. Dr. SHAPIRO: Would you stay here for three months? TOM: Oh, no, no, no. No, no. No, thank you. Dr. SHAPIRO: In three months, Volker Deecke's team followed killer whales in Shetland only 12 times. On average, that's a little less than once each week. But it's a start. They eventually observed whales targeting marine mammals, namely harbor seals, as prey. There was no evidence for feeding on fish, but the possibility can't be ruled out just yet. So, they'll probably go back next summer to try to learn more. Volker's looking forward to it. Dr. DEECKE: Having the time to immerse yourself into the place and just go beyond the first impression, I think is a real privilege in itself, whales or no whales. So that's certainly what keeps me going. Dr. SHAPIRO: As killer whale biologists, we wait weeks for a glimpse of a black fin on light water, for the moment when we can observe and describe what the animals let us see. It takes a kind of love to maintain that kind of relationship, because we're pretty sure the killer whales don't feel the same way about us. It's not like they're waiting for us to show up. But it doesn't matter. We're drawn to them. Ms. ALICE ROCCO (Killer Whale Researcher): With killer whales, it's incredible. Dr. SHAPIRO: That's field assistant Alice Rocco. Ms. ROCCO: Like the first time we saw them, to me the male was extremely sensual - you know, like he had these sexy movements going on. Looked like he was a dancer or something - a really good dancer. Dr. SHAPIRO: And it's not just we biologists that get infatuated. Killer whales are awesome creatures. Local Shetlander Derrick Herning(ph) watches them from shore. Mr. DERRICK HERNING: You get a thrill from seeing a killer whale. I mean, I know they're cruel, that they play around with seals. They toss them up in the air and all the rest of it. But it's still a marvel of nature, this - it's a beautiful whale, the killer whale. So I take my hat off to it. I don't wear a hat, but never mind. (Soundbite of music) Dr. SHAPIRO: Killer whales capture the imagination. And maybe that's because of their very elusiveness, the way they disappear beneath the water's surface into their own world, leaving us behind on the shore, wishing to see them just once more. A love like that can sustain you for a lifetime.

Back home, I've heard emergency sirens outside, and mistaken them for a band of roving killer whales that have somehow come ashore to put out a fire.  (Soundbite of killer whales)  Dr. SHAPIRO: Whales are mythic and real at once.   Dr. DEECKE: The one thing that I always notice about whales is people use them as a canvas, you know? The white whale, people just color them in and project whatever they want onto them. And the less you know about an animal, the more you can do that. You know, once you actually have the full knowledge of what the animal is about, it takes away that freedom to project your ideas into it, what it should be, and what it should be doing.  Dr. SHAPIRO: So before we go any further, let's color in the killer whale a bit. They live in every ocean and hug the coastlines of every continent. Each population feeds on something different. In Norway, they eat fish, mostly herring. In Alaska, one of the populations eats marine mammals, including seals and porpoises. Killer whale feeding involves two basic phases. They locate and pursue their prey, and then they attack and eat it. In one very obvious way, killer whales that eat fish behave differently from those that eat marine mammals.  (Soundbite of Norwegian killer whales)  Dr. SHAPIRO: These are the Norwegian fish eaters. They're loud. They call to one another a lot. They echolocate using sound like an acoustic strobe light to scan their surroundings and find fish. Now, here's a recording of the Alaskan mammal eaters in pursuit.   (Soundbite of Alaskan killer whales)  Dr. SHAPIRO: They're absolutely silent. The seals and porpoises they eat have excellent hearing, and a vocal killer whale would tip them off and help them escape. So the killer whales keep quiet. But hearing in fish tends to be poor. So it's OK for killer whales to be chatty. It may be that they're informing one another of where they are, or maybe they're just excited. Both types of killer whales, those that eat fish and those that eat marine mammals, spend a lot of time in pursuit, waiting for and following their prey. And it's not unlike how killer whale researchers spend their time waiting for the whales to show up - chatting with one another, scanning the water from a windy bluff.   Dr. DEECKE: I mean, you're just looking for little irregularities in the water. Anything vertical really sticks out on this horizontal landscape.  Dr. SHAPIRO: Volker is speaking from Fitful Head, a lookout in the south of the Shetland Islands, which are about 80 miles to the north of Scotland. I visited him and a field team of three this summer in Shetland, where they were studying the killer whales. One of the big questions was whether the Shetland whales eat fish or mammals. The team wanted to watch the animals in action, look for evidence of fish scales or marine mammal guts in the water, and listen for the presence or absence of killer whale vocal activity. But to get close enough, they first had to find them by spotting the animals from a distance. And that takes a lot of waiting. Here's Andy Foote, a killer whale biologist and one of the field team members scanning the water for whales.  Mr. ANDY FOOTE (Killer Whale Biologist): I think when you first get into working with whales, you almost jump at every wave or marker buoy. And as you get a little bit more experienced, you sort of actually don't exclaim at and have an outburst at the first sight. You wait for it to come up a second time and make sure, and you're like, ha, OK. Just that sense of excitement, where all of a sudden your - the hairs on the back of your neck stand up a little bit, and then you've got your whale.  Dr. SHAPIRO: Day after day, while we stood there looking for whales and not seeing any, there were often tourists and locals observing us, trying to make out why we watched the waters around us so intently, so hopefully. Some folks understood what brought us there, like this fellow, Gordon(ph).  GORDON: When I was a kid, a teenager, we used to go bus spotting. Ever heard of that? We used to go around and take numbers of the buses.  Dr. SHAPIRO: Oh, yeah.  GORDON: And we had special books with all the buses in them and all the different types of buses - double-decker, single-deckers. And we used to go in different carriages and sit behind the wheel and vroom, vroom, vroom, you know?  Dr. SHAPIRO: That was your thing.  GORDON: That was my thing.  Dr. SHAPIRO: So you can understand how you could get really interested in something?  GORDON: I can understand how a person could be interested in a worm or a killer whale or a bird or whatever.  Dr. SHAPIRO: But some bystanders weren't quite so convinced, like Tom(ph).  TOM: Could I do it? Not really.  Dr. SHAPIRO: How long would you wait up here?  TOM: Well, if I thought I was going to see one, I'd probably stay a half-hour or an hour.  Dr. SHAPIRO: Would you stay here for three months?  TOM: Oh, no, no, no. No, no. No, thank you.  Dr. SHAPIRO: In three months, Volker Deecke's team followed killer whales in Shetland only 12 times. On average, that's a little less than once each week. But it's a start. They eventually observed whales targeting marine mammals, namely harbor seals, as prey. There was no evidence for feeding on fish, but the possibility can't be ruled out just yet. So, they'll probably go back next summer to try to learn more. Volker's looking forward to it.  Dr. DEECKE: Having the time to immerse yourself into the place and just go beyond the first impression, I think is a real privilege in itself, whales or no whales. So that's certainly what keeps me going.  Dr. SHAPIRO: As killer whale biologists, we wait weeks for a glimpse of a black fin on light water, for the moment when we can observe and describe what the animals let us see. It takes a kind of love to maintain that kind of relationship, because we're pretty sure the killer whales don't feel the same way about us. It's not like they're waiting for us to show up. But it doesn't matter. We're drawn to them.  Ms. ALICE ROCCO (Killer Whale Researcher): With killer whales, it's incredible.  Dr. SHAPIRO: That's field assistant Alice Rocco.  Ms. ROCCO: Like the first time we saw them, to me the male was extremely sensual - you know, like he had these sexy movements going on. Looked like he was a dancer or something - a really good dancer.  Dr. SHAPIRO: And it's not just we biologists that get infatuated. Killer whales are awesome creatures. Local Shetlander Derrick Herning(ph) watches them from shore.  Mr. DERRICK HERNING: You get a thrill from seeing a killer whale. I mean, I know they're cruel, that they play around with seals. They toss them up in the air and all the rest of it. But it's still a marvel of nature, this - it's a beautiful whale, the killer whale. So I take my hat off to it. I don't wear a hat, but never mind.  (Soundbite of music)  Dr. SHAPIRO: Killer whales capture the imagination. And maybe that's because of their very elusiveness, the way they disappear beneath the water's surface into their own world, leaving us behind on the shore, wishing to see them just once more. A love like that can sustain you for a lifetime.

Locusts don't vocalize, but we hear their wings and we hear the sound they make as they eat these plants down to their bare stems. GREENFIELDBOYCE: This kind of voracious swarm is why locusts are famous. But, it's actually not their usual routine. STEVE ROGERS: The swarming is something the locusts only do very occasionally. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Steve Rogers studies locusts at the University of Cambridge in England. ROGERS: The fact locusts can spend many generations in a form that not only doesn't swarm, but is actively repelled by the other locusts. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says locusts are usually solitary creatures, just harmless mild-mannered grasshoppers. But, if something like a drought forces locust to crowd together at a dwindling food source, and they start to smell and see other locusts and touch them. . . ROGERS: This is the exactly the point to which behavior changes dramatically. GREENFIELDBOYCE: First, they found that inside insect's nervous system there was steep rise in a brain chemical called serotonin. But was this causing the change? Michael Anstey is a researcher at the University of Oxford. He says they decided to find out and this week, in the Journal Science, they report on what happened when they gave locusts drugs that alter serotonin levels. MICHAEL ANSTEY: You know, it was absolutely startling to see the effect that these drugs had. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says drugs that block serotonin made solitary locusts stay shy, they never became gregarious, even in conditions that would normally make them swarm. ANSTEY: This really was the Eureka moment. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And drugs that boosted serotonin made solitary locust be suddenly attracted to other insects. ANTSEY: Watching those locusts actually go and behave as if they'd been in a crowd, or were born in a crowd, is absolutely remarkable. So, it's quite exciting and truly - truly fun to do. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Besides being fun, researchers hope this new insight might lead to new forms of pest control. That's a long way off. But Steve Roger says it is surprising to see just a single chemical making such a difference. ROGERS: Using models like these in wasps, we know that as they change behavior, as they leave the nest and things, there is a whole stew of different chemical changes going on. So the thing that we found is generally quite unusual. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Still, serotonin is known to affect behavior in other species, and boosting serotonin is what drugs like Prozac do. ROGERS: Serotonin is implicated in a lot of aspects of mood and well-being in humans as well as causing this change in locusts.

Sexually transmitted diseases appear to be on the rise in the United States. That's according to the latest report from the Centers for Disease Control. A quick glance at the data tells you that infections are up. But Day to Day's medical adviser, Dr. Sydney Spiesel, says the facts may not be so simple. Syd is a Yale Medical School professor and a pediatrician, and welcome back to Day to Day. Dr. SYDNEY SPIESEL: Always glad to be here. BRAND: All right, this study focuses on three big diseases: chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis. And what does it say? Dr. SPIESEL: Well, it says that of all of them, there's been a tremendously striking rise in chlamydia, in particular. And in fact, the numbers are so huge - there - in 2007, there were more than a million cases reported to CDC for the year, and that represents the largest number of cases ever reported to CDC for any condition. So, that's really pretty huge. And between 2006 and 2007, it went up 7. 5 percent, for example. BRAND: And also with syphilis and gonorrhea? Dr. SPIESEL: Gonorrhea is really pretty much stable. Syphilis, the total amount has not really increased, but the distribution has changed. It formerly was equally distributed between men and women. And now the number of cases reported - men has gone up a lot, and the number of cases reported in women has gone down a lot. And that may be because of - there's increased frequency of syphilis in men having sex with men. BRAND: So, what does this tell you, Syd, about the data? I mean, it seems pretty straightforward that there's an increase in all three of these. Dr. SPIESEL: Well, the data are really open to multiple interpretations. For instance, there's been a tremendous change just in the last few years in many parts of the country in the way testing is done. So, in the old days, testing, especially for men, especially for chlamydia and for gonorrhea were - how to put it delicately - very uncomfortable. And so, men shied away from getting tested. Men wouldn't get tested. Now, it's a urine test. It's not invasive at all, not annoying at all. And so, many more men are being tested than used to be the case. And maybe that's reflected in the fact that between 2006 and 2007 there were, like, a 43 percent increase in the number of positive cases in men. So, does that simply reflect more testing? BRAND: Still, with chlamydia, it looks like a massive increase in the number of cases. Could it all come down to that, that there's just more testing? Dr. SPIESEL: I think the actual rate of chlamydia has gone up. It's particularly an issue for young, African-American women. And that may have to do with all kinds of things. They may have less access to good-quality health care, which would provide both counseling and treatment early on. There's a lower rate of circumcision in African-American men, and that may lead to - there's no question that circumcision decreases the rate of transmission. So, there are all these things that we just don't know, and I think we just need more research. BRAND: Now, the thing about chlamydia is it's not a serious disease. It's not like HIV. You can cure it with antibiotics, right? Dr. SPIESEL: I really don't want people to become casual. These diseases are still serious and with very significant consequences, especially for women and children. Syphilis, we'd almost eliminated, but now it's rising, and not exactly sure why, although there are some ideas about that. We shouldn't forget that having an STD promotes the transmission of HIV. So, we do have - listen, these diseases are serious and dangerous, and should be taken seriously. COHEN: Syd, thank you. Dr. SPIESEL: My pleasure. BRAND: That's opinion from Dr. Sydney Spiesel.

So say scientists at the Alaska Volcano Observatory. In fact, it's all hands-on deck 24/7 at the observatory. Ash could spew 50,000 feet into the air across south central Alaska and reaching Anchorage, 100 miles away. That means goggles and dust masks are flying off the shelves in local stores. Tom Miller is a scientist emeritus at the observatory and he joins us now. Mr. Miller, how imminent is imminent? When are you expecting an eruption? Dr. TOM MILLER (Scientist Emeritus, Alaska Volcano Observatory): Based on the increase in the micro-earthquake seismicity, and the increase heat and gases we know that the mountain is very restless based on the occurrence of eruptions at other volcanoes and most recently - the most recent Redoubt eruption in 1989. We think that an eruption is more likely to occur than not, and we think it could occur any time within a matter of hours to a matter of a few weeks, so we're currently on a 24/7 watch and waiting for developments. SIEGEL: What kind of a threat, what an eruption of Mount Redoubt pose, either to property in the vicinity, or for that matter to the health of Alaskans nearby? Dr. MILLER: Well, of course Redoubt is in a National Park and Wilderness area, so it's remote. However, about 25 miles away from the volcano is the Drift River Oil Terminal, a facility that collects oil from offshore platforms in Cook Inlet near Anchorage. They're not under direct threat from any lava or ash, but they are in some risk to mudflows and flooding and so on. And they have prepared for this over the years and have encountered the problem before, like in 1989-90. So those are that closest people, otherwise there are about 300,000 people in south central Alaska that could conceivably have ash fall in on their heads at one time or another over the next several weeks if indeed it does start an eruption. This ash is not deadly, but it could be a problem to people with asthma and problems like that. And of course, it's a real hazard to electronics, can bother automobile engines and it's an incredible hazard to jet aircraft - high flying jet aircraft because it can stop the engines, and it's done that in the past. SIEGEL: And do we just assume that an eruption of a volcano like Mount Redoubt is one big blast that happens, and then the dust settles or might there be. . . Dr. MILLER: Well, indeed. . . SIEGEL: More than one? Dr. MILLER: It could be that. But generally, it hasn't been and indeed 1989-90, there were over 20 major explosive events that occurred between December 14th and April 21st. And all of those sent ash plumes to heights of any where from 30 to 50,000 feet, but it could easily be episodically erupting on the scale of every weeks for some few months.

(Soundbite of CBS NFL coverage) (Soundbite of crowd cheering) Unidentified Man: A wide hit, ball's out. (Soundbite of crowd cheering) Unidentified Man: Recovered by Timmons. Ryan Clark is still down. So, too, is Willis McGahee, and they say, fumble recovery, Pittsburgh. HAMILTON: That was from the CBS broadcast of a playoff game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Pittsburgh Steelers just a couple of weeks ago. Willis McGahee, the Baltimore player, was knocked unconscious and spent the night in a hospital. He says, he's fine now. But Doctor Ann McKee of Boston University worries about players who take repeated blows to the head. She's examined the brains of seven former NFL players who died of various causes before they reached 50. The most recent was Tom McHale of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who died at 45. McKee says, six of the players she examined had the same sort of damage found in some aging boxers. The brain tissue shrivels, and tangles begin to appear.  Dr. ANN MCKEE (Associate Professor, Neurology and Pathology, Boston University): We don't see anything like this in the normal population. This is something significant. HAMILTON: McKee says, the research on boxers suggests that at least one in five who suffer multiple concussions experience a slow degeneration of their brains later in life.  Dr. MCKEE: You know, once it's triggered, it just keeps on progressing, even though most of the time, the athlete has stopped getting the injuries, they've retired from the sport, but unfortunately, the process continues in the brain as long as they live. HAMILTON: And it leads to memory problems, depression, incoherent thoughts and eventually, dementia. But McKee says it's hard to use research on boxers to draw conclusions about football players.  Dr. MCKEE: There's so little we know about this, and everything needs to be found out. We need to find out how many hits. Do the hits have to come in close succession? Does it matter how old a person is when they get their injuries? And we think there's probably a genetic susceptibility, but we really just don't know what that is yet. HAMILTON: McKee hopes to know a lot more after studying at least 100 brains from former football players. That will take years, though, because the studies can only be done on players who have died after agreeing to give their brains to science. Mark Lovell runs the Sports Medicine Concussion Program at the University of Pittsburgh. He also works as a consultant to the NFL. Lovell says, it's not easy to assess the risk from concussions to an individual player. Dr. MARK LOVELL (Director, Sports Medicine Concussion Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center): You can see athletes who've had numerous concussions who seem to be functioning perfectly well. You can see athletes who have had one concussion who aren't functioning. HAMILTON: Lovell says, it's not even clear how many players actually sustain concussions during the season. Many won't say anything that might get them removed from a game. And medical technology doesn't offer trainers and coaches much help in getting a quick answer. Dr. LOVELL: The problem is is that the traditional ways of detecting brain injuries, such as CAT scans and MRIs and things like that, are really not at all sensitive to concussion. So, they really don't tell us much, other than the fact that there hasn't been a more serious brain injury, such as bleeding, et cetera, in the brain.  HAMILTON: Lovell says, that may change in the next decade. In the interim, he says, teams appear to be keeping players off the field longer than they used to after a blow to the head. Even so, Ann McKee says, she'll be thinking about head injuries while she watches the Super Bowl on Sunday.   Dr. MCKEE: You worry about all the hits. So, you really worry about it, and you know, you wonder what's going to pop up in 10 or 20 years. HAMILTON: Jon Hamilton, NPR News.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  The starting quarterbacks for Sunday's Super Bowl have something in common - both have suffered repeated concussions on the field. These type of head injuries can lead to severe brain damage, sometimes years or decades later.

And perhaps nowhere are they more endangered than in the war-ravaged eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo.  In November, Weekend Edition reported that the country's government and the rebels had agreed to let park rangers and conservationists back into the Virunga National Park where many of the gorillas live. The rangers had been gone for a year, and scientists feared the worst, but they were in for a surprise.  Richard Carroll of the World Wildlife Fund is here, and Mr. Carroll, you actually found the gorilla population had increased? Dr. RICHARD CARROLL (Managing Director, World Wildlife Fund's Congo Basin Program): Yes, this is a very, very good news story. After 16 months of being excluded from the park, to come back in and find that the gorilla population is not only intact but has increased by nine members.   With all the chaos, you would expect much more devastation in this population in this part of the world that's been wrought with conflict and humanitarian and ecological problems. So, we're thrilled. HANSEN: So, it increased by nine. What would the total population be? Dr. CARROLL: Well, the population in the Virungas is 380, in the tri-national area. That includes the Virunga National Park in Democratic Congo, the Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda and Mgahinga National Park in Uganda. HANSEN: To what do you attribute this good news? Dr. CARROLL: The good news, I believe, with the gorillas - gorillas have become iconic through decades of war and conflict and rebel groups going back and forth and the genocide in Rwanda and all the issues that have plagued this fantastic area of the world. . . TEXT: Nobody has harmed the gorillas, not the local people or the rebel groups.  They know that the gorillas are an economic resource with gorilla tourism, it's one of the highest foreign income earners for these countries. And so, they want to maintain that resource. But also, it's a source of pride. HANSEN: Hmm(ph). Dr. CARROLL: This is the only place where mountain gorillas exist in the world. HANSEN: Does the economic value still exist given the fact that there really isn't a lot of tourism there because of the fighting? And if there were no tourists coming into the country, what might that mean for the gorillas? Dr. CARROLL: Mm hmm(ph). Well, I believe that tourism will restart in the Congo once there is stability. Rwanda, a few years ago, was in such a state of affairs that who would have thought that you would go to Rwanda to see gorillas. The gorilla tourism in Rwanda is thriving. It's contributing to the economy and to the protection of the gorillas. HANSEN: Richard Carroll is managing director of the World Wildlife Fund's Congo Basin Program. Thank you for coming in.

S. compares with other countries when it comes to food safety and inspection. Jorgen Schlundt is director of food safety with the World Health Organization. He joins us from Geneva. Thanks for being with us. Dr. JORGEN SCHLUNDT (Director of Food Safety, World Health Organization): You're welcome. BLOCK: And can you point to one country that you would consider to be the gold standard for food safety? Dr. SCHLUNDT: No, we don't have that. We have countries that have tried to introduce new systems, and they have improved their systems, and therefore, also, they have less disease. But we have very, very poor measurements as to that. BLOCK: Poor measurements because? Dr. SCHLUNDT: Most countries don't really link disease cases directly to the food that people got sick from. This is something that's relatively new, that it's - many countries are now getting better at doing that. So we will see more and more cases where human cases can be linked to some specific food. BLOCK: Where would you say the U. S. falls in the continuum of food safety and food inspection around the world? Dr. SCHLUNDT: In a number of areas, U. S. is in the forefront, especially over the last 10, 20 years. There has been some new concepts where you go to the industry and say, you know, we have a common responsibility. We should look into your system and improve it. And - but in other areas, maybe some of the European countries in the northern Europe are more in the forefront. Actually, following the directions of the U. S. from the mid '90s where it was said that it's very important to look at the whole food production chain all the way from farm to fork. BLOCK: Farm to fork means you're overseeing the entire food production system? Dr. SCHLUNDT: You try to oversee the food system. Because what happens, for instance, in the peanuts or in the spinach cases is that you use animal manure on the farm, and animal manure can also contain salmonella bacteria. And then if you don't do it in a sensible way, you end up with a salmonella bacteria in the kitchen, and people eat them and some will get sick. BLOCK: You know, for American consumers who are looking at these repeated food safety problems, one after the other, with some basic foods that we all eat. They're listening to this and thinking, if we're considered at the top of the pack and we're still having all these problems, something is really wrong. Dr. SCHLUNDT: I wouldn't say that something is really wrong, but I would say that something could be changed in many, many countries, and also in the U. S. to improve the situation dramatically. You know, if we were really going after the big problem foods and if we were using new technology to make sure that we understand what the connection is between the food and disease\u2026 BLOCK: What are you talking about when you say new technology? Dr. SCHLUNDT: Well, the new technologies are, for instance, in the U. S. you now have a very efficient system that can link different cases. I mean, you can take some cases in Kentucky, and some in Ohio and some in California, and you can link them together because they're caused by the same salmonella. You couldn't do that before and you can't do that in many other countries. BLOCK: But again, you're still talking about identifying a problem after there's been contamination, not about preventing the contamination in the first place. Dr. SCHLUNDT: Yeah, but preventing the contamination, for instance, in this case, would be that we say, okay, where does it originally come from? And we know that we use animal manure in many, many different places in agriculture production. Then we should change the rules that are defining how we use animal manure. But you cannot say that the more you test, the more safe it is. That is really not the case. You have to go to the way that you're producing food and then improve that way, and that's the real way of getting rid of the food-borne disease cases.

I'm Alex Cohen. A news item you might have missed last week. In northern Japan, seven men became gravely ill after eating blowfish testicles. It might not sound like a delicacy to you, but it is in Japan. Jellyfish does not enjoy the same sort of popularity there, but one man has been trying to change that. My colleague, Madeleine Brand, had the chance to meet him a few years ago while reporting for NPR's Climate Connection series. Today, we hear her piece from October of 2007 once again. Back then, she spoke with Alex Chadwick about jellyfish as cuisine. Let's just say, Mr. Chadwick was a little wary. (Soundbite of NPR's Day to Day, October 3, 2007) ALEX CHADWICK: Ugh. MADELEINE BRAND: Ugh indeed. Yes, this guy is actually being helped by climate change. It seems that warmer temperatures and more pollution in the oceans are leading to lots more jellyfish, especially around Japan, where global warming has shifted ocean currents, bringing in more jellyfish. CHADWICK: Well, I've read enough of the science. The warmer waters mean a great spurt in the growth of the food that the jellyfish eat, so more jellyfish. BRAND: More jellyfish and bigger jellyfish; some of them are growing as big as washing machines. And when that happens, they get caught up in the fishing nets and literally crush the other fish. CHADWICK: Bad, bad for the fish, but maybe good for this jellyfish broker you met? BRAND: That's right. And this is actually what he calls himself. Mr. KANEO FUKUDA (Jellyfish Broker): My nickname is Jellyfish Fukuda. BRAND: Jellyfish Fukuda. His real name is Kaneo Fukuda. He's trying to get us all to love us some jellyfish. I met him with our translator, journalist Tim Horniak(ph), one night in Yokohama. That's a city near Tokyo with a big Chinatown. And you know, Alex, the Chinese have been eating jellyfish forever. So, we decided to sample some at a Chinese restaurant in Yokohama. (Soundbite of restaurant) BRAND: OK, we're now at the restaurant. Before we eat the jellyfish, we're going to go to the kitchen to see how the chef prepares it. Mr. TIM HORNIAK (Journalist, Translator): This is Chef Saito(ph). Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken). BRAND: Chef Saito, OK. Chef SAITO: Yes. BRAND: The chefs now brought out two bowls. One bowl. . . Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken). Mr. HORNIAK: This is jellyfish that has been processed. These are wide, thin sheets. They're kind of yellow, wrinkly and semitransparent. Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken). Mr. HORNIAK: Please touch it. BRAND: Touch it? OK. (Soundbite of laughter) Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken). Mr. HORNIAK: Smell it. BRAND: Smell it? Oh, OK. It smells like old cheese, and it feels like skin, rubbery, thick skin. Mr. HORNIAK: Fukuda-san says this is the smell of jellyfish. BRAND: Oh, it smells like old cheese? Mr. HORNIAK: (Japanese spoken). Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken). BRAND: Yes? Mr. HORNIAK: Yes, old cheese. Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken). Mr. HORNIAK: First, we cut it. BRAND: So, he's putting these pieces of jellyfish, the pieces that look like rubbery parchment or skin, onto a cutting board. So, these are about, oh, a quarter of an inch wide and maybe four inches long strips of jellyfish he's cutting with his cleaver. . . (Soundbite of slicing) BRAND: Throwing them into a bowl. Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken). Mr. HORNIAK: OK. Well, first, we boil it in water, and then we leave it in the water for about two days, and it becomes like this. In this plastic bowl here, looks a bit different from the jellyfish that's been cut up. It looks like more rounded, maybe. BRAND: It looks like worms. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. HORNIAK: OK. BRAND: Looks like worms. Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken). Mr. HORNIAK: This is how we boil the cut-up jellyfish. BRAND: Yes. Come this way? OK. (Soundbite of boiling water) Mr. HORNIAK: Yeah, this is some serious fireworks happening here. BRAND: Oh, my God! (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. HORNIAK: We're right in front of the stove in the Chinese restaurant. BRAND: So, he's put all this water into the wok, and it's boiling fiercely. Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken). BRAND: And then, he just puts the jellyfish into this rapidly boiling water. Wow. And so within seconds, it's done. It's cooked. Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken). Mr. HORNIAK: If you leave it in water for a day or two, it becomes softer. BRAND: Can I touch it? Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken). BRAND: Ow. Whoa, that's hot. It's hot, and it's rubbery, yeah, and it shrunk, yeah. So, I guess this jellyfish, then, will sit in water for a few days to soften up. (Soundbite of people talking) BRAND: Right, cheers. Mr. HORNIAK: To your jellyfish. Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken). (Soundbite of clinking glasses) (Soundbite of laughter) BRAND: To jellyfish. Mr. HORNIAK: OK. So, we have just to come down from the kitchen upstairs, and we're seated at our round table. BRAND: So, here are the jellyfish that we saw upstairs, and they've been seasoned. Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken). Mr. HORNIAK: You chew it. If it's chewy, it's good jellyfish. BRAND: OK. Mm. Not bad. (Soundbite of chewing) Mr. HORNIAK: (Japanese spoken). BRAND: Crunchy, very crunchy. Mr. HORNIAK: (Japanese spoken). Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken). BRAND: You know, I really could be eating anything, a bamboo shoot or some kind of radish, maybe, flavored nicely with sesame oil and salt, the future of our cuisine right here on my chopstick. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. HORNIAK: We're all going to be eating this around the world. BRAND: I know. No more fish. Say hello to the giant jellyfish dangling from my chopsticks. Mr. FUKUDA: Last year, September, we go to China. Mr. HORNIAK: They went to China last September, OK. Mr. FUKUDA: To catch jellyfish. Mr. HORNIAK: To catch jellyfish? BRAND: You went on the boat? Mr. FUKUDA: (Japanese spoken). Mr. HORNIAK: That's kind of scary. BRAND: Oh, pictures. Mr. FUKUDA: (Japanese spoken). Mr. HORNIAK: Photos from that, that's good. BRAND: Pictures of the jellyfish. Mr. HORNIAK: It looks like they're pulling something out of the water, and this one, wow. BRAND: Oh, my gosh! Look at that thing. It looks like a giant beach ball. Mr. FUKUDA: (Japanese spoken). Mr. HORNIAK: Oh, this photograph shows how giant jellyfish has been consumed in China for a long time, raw and served in a kind of soup. And Fukuda-san would like to popularize this form of jellyfish cuisine in Japan, served raw, because if he does manage to do that, this will help out a lot of the fishermen, Japanese fishermen, in the Sea of Japan whose nets are being flooded by a deluge of giant jellyfish. You know, they'll be able to harvest these creatures as something they can sell in Japan if this becomes popular. BRAND: How big a problem is it for Japanese fishermen, these giant jellyfish? Mr. HORNIAK: (Japanese spoken). Mr. FUKUDA: (Japanese spoken). Mr. HORNIAK: Of course, it's a really big problem for the fishermen on the Sea of Japan because these giant jellyfish get into the nets and you can't get any more fish; you know, the fish die in the folds of these jellyfish. Mr. FUKUDA: (Japanese spoken). Mr. HORNIAK: It's become so that these fishermen aren't able to fish, really. You know, they're just pulling up all these jellyfish all the time. BRAND: And yet, it's a good thing for you because you have made it a business opportunity. Mr. FUKUDA: (Japanese spoken). (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. HORNIAK: That's right. It is a good chance for me, even though it's an environmental problem. Mr. FUKUDA: (Japanese spoken). Mr. HORNIAK: I'm creating jellyfish makeup and skin products, which are very good for ladies with dry skin. BRAND: I'm looking at a picture of his - he has made an alcoholic drink, vodka, soda water and jellyfish. What is it - what is your drink called? Does it have a name? Mr. HORNIAK: (Japanese spoken). Mr. FUKUDA: jellyfish sour. (Soundbite of laughter) BRAND: A jellyfish sour? Mr. FUKUDA: Yes, yes. (Soundbite of laughter) BRAND: Mmmm. So, what are those things floating in it? So, it's bits of jellyfish. . . Mr. FUKUDA: Jellyfish. Mr. HORNIAK: There's jellyfish in. . . Mr. FUKUDA: American jellyfish. Mr. HORNIAK: American jellyfish. Mr. FUKUDA: (Japanese spoken). Mr. HORNIAK: I'm making a lot of different dishes with jellyfish. BRAND: What about jellyfish cake? Mr. HORNIAK: Jellyfish cake? (Japanese spoken). Mr. FUKUDA: (Japanese spoken). Mr. HORNIAK: I'm making it, yes, indeed. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. HORNIAK: Of course, I'm making that. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. FUKUDA: (Japanese spoken). Mr. HORNIAK: I'll show you. BRAND: Oh, and you have a picture of some jellyfish cake. (Soundbite of laughter) BRAND: So, Alex, that is Jellyfish Fukuda. And if global warming continues, if Jellyfish Fukuda is successful, we could all be eating jellyfish cake and a lot of other delicious jellyfish dishes. (Soundbite of music) COHEN: Peanut butter and jellyfish sandwiches, anyone? Maybe not. Stay with us. NPR's Day to Day continues.  ALEX COHEN, host:  This is Day to Day from NPR News. I'm Alex Cohen. A news item you might have missed last week. In northern Japan, seven men became gravely ill after eating blowfish testicles. It might not sound like a delicacy to you, but it is in Japan. Jellyfish does not enjoy the same sort of popularity there, but one man has been trying to change that. My colleague, Madeleine Brand, had the chance to meet him a few years ago while reporting for NPR's Climate Connection series. Today, we hear her piece from October of 2007 once again. Back then, she spoke with Alex Chadwick about jellyfish as cuisine. Let's just say, Mr. Chadwick was a little wary.  (Soundbite of NPR's Day to Day, October 3, 2007)  ALEX CHADWICK: Ugh.  MADELEINE BRAND: Ugh indeed. Yes, this guy is actually being helped by climate change. It seems that warmer temperatures and more pollution in the oceans are leading to lots more jellyfish, especially around Japan, where global warming has shifted ocean currents, bringing in more jellyfish.  CHADWICK: Well, I've read enough of the science. The warmer waters mean a great spurt in the growth of the food that the jellyfish eat, so more jellyfish.  BRAND: More jellyfish and bigger jellyfish; some of them are growing as big as washing machines. And when that happens, they get caught up in the fishing nets and literally crush the other fish.  CHADWICK: Bad, bad for the fish, but maybe good for this jellyfish broker you met?  BRAND: That's right. And this is actually what he calls himself.  Mr. KANEO FUKUDA (Jellyfish Broker): My nickname is Jellyfish Fukuda.  BRAND: Jellyfish Fukuda. His real name is Kaneo Fukuda. He's trying to get us all to love us some jellyfish. I met him with our translator, journalist Tim Horniak(ph), one night in Yokohama. That's a city near Tokyo with a big Chinatown. And you know, Alex, the Chinese have been eating jellyfish forever. So, we decided to sample some at a Chinese restaurant in Yokohama.  (Soundbite of restaurant)  BRAND: OK, we're now at the restaurant. Before we eat the jellyfish, we're going to go to the kitchen to see how the chef prepares it.  Mr. TIM HORNIAK (Journalist, Translator): This is Chef Saito(ph).  Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken).  BRAND: Chef Saito, OK.  Chef SAITO: Yes.  BRAND: The chefs now brought out two bowls. One bowl. . .  Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken).  Mr. HORNIAK: This is jellyfish that has been processed. These are wide, thin sheets. They're kind of yellow, wrinkly and semitransparent.  Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken).  Mr. HORNIAK: Please touch it.  BRAND: Touch it? OK.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken).  Mr. HORNIAK: Smell it.  BRAND: Smell it? Oh, OK. It smells like old cheese, and it feels like skin, rubbery, thick skin.  Mr. HORNIAK: Fukuda-san says this is the smell of jellyfish.  BRAND: Oh, it smells like old cheese?  Mr. HORNIAK: (Japanese spoken).  Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken).  BRAND: Yes?  Mr. HORNIAK: Yes, old cheese.  Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken).  Mr. HORNIAK: First, we cut it.  BRAND: So, he's putting these pieces of jellyfish, the pieces that look like rubbery parchment or skin, onto a cutting board. So, these are about, oh, a quarter of an inch wide and maybe four inches long strips of jellyfish he's cutting with his cleaver. . .  (Soundbite of slicing)  BRAND: Throwing them into a bowl.  Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken).  Mr. HORNIAK: OK. Well, first, we boil it in water, and then we leave it in the water for about two days, and it becomes like this. In this plastic bowl here, looks a bit different from the jellyfish that's been cut up. It looks like more rounded, maybe.  BRAND: It looks like worms.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. HORNIAK: OK.  BRAND: Looks like worms.  Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken).  Mr. HORNIAK: This is how we boil the cut-up jellyfish.  BRAND: Yes. Come this way? OK.  (Soundbite of boiling water)  Mr. HORNIAK: Yeah, this is some serious fireworks happening here.  BRAND: Oh, my God!  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. HORNIAK: We're right in front of the stove in the Chinese restaurant.  BRAND: So, he's put all this water into the wok, and it's boiling fiercely.  Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken).  BRAND: And then, he just puts the jellyfish into this rapidly boiling water. Wow. And so within seconds, it's done. It's cooked.  Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken).  Mr. HORNIAK: If you leave it in water for a day or two, it becomes softer.  BRAND: Can I touch it?  Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken).  BRAND: Ow. Whoa, that's hot. It's hot, and it's rubbery, yeah, and it shrunk, yeah. So, I guess this jellyfish, then, will sit in water for a few days to soften up.  (Soundbite of people talking)  BRAND: Right, cheers.  Mr. HORNIAK: To your jellyfish.  Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken).  (Soundbite of clinking glasses)  (Soundbite of laughter)  BRAND: To jellyfish.  Mr. HORNIAK: OK. So, we have just to come down from the kitchen upstairs, and we're seated at our round table.  BRAND: So, here are the jellyfish that we saw upstairs, and they've been seasoned.  Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken).  Mr. HORNIAK: You chew it. If it's chewy, it's good jellyfish.  BRAND: OK. Mm. Not bad.  (Soundbite of chewing)  Mr. HORNIAK: (Japanese spoken).  BRAND: Crunchy, very crunchy.  Mr. HORNIAK: (Japanese spoken).  Chef SAITO: (Japanese spoken).  BRAND: You know, I really could be eating anything, a bamboo shoot or some kind of radish, maybe, flavored nicely with sesame oil and salt, the future of our cuisine right here on my chopstick.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. HORNIAK: We're all going to be eating this around the world.  BRAND: I know. No more fish. Say hello to the giant jellyfish dangling from my chopsticks.  Mr. FUKUDA: Last year, September, we go to China.  Mr. HORNIAK: They went to China last September, OK.  Mr. FUKUDA: To catch jellyfish.  Mr. HORNIAK: To catch jellyfish?  BRAND: You went on the boat?  Mr. FUKUDA: (Japanese spoken).  Mr. HORNIAK: That's kind of scary.  BRAND: Oh, pictures.  Mr. FUKUDA: (Japanese spoken).  Mr. HORNIAK: Photos from that, that's good.  BRAND: Pictures of the jellyfish.  Mr. HORNIAK: It looks like they're pulling something out of the water, and this one, wow.  BRAND: Oh, my gosh! Look at that thing. It looks like a giant beach ball.  Mr. FUKUDA: (Japanese spoken).  Mr. HORNIAK: Oh, this photograph shows how giant jellyfish has been consumed in China for a long time, raw and served in a kind of soup. And Fukuda-san would like to popularize this form of jellyfish cuisine in Japan, served raw, because if he does manage to do that, this will help out a lot of the fishermen, Japanese fishermen, in the Sea of Japan whose nets are being flooded by a deluge of giant jellyfish. You know, they'll be able to harvest these creatures as something they can sell in Japan if this becomes popular.  BRAND: How big a problem is it for Japanese fishermen, these giant jellyfish?  Mr. HORNIAK: (Japanese spoken).  Mr. FUKUDA: (Japanese spoken).  Mr. HORNIAK: Of course, it's a really big problem for the fishermen on the Sea of Japan because these giant jellyfish get into the nets and you can't get any more fish; you know, the fish die in the folds of these jellyfish.

If a vision of a boa constrictor comes to mind, think bigger - much bigger. The biggest snake that ever lived reached 42 feet, about the length of a school bus. That's according to scientists who found the vertebrae of this super serpent in the rainforests of Colombia. NPR's Christopher Joyce has this report. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In fact, the area where the bones were found is no longer a rainforest, although it was when the snake was alive, millions of years ago. ] CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: It's tempting to wait 'til the end of the story to reveal that this snake is extinct, but that wouldn't be fair. So OK, Titanoboa cerrejonensis lived 60 million years ago, but one can still imagine, as big around as a trash barrel, weighing over a ton. Jason Head is a paleontologist at the University of Toronto, who studies big snakes that once roamed through the earth - or slithered, that is. A colleague in Colombia, South America called and said he'd found some huge bones from a very long spinal column. They set up a video conference so Head could see them. Dr. JASON HEAD (Paleontologist, University of Toronto): He held one specimen up to the camera and I just about jumped out of my chair. And we were both just sitting there laughing, because it was so ridiculously big. It was a vertebra the size of his hand. You know, it was - we were both just blown away. And I said I know this is the world's largest snake. JOYCE: Titanoboa inherited the earth after the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago. Dr. HEAD: Between the end of the age of dinosaurs and about 45, give or take a couple of million years, this is the single largest terrestrial vertebrate. JOYCE: On land the Titanoboa was boss. It ate, well, whatever it wanted. Most meals were primitive crocodiles, al dente. But Head says size isn't the whole story here. Dr. HEAD: We realized right away that it was telling us a story, that the fact that there was a snake this big has to mean something about the environment. JOYCE: Something about how hot the tropics were then and maybe how hot they could get again. Here's why. This snake was presumably cold-blooded. To survive with that big a body it had to live in a very hot place. To be exact, says Head, a rainforest averaging 32 degrees Celsius, more or less, or 90 degrees Fahrenheit. That's several degrees warmer than now and several degrees warmer than scientists thought the tropics could ever get, even during a greenhouse period. Dr. MATTHEW HUBER (Climate scientist, Purdue University): There's an old idea that the tropical regions have a thermostat and they just can't get hotter than about 28, 29, 30 degrees C. JOYCE: That's Matthew Huber, who studies ancient climates at Purdue University. Essentially, the idea has been that the tropics just don't warm up that much during global warming periods, even as the rest of the world does. Huber says the snake evidence suggests otherwise. Dr. HUBER: And if that's the case, that's in some sense bad news for us for the future. It says there's no magical thermostat that keeps the tropics at a reasonable temperature that they will warm to in a global warming world. JOYCE: If, he says, that is the case. No one has ever used a fossil snake before as a measure of ancient climate. Huber says the work will need some confirmation. But, he adds, there might also be a bright side here. Many biologists thought that tropical forests would simply die if they got significantly hotter. Dr. HUBER: And this suggests that at least on long time scales the tropics are quite happy to be significantly warmer than they are today.

Let me tell you, it's good to be the queen, even the queen ant. That's what a certain type of butterfly has learned. As caterpillars, they've learned how to masquerade perfectly as ant queens. They trick other ants into treating them like royalty, even killing their own offspring to feed the hungry caterpillars. Just how does this butterfly pull off this evolutionary stunt? Well, Jeremy Thomas and his colleagues have figured it out, and the research appears today in today's edition of the journal Science. Jeremy Thomas is a professor of ecology at the University of Oxford. He joins me now. And ants are extremely protective of their nests, I understand. So, how does a caterpillar manage to work its way inside these nests? Dr. JEREMY THOMAS (Ecology, University of Oxford): Yes, you're right. Ants will kill almost anything that goes into their nest. But these caterpillars have two tricks. One is that they have chemicals that mimic the chemicals that the ants have. So, they smell the same as the ants, and that allows them to get in, but they also have this further trick. They can produce sounds and they actually imitate the sounds that the queens make. So, the workers are tricked into thinking that these intruders are actually the most important object in the whole society. BRAND: Well, let's hear some of that sound. Now, this is the queen ant, letting her colony know that she's in charge. (Soundbite of queen ant sound) BRAND: OK. And now here is the caterpillar's version. (Soundbite of Large Blue caterpillar sound) BRAND: So, it doesn't sound exactly the same, but enough to trick the ants? Dr. THOMAS: Yes, that's right. And to human ears, they do sound really rather different, but there are certain parts of the sound that are absolutely spot on, absolutely identical. The nearest comparison I can give is two very different musical instruments, something like a violin or a tuba and a trombone, that although the sounds they produce are really rather different, they're playing the same tune, and it's the tune that the ants can recognize, a tune that says I'm a queen ant; treat me like royalty. (Soundbite of laughter) BRAND: And then they do, and as I said in the introduction, they actually will feed these caterpillars their own offspring if they demand it? Dr. THOMAS: They will if conditions get really harsh. If they're starving, they certainly will kill their own young to feed these caterpillars instead. BRAND: But why would these caterpillars want to invade the ants' nest in the first place? Can't they take care of themselves? Dr. THOMAS: Well, it's the end of a remarkable long evolutionary process that has probably been going on for millions of years, and they can really be sort of parasites for the ants. In nature, where there is a resource going up for grabs, sooner or later, something seems to evolve to fill that niche. BRAND: And so, what does this mean for the ants? Dr. THOMAS: Well, it's very bad news for the ants, as a matter fact. There's no detectable benefit for them at all. It really is an intruder that weakens the whole colony so much that they - often the colony dies, because they get the worker ants working very, very hard to get enough food for them, exhausting its host.

I'm Madeleine Brand. Global warming is shrinking the polar ice sheet: bad news for polar bears and, really, bad news for all of us. Here's a small silver lining. It's an opportunity for fishermen. Ice-free summers could open up new fishing grounds in the waters north of Alaska. NPR's Martin Kaste reports from Seattle that the people who manage the fishing industry are saying, not so fast. MARTIN KASTE: Caleb Pongawi(ph) is a native Alaskan from St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea. From there, you really can see Russia. He grew up surrounded by the arctic icepack. Mr. CALEB PONGAWI (Resident, St. Lawrence Island, Alaska): One has to experience being out in the ocean among the ice to feel the peacefulness, the power, of the ice. KASTE: He says the ice is especially inviting in the spring, when the sun finally comes out again. Mr. PONGAWI: There's mirages because there's heat from the sun on ice. It's like seeing a city, you know, 100 miles away coming out over the horizon. It's beautiful. KASTE: But now, that sea ice is thinning. It comes in later in the year, and it breaks up earlier. Pongawi is seeing more ships, barges and oil-company vessels heading north of the Bering Strait, and he wonders if fishing boats are far behind. Jim Ayers of the conservation group Oceana says it may be just a matter of time. Mr. JIM AYERS (Vice President, Pacific, Oceana): As the ice has been retreating, it's pretty clear that industrial fishing is possible. KASTE: Environmentalists have been trying for years to stop arctic fishing before it starts, and at a meeting this week in Seattle, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council voted to do just that. Ayers calls it a big victory. Mr. AYERS: The idea is that it's closed and it will only open when we understand how we might do that in a way that wouldn't have severe impact on an already stressed arctic ecosystem. KASTE: In other words, no commercial fishing in the arctic until it's been properly studied. The fishing industry supports this decision. Laurie Swanson(ph), who works for companies that run trawlers off the southern coast of Alaska, says her industry isn't exactly poised to moved in to the arctic anyway. Ms. LAURIE SWANSON (Businesswoman, Southern Alaska): There's not an expectation of fisheries developing soon. I think it's a much more long-term thinking, if the ice were to retreat, if those grounds are accessible, if there are harvestable stocks. But I don't think it's anything that's going to happen quickly. KASTE: It's a whole lot easier politically to shut down a fishing ground that isn't being used yet. But what happens when those studies are done? Clearly, some environmentalists hope that this will turn into a permanent ban. But the fishing industry sees things differently. Laurie Swanson says this policy is what it says it is: a first step toward establishing a management plan for arctic fishing. Ms. SWANSON: I think it's a policy call by the nation as to whether it's better to allow no fishing at all or to take a practical view of what is available, what can be safely harvested, and allow a safe and controlled harvest of the resources that are there. KASTE: Still, as Swanson says, the commercial fishing fleets based here in Seattle and in Alaska are feeling no great rush to expand their range into the Arctic Circle. Conditions are still rough up there, and the ice is still treacherous. But as the arctic keeps warming, that could change quickly, and this new policy is an acknowledgment that the day may come when American fishing boats start casting their nets in the waters that were formerly known as the polar ice cap. Martin Kaste, NPR News, Seattle.  MADELEINE BRAND, host:  This is Day to Day. I'm Madeleine Brand. Global warming is shrinking the polar ice sheet: bad news for polar bears and, really, bad news for all of us. Here's a small silver lining. It's an opportunity for fishermen. Ice-free summers could open up new fishing grounds in the waters north of Alaska. NPR's Martin Kaste reports from Seattle that the people who manage the fishing industry are saying, not so fast.  MARTIN KASTE: Caleb Pongawi(ph) is a native Alaskan from St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea. From there, you really can see Russia. He grew up surrounded by the arctic icepack.  Mr. CALEB PONGAWI (Resident, St. Lawrence Island, Alaska): One has to experience being out in the ocean among the ice to feel the peacefulness, the power, of the ice.  KASTE: He says the ice is especially inviting in the spring, when the sun finally comes out again.  Mr. PONGAWI: There's mirages because there's heat from the sun on ice. It's like seeing a city, you know, 100 miles away coming out over the horizon. It's beautiful.  KASTE: But now, that sea ice is thinning. It comes in later in the year, and it breaks up earlier. Pongawi is seeing more ships, barges and oil-company vessels heading north of the Bering Strait, and he wonders if fishing boats are far behind. Jim Ayers of the conservation group Oceana says it may be just a matter of time.  Mr. JIM AYERS (Vice President, Pacific, Oceana): As the ice has been retreating, it's pretty clear that industrial fishing is possible.  KASTE: Environmentalists have been trying for years to stop arctic fishing before it starts, and at a meeting this week in Seattle, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council voted to do just that. Ayers calls it a big victory.  Mr. AYERS: The idea is that it's closed and it will only open when we understand how we might do that in a way that wouldn't have severe impact on an already stressed arctic ecosystem.  KASTE: In other words, no commercial fishing in the arctic until it's been properly studied. The fishing industry supports this decision. Laurie Swanson(ph), who works for companies that run trawlers off the southern coast of Alaska, says her industry isn't exactly poised to moved in to the arctic anyway.  Ms. LAURIE SWANSON (Businesswoman, Southern Alaska): There's not an expectation of fisheries developing soon. I think it's a much more long-term thinking, if the ice were to retreat, if those grounds are accessible, if there are harvestable stocks.

He's a machine. (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE \"ROBOCOP\")(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE \"THE TERMINATOR\")(SOUNDBITE OF FIGHTING, SCREAMING)MICHAEL BIEHN: Unidentified Announcer: Inhuman, relentless. ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER: (As The Terminator) I'll be back. LINDA HAMILTON: (As Sarah Connor) Are you saying it's from the future? BRAND: The future is now, or at least it was in those clips from \"Robocop\" and \"The Terminator. \" I am talking about this new term. It's called homo evolutis. This new version of human is emerging thanks to advances in genetics and robotics. Well, for now, at least, homo evolutis may just be the figment of one man's imagination. That man is Juan Enriquez. He's managing director at Excel Medical Ventures, a life-science investment firm in Boston. And he presented his ideas about homo evolutis at last week's TED Conference, the Technology, Entertainment and Design Conference. And he's here now on the line, and welcome to the program. What is homo evolutis? JUAN ENRIQUEZ: Well, I consider it a hominid, a proto-human, that's beginning to take direct and deliberate control over the evolution of his species and others. You know, Darwin kept looking at how different species, including humans, adopt and adapt to the environment. Now, for the first time, we're creating a species that not only influences the environment on a massive scale, but also begins to directly guide the evolution of species by engineering bacteria, by engineering tissues, and by thinking about giving us abilities that we don't traditionally have. BRAND: Now, I just want to make it clear to our listeners you're not a scientist; you are a venture capitalist. ENRIQUEZ: Among other things, yes. BRAND: Among other things. . . (SOUNDBITE OF LOVE)BRAND: Among a lot of other things. ENRIQUEZ: I've been accused of worse. BRAND: But what you're talking about is a scientific phenomenon. You're talking about us actually changing our DNA? ENRIQUEZ: The argument that I've been making is the ability to code life in the four letters of DNA - adenine, theanine, guanine, cytosine - allows us to begin to change what living forms do, and we're doing that with bacteria that make vaccines or that make chemicals or that make energy. And now, we're progressing down a path where we can re-grow, say - or at Wake Forest, Tony Atala's working on re-growing ears for injured soldiers. He's working on re-growing bladders for people who've lost them to cancer. We're beginning to re-grow our own skin in sheets, and that is going to be an absolutely immense driver of the global economy going forward. BRAND: And how would that, though, replicate itself in future generations? I understand how we're changing our bodies now, the bodies that exist. But how do you pass on that information to your descendants? ENRIQUEZ: Well, the argument that I made at TED is that those of us who are, you know, in our 40s or 50s are going to begin to get glimpses of this new species. But I think our grandchildren are going to begin to see, in much clearer terms, how we're heading towards this. And what you're talking about is germinal evolution as opposed to personal evolution, where we're beginning to engineer our own bodies, but we're not at the stage where we're beginning to engineer going forward, in big terms yet. As we begin to engineer more and more things, our grandkids are going to begin to get glimpses of choices that you and I can't even begin to imagine. BRAND: I'm still hung up on the DNA, changing the DNA, the building blocks of life, and how long that takes, because really, it's been, what, 200,000 years since the first homo sapiens evolved? And you're talking about 100 years that things might change? ENRIQUEZ: I'm not arguing everything will change in 100 years. I'm arguing we'll get glimpses of what's coming. Our grandchildren will start to see it much more clearly: stronger tendons, different types of eyes, re-grown skin, re-grown bladders. It's these three big trends coming together. It's the ability to engineer genes; it's the ability to engineer on a cellular level, on a microscopic level, the ability to engineer tissues and robotics that coming together allow us to adopt and adapt to an environment in a very different way. All of these tiny little changes just remind me of those wonderful sketches in Darwin's Galapagos books of the finches and how the different beaks adapt to different climates and different circumstances to eat different types of seeds, but the great big difference with what Darwin was observing and what we're observing is he was watching nature force this adoption and adaptation and we are beginning to deliberately engineer it in very interesting ways. And I think that leads us from being a homo sapiens into a homo evolutis that begins to take charge of these little tiny knits of evolution in where his and her species is going. BRAND: So, you don't think that it's \"unnatural\" - I mean to put that word in quotes - to change and adapt in human beings and choose certain characteristics that are more beneficial than others? ENRIQUEZ: You know, I think we've been doing that for a long, long time, and that's how we went from being Cro-Magnons and Neanderthals into being what we are today. And if we don't keep evolving, I think that would, actually, be very sad. I mean, if this is the entire purpose of the universe and this is pinnacle, well, you'd almost become a French existentialist at that point.

And scientists estimate there are 30 or more actual cases for every one that's reported. Nine deaths have been linked to the outbreak, and it's led to one of the biggest food recalls in recent years. On Capitol Hill yesterday, a House subcommittee held a hearing about the outbreak. Congressman Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, sits on the panel and showed just how personal this outbreak could be. EDWARD MARKEY: Peanut butter was probably half of my diet as a child. It's one of those foods that is really good for you and tastes great too. But now mothers and fathers across America are worried about salmonella and don't know what to put in their kids' lunches. MONTAGNE: NPR's Joanne Silberner was at the hearing and joins us now to talk about it. Good morning. JOANNE SILBERNER: Good morning. MONTAGNE: Emotions seem to be running pretty high there at that hearing. What was the atmosphere altogether? SILBERNER: Well, it started out with testimony from some of the victims. There was a man who lost his 72-year-old mother. Another lost his dad. And then there was the father of a three-year-old who survived but really gave the family a scare. So we heard from those people and saw just how serious this outbreak has been. MONTAGNE: Now, we just had another salmonella outbreak and it was thought to have been sourced to tomatoes, but then it turned out to be jalape\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00b1o and Serrano peppers. And then a couple of years back there was a salmonella outbreak in peanut butter. Are foods getting less safe? SILBERNER: And when you look at that pepper outbreak that was last year that came from one farm in Mexico and it spread all over because the peppers were distributed all over. MONTAGNE: And this current outbreak traced to a peanut plant; it was one peanut plant. It accounts for only one percent of the peanut market in this country, but again managed to send its product everywhere. SILBERNER: That's right. And it's really the new food reality that companies like Kellogg or Keebler, they will buy products from all over and then put them into their products, then we eat that final product. We no longer eat locally grown foods from a single source. Foods are combined. MONTAGNE: And so while this current outbreak affects something like 13,000 products being recalled, we should emphasize that many peanut products are not involved. And some of them have PR campaigns to say that their products are safe. Talk to us about that. SILBERNER: Yeah. There's a Web site from a peanut group that lists products that are specifically safe. And certainly what you buy in jars in the store, the peanut butter there, that's safe. Now, the company did say that it sold some product to dollar stores. That has been recalled.

I'm Madeleine Brand. Valentine's Day is Saturday, and so, for the fortunate, there will be a romantic dinner followed by maybe a little romance. But attitudes towards dinner and romance have actually evolved, with dinner taking on more importance than sex, if you can believe it. Mary Eberstadt took the long-range look at this in an article called \"Is Food the New Sex? \" She's a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. So, is it? Is food the new sex?  Ms. MARY EBERSTADT (Research Fellow, Hoover Institution, Stanford University; Author, \"Is Food the New Sex? \"): Well, I think it is, Madeleine. Let me explain what I mean by that provocative-sounding question. Over the past half century or so, something really interesting has happened throughout western societies. On the one hand, moral beliefs about sex have all gone in one direction. And generally speaking, it's been the laissez-faire direction. That is to say, people today are much less moralistic about sexual behavior than they were 50 years ago. On the other hand, at the very same time this has been happening, people's attitudes about food, which, say, in the 1950s, were very laissez-faire. Food was just seen as a matter of taste. Those attitudes today have evolved such that people are much more moralistic about food and food choices, whether the issue is vegetarianism or what's good for the planet. People in general have come to adopt a sort of moralistic universal code about food. It's not accepted by everybody, but it's clearly the direction in which things are moving. BRAND: What do you mean by laissez-faire about sex? Ms. EBERSTADT: I mean, having generally the idea that as along as things are consensual, there's nothing external, like a moral code, that should put a restraint on things. I don't mean that people have become completely amoral about sex. I just mean that if you look at the course of ideas in the last, again, say, roughly 50 years, you see a clear movement away from a strict, well-defined sexual morality, according to which extramarital sex is wrong under any circumstances. And again, what you see in the area of food is the rise of various moral codes - macrobiotics, vegetarianism, et cetera - at the same time that people are moving away from them in sex. BRAND: Well, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, most people in their 30s and 40s are married, and within those marriages, most have only one sexual partner in a given year - each other. Ms. EBERSTADT: Oh, sure. BRAND: So, how is that an indication of a laissez-faire attitude towards sex and morality? Ms. EBERSTADT: I think, if you look at what happens in the years before marriage by all kinds of measures, it's clear that, say, a 25-year-old today who's single is living very differently from her grandmother. In, for example, the Policy Review essay, I actually make up these two people called Betty and Jennifer, because I think it helps to see how differently people live now. Say, Jennifer, a 25-year-old today, is exposed to lots of things that Betty never got near. For example, young people are much more likely to use pornography. They're much more likely to experiment sexually. They're much, much more likely to have very liberal attitudes about sex. So, there's a clear change of attitude. BRAND: And do you find that the people who have more, I guess, moral strictures when it comes to having sex - people, perhaps, who are more religious - have looser strictures when it comes to food? Or is this something that you're theorizing about? Ms. EBERSTADT: Yeah. Look, I don't have longitudinal studies to demonstrate that. But I have heard expressed very often by social conservatives, say, the sort of head-scratching idea, why are people so crazy about food now? Why does nobody, you know, talk about traditional sexual morality? So, I think on that side of the spectrum, people are genuinely puzzled, and they sense that there's a lot of morality still floating around in society, but that it's drifted away from, you know, traditional moral concerns, particularly about a sexual code, and drifted over to this area where really, it hasn't existed before. All religions have rules proscribing food. For example, Seventh Day Adventists are vegetarians. Muslims, Christians, Jews all have their own dietary rules, but those rules were understood to further the religion. It's only really in our time that things like vegetarianism have come completely unmoored from any other moral system. It's become a thing in itself. BRAND: Mary Eberstadt is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution. Her article is in the Hoover's Policy Review magazine. It's called \"Is Food the New Sex? \" I have to say, that's a very provocative title. Thank you very much.  Ms. EBERSTADT: Thanks for having me.  MADELEINE BRAND, host:  This is Day to Day.

Ms. EBERSTADT: Oh, sure.  BRAND: So, how is that an indication of a laissez-faire attitude towards sex and morality?  Ms. EBERSTADT: I think, if you look at what happens in the years before marriage by all kinds of measures, it's clear that, say, a 25-year-old today who's single is living very differently from her grandmother. In, for example, the Policy Review essay, I actually make up these two people called Betty and Jennifer, because I think it helps to see how differently people live now. Say, Jennifer, a 25-year-old today, is exposed to lots of things that Betty never got near. For example, young people are much more likely to use pornography. They're much more likely to experiment sexually. They're much, much more likely to have very liberal attitudes about sex. So, there's a clear change of attitude.  BRAND: And do you find that the people who have more, I guess, moral strictures when it comes to having sex - people, perhaps, who are more religious - have looser strictures when it comes to food? Or is this something that you're theorizing about?  Ms. EBERSTADT: Yeah. Look, I don't have longitudinal studies to demonstrate that. But I have heard expressed very often by social conservatives, say, the sort of head-scratching idea, why are people so crazy about food now? Why does nobody, you know, talk about traditional sexual morality? So, I think on that side of the spectrum, people are genuinely puzzled, and they sense that there's a lot of morality still floating around in society, but that it's drifted away from, you know, traditional moral concerns, particularly about a sexual code, and drifted over to this area where really, it hasn't existed before.  All religions have rules proscribing food. For example, Seventh Day Adventists are vegetarians. Muslims, Christians, Jews all have their own dietary rules, but those rules were understood to further the religion. It's only really in our time that things like vegetarianism have come completely unmoored from any other moral system. It's become a thing in itself.  BRAND: Mary Eberstadt is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution. Her article is in the Hoover's Policy Review magazine. It's called \"Is Food the New Sex? \" I have to say, that's a very provocative title. Thank you very much.   Ms. EBERSTADT: Thanks for having me.

NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: Joseph LeDoux studies memory at New York University. He says if you picture your memory as a kind of storage cabinet that's full of unchanging stuff, you're wrong. Dr. JOSEPH LEDOUX (Neuroscientist, New York University): Each time you take a memory out, each time it's retrieved, it's got to be restored. And sometimes when you restore it, you put in additional information. This is a good thing because it allows you to update the memory. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It also means the memory can be changed if you catch it at the right point. Dr. LEDOUX: There's just this window, or temporary state, where the memories lay (unintelligible) and subject to disruption. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In fact, the memory can even be erased. Ladue has done studies with rats showing he can wipe out a fearful memory using certain drugs. Now scientists have done a similar experiment in people. It involved college students, spiders and electric shocks. Meryl Kynt(ph) led the study at the University of Amsterdam. First, she wanted to give the student volunteers a new, fearful memory. So they came into a lab, sat in front of a computer screen and were shown picture of big spiders. Ms. MERYL KYNT (University of Amsterdam): Two different pictures. One spider's on a shoulder, the other on the leaves of a plant. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The study was designed so that only one of the spider images would become linked to a scary memory. Every time that image appeared, the student would get a mild electric shock on the wrist. Ms. KYNT: During the procedure, you see that a fear evolves. So they fear only one spider, and they don't fear the other spider. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Kynt and her colleagues could actually measure that fear by monitoring people's startle response. The students were sent home with their nasty spider memory. And the next day, the researchers tried to erase that memory. They gave the students either a placebo pill or a real drug - a common blood-pressure drug, a beta blocker called Propranolol. Then they showed the students the picture of the scary spider to make them recall the memory of being shocked. The researchers wanted to see if the drug could prevent that bad memory from being put back into storage. And that appears to be the case. When people who got the drug were later shown both the good and the bad spiders, their reaction was identical. Their learned fear response was gone. Ms. KYNT: It was completely eliminated. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says if you asked them, do you remember the scary spider. They said, sure. Ms. KYNT: Because they were aware that this picture was followed by a shock, but the emotional impact, the emotional meaning was gone since there was no fear response anymore. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And she says that emotional association is a kind of memory, one that was essentially erased by the drug. The study is described in the journal Nature Neuroscience. Some researchers, like Kareem Nadir(ph) at McGill University, have already been studying whether this drug can be used as a treatment for people who are tormented by painful memories. People with post-traumatic stress disorder are asked to recount troubling memories and are given the drug. Nadir says the preliminary results are promising. Mr. KAREEM NADIR (Researcher, McGill University): Some of these guys have had PTSD for like 30 years. And then, like, they feel better. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He knows that some people have raised ethical concerns about the idea of weakening specific memories with a drug. But he thinks if people are suffering, it's something worth trying.

Well, we're about to hear about a major paleontological dig in the heart of the nation's second largest city. Workers excavating the parking garage next to an old department store in Los Angeles uncovered the largest known collection of fossils from the Ice Age. Paleontologists have been pulling fossils out of the La Brea tar pits, on the west side of L. A. , for years. But this new find near the tar pits provides more details about what life was like up to 40 thousand years ago. Robin Turner is president of ArchaeoPaleo Resource Management - that's a company that works closely with the tar pits. And she describes exactly what they found at that site. NORRIS: We found a mammoth. We've got saber tooth cat, we've got lion, and I know that there is a short-faced bear. There's many sloths that were found. There's all sorts of birds of prey, pond turtles. And we've got trees with their root system and branches, and little bugs and a river. NORRIS: And there's one particular animal that the folks at the Page Museum are particularly excited about - this mammoth that they've named Zed. Tell me about Zed. NORRIS: Well, Zed was found in an old stream bed, where he had died and fallen apart. We found that we had the entire mammoth except, possibly, one part of a right leg. And it ended up that we still think we have that. But it's in another place that they haven't excavated yet. But Zed is wonderful because he has several broken rib bones that have healed, which show it was an old break. So he was walking around with some broken ribs. And he has an area on his chin that is a big, bulbous area that shows that he had some sort of a cancer, or a disease or something. So, he wasn't a well animal. NORRIS: Now, it sounds like it was not just the big animals, but even the small things that you've found that got people really excited. NORRIS: This is the most wonderful find I could ever have in my entire life, and I'm pretty sure it's the best find - a paleontologic find - that there is in the world. And the reason is, it's the entire environment that was kept intact. We have everything from the mammoth all the way down to trees and little bugs with hair on their backs, or little fur on their backs. We have pond turtles, we have birds. We have everything all the way down to algae. We have a stream that goes through the site, so we have freshwater shells. Most paleontologic finds, we find an animal or a few things. But we don't find the entire environment, from 10,000 to 40,000 years ago. NORRIS: So, we're talking about a well-traveled stretch of territory in Los Angeles. This is essentially right near Wilshire Boulevard. Thousands of cars buzz up and down the street all day long. What must life have been like along that stretch of what we now know as Wilshire Boulevard thousands of years ago? NORRIS: Well, the area was much like it is now, but a little bit more tropical. So, it brought in all the animals for food substance as well as water. NORRIS: Boy, when I think about traveling to and from Los Angeles, I guess I'll never think of the watering holes along Wilshire Boulevard in quite the same way - the restaurants and bistros. There were these animals that were dining along that strip long before humans arrived. NORRIS: Yeah, I call it the original fast food.

Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. ARI SHAPIRO, host: And I'm Ari Shapiro filling in for Renee Montagne. The nation's crime labs need a total overhaul. That's the conclusion the National Academy of Sciences reached in a study that they released yesterday. As NPR's Dina Temple-Raston reports, it turns out that forensic evidence isn't nearly as iron clad as it appears on television. (Soundbite of song, \"Baba O'Riley\") Mr. ROGER DALTRY (Singer, The Who): (Singing) Out here in the fields\u2026 DINA TEMPLE-RASTON: Now, if you recognize that music as a TV theme song, you are probably one of the millions of people who watch \"CSI\" or Crime Scene Investigation. (Soundbite of song, \"Baba O'Riley\") And according to the National Academy of Sciences report, frankly, you're part of the problem. The NAS actually calls it the \"CSI effect. \" Apparently, after watching blood spatters analyzed and carpet fibers tweezered night after night, there's a sense out there that forensic evidence is infallible.  (Soundbite of TV show, \"CSI\") Ms. MARG HELGENBERGER (As Catherine Willows): This brand of drugs is a signature to one specific distributor. Unidentified Woman (Actress): The street name is Nemo. TEMPLE-RASTON: In fact, the NAS says studies show \"CSI\" viewers \u2014 and even judges and lawyers \u2014 are under the impression that the techniques that they see on the show are science at work. And they aren't. Judge Harry Edwards is one of the co-chairs of the NAS committee. Judge HARRY EDWARDS (Co-chairman, National Academy of Sciences): The quality of practice in forensic science disciplines varies greatly. TEMPLE-RASTON: Edwards's committee found that while some forensic evidence, like DNA, is top-notch, other evidence, like fingerprints for example, is not nearly so reliable. Barry Scheck is one of the co-directors of the Innocence Project, which, among other things, has overturned convictions using forensic evidence. Mr. BARRY SCHECK (Co-director, Innocence Project): Whether it's hair analysis, fiber comparison, bite marks, even fingerprints, judges and juries have heard this evidence, they think it's solid, and then they rely on it to come up with convictions that later have been proved to be wrong. TEMPLE-RASTON: That's one of the reasons why the NAS report recommends a forensic science overhaul. It wants forensic experts to be certified. It wants to train technicians and supervise crime labs. It calls for separating the science in a crime scene investigation from the police work. And the committee wants to create a new federal agency to oversee all this. It's not at all clear how this would happen. For one thing, Congress may not want to spend the money to create a new agency. And Congress might have trouble legislating local police practices from Washington. Professor EUGENE O'DONNELL (John Jay College of Criminal Justice): We have a real national hodgepodge when it comes to science and law enforcement. TEMPLE-RASTON: That's Eugene O'Donnell, a former prosecutor and now professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. He says that law enforcement across the country is so diverse it would be hard for Congress to enforce forensic standards at a grass-roots level. That said, he does credit the report with getting a conversation going about forensic evidence and how to make it more scientific. Prof. O'DONNELL: This report offers an opportunity to start rethinking where science should be and what its proper relationship should be with law enforcement. TEMPLE-RASTON: As a general matter, law enforcement has supported the NAS suggestions, with the exception of one. The NAS says crime labs should be independent and not part of police departments or prosecutors' offices. Investigators say that could be a problem. Right now, a forensic examiner can call the police right away when some piece of evidence is useless. Because of that it allows investigators to go back to the crime scene while evidence is still fresh. O'Donnell says there's a balance to strike. Prof. O'DONNELL: When this system works best, you have that proper mix of independence, and yet you have law enforcement being able to weigh in and provide background and context as the investigation is being pursued. TEMPLE-RASTON: He says it isn't clear how independent labs will allow that to happen. Think about going to a doctor's office and getting a blood test, he said. The doctor sends it to an independent lab, and it takes days to get results. Investigators often don't have the luxury of time if there's a criminal on the loose. Dina Temple-Raston, NPR News. SHAPIRO: You can read highlights of the National Academy of Science's report on forensics at npr. org.  STEVE INSKEEP, host:  It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News.  Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep.  ARI SHAPIRO, host:  And I'm Ari Shapiro filling in for Renee Montagne.  The nation's crime labs need a total overhaul. That's the conclusion the National Academy of Sciences reached in a study that they released yesterday. As NPR's Dina Temple-Raston reports, it turns out that forensic evidence isn't nearly as iron clad as it appears on television.  (Soundbite of song, \"Baba O'Riley\")  Mr. ROGER DALTRY (Singer, The Who): (Singing) Out here in the fields\u2026  DINA TEMPLE-RASTON: Now, if you recognize that music as a TV theme song, you are probably one of the millions of people who watch \"CSI\" or Crime Scene Investigation.  (Soundbite of song, \"Baba O'Riley\")  And according to the National Academy of Sciences report, frankly, you're part of the problem. The NAS actually calls it the \"CSI effect. \" Apparently, after watching blood spatters analyzed and carpet fibers tweezered night after night, there's a sense out there that forensic evidence is infallible.   (Soundbite of TV show, \"CSI\")  Ms. MARG HELGENBERGER (As Catherine Willows): This brand of drugs is a signature to one specific distributor.  Unidentified Woman (Actress): The street name is Nemo.  TEMPLE-RASTON: In fact, the NAS says studies show \"CSI\" viewers \u2014 and even judges and lawyers \u2014 are under the impression that the techniques that they see on the show are science at work. And they aren't. Judge Harry Edwards is one of the co-chairs of the NAS committee.

This is a good time to find out because it's National Engineers Week, and yesterday, teachers and engineers around the country took part in Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day. That was an effort to get more girls excited about changing the world through careers in engineering.

Leslie Collins is the executive director of the National Engineers Week Foundation in Alexandria, Virginia. She joins us over the phone. Welcome to Science Friday, Ms. Collins. Ms. LESLIE COLLINS (Executive Director, National Engineers Week Foundation): Well, thank you, Ira. Glad to be here. Like the show a lot. FLATOW: Thank you. What was the impetus for this? Ms. COLLINS: For Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day? The impetus was that a number of American corporations can't get enough engineers, and when you look at the changing demographics, women are a majority on college campuses these days, yet they are only about 20 percent of the college engineering students. So, we'd like to change that. There are a lot more girls going to college these days. They are academically prepared, which wasn't necessarily the case even 20 years ago, but they're capable of going into engineering, but it's not on the radar screen, and we'd like to change that. FLATOW: Yeah. So, what happens to them, and how do you propose to change that? Ms. COLLINS: Well, we propose to start talking with girls in the way that's meaningful for them. I think that too often, engineers are guilty of this, talking about the process of becoming an engineer and not about how engineering is really a helping profession. And when you talk to girls, and boys, for that matter, about what they want out of their future careers, they're pretty savvy and they wanted to know they're going to make a good living; girls want to know there's going to be some job flexibility; they also want to know - this is girls, now - that they're going to be creative, and they're going to work with people. I think that Dilbert image is stuck in some people's heads. . . FLATOW: Yeah. Ms. COLLINS: And that's not engineering at all. FLATOW: No. Ms. COLLINS: And engineers - it's a very helping profession. When you listen to what the president is talking about in terms of infrastructure, revitalizing cities; you had the piece on about his work with the mayors; health care, energy, renewable resources, that's all engineering and it's all engineering solutions. And kids are really interested in that. They just don't know it's engineering. FLATOW: You know, I actually have an engineering degree. I went to school in engineering, and you're so right about that, is that you are so involved with taking courses in math and science and physics that you never had an idea where you're going to wind up or what you were working for. Ms. COLLINS: Right. And actually, there are a couple of very popular college-student programs now that back up what you say, absolutely. One of the fastest growing student organizations in this country is called Engineers Without Borders, like Doctors Without Borders. The college kids are given assignments, where they come up with sustainable solutions in developing communities. It might be a very simple water-pumping operation or filtration system. And so, they're really doing engineering early on in their college career. Another one is the Solar Decathlon, where college teams build houses with - using sustainable energy, and that also is wildly popular, and I think it gets to the, you know, point you're making, that the kids want to do engineering and they want to see what they're going to be able to do with it. And when it comes to the pre-college students, they know that something like engineering is going to take math and science, but what they don't know is, why is that worth it? What is the real application, and why, in the end, is it worth it? FLATOW: So, how successful were you yesterday? Ms. COLLINS: We have about 10,000 volunteers that reach about a million girls in kindergarten through 12th grade, and that's man and women as mentors, but we especially want to get women engineers out there. Study after study shows that particularly for girls, it's really important to have those role models. And one of the problems in engineering is sort of this, you know, Catch 22. When girls get to college, there aren't many women faculty in engineering. And as matter of fact, the Diversity and Innovation Caucus on the Hill next week with the Society of Women Engineers is sponsoring a briefing on that very topic and how to retain and advance women faculty in engineering. So, the idea is to present to girls role models and - so, they can see, yeah, I look like an engineer, to do hands-on activities with them. And one thing - we thought people always say, well, what are girl activities? What does that mean? It means it's hands-on; it means it's introducing girls to something new. They're not necessarily looking to increase their science and math knowledge, but they're looking to maybe try something new that's in a very comfortable space. And it's not about individual competition; it's about, you know, teamwork. . . FLATOW: Yeah. Ms. COLLINS: And you might compete as teams, but those make things a little more girl-friendly. FLATOW: Do you have women engineers to present to them as role models? Ms. COLLINS: Oh, yeah, absolutely we do. And women are very happy to go out and share. They understand the issues. So, I have to say, we also have to train them with the right kinds of messages, because if I send out a woman engineer who is of an age and who, back in her time in college, might have been only one of several women in the college engineering class, that day has sort of passed. . . (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: I only had one woman in my whole engineering class. Ms. COLLINS: Right. So, you know, girls today have pretty high expectations. And they're not going to face and don't intend to face the same barriers that, you know, some people have. So, we don't want to set up, you know, artificial expectations and sort of turn them off. We want them to be able to say, you know, this is for me, I can do it, and other people like me are going to do it. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Do you attract any boys while you're doing this also? Do they say, hey, well, if there are going to be more girls in engineering. . . (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Maybe I want to. . . Ms. COLLINS: I have three boys, none of whom are going into engineering. I've tried, but. . . (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. COLLINS: We do absolutely talk to boys as well. It's interesting. Right now for a project called Engineer Your Life - and if anybody out there has, particularly high-school students, thinking about what they might want to major in, it's EngineerYourLife. org. The boys who visit with our engineers tend to have some sense of what engineering is and even may already be saying, I think I want to be a mechanical engineer or civil engineer, which - somebody's gotten to them. When it comes to the girls, they are really much more of a blank slate in that way. They don't necessary know what engineering is and maybe - unless maybe they have a relative or a neighbor who is one. So, we have a little more work to do there. They haven't traditionally been encouraged, and we find guidance counselors don't know much about engineering. We all know the problems with the science and math teachers who haven't been trained in science and math, so they can't really advise kids. . . FLATOW: Yeah. Ms. COLLINS: On what engineering is like. So. . . FLATOW: Yeah. Well, good luck to you, and thank you for taking time to be with us. Ms. COLLINS: Well, thank you, Ira.

(Soundbite of whistling) SHAPIRO: Bonnie knows how to whistle. (Soundbite of whistling) SHAPIRO: Those notes are a symphony to the ears of primate researchers. They believe her musical abilities could lead to a greater understanding of how human speech evolved. Ms. ERIN STROMBERG (National Zoo): I think what makes it significant is that you can train apes to whistle, but no one actually trained her to do it. She decided to do it on her own. SHAPIRO: That's Erin Stromberg. She works in the National Zoo's Great Ape House, where she helps care for the orangutans. And by the way, it is pronounced orangutan. Ms. STROMBERG: As long as you don't say orangutang(ph) - with a G on the end -then you're pretty good. SHAPIRO: Stromberg helped publish a recent paper on Bonnie's talents. Researchers believe Bonnie was trying to imitate the sounds of zookeepers who whistled while they worked. Stromberg says Bonnie's ability to copy that sound is powerful evidence that apes can re-create the sounds of other species. Ms. STROMBERG: It's all about different verbalizations and sounds and how do they acquire them. SHAPIRO: So what's significant about Bonnie learning to whistle is not that she's able to do it\u2026 Ms. STROMBERG: Right. SHAPIRO: \u2026it's that she saw someone else do it and just picked it up. Ms. STROMBERG: Exactly. SHAPIRO: Bonnie the orangutan is 32 years old. She has dark orange hair and a big round belly, but she weighs in at a svelte 140 pounds. She lives in a big concrete enclosure with plenty of things for her to climb up on and swing down from. A large window lets spectators look in, and Bonnie looks right back at them. Ms. STROMBERG: She is a very feisty girl. She's very intelligent. SHAPIRO: And she's climbing right up here to the window. Hey, Bonnie. Very intense gaze. Ms. STROMBERG: Very inquisitive. Very inquisitive. SHAPIRO: Bonnie has been mimicking her zookeepers' action for years. She likes to sweep the floors and wash the windows, although she uses dirty rags to do it. Once she started whistling, researchers decided to test her gift for mimicking sounds. They asked Stromberg to whistle basic patterns to see if Bonnie could copy them. And it turns out it was easier for the ape than the human. Ms. STROMBERG: I'm actually not a good whistler, so\u2026 SHAPIRO: I'll confess. I'm not a very good whistler either. Honestly. I'm the wrong person to be doing this story. Ms. STROMBERG: Yeah. She's actually quite good at it. SHAPIRO: But not good enough to whistle a melody. Then again, neither can Stromberg. So the researchers kept it simple. Ms. STROMBERG: I would give a long whistle, and would she then in turn imitate me? Or if I gave a short whistle, would she then do a short whistle? And she would. She was pretty good at following what I was doing. SHAPIRO: If orangutans can whistle, could they conceivably some day learn to talk? Ms. STROMBERG: They don't have the correct vocal cords that humans do. SHAPIRO: Put this in perspective. Parrots whistle. Dolphins and whales vocalize. We've heard primates make all kinds of other noises. And they've been learning sign language for years. Why is this discovery significant? Ms. STROMBERG: I think what makes it significant is that something made her want to whistle, or at least try it out. And so she was to me challenging herself to do something else. SHAPIRO: Erin, it was great talking to you. Thanks a lot. Ms. STROMBERG: Thanks for stopping by. Have a good time at the zoo. SHAPIRO: Erin Stromberg is a research assistant at the National Zoo, and she helps take care of Bonnie the whistling orangutan. Given that you and I are both bad whistlers, I think on the count of three we should try in unison to make the best sound we can. All right? Ms. STROMBERG: I'm no good at it. SHAPIRO: Me neither. That's why this will work. All right? One, two, three. (Soundbite of whistle) Ms. STROMBERG: You are worse than I am.

Ms. STROMBERG: It's all about different verbalizations and sounds and how do they acquire them.  SHAPIRO: So what's significant about Bonnie learning to whistle is not that she's able to do it\u2026  Ms. STROMBERG: Right.  SHAPIRO: \u2026it's that she saw someone else do it and just picked it up.  Ms. STROMBERG: Exactly.  SHAPIRO: Bonnie the orangutan is 32 years old. She has dark orange hair and a big round belly, but she weighs in at a svelte 140 pounds. She lives in a big concrete enclosure with plenty of things for her to climb up on and swing down from. A large window lets spectators look in, and Bonnie looks right back at them.  Ms. STROMBERG: She is a very feisty girl. She's very intelligent.  SHAPIRO: And she's climbing right up here to the window. Hey, Bonnie. Very intense gaze.  Ms. STROMBERG: Very inquisitive. Very inquisitive.  SHAPIRO: Bonnie has been mimicking her zookeepers' action for years. She likes to sweep the floors and wash the windows, although she uses dirty rags to do it. Once she started whistling, researchers decided to test her gift for mimicking sounds. They asked Stromberg to whistle basic patterns to see if Bonnie could copy them. And it turns out it was easier for the ape than the human.  Ms. STROMBERG: I'm actually not a good whistler, so\u2026  SHAPIRO: I'll confess. I'm not a very good whistler either. Honestly. I'm the wrong person to be doing this story.  Ms. STROMBERG: Yeah. She's actually quite good at it.  SHAPIRO: But not good enough to whistle a melody. Then again, neither can Stromberg. So the researchers kept it simple.  Ms. STROMBERG: I would give a long whistle, and would she then in turn imitate me? Or if I gave a short whistle, would she then do a short whistle? And she would. She was pretty good at following what I was doing.  SHAPIRO: If orangutans can whistle, could they conceivably some day learn to talk?  Ms. STROMBERG: They don't have the correct vocal cords that humans do.  SHAPIRO: Put this in perspective. Parrots whistle. Dolphins and whales vocalize. We've heard primates make all kinds of other noises. And they've been learning sign language for years. Why is this discovery significant?  Ms. STROMBERG: I think what makes it significant is that something made her want to whistle, or at least try it out. And so she was to me challenging herself to do something else.  SHAPIRO: Erin, it was great talking to you. Thanks a lot.  Ms. STROMBERG: Thanks for stopping by. Have a good time at the zoo.  SHAPIRO: Erin Stromberg is a research assistant at the National Zoo, and she helps take care of Bonnie the whistling orangutan.  Given that you and I are both bad whistlers, I think on the count of three we should try in unison to make the best sound we can. All right?  Ms. STROMBERG: I'm no good at it.  SHAPIRO: Me neither. That's why this will work. All right? One, two, three.  (Soundbite of whistle)  Ms. STROMBERG: You are worse than I am.  (Soundbite of laughter)  (Soundbite of song)  Unidentified Woman: (Singing) Anyone can whistle, any old day, easy\u2026  SHAPIRO: To see Bonnie whistling, along with video of her and her orangutan boyfriend Kyle, just swing on over to npr. org.  (Soundbite of music)  Unidentified Woman: (Singing) \u2026though someone tell me why can't I.

These engineers are at Columbia University in New York, and they want to know how ell the cables on suspension bridges are holding up. They're working on what they hope will be a more accurate way of telling when a failure is imminent. Their study is relevant for bridges anywhere in the world, but this project has particular importance to people in New York. NPR's Joe Palca has our report. JOE PALCA: There are 10 suspension bridges in the greater New York City area. There's the Bear Mountain Bridge, the Mid-Hudson Bridge, the Triborough Bridge, the Manhattan Bridge, the Williamsburg Bridge, the George Washington Bridge, the Throgs Neck Bridge, the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge, the Verrazano Bridge, and, of course, the granddaddy of them all, the one I'm standing on now: the Brooklyn Bridge. These bridges were all built to last, but none of them will last forever. How long they'll last is a question they're trying to answer about eight miles north of the Brooklyn Bridge in a cavernous room on the campus of Columbia University. Professor RAIMONDO BETTI (Civil Engineering, Columbia University): The uniqueness of these bridges is that some of them are over 100 years old. PALCA: That's Raimondo Betti. He's a professor of civil engineering and engineering mechanics at Columbia University. Betti is in charge of the program to build and test a new sensor system that will measure the health of bridge cables. Prof. BETTI: One of the problems that these bridges have is that there is corrosion inside these cables. And so the question arise: What is the strength of the cables after 100 years of service? PALCA: Most suspension bridges share the same basic design: giant cables are strung between two towers and are anchored to the shore on either side. A roadway is suspended below the cables. The cables themselves are bundles of thousands of thick steel strands. Right now, cables are inspected visually once or twice a year. That's okay, but obviously, a rapidly developing problem can be missed. Raimondo Betti's idea is to embed tiny sensors inside the cable bundles to track the cables' condition round the clock. Now, it's one thing to put a sensor inside a cable. It's another to know whether it's giving you reliable information. So Betti and his colleagues have built themselves a large glass-walled chamber, and inside they've put a 20-foot length of bridge cable with their sensors embedded in it. Prof. BETTI: It's an exact replica of a 20-inch diameter cable. Now the Williamsburg Bridge, the Manhattan Bridge, those are bridges that have similar size. PALCA: Over the next six months, they'll record data from the sensors as they bake the cable with heat lamps and douse it with water, the kinds of things a New York bridge cable might be exposed to. Prof. BETTI: We are trying to create conditions that are more aggressive than the one out there, because otherwise the system will not be tested. And six months from now, we'd open the cable. PALCA: Open the cable and see how well the data they recorded matched the actual damage to the cable. Of course, even if Betti's sensor system works as he hopes, it doesn't solve the problem of what to do if a cable on a bridge connecting, say, Brooklyn and Manhattan is showing dangerous signs of weakness. Prof. BETTI: It's impossible to replace a bridge like that in a densely-populated area like New York City. You don't have the luxury of saying, I'm closing the bridge for five years, the traffic will go somewhere else. PALCA: It will take some clever engineering and a lot of money to replace a cable. The new sensor system could let them know when that's absolutely necessary. Joe Palca, NPR News.  STEVE INSKEEP, host:  Some engineers are working on another mystery.

It says they promise never to seek out the donor's name. But as NPR's Joseph Shapiro reports, a growing number of parents and children want to know more about their extended hidden families. JOSEPH SHAPIRO: Donor siblings - that's the term for people who are conceived with the egg or sperm of a common donor. Every donor is given a number and that number is public information. There's a place on the Internet where people can share these numbers and voluntarily seek out donor siblings. It's called The Donor Sibling Registry and it was started a little over eight years ago by Wendy Kramer. Ms. WENDY KRAMER (Donor Sibling Registry): And I posted a very short message that said I'm the mother of an awesome 10-year-old donor child. I know that he has at least three donor siblings and would love to contact them. We are looking for donor 1058 from California Cryobank. SHAPIRO: Today, Kramer's son, Ryan, knows of six half sisters, all conceived with the sperm of donor 1058. Two years ago, Wendy Kramer and her son flew from Colorado to New York to meet one of them, a girl named Anna. Ms. KRAMER: And the meeting was very emotional. It's kind of weird, I mean, I know Anna is nothing to me. I'm not related to her. But when I saw this little girl who had parts of my son in her, there was an immediate connection with her and with her mom. I mean, we hugged each other and we cried. SHAPIRO: A few weeks later, a Mother's Day card came in the mail from Anna. Ms. KRAMER: And on the front of it, it was M. O. M. and it said, My Other Mother. And I think Anna as a 13-year-old at the time, she was also trying to define -well, wait a minute, what are we two each other? So, Ryan is my brother, but what are you and how - you know, we were all just kind of trying to figure out what does this all mean and how do we go forward? SHAPIRO: They're not alone. More than 6,000 people have been linked through the Donor Sibling Registry. It's a self-selected group of people who do want to find each other. Most families that use assisted reproduction don't seek out donor siblings. The ones who do are usually single mothers like Wendy Kramer or lesbian couples. Tabitha Freeman is a researcher at the University of Cambridge in England, and she's been studying families on the Donor Registry. Ms. TABITHA FREEMAN (University of Cambridge, England Researcher): It's a new form of family. It's not, perhaps, what people traditionally understand by families, sort of mom, dad, child. And yes, they do describe each other as brothers and sisters. SHAPIRO: It's often assumed that people seek out donor information to learn about their own medical history. But that's not what Freeman found in the study published in the current issue of the journal, Human Reproduction. Instead, people said mainly they were curious - that was Wendy Kramer's reason. Or they wanted to help their child get a sense of identity. In Freeman's survey, the average number of related donor siblings who found each other was five. But some of those on the registry have 20, 50 or even in one case, 120 donor siblings. Ms. FREEMAN: I think when you get to a certain number it's just a very different understanding of what a sibling is. So, we do need research on this sort of bonds between these larger numbers. SHAPIRO: One day last summer, Wendy Kramer logged onto her computer. Ms. KRAMER: Ryan and I were sitting in the living room. I had my laptop. He was sitting on the other couch. I signed on and I went, Ryan, and he knew that tone of voice, and he just looked at me and he said, boy or a girl? How old?

I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. Anthropologists feel pretty lucky when they find a fossilized bone from a human ancestor. Even more unusual is a fossil footprint. Scientists have now discovered not one, but two sets of such footprints. They were left in the mud 1. 5 million years ago. NPR's Christopher Joyce has the story. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: It was a long way to go for fossils, a four-day drive across a desert in Kenya, then months in blazing sun digging through dirt. But the day in 2006 when anthropologist Brian Richmond and his crew found the fossil footprints, they knew they'd made one of the rarest of discoveries. Dr. BRIAN RICHMOND (Anthropologist, George Washington University): We looked at this, and at first, we had to look at each other, like is - do you think - this is a human footprint, isn't it? You know, and we almost wanted to have our - we wanted to have our colleagues look and tell us that what we were seeing is, in fact, true. And we couldn't believe it. It was really exciting. JOYCE: Exciting because of the extreme age of that layer of sediment, 1. 5 million years. Richmond, from George Washington University, knew there was only one set of human-like footprints older than that. They'd been found 30 years ago, but they were from a much more primitive ancestor. These new prints looked, well, like Richmond's own footprint. Dr. RICHMOND: These footprints are the earliest footprints of early humans. JOYCE: They probably belonged to a species called Homo erectus or a close relative, species that eventually evolved into us, and apparently, they looked a lot like us. Dr. RICHMOND: The prints match a men's shoe size of about nine, which gives you a height of about five feet, nine inches. JOYCE: The prints had been laid by someone walking through mud that had dried and then been washed over with sand and naturally preserved. The shape of the prints and their spacing leads Richmond to conclude that Homo erectus could walk the walk that humans do. Dr. RICHMOND: Here we have really compelling evidence that sure enough, they were walking with a long stride, they had an arch in the foot the way we have, and the arch gives us a spring in our step, in a way, and actually makes our walking more efficient. JOYCE: When the team went back to the dig in 2007, they got another surprise. Digging in a level about 15 feet higher, they found another set of Homo erectus footprints. They calculated that they'd been made about 1,000 years after the first set. In all, they now had about 20 prints. John Harris, an anthropologist from Rutgers University who led the dig, says the odds of finding two sets 1,000 years apart are off the charts. Dr. JOHN HARRIS (Anthropologist, Rutgers University): It's just incredible. I'd never excavated anything like this before. JOYCE: There were lots of other prints there, too: antelope, zebra, even a form of lion. The place had been a river valley near a lake, a hopping place, says Harris, but the climate was drying out with greater distances between trees and water. Evolving a more efficient walk would have been a big advantage. Dr. HARRIS: It shows a creature that was capable of increasing its home range. So they would've had to have moved over greater areas of the ancient landscape to sustain themselves in terms of their food requirements. JOYCE: The footprint's shape and the pronounced arch suggests that this creature, like us, had a spring ligament in the foot. That ligament absorbs energy and then returns it as the walker moves forward. That, says anthropologist Dan Lieberman at Harvard University, suggests that a hominid like Homo erectus was not just a good walker, but a runner, because he had to be. Dr. DAN LIEBERMAN (Anthropologist, Harvard University): Imagine you are a Homo erectus, and you're hungry, and you want to kill something for dinner. The weapons available to you are incredibly primitive. So, one thing that early hominids might have included as part of their repertoire of hunting strategies was to run animals in the heat. JOYCE: Until, Lieberman says, the prey collapsed. The footprints are described in tomorrow's issue of the journal, Science. The team will return this summer, and Richmond says he can't wait. Dr. RICHMOND: It's almost an emotional kind of connection when you realize that the last time someone stood in that spot where you were standing at the moment was 1. 5 million years ago, and it may have even been a direct ancestor.

(Soundbite of music) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. I sometimes have a hard time making decisions, even unimportant ones, which is why I wanted to talk with Jonah Lehrer, the author of the new book, \"How We Decide. \" The book reports on what neuroscientists, with the help of brain imaging, are learning about how the human mind makes decisions. Jonah Lehrer is editor-at-large for Seed Magazine and the author of \"Proust was a Neuroscientist. \" He edits the \"Mind Matters\" blog for Scientific American and writes his own blog, \"The Frontal Cortex. \" Jonah Lehrer, welcome to FRESH AIR. Now, you describe yourself as pathologically indecisive. I relate to that. Mr. JONAH LEHRER (Author, \"How We Decide\"): Yes. Guilty as charged. (Soundbite of laughter) GROSS: And so as an example, tell us about the decision you were struggling to make that led to this book, this really important decision? Mr. LEHRER: The revelation occurred in the cereal aisle of the supermarket. I was sent to the supermarket with what seemed like simple instructions, which was buy a box of Cheerios. And it wasn't until I got the supermarket that I realized that there were 20 different kinds of Cheerios. There were original Cheerios. There were honey-nut Cheerios, apple-cinnamon, multigrain, the yogurt-with-the-berry thing, and then of course there are all the generic varieties of Cheerios. And so I found myself spending literally a half an hour, 30 minutes, in the cereal aisle of the supermarket, trying to choose between boxes of Cheerios. And that's when I realized I had a problem, and I became really curious as to what was actually happening inside my head while I was struggling to make a decision. GROSS: Now, were you struggling to make this decision for your own breakfast or for somebody else's? Mr. LEHRER: It was for my breakfast and my wife's breakfast. So it was clearly a very weighty decision. You know, I won't bore you by discussing how hard it is for me to choose floss and toothpaste. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. LEHRER: So this is something I struggle with every day. It's a classic case of paralysis by analysis. GROSS: Which means what? Mr. LEHRER: Which means I'm simply thinking too much in the supermarket. I come up with long lists of reasons to prefer honey-nut Cheerios, and then I look at the apple-cinnamon Cheerios, and then I come up with long lists of reasons to prefer apple-cinnamon Cheerios, and it goes on and on like that. I'm stuck in this loop of self-consciousness where I come up with reason after reason after reason. And so it was really that very basic, everyday failure that really first got me interested in the subject of decision-making. GROSS: Now, one of the things you learned for sure from writing your book is that sometimes too much information is a really bad thing when it comes to making a decision, and that's part of the predicament you were in. You had all these different brands, and they each have a certain, like, topping and a certain amount of sugar, and\u2026 Mr. LEHRER: And there's price. I mean there are so many variables to consider. GROSS: Right, right, yeah. So is that - was that part of your problem in the supermarket aisle, and why is too much information so paralyzing? Mr. LEHRER: Yeah, that was definitely, I think, a big part of my problem. And I think the reason too much information is paralyzing ultimately gets back to the brain and the way the brain is built and the fact that our prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that's responsible for these kinds of deliberate, rational decisions - when we try to think through our breakfast options -that's a pretty feeble part of the brain. It's kind of depressing to hear that, but it's actually a relatively limited and bounded part of the brain. It can only hold about seven pieces of information in the prefrontal cortex at any given moment. So when you try to think through, even a decision as banal as choosing a breakfast cereal, you can very quickly overwhelm your prefrontal cortex. GROSS: Wow. Now let me just ask you, before we get to other things that you report on in your book, if you were making that decision in that same supermarket aisle now, knowing what you know now about the brain and decision-making, how would you do it differently? Mr. LEHRER: I still take a little too long in the cereal aisle, to be perfectly honest. But now what I try to do is I try to honestly pay attention to what I refer to in the book as the emotional brain, that part of my brain that has a better understanding of what I actually want to eat for breakfast. So I try to really pay close attention to that, and you know, and eavesdrop on my, you know, on my own brain and try not to pay so much attention to the reasons I'm generating, on the fly, and actually listen closer to my feelings. GROSS: You write in your book, though, you know, we're supposed to be rational creatures. Plato wrote about how we're rational creatures, and we should be making rational decisions, but you learned that that's not exactly how decision-making works, that there's a lot of emotional parts of the brain that come into play when making an intelligent decision. Can you talk a little bit about that part of the brain and how it helps inform decision-making? Mr. LEHRER: Well, Plato had this great metaphor for the mind, which was that there's this rational charioteer, and it's his job to oversee these emotional horses who tend to run wild, and you know, this is - you know, reason's in the seat, reason's in the driver's seat, and we make the best decisions when we trust the rational charioteer. I think most scientists would modify that metaphor a bit and say, well, it's not quite a, you know, rider with reigns on horses. It's more like a rider trying to control an elephant, and the elephant is the emotional brain and we have much less control over what we actually do than we think we do. It's sort of the illusion of rationality, where we're great at rationalizing decisions, but we're not quite so rational. And so what I refer to an emotional brain, and what scientists tend to refer to as the emotional brain or limbic system, is the collection of brain areas scattered throughout the cortex -includes the amygdala, the insula, the nucleus accumbens, the ventral striatum - brain areas that tend to traffic in Dopamine, and they generate all sorts of subtle feeling that drive our behavior, even when we're not aware of them. And I think one of the best examples of this comes from the work of a neurologist named Antonio Demasio, who in the early 1980s was studying patients who, because of a brain tumor, lost the ability to experience their emotions. So they didn't feel the everyday feelings of fear and pleasure. And you'd think, if you were Plato, that these people would be philosopher-kings, that they would be perfectly rational creatures, they'd make the best set of decisions possible. And instead, what you find is that they are like me in the cereal aisle, that they're pathologically indecisive, that they would spend all day trying to figure out where to eat lunch. They'd spend five hours choosing between a blue pen or a black pen or a red pen, that all these everyday decisions we take for granted, they couldn't make. And that's because they were missing these subtle, visceral signals that were telling them to just choose the black pen or to eat the tuna fish sandwich or whatever. And then when we're cut off from these emotional signals, the most basic decisions become all but impossible. GROSS: Now brain imaging is being used to help scientists, help neurologists, understand the process of decision-making and which parts of the brain come into play when decisions are being made. Are there parts of the brain that the scientists are beginning to understand play a significant role in the decision-making process? Mr. LEHRER: I think one thing that's surprised scientists, that's become visible in brain scanners, is what's sometimes referred to as the vulcanization of the brain. The fact that there are - at any given moment, there's a tremendous argument happening inside your cortex, that it's not simply one brain area that reacts to one thing. That you know, for example, choosing what to buy activates this emotional tug of war inside your head. That some brain areas respond to the pleasure of getting something new, of buying that new red sweater, and other brain areas react to the pain of having to spend money. And you know, so this decision that seems like such a simple, easy decision, that when you look under the surface of the brain, there's actually this tug of war taking place, this argument taking place. So I think that's one thing that brain scanners really allowed us to see, that decisions often result from this argument happening inside the head. GROSS: And is there a part of the brain that's responsible for integrating all the different information that you're getting from the different parts of your brain - the part of the brain that wants to buy the sweater, the part of your brain that thinks you're spending too much, the part of your brain that thinks maybe it doesn't look that good on me anyways? Mr. LEHRER: In the case of that shopping example, and this is a general truism, it seems to be the prefrontal cortex. It seems to be different parts of the frontal lobes, like the orbital frontal cortex, that are responsible for integrating these emotions, and you know, and helping you integrate them into your decision-making, you know, into what you actually choose to buy. But I think one crucial thing to do in decision-making is not to force a settlement onto the argument. I think what we too often do is we tend to shut off different brain areas and kind of impose certainty from the top down, and I think that's a bad thing, that it's sometimes disquieting for us to have these emotional arguments taking place inside our head, to not know if we should actually buy the red sweater. And so I think what we too often do is turn off brain areas and ignore brain areas that are trying to tell us something. That you know, these feelings coming from the unconscious, percolating up from below, they're signals that are trying to tell us something. And I think too often, we shut them off and ignore them just because we actually really want to buy the red sweater. GROSS: My guest is science journalist Jonah Lehrer. His new book is called \"How We Decide. \" We'll talk more after our break. This is FRESH AIR. (Soundbite of music) GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is science writer Jonah Lehrer, and we're talking about his new book, \"How We Decide,\" which is basically about the neurology of decision-making. One of the things you write about in your book is Dopamine, and many of us know that Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that's related to Parkinson's Disease. But you're not writing about Parkinson's, and you're not even writing about Dopamine in terms of movement, and the symptom associated with a lack of Dopamine in Parkinson's Disease is an inability to move or a twitching. So where does Dopamine come into play in the process of decision-making? Mr. LEHRER: It comes into play a lot. It's one of the crucial neurotransmitters behind decision-making. I talk about Dopamine. I think Dopamine is often associated with Parkinson's and is also associated with stuff like sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. You know, it's the neurotransmitter responsible for all those feelings we probably shouldn't indulge. It gets tossed around a lot when people talk about stuff like cocaine and sex. But Dopamine's even more important than that. It also seems to modulate many of our feelings, from the pleasure of eating chocolate cake or a crack high to feelings of fear and disgust. So it, in many respects, is one of the key neurotransmitters of emotion in general. And I think when you talk about decision-making, that's part of what makes it so important. And I think there's also been a lot of really interesting work, much of it done by a scientist named Wolfram Schultz at Cambridge University, that have shown how Dopamine neurons react in detail to the real world. GROSS: Can you tell us about one of those studies? Mr. LEHRER: His experiments observe a really elegant protocol. He'll monitor individual Dopamine neurons in the brain of a monkey, and he'll show that at first, the neurons respond to a reward, to a squirt of juice. So if you give the monkey a squirt of juice, these Dopamine neurons will fire, and the monkey experiences the pleasure of getting a squirt of apple juice. That's the reward. But these neurons quickly adapt to the pleasure. So they quickly stop firing. That, you know, that makes perfect sense. You have an iPod. It makes you happy for a day or two, and then it stops, you know, giving you squirts of joy every time you look at the iPod. We adapt to these kind of hedonic pleasures. But what Wolfram Schultz found is that if you then play a bell before giving the monkey a squirt of juice, the Dopamine neurons will fire whenever you play the bell. And if you flash a light before playing a bell before giving a squirt a juice, they'll fire whenever you flash a light, and if you play a song before flashing a light before ringing the bell, etcetera, etcetera, the Dopamine neurons will always try to predict the reward. So they're called prediction neurons. Their job is to predict the first event that signals a reward is coming, a squirt of juice is coming. And so you can begin to understand how these neurons are so important in terms of allowing us to make sense of reality, in terms of finding the patterns and correlations and causations that allow us to actually figure out what's going to happen. And most importantly from the perspective of evolution, figure out when our squirts of juice are going to arrive - try to make sense of those rewards. You know, and so you can begin to understand why they're so important for decision-making in terms of allowing us to make decisions that allow us to maximize our rewards. GROSS: Another interesting study pertaining to Dopamine had to do with people who develop gambling addictions. Tell us about that one. Mr. LEHRER: I talked to a woman named Ann Klinestiver, who she was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1998, and she was put on, like many Parkinsonian patients, put on a drug called a Dopamine agonist. And the purpose of these drugs is to increase the amount of Dopamine in the brain to help compensate for the massive cell loss of Dopamine neurons in the back of the brain, the part of the brain that controls bodily movement. One of the common side effects of these drugs is gambling compulsions. Some studies estimate that as many as 10 to 15 percent of patients on these drugs develop some sort of gambling problem. And in the case of Ann, it's a very sad story. It really ruined her life. She lost her entire life savings, more than $250,000. Her husband left her. It was a very traumatic experience. And you know, one of the saddest parts of the story to me is that it never occurred to her that it might be her medication that was doing this. She thought it was that she just all of a sudden discovered this thing she couldn't control. As soon as she was taken off her Dopamine agonist in 2004, the compulsion disappeared within the week, and she was all of a sudden able to control her slot-machine habit. She had a compulsion for slot machines. She would spend 18 hours at a time putting quarters into one-armed bandits. And I think one of the reasons slot machines and games of chance in general are so addictive is because they hijack the Dopamine system. The Dopamine system's great at finding patterns. It can find the pattern that predicts a squirt of juice, but it's terrible at dealing with random systems. It's terrible at dealing with that random-number generator inside the slot machine because it generates a consistently surprising reward. So even though there's no pattern to find, we can't help but search for a pattern. GROSS: So explain a little bit more why taking this Dopamine-related drug would turn somebody, would possibly turn somebody into a compulsive gambler. Mr. LEHRER: Well because what it does is - the surviving Dopamine neurons in mid-brain, the part of your brain that seems to respond to those kinds of rewards in a casino, those kinds of rewards generated by, you know, the clanging coin of a slot machine when you actually get some money in return, those neurons were - became very saturated with neurotransmitters. So those Dopamine neurons simply had too much Dopamine. So when Ann got a reward from a slot machine, when she got some coins in return, the end result was this surge of emotion, this surge of Dopamine that signaled something really good had happened. And so she became transfixed by this random system. Her brain was literally trying to figure it out, in essence. It was trying to find the pattern that predicted the clanging coins, that predicted when she would win in the casino. But the reality, of course, is that there's no pattern to be found. You know, that no matter how hard her Dopamine neurons tried, they would never find the sequence of events that predicted the payout. But because they were so saturated with neurotransmitter because she was on this Dopamine agonist drug, she simply couldn't walk away. GROSS: You know, you point out that our brains weren't designed to deal with the amount of information that we're confronted with now and the number of choices that we're confronted with. You say that some scientists think that we can deal with, say, four distinct variables at any one time, and others say maybe between five and nine. But still that's a pretty low number of variables, considering the difficult choices that we have to make now and the options that often present themselves, both in silly, trivial and important, profound decisions. So do you recommend trying to block out some of those variables to make a decision possible? Mr. LEHRER: You know, blocking out might not be the best option, but I think we should definitely be conscious of the fact that we have limited machines, that our brain isn't omnipotent and that it can only take in so much information at any one time. One of the studies I talk about in the book concerns a study done by a Stanford psychologists who - they had two groups of people. One group they had memorize a two-digit number; the other group they had memorize a seven-digit number. Then they marched these two groups down the hall and gave them a choice between two snacks. One snack was a rich, gooey slice of chocolate cake. The other snack was a responsible fruit salad. The people who memorized a two-digit number were twice as likely to choose the fruit salad as the people who memorized the seven-digit number, who were twice as likely to choose the chocolate cake. And the reason is that those extra five digits - doesn't seem like very much information at all, just five extra numbers - so overwhelmed the prefrontal cortex that there wasn't enough processing power leftover to exert self-control. So that gives us a sense of just how limited in capacity our brain actually is and I think points to the fact that we should absolutely be aware of these limitations. So that doesn't necessarily mean, you know, you have to block out information and never use Google. I think it just means that we should be aware of this and that if you've had a hard day at work or if you're trying to - you know, if you just spent all morning on a crossword puzzle, then be aware that your willpower's going to be a little bit weaker, that especially these rational faculties of the brain are very limited in capacity. GROSS: You know, in addition to writing about science in books and for the Boston Globe, you have a blog and write about all kinds of interesting things on there. What has gotten the most reaction of everything that you've written about? Mr. LEHRER: I think probably - this is probably a year ago - I wrote about a series of experiments involving wine. And I've since learned about this wonderful subculture on the Internet of wine aficionados. And this experiment concerned a experiment done by a scientist at the University of Bordeaux, and it was done on wine experts, people who were going to school to learn about wine. And he showed that basically you can trick these wine experts into believing all sorts of silly stuff, that you could give them a white wine that was dyed red, and they would describe this white wine in terms of, you know, they'd talk about its crushed red fruit and how it smelled like blackberries and full of tannins. And you could give them a cheap wine, but if you served it in an expensive bottle, it would be called refined and elegant. And these basic findings wouldn't be surprising to a psychologist. We're doing this kind of stuff all the time. The brain is constantly warping its sensations to reflect our expectations. That in a sense we, you know, we see what we want to see and taste what we want to taste and disregard the rest. And yet somehow when you talk about it in terms of wine, people become very sensitive. GROSS: You're very good at translating science, and I'm wondering how you got interested in science. I think a lot of people would probably complain that science isn't emphasized as much as they'd like in schools anymore. How did you realize that you loved science? Mr. LEHRER: You know, I've always loved science, and I always thought I'd be a scientist. And I worked for several year in a really wonderful lab, the lab of Ayr Kendell(ph) at Columbia. I was just a technician, you know, the manual laborers of science. You make the gels, and you do the PCRs and stuff like that. And one of the things I learned from that was that I was a very bad scientist. The post-doc I worked for, who remains a very close friend, used to joke that I excelled at experimental failure, that I found new ways to make his experiments not work. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. LEHRER: And I think that, you know, I realized that as much as I love science and the ideas of science, I didn't quite have the discipline. I didn't love the process. I didn't love the actual experimentation. I wasn't good at taking a very complex question and finding ways to parse it into very testable questions. So that's when I first got interested in science writing and the idea of translating science. Because as much as I love the ideas of science, and most days, I still can't believe that someone lets me do this for a living - you know, just getting to talk to scientists is as good as it gets - I found that I wasn't good at the day-to-day science. And I think all great scientists really excel - they don't just love the ideas. They also love the manual labor of science. GROSS: Jonah Lehrer, thanks so much for talking with us.

(Soundbite of music)  GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is science writer Jonah Lehrer, and we're talking about his new book, \"How We Decide,\" which is basically about the neurology of decision-making.  One of the things you write about in your book is Dopamine, and many of us know that Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that's related to Parkinson's Disease. But you're not writing about Parkinson's, and you're not even writing about Dopamine in terms of movement, and the symptom associated with a lack of Dopamine in Parkinson's Disease is an inability to move or a twitching.  So where does Dopamine come into play in the process of decision-making?  Mr. LEHRER: It comes into play a lot. It's one of the crucial neurotransmitters behind decision-making. I talk about Dopamine. I think Dopamine is often associated with Parkinson's and is also associated with stuff like sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. You know, it's the neurotransmitter responsible for all those feelings we probably shouldn't indulge. It gets tossed around a lot when people talk about stuff like cocaine and sex.  But Dopamine's even more important than that. It also seems to modulate many of our feelings, from the pleasure of eating chocolate cake or a crack high to feelings of fear and disgust.  So it, in many respects, is one of the key neurotransmitters of emotion in general. And I think when you talk about decision-making, that's part of what makes it so important. And I think there's also been a lot of really interesting work, much of it done by a scientist named Wolfram Schultz at Cambridge University, that have shown how Dopamine neurons react in detail to the real world.  GROSS: Can you tell us about one of those studies?  Mr. LEHRER: His experiments observe a really elegant protocol. He'll monitor individual Dopamine neurons in the brain of a monkey, and he'll show that at first, the neurons respond to a reward, to a squirt of juice.  So if you give the monkey a squirt of juice, these Dopamine neurons will fire, and the monkey experiences the pleasure of getting a squirt of apple juice. That's the reward. But these neurons quickly adapt to the pleasure. So they quickly stop firing.  That, you know, that makes perfect sense. You have an iPod. It makes you happy for a day or two, and then it stops, you know, giving you squirts of joy every time you look at the iPod. We adapt to these kind of hedonic pleasures.  But what Wolfram Schultz found is that if you then play a bell before giving the monkey a squirt of juice, the Dopamine neurons will fire whenever you play the bell. And if you flash a light before playing a bell before giving a squirt a juice, they'll fire whenever you flash a light, and if you play a song before flashing a light before ringing the bell, etcetera, etcetera, the Dopamine neurons will always try to predict the reward.  So they're called prediction neurons. Their job is to predict the first event that signals a reward is coming, a squirt of juice is coming. And so you can begin to understand how these neurons are so important in terms of allowing us to make sense of reality, in terms of finding the patterns and correlations and causations that allow us to actually figure out what's going to happen. And most importantly from the perspective of evolution, figure out when our squirts of juice are going to arrive - try to make sense of those rewards.  You know, and so you can begin to understand why they're so important for decision-making in terms of allowing us to make decisions that allow us to maximize our rewards.  GROSS: Another interesting study pertaining to Dopamine had to do with people who develop gambling addictions. Tell us about that one.  Mr. LEHRER: I talked to a woman named Ann Klinestiver, who she was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1998, and she was put on, like many Parkinsonian patients, put on a drug called a Dopamine agonist. And the purpose of these drugs is to increase the amount of Dopamine in the brain to help compensate for the massive cell loss of Dopamine neurons in the back of the brain, the part of the brain that controls bodily movement.  One of the common side effects of these drugs is gambling compulsions. Some studies estimate that as many as 10 to 15 percent of patients on these drugs develop some sort of gambling problem. And in the case of Ann, it's a very sad story. It really ruined her life. She lost her entire life savings, more than $250,000. Her husband left her. It was a very traumatic experience. And you know, one of the saddest parts of the story to me is that it never occurred to her that it might be her medication that was doing this. She thought it was that she just all of a sudden discovered this thing she couldn't control.  As soon as she was taken off her Dopamine agonist in 2004, the compulsion disappeared within the week, and she was all of a sudden able to control her slot-machine habit. She had a compulsion for slot machines. She would spend 18 hours at a time putting quarters into one-armed bandits. And I think one of the reasons slot machines and games of chance in general are so addictive is because they hijack the Dopamine system.  The Dopamine system's great at finding patterns. It can find the pattern that predicts a squirt of juice, but it's terrible at dealing with random systems. It's terrible at dealing with that random-number generator inside the slot machine because it generates a consistently surprising reward.  So even though there's no pattern to find, we can't help but search for a pattern.  GROSS: So explain a little bit more why taking this Dopamine-related drug would turn somebody, would possibly turn somebody into a compulsive gambler.  Mr. LEHRER: Well because what it does is - the surviving Dopamine neurons in mid-brain, the part of your brain that seems to respond to those kinds of rewards in a casino, those kinds of rewards generated by, you know, the clanging coin of a slot machine when you actually get some money in return, those neurons were - became very saturated with neurotransmitters. So those Dopamine neurons simply had too much Dopamine.  So when Ann got a reward from a slot machine, when she got some coins in return, the end result was this surge of emotion, this surge of Dopamine that signaled something really good had happened. And so she became transfixed by this random system.  Her brain was literally trying to figure it out, in essence. It was trying to find the pattern that predicted the clanging coins, that predicted when she would win in the casino.  But the reality, of course, is that there's no pattern to be found. You know, that no matter how hard her Dopamine neurons tried, they would never find the sequence of events that predicted the payout. But because they were so saturated with neurotransmitter because she was on this Dopamine agonist drug, she simply couldn't walk away.  GROSS: You know, you point out that our brains weren't designed to deal with the amount of information that we're confronted with now and the number of choices that we're confronted with.  You say that some scientists think that we can deal with, say, four distinct variables at any one time, and others say maybe between five and nine. But still that's a pretty low number of variables, considering the difficult choices that we have to make now and the options that often present themselves, both in silly, trivial and important, profound decisions.  So do you recommend trying to block out some of those variables to make a decision possible?  Mr. LEHRER: You know, blocking out might not be the best option, but I think we should definitely be conscious of the fact that we have limited machines, that our brain isn't omnipotent and that it can only take in so much information at any one time.  One of the studies I talk about in the book concerns a study done by a Stanford psychologists who - they had two groups of people. One group they had memorize a two-digit number; the other group they had memorize a seven-digit number. Then they marched these two groups down the hall and gave them a choice between two snacks.  One snack was a rich, gooey slice of chocolate cake. The other snack was a responsible fruit salad. The people who memorized a two-digit number were twice as likely to choose the fruit salad as the people who memorized the seven-digit number, who were twice as likely to choose the chocolate cake. And the reason is that those extra five digits - doesn't seem like very much information at all, just five extra numbers - so overwhelmed the prefrontal cortex that there wasn't enough processing power leftover to exert self-control.  So that gives us a sense of just how limited in capacity our brain actually is and I think points to the fact that we should absolutely be aware of these limitations.  So that doesn't necessarily mean, you know, you have to block out information and never use Google. I think it just means that we should be aware of this and that if you've had a hard day at work or if you're trying to - you know, if you just spent all morning on a crossword puzzle, then be aware that your willpower's going to be a little bit weaker, that especially these rational faculties of the brain are very limited in capacity.  GROSS: You know, in addition to writing about science in books and for the Boston Globe, you have a blog and write about all kinds of interesting things on there. What has gotten the most reaction of everything that you've written about?  Mr. LEHRER: I think probably - this is probably a year ago - I wrote about a series of experiments involving wine. And I've since learned about this wonderful subculture on the Internet of wine aficionados. And this experiment concerned a experiment done by a scientist at the University of Bordeaux, and it was done on wine experts, people who were going to school to learn about wine. And he showed that basically you can trick these wine experts into believing all sorts of silly stuff, that you could give them a white wine that was dyed red, and they would describe this white wine in terms of, you know, they'd talk about its crushed red fruit and how it smelled like blackberries and full of tannins.  And you could give them a cheap wine, but if you served it in an expensive bottle, it would be called refined and elegant. And these basic findings wouldn't be surprising to a psychologist. We're doing this kind of stuff all the time. The brain is constantly warping its sensations to reflect our expectations. That in a sense we, you know, we see what we want to see and taste what we want to taste and disregard the rest. And yet somehow when you talk about it in terms of wine, people become very sensitive.  GROSS: You're very good at translating science, and I'm wondering how you got interested in science. I think a lot of people would probably complain that science isn't emphasized as much as they'd like in schools anymore. How did you realize that you loved science?  Mr. LEHRER: You know, I've always loved science, and I always thought I'd be a scientist. And I worked for several year in a really wonderful lab, the lab of Ayr Kendell(ph) at Columbia. I was just a technician, you know, the manual laborers of science. You make the gels, and you do the PCRs and stuff like that. And one of the things I learned from that was that I was a very bad scientist.  The post-doc I worked for, who remains a very close friend, used to joke that I excelled at experimental failure, that I found new ways to make his experiments not work.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. LEHRER: And I think that, you know, I realized that as much as I love science and the ideas of science, I didn't quite have the discipline. I didn't love the process. I didn't love the actual experimentation. I wasn't good at taking a very complex question and finding ways to parse it into very testable questions.  So that's when I first got interested in science writing and the idea of translating science. Because as much as I love the ideas of science, and most days, I still can't believe that someone lets me do this for a living - you know, just getting to talk to scientists is as good as it gets - I found that I wasn't good at the day-to-day science. And I think all great scientists really excel - they don't just love the ideas. They also love the manual labor of science.  GROSS: Jonah Lehrer, thanks so much for talking with us.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, Host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Now, some news you can use the next time you have to release a crocodile in the wild in the hopes that it won't come back to where you found it. That's not an everyday problem for most of us, but in Florida, sometimes, a crocodile crawls into someone's yard, and sometimes, the croc is placed back in the wild. SIEGEL: magnets. Lindsey Hord, a biologist with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, joins us from his office in Okeechobee, Florida. Lindsey Hord, what do you do with magnets? BLOCK: We're attempting to disorient the crocodile's navigational senses and prevent it from returning to its capture site by placing magnets on a crocodile's head while it's in transit from its capture site to its release site. Of course, then we remove the magnets at its release site. And then the hope is that at this point, it doesn't know where it's at. So it doesn't know where it's at, it can't return to where it came from. SIEGEL: This is safer than blindfolding the croc and spinning him around many times. You're trying to confuse the crocodile's navigational system here. BLOCK: Basically, yes. SIEGEL: Yeah. How many times have you tried it? BLOCK: We've tried it just twice. Some scientists in Mexico, dealing with the same species, the American crocodile, tested it for a couple of years and had, you know, reported some fairly good success. We saw the article and of course said, hmm, well, we might as well try this. We're already relocating crocodiles. So it can't hurt. Let's see if this works for us. SIEGEL: And it's still too early to find out whether those two crocs have made it. BLOCK: Oh, way too early. SIEGEL: Yeah. Why in theory would the magnets block the crocodile's sense of direction or location? Is it - do we assume that their whole system of navigation is magnetic? BLOCK: Well, there's some evidence that they sense the Earth's magnetic field in some way to orient themselves. There's some evidence that they use celestial navigation. They probably use visual cues when they're close to something, or they may even use olfactory stimulus to, you know, to return to their house. It just depends on, you know, probably, you know, the distance that you're talking about. Certainly, for over long distances, you know, they're going to have to use something that basically is like a GPS, you know, that it says, okay, you were here, you're here now. Here's how you get back to where you were. SIEGEL: Now, you say, place magnets on the crocodile's head. It sounds a lot easier said than done. It sounds rather dangerous, putting little magnets on the crocodile. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)BLOCK: It's really not. Of course, we happened to capture these crocodiles anyway, you know, in these situations. So once we capture the crocodile and it is secured, then we're basically just taping these magnets to the crocodile's head. You know, it looks like and seems like it's dangerous, but in reality, you know, if we're doing the things properly, it is not that dangerous. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)SIEGEL: Okay. I'll take your word for that. Well, just before I let you go, we should note that the problem for people in Florida, that crocodiles turn up on their property, is evidence, in part, of a solution for the crocodiles, that you've actually been able to bring back the crocodile population in Florida over the years. BLOCK: Yes. The American crocodile population in Florida is really an endangered species success story. However, the result of that recovery is that crocodiles are now being encountered in places where they haven't been seen for several decades, and those areas are places where people live. And, you know, and our job is to try to balance the needs of a recovering species along with public safety. So, you know, we obviously try to get people to coexist with these crocodiles as much as possible. SIEGEL: Mr. Hord, thank you very much for talking with us today. BLOCK: My pleasure.

The president is expected to announce a change from President Bush's policy at a White House event on Monday. And joining us to explain what this means is NPR's Joe Palca. Hey, Joe. JOE PALCA: Hey. BLOCK: Explain the current regulation, please, on federal funding for stem cell research. PALCA: Well, what the current federal regulation is, is that you can use federal dollars to do research on human embryonic stem cells, but those stem cells have to have been created, the stem cell lines have to have been created, prior to August 9, 2001, which was the day that President George W. Bush announced his policy. And he said he was morally troubled by this. He didn't want to encourage any embryos to be destroyed, which you have to do to make these, but he said for ones that they've already made, it's okay, the work can go forward. And his decision comes after the Clinton administration decided that they would allow this funding but never went ahead with it. BLOCK: Now, President Obama, then candidate Obama, promised to change this policy during the campaign. What exactly do we expect him to do on Monday -lift this entirely? PALCA: The issue has been: Can you do the kinds of research you want to do with the lines that currently qualify for federal funding? I have to point out here that if you get independent funding, private funding and state funding - California, for example, doesn't have this restriction on California researchers, who receive state money for embryonic stem cell research - but the federal funds have been closed and presumably, these will be opened. And it's not going to be a free-for-all. The president and the National Institutes of Health has always intended to have a set of ethical guidelines, and only certain - you know, the research that's morally acceptable, once you accept the fact that you're using these cells at all - so there will be some caveats. BLOCK: Joe, the promise has been that stem cell research could lead to cures for diseases such as Parkinson's Disease, diabetes. If and when the ban on funding and restrictions are lifted, what expectation do you have that those cures might be found any earlier? PALCA: Well, you know, this is, of course, the question that's impossible to answer, but scientists will tell you that the only way they're going to find these cures is to do the research, and the only way they can do the research at the speed which they think the research deserves is to get federal research dollars because really, that's the big engine for basic biomedical research. Pharmaceutical companies have not jumped on this because the payoff is a long way off, and it's not necessarily something that's going to be looking good on their ledger books right away. So it's a ways down the line. BLOCK: In the meantime, with these restrictions in place, haven't scientists found alternatives to using embryonic stem cells? PALCA: Well, exactly, and President Bush has said - you see? By restricting these cells, others have found ways around this problem of destroying an embryo to get the same kind of cells. These are so-called induced, pluripotent stem cells that behave just like embryonic stem cells, but you start with a normal skin cell or something like that. Scientists will tell you, yes, these cells are very promising and yes, they may in fact be a morally untainted way of getting cells for treatment of diseases, but for now they've had a lot more experience, albeit somewhat limited by the restrictions, with embryonic stem cell research, and so they feel it's important to push ahead both with these embryonic stem cells and with these new induced pluripotent stem cells.

The satellite would have provided new information about the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and its role in global warming. And the loss was especially painful because the nations existing climate satellites are getting old. As NPRs Jon Hamilton reports, that means the U. S. is likely to lose critical eyes in the sky just when it needs them most. JON HAMILTON: For a decade, a satellite known as QuikSCAT has been sending back important data about ocean winds and hurricanes, things that are affected by the changing climate. But that stream of data could end any day now. Ms. KATHY KELLY (University of Washington): Oh, its way past due. Its amazing that it still works. HAMILTON: Kathy Kelly is an oceanographer at the University of Washington. She says a proposed replacement for QuikSCAT wont be launched for years. Whats worse, the replacement is really designed for weather forecasting, so its not accurate enough to do climate research. The problem goes beyond QuikSCAT. Weather satellites arent designed to measure most of the stuff you need to monitor the climate, things like the thickness of ice sheets, the exact temperature of oceans, and the chemical composition of the atmosphere. And Kelly says many of the satellites that do measure these things are expected to go out of service in the next few years. Ms. KELLY: Well be blind for maybe a decade. And the Europeans will be putting up sun sensors, and that covers some holes. So well have some information. The problem is, is the climate record. HAMILTON: To be useful, the climate record has to be highly accurate and span decades without any gaps. Kelly says thats because climate change is happening in tiny increments over many years. Ms. KELLY: For instance, with sea level were looking that three millimeters a year, is the signal. Its tiny, and so every little bit of error matters. HAMILTON: In the 1980s and early 1990s, it looked like scientists were going to get the tools they needed to monitor climate change. But Bruce Wielicki, a climate scientist at NASA, says that ambitious program soon ran into budget cuts and delays, and more budget cuts. Dr. BRUCE WIELICKI (NASA): So now, were literally sitting there with a system that got up, was successful, would have been actually continued for the next 10 or 15 years in the initial NASA plan, but now there are no continuing satellites or spacecraft. So were basically sitting at the edge of a cliff. HAMILTON: Wielicki says money is only part of the problem. Climate change is an issue that has fallen between two agencies: NASA, the space agency, and NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Wielicki says NOAA's top priorities have been fisheries and weather. NASA has focused on putting people in space and doing space science, not Earth science. Dr. WIELICKI: So you end up with two agencies, who are the primary climate agencies, having climate as third priority. So how are you going to get climate done? And the answer is, you're not. HAMILTON: To address the organizational problem, Jane Lubchenco, the Obama administrations pick to run NOAA, plans to create a National Climate Service. And to help with the money problem, the president's stimulus package includes hundreds of millions of dollars for climate research, including new satellites. Wielicki says thats all good, but it will take a long time for those steps to have any effect. Dr. WIELICKI: The quickest you can get any new sensor up, from when you seriously start it, is on the order of five years, and it can be as long as 10. So youve got to be thinking long-term in this problem. HAMILTON: In the meantime, old satellites will probably give out before new ones go up. That will create gaps in the record, and those gaps will make it harder to predict things like how much the oceans will rise, or how hot summers will be three decades from now. Tom Karl, who directs climate services at NOAA, says this is an urgent problem because satellite data will influence how the U. S. spends hundreds of billions of dollars to prepare for climate change. Dr. TOM KARL (Director, NOAA): What are we going to do with airports? What are we going to do with the transportation sector? Water is going to be a major issue. There are some suggestions that water in the future, from just the climate change in the next several decades, could be a tough issue to deal with in some parts of the world, particularly the subtropics, as we see  expect drying to occur. Theres even concerns in the southwest part of the U. S. HAMILTON: It will take more and better satellites to tell us how concerned we should be. Jon Hamilton, NPR News.  STEVE INSKEEP, host:  When a NASA satellite plunged into the ocean last month instead of reaching orbit, climate scientists winced. The satellite would have provided new information about the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and its role in global warming. And the loss was especially painful because the nations existing climate satellites are getting old. As NPRs Jon Hamilton reports, that means the U. S. is likely to lose critical eyes in the sky just when it needs them most.  JON HAMILTON: For a decade, a satellite known as QuikSCAT has been sending back important data about ocean winds and hurricanes, things that are affected by the changing climate. But that stream of data could end any day now.  Ms. KATHY KELLY (University of Washington): Oh, its way past due. Its amazing that it still works.  HAMILTON: Kathy Kelly is an oceanographer at the University of Washington. She says a proposed replacement for QuikSCAT wont be launched for years. Whats worse, the replacement is really designed for weather forecasting, so its not accurate enough to do climate research. The problem goes beyond QuikSCAT. Weather satellites arent designed to measure most of the stuff you need to monitor the climate, things like the thickness of ice sheets, the exact temperature of oceans, and the chemical composition of the atmosphere. And Kelly says many of the satellites that do measure these things are expected to go out of service in the next few years.  Ms. KELLY: Well be blind for maybe a decade. And the Europeans will be putting up sun sensors, and that covers some holes. So well have some information. The problem is, is the climate record.  HAMILTON: To be useful, the climate record has to be highly accurate and span decades without any gaps. Kelly says thats because climate change is happening in tiny increments over many years.  Ms. KELLY: For instance, with sea level were looking that three millimeters a year, is the signal. Its tiny, and so every little bit of error matters.  HAMILTON: In the 1980s and early 1990s, it looked like scientists were going to get the tools they needed to monitor climate change.

I'm Robert Siegel. MICHELE NORRIS, Host: And I'm Michele Norris. President Barack Obama said today his administration plan to depart from the Bush administration and take a different approach to scientific research. Fulfilling a campaign promise, Obama signed an order allowing federal funding for the study of embryonic stem cells. Supporters believe studying these cells could lead to cures for illnesses from diabetes to paralysis. BARACK OBAMA: With the Executive Order I am about to sign, we will bring the change that so many scientists and researchers; doctors and innovators; patients and loved ones have hoped for and fought for these past eight years. We will lift the ban on federal funding for promising embryonic stem cell research. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)NORRIS: But he said his administration only would support research that follows strict ethical guidelines. OBAMA: We will support it only when it is both scientifically worthy and responsibly conducted. We will develop strict guidelines, which we will rigorously enforce, because we cannot ever tolerate misuse or abuse. And we will ensure that our government never opens the door to the use of cloning for human reproduction. It is dangerous, profoundly wrong, and has no place in our society or any society. NORRIS: The President promised to restore scientific integrity to the federal government. OBAMA: Promoting science isn't just about providing resources, it's also about protecting free and open inquiry. It's about letting scientists, like those who are here today, do their jobs free from manipulation or coercion and listening to what they tell us even when it's inconvenient, especially when it's inconvenient. It is about ensuring that scientific data is never distorted or concealed to serve a political agenda, and that we make scientific decisions based on facts not ideology. By doing this. . . (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)NORRIS: President Obama there speaking in the East Room of the White House. For more now on what these statements will mean, we're joined by NPR science correspondent Joe Palca. Hey, Joe. JOE PALCA: Hey, Michele. NORRIS: Now, why did this order on scientific integrity draw cheers from the crowd? PALCA: Well, I think Aretha Franklin captured the idea when she said R-E-S-P-E- C-T. I think scientists have spent the last eight years feeling dissed. That's the way they felt. It wasn't true 100 percent of the time but that was the gestalt in the scientific community. And I think now they're seeing - they're hearing a president say, we love you and we respect your ideas. And, you know, that feels good. NORRIS: So brand new day. Now, what does the new order actually mean for stem cell research? PALCA: Well, for stem cell research it's very specific what it means. President George W. Bush allowed federal funding for embryonic stem cell research with the following major caveat: that all the stem cell lines had to have been created prior to August 9, 2001. President Obama today said that restriction is gone. You may now apply for federal funds for embryonic stem cell research for embryonic stem cells created whenever, provided they meet certain ethical guidelines. Interestingly, though, the federal government will not be making those embryonic stem cell lines because there's still a congressional restriction that prevents that from happening. So somebody else has to make them but federal funds can be used to study them. NORRIS: Just give us a sense if the gates are now open, what kinds of things will start to happen? PALCA: Well, the gates are open to a certain extent. I mean, the first thing that happens is that the National Institutes of Health that will actually hand out this money will set up those guidelines that you've heard President Obama describe about what's the ethical use of these stem cells. Now, in some cases, that means asking the donors, do you approve of us destroying this embryo in order to obtain these stem cells? What should they be used for? Under what circumstances should they be studied? Is this really a valid research project that has a promise to do something or are you just wasting our time? NORRIS: Now, we've been talking about what the President did do with these statements. Let's talk a little bit about what he did not do, specifically on embryonic stem cell research and funding. PALCA: Well, it's not going to happen tomorrow. Nobody is going to back their, you know, pull their wheelbarrow up to the outside of the NIH and fill it up with cash. It's going to take some time to work out the procedures. Happily for the government, several other major scientific organizations have already discussed it and come up with guidelines, so the government will have to decide which among the ones that are already out there they want to adopt. NORRIS: The President, with this Executive Order, has heralded in an entirely new day for scientific research. But what about people who were not in the room, people who've pushed for these restrictions? I imagine the debate continues. PALCA: Oh, right. I think that people who are morally opposed to the destruction of embryos for any purpose are still going to be upset that they're going to be destroyed for the purpose of deriving embryonic stem cells. But I think more broadly, what's happened here is the President has taken the perspective not to diss anybody's opinions, or not to say your point of view isn't valid, but we're in a pluralistic society and most people feel that this is acceptable. And so, if you don't think it's right, don't apply for the funds, don't use the therapies, don't - you know, don't benefit from it. But if you do, and a majority of Americans, according to the President do, then we're allowing it. NORRIS: that's NPR's Joe Palca. Joe, thanks so much. PALCA: You're welcome.

Religious people may believe that God is supernatural, but new research shows that their brains respond as if he or she were just another person. That could help explain how the capacity for religious belief has evolved along with the human brain. NPR's Jon Hamilton has this story. JON HAMILTON: A team from the National Institutes of Health wanted to know what goes on in people's brains when they encounter statements like this. D: I believe a God is with me throughout the day and watches over me. HAMILTON: Or statements like this. D: God is angry at human behavior. HAMILTON: Jordan Grafman runs the cognitive neuroscience section at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. He was part of a team that studied the brains of 40 people, some religious, some not, using a technology called functional MRI. Grafman says some people agreed with the statements about God's love or anger, while other didn't. But either way, the statements got a response in areas of the brain involved in empathy and understanding what other people might be thinking. D: If the statement was that God has a presence in my daily life, well, that's making an inference, first of all, about God as a being of some kind, as an essence of some kind. So you're making an inference about an entity and their relationship with you. That would activate areas, for example, in the left frontal cortex of the brain. All such areas activated, as well, if you were making an inference about a friend's intentions. HAMILTON: Grafman says there were differences between religious and non-religious people. Those who said they believed in God had a negative emotional response to statements like there is no higher purpose. Non-believers had the same reaction to statements that assumed God exists. Grafman says the results show that to the brain, religious belief is a lot like political belief. D: If you're very conservative, and you have to make a judgment about what looks like a liberal statement, and you disagree with that, you might find this very same brain system is being activated. HAMILTON: Grafman says the new study says nothing about whether God exists, but it does suggest that belief in a supernatural being depends on brain systems that evolved quite recently. D: We believe that some of the same underlying abilities that support other sorts of complex human social behavior also support the behavior that we're terming religious belief. HAMILTON: Grafman says that probably means religions appeared as humans evolved the ability to handle really complicated social interactions. Joseph Bulbulia is an expert on the cognitive psychology of religion at Victoria University in New Zealand. He says religious belief has helped societies survive and thrive for thousands of years. Without religion, he says. . . D: So much of what is possible for us, large-scale cooperation, which now spans the world, would be impossible. HAMILTON: Bulbulia says religious belief means people share the same set of rules about behavior and think they'll be punished if they don't follow them. It also unites people, especially in times of great uncertainty. Bulbulia says it's no accident that President Obama invoked religion during his inaugural address. P: And with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations. Thank you. God bless you. May God bless the United States of America.

He will overturn existing restrictions on federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. White House officials say the president will also sign a second order intended to separate politics from science. NPR's Julie Rovner reports. JULIE ROVNER: So far, President Obama has reversed two Bush administration policies that were strongly supported by the pro-life community. Both were done quietly and out of public view. But that won't be the case today. Mr. HAROLD VARMUS (Science Adviser to President Obama): The executive order that the president will sign lists limitations that were imposed by President Bush on August 9th, 2001 that restrict the use of federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research to work with cell lines derived before the date of his speech. ROVNER: That's Harold Varmus, a science adviser to President Obama. Those cell lines he refers to are, of course, derived from human embryos, which are destroyed in the process. That's what makes the research so controversial. On the other hand, embryonic stem cells have the potential to turn into any cell in the human body, which is what makes them so promising to researchers. Colorado Democratic Congresswoman Diana DeGette has been working to overturn the restrictions since they were first imposed. She says she still hopes Congress will write federal standards for the research funding into law. Representative DIANA DEGETTE (Democrat, Colorado): Congress is still going to pass legislation, in large part because we don't want to see this become a ping-pong ball between different administrations like international family planning issues and other issues have become. ROVNER: Those are policies that switch back and forth, depending on which party controls the White House. Opponents of the embryonic stem cell research funding are already crying foul. Here's how Virginia Republican Congressman Eric Cantor put it on CNN. Representative ERIC CANTOR (Republican, Virginia): And, frankly, federal funding of embryonic stem cell research can bring on embryo harvesting, perhaps even human cloning that occurs. We don't want that. That shouldn't be done. That's wrong. ROVNER: But what President Obama will also say is wrong today is letting science be dictated by ideology. Varmus told reporters that in addition to the stem cell executive order, the president will sign a memorandum to, quote, \"restore scientific integrity. \" Mr. VARMUS: We'll endorse the notion that public policy must be guided by sound scientific advice, and then we'll direct the Office of Science and Technology policy to ensure a number of effective standards and practices. ROVNER: Congresswoman DeGette says that during the Bush administration, scientific policy was often dictated by things other than scientific evidence. Rep. DEGETTE: It started with global climate change, where the Bush administration announced that they didn't really believe it was true, contrary to the scientific evidence. And then it moved all the way through abstinence-only sex education, stem cell research and many other issues. ROVNER: The president's actions today will please many of his liberal backers, but they'll surely anger the social conservatives he's been trying to reach out to. Julie Rovner, NPR News, Washington.

Here's how Virginia Republican Congressman Eric Cantor put it on CNN.  Representative ERIC CANTOR (Republican, Virginia): And, frankly, federal funding of embryonic stem cell research can bring on embryo harvesting, perhaps even human cloning that occurs. We don't want that. That shouldn't be done. That's wrong.  ROVNER: But what President Obama will also say is wrong today is letting science be dictated by ideology. Varmus told reporters that in addition to the stem cell executive order, the president will sign a memorandum to, quote, \"restore scientific integrity. \"  Mr. VARMUS: We'll endorse the notion that public policy must be guided by sound scientific advice, and then we'll direct the Office of Science and Technology policy to ensure a number of effective standards and practices.  ROVNER: Congresswoman DeGette says that during the Bush administration, scientific policy was often dictated by things other than scientific evidence.  Rep. DEGETTE: It started with global climate change, where the Bush administration announced that they didn't really believe it was true, contrary to the scientific evidence. And then it moved all the way through abstinence-only sex education, stem cell research and many other issues.  ROVNER: The president's actions today will please many of his liberal backers, but they'll surely anger the social conservatives he's been trying to reach out to.  Julie Rovner, NPR News, Washington.

I'm Ira Flatow. Remember back in the early '60s, well, when we had math grads fresh out of school?

And if you'd like to talk with her, our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. We're also twittering. You can tweet us your questions by writing the @ sign followed by SciFri - also taking your questions in Second Life. Let me introduce my guest, Barbara Liskov is an institute professor and head of the programming methodology group in the computer science and artificial intelligence lab at MIT. She joins us by phone. Welcome to Science Friday, Dr. Liskov. Dr. BARBARA LISKOV (Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology): Thank you very much. FLATOW: You know, I think that most of us would imagine that being a women in those days, in the computing department, was a long and lonely career. Would that be correct? Dr. LISKOV: I didn't feel particularly lonely. When I first started at Stanford we had a very small class and the students typically worked as a group to work on the class projects. And later when I joined MIT I felt that I was accepted as a faculty member just like everybody else. FLATOW: How did you get into computers? You had a bachelor's degree in math. Dr. LISKOV: Just in the way that you described it. I got a job as a programmer when I couldn't get an interesting job as a mathematician, and I discovered that I had a talent for it, and after couple of years of working I decided to go back to graduate school so I could learn more quickly. FLATOW: Were there many - were there many courses in those days? Dr. LISKOV: There were only a few places in the country that had programs in computer science. One of them was Stanford University and that's where I decided to go for graduate school. FLATOW: So, when you got your first programming job, how did you know what to do? Was it more or less just trial and error in those days? Dr. LISKOV: They were - I was handed a reference manual for the programming language - that was FORTRAN. FLATOW: I remember that one. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. LISKOV: Yes, and a description of the project, and I just had to figure out what to do by myself. FLATOW: So you sat there and said hmmm. Dr. LISKOV: Yes, exactly. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: But those days if you handed in your, I remember from those days in the '60s, you punched out a bunch of those punch cards, and if you had a mistake in a period, it wouldn't compile and run. You had to wait forever to get them back and run them again. Dr. LISKOV: That's right, that's right, yes, you had to do batch processing. One advantage of that way of doing things versus what happens today, is you did think a little more carefully about what you wanted to accomplish if your program managed to get through the compiler. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. LISKOV: So in a way, it was perhaps a more efficient process as far as your own time was concerned. FLATOW: Yeah, because you cared about eating in those days. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. LISKOV: Yes. FLATOW: Yes, if it didn't run, you had to wait there again and do it all over again. Dr. LISKOV: Yeah. FLATOW: And there were no keyboard and things. Dr. LISKOV: You had to use a - if you wanted to punch your own cards, you had to use one of those special machines to punch them in. FLATOW: Yeah. Actually that was my first science fair project. I wrote a program that could read a punch card. Dr. LISKOV: Oh, yes. FLATOW: I made a little object that could do that. So, you were actually, back in '60s, then, you and your colleagues were basically essentially creating the whole field. There wasn't a lot of earlier work to build on. Dr. LISKOV: That's true, there wasn't much earlier work. FLATOW: Hmm. So did you sit around and think well, what can I do with a computer. Dr. LISKOV: Uh, so that kind of thinking for me came a bit later. First you know, you start as a graduate student and you're working on projects that your advisor has in mind. FLATOW: Right. Dr. LISKOV: And you're thinking about what can I do within that context. And after I got my PhD, I worked at the Mitre Corporation, and there I worked on a project that they had in hand. FLATOW: Right. Dr. LISKOV: But when I got to MIT, then it changed completely. I had to, you know, think all by myself about what I was going to work on next. FLATOW: Um hum. Did you have to develop the language yourself, that you are working on - the computer language? Dr. LISKOV: Well the first research project I did at MIT involved inventing a computer language called CLU, C-L-U, and that was part of my early work on data abstraction, which is the thing I'm most well known for. FLATOW: Tell us what that means. Dr. LISKOV: What that means is, it's a way of providing modules with very narrow interfaces. It's a way of separating the idea of what you're trying to accomplish with a piece of code from the way - from how you do that. FLATOW: Hmm. Dr. LISKOV: So, that if you decide to re-implement things in a different manner, it's not going to affect any of the rest of the program, which only depends on what you're doing, not how you are doing it. FLATOW: Well, that's a very important thing. Dr. LISKOV: Yes it is. FLATOW: Yeah. Are there more women in programming today, compared to when you started? Dr. LISKOV: Actually there aren't. When I started, because of what you said in your introduction, nobody had a background in computer science and they would take anybody on who had the ability to do programming. Today of course, you have to have a degree in computer science and so there is a sort of a set of obstacles in the way. You have to go to a university and get a degree in computer science or some related field, and for reasons that are not entirely well understood, the girls have not entered that program at the rate which you would have thought they might've. FLATOW: Uh huh. So, things are. . . The more they change, the more what? Ms. BARBARA LISKOV: Well, they'd stayed flat for many years. I do believe they might be changing at this point. I've seen, at MIT in the last couple of years, that the number of women in our undergraduate major has gone up - from maybe around 20 percent to somewhere between 25 and 30 percent. FLATOW: We've got a tweet here from Craig Newmark of Craigslist, who wants to say hello to you - or says hello because he remembers looking at CLU and makes - it says, looking at - no longer technical at Craigslist, makes me sad. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. LISKOV: A-ha. FLATOW: So there you go. So what do you say to women today who are looking to get into computer science? Ms. LISKOV: It's a great field, and it, you know, it requires a certain way of doing things, which if it happens to be something that you enjoy and are good at, it's a great field to go into. And of course, it opens up many other things. Our undergraduate majors don't all go into technical professions. Sometimes they become doctors or lawyers, patent attorneys, business. A lot of them used to go into finance before the recent problems. FLATOW: Well, that was my next question. Do - are people staying away from Wall Street now? Ms. LISKOV: I suspect, but I don't have any firsthand knowledge, that our graduates are a little less likely to go to Wall Street right now. FLATOW: You wouldn't blame Wall Street on the graduates, then? Ms. LISKOV: No, I certainly would not. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Someone wants to know who the Turing Award is named after. Ms. LISKOV: It's named after Alan Turing. He did some very early, fundamental work in computer science, and he's also very well known for his work on breaking codes during World War II. He was a British citizen, and he worked with the codebreakers, and there was a book of that name that was published about his life. FLATOW: Didn't he make some rules to judge whether a computer was intelligent or not? Ms. LISKOV: Yes, he had the Turing test. I'm not sure if he invented that or whether somebody named it after him. But the idea was that, if you could set things up so you couldn't tell whether a computer was answering you or a person, then this was passing the Turing test. And could we get computers that would be so much like people that we couldn't tell the difference? FLATOW: And there was a recent survey in the U. K. that showed that just 22. 5 percent of new recruits in IT are women. Ms. LISKOV: Yeah, well that's sort of in line with what we were talking about earlier. As I said, I think it might be getting a little better. The problem in computer science, I think, mostly arises pre-university and has to do with our culture and what young girls feel about the professions they'd like to go into. FLATOW: Yeah. Ms. LISKOV: And I think that now that we have Facebook and Twitter and other kinds of social networking, girls may be feeling that computers are a little more like the kinds of things they like to do. FLATOW: And so what are you working on now? What interests you? Ms. LISKOV: Right now I work in distributed computing, which has to do with applications like Google and eBay and Amazon that provide you services over the network, and typically these systems run themselves on thousands or tens of thousands of computers. FLATOW: Is this what we call the cloud these days? Ms. LISKOV: Amazon is producing a kind of storage called the cloud computing, and my current research actually is very much focused on online storage. If you - it's very desirable from a personal point of view to be able to put your data online because then you don't have to be responsible for maintaining it, making sure you do backups, you know, what happens if your computer fails and stuff like that. FLATOW: Don't you feel like you're back in the old mainframe days? Ms. LISKOV: No, because you don't necessarily run on your data there, although Amazon is also producing those kinds of facilities. But just having the ability to not worry about the backup problem is a big boon for users, and the problem is that if you put your data in the cloud, you want to be absolutely certain that it doesn't get lost, that it's there when you need it, and that it isn't compromised in any way, and particularly if you put on confidential information, you want to be sure that it doesn't get leaked. And so those are the kinds of problems that I'm working on these days. FLATOW: Those are major problems, worrying about the security of your data. Ms. LISKOV: Yes, they definitely are. FLATOW: When it goes out into the netherworld someplace. Ms. LISKOV: Right. FLATOW: And you can't keep track of it. Well, I wish you good luck. I want to thank you for taking time to be with us today, and congratulations to you. Ms. LISKOV: Thank you so much. I've really enjoyed it. FLATOW: Barbara Liskov, who just won the Turing Award; it's called the Nobel Prize in computing. She is institute professor and  head of the programming methodology group in the computer science and artificial intelligence lab over there at MIT. We're going to take a short break, and when we come back, we're going to switch gears and talk about the mood of science, for science in Washington these days. President Obama signed a couple of executive orders this week and talked about restoring science, and we'll talk with the new president of the AAAS. Peter Agre will join us. So stay with us. We'll be right back. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is Science Friday from NPR News.  IRA FLATOW, host:  Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow.

It's a way of separating the idea of what you're trying to accomplish with a piece of code from the way - from how you do that.  FLATOW: Hmm.  Dr. LISKOV: So, that if you decide to re-implement things in a different manner, it's not going to affect any of the rest of the program, which only depends on what you're doing, not how you are doing it.  FLATOW: Well, that's a very important thing.  Dr. LISKOV: Yes it is.  FLATOW: Yeah. Are there more women in programming today, compared to when you started?  Dr. LISKOV: Actually there aren't. When I started, because of what you said in your introduction, nobody had a background in computer science and they would take anybody on who had the ability to do programming. Today of course, you have to have a degree in computer science and so there is a sort of a set of obstacles in the way. You have to go to a university and get a degree in computer science or some related field, and for reasons that are not entirely well understood, the girls have not entered that program at the rate which you would have thought they might've.  FLATOW: Uh huh. So, things are. . . The more they change, the more what?  Ms. BARBARA LISKOV: Well, they'd stayed flat for many years. I do believe they might be changing at this point. I've seen, at MIT in the last couple of years, that the number of women in our undergraduate major has gone up - from maybe around 20 percent to somewhere between 25 and 30 percent.  FLATOW: We've got a tweet here from Craig Newmark of Craigslist, who wants to say hello to you - or says hello because he remembers looking at CLU and makes - it says, looking at - no longer technical at Craigslist, makes me sad.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. LISKOV: A-ha.  FLATOW: So there you go. So what do you say to women today who are looking to get into computer science?  Ms. LISKOV: It's a great field, and it, you know, it requires a certain way of doing things, which if it happens to be something that you enjoy and are good at, it's a great field to go into. And of course, it opens up many other things.  Our undergraduate majors don't all go into technical professions. Sometimes they become doctors or lawyers, patent attorneys, business. A lot of them used to go into finance before the recent problems.  FLATOW: Well, that was my next question. Do - are people staying away from Wall Street now?  Ms. LISKOV: I suspect, but I don't have any firsthand knowledge, that our graduates are a little less likely to go to Wall Street right now.  FLATOW: You wouldn't blame Wall Street on the graduates, then?  Ms. LISKOV: No, I certainly would not.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Someone wants to know who the Turing Award is named after.  Ms. LISKOV: It's named after Alan Turing. He did some very early, fundamental work in computer science, and he's also very well known for his work on breaking codes during World War II.  He was a British citizen, and he worked with the codebreakers, and there was a book of that name that was published about his life.  FLATOW: Didn't he make some rules to judge whether a computer was intelligent or not?  Ms. LISKOV: Yes, he had the Turing test. I'm not sure if he invented that or whether somebody named it after him. But the idea was that, if you could set things up so you couldn't tell whether a computer was answering you or a person, then this was passing the Turing test. And could we get computers that would be so much like people that we couldn't tell the difference?  FLATOW: And there was a recent survey in the U. K. that showed that just 22. 5 percent of new recruits in IT are women.  Ms. LISKOV: Yeah, well that's sort of in line with what we were talking about earlier. As I said, I think it might be getting a little better. The problem in computer science, I think, mostly arises pre-university and has to do with our culture and what young girls feel about the professions they'd like to go into.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Ms. LISKOV: And I think that now that we have Facebook and Twitter and other kinds of social networking, girls may be feeling that computers are a little more like the kinds of things they like to do.  FLATOW: And so what are you working on now? What interests you?  Ms. LISKOV: Right now I work in distributed computing, which has to do with applications like Google and eBay and Amazon that provide you services over the network, and typically these systems run themselves on thousands or tens of thousands of computers.  FLATOW: Is this what we call the cloud these days?  Ms. LISKOV: Amazon is producing a kind of storage called the cloud computing, and my current research actually is very much focused on online storage.  If you - it's very desirable from a personal point of view to be able to put your data online because then you don't have to be responsible for maintaining it, making sure you do backups, you know, what happens if your computer fails and stuff like that.  FLATOW: Don't you feel like you're back in the old mainframe days?  Ms. LISKOV: No, because you don't necessarily run on your data there, although Amazon is also producing those kinds of facilities. But just having the ability to not worry about the backup problem is a big boon for users, and the problem is that if you put your data in the cloud, you want to be absolutely certain that it doesn't get lost, that it's there when you need it, and that it isn't compromised in any way, and particularly if you put on confidential information, you want to be sure that it doesn't get leaked.  And so those are the kinds of problems that I'm working on these days.  FLATOW: Those are major problems, worrying about the security of your data.  Ms. LISKOV: Yes, they definitely are.  FLATOW: When it goes out into the netherworld someplace.  Ms. LISKOV: Right.  FLATOW: And you can't keep track of it. Well, I wish you good luck. I want to thank you for taking time to be with us today, and congratulations to you.  Ms. LISKOV: Thank you so much. I've really enjoyed it.  FLATOW: Barbara Liskov, who just won the Turing Award; it's called the Nobel Prize in computing. She is institute professor and  head of the programming methodology group in the computer science and artificial intelligence lab over there at MIT.  We're going to take a short break, and when we come back, we're going to switch gears and talk about the mood of science, for science in Washington these days. President Obama signed a couple of executive orders this week and talked about restoring science, and we'll talk with the new president of the AAAS. Peter Agre will join us. So stay with us. We'll be right back.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is Science Friday from NPR News. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2009 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Ira Flatow. A bit later in the hour, research about erasing memories and research in building a better battery. But first, particle physics. Do you ever wonder why everything around us has mass? Well you know, to physicists it's not good enough to say well, it's heavy. That's not the physics way of looking at things. They're looking for an invisible, subatomic particle - the Higgs boson - that helps give mass to the masses. And this morning, researchers at Fermilab, out there in Batavia, Illinois, now said they've got a much better handle on where to look for the elusive Higgs boson, and they've also got some other interesting physics research to talk about. So we're going to talk about what's going on in the world of particle physics and the Higgs boson and other things now. Joining me now to sort through the particle zoo is Heidi Schellman. She's a professor of physics at Northwestern University. She works at Fermilab, and she joins us by phone from the campus there in Batavia. Welcome to the program. Dr. HEIDI SCHELLMAN (Professor of Physics, Northwestern University): Hello, good morning - good afternoon. FLATOW: Whatever it is, depends on where you are. It's all relative, as someone used to say. Dr. SCHELLMAN: Yes, in physics, it's a 24 hour operation. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: But everybody, I mean you guys in Batavia and the Hadron Collider that's out there in CERN, they're looking for the Higgs boson. What's so important about that? Dr. SCHELLMAN: Well, we have a very nice model for how the world works, or at least the part we understand so far, called the Standard Model, and what it doesn't tell us, unless you have this Higgs field, is why particles have mass. I mean, we have a large number of elementary particles, about, let's see, 12 of them, and  - actually 16 of them - and they have different masses, widely varying masses. So why do things have mass? FLATOW: You mean they don't have to have mass? Dr. SCHELLMAN: In principle, without the Higgs, everything would be massless, and the universe would be full of, well, photons and other massless particles. So mass has to come from someplace, and the mechanism we have for explaining that right now is the Higgs field. And with the Higgs field comes a prediction that there's an associated particle, the Higgs boson. FLATOW: Now this morning, you folks out there at Fermilab announced that you had a better window for where to look for this Higgs boson. Can you explain that to us? Dr. SCHELLMAN: Yes. So I will say that it's a better window to look for, in some sense, the Standard Model Higgs, the one that fits in with everything else we know. And there's actually - all the results that are being reported today, this week there are four results coming out, and all of them point to particular windows for that. So first there's something called the direct measurement. It's basically, you decide to say well, there's a Higgs particle someplace in our data, and we're going to go and look for it. And if we don't see it at the level that the Standard Model says we should, well, it ain't there. FLATOW: When you say levels, do you mean energy levels, or the number of them, or\u2026? Dr. SCHELLMAN: Actually, it is the level of quantity. FLATOW: I see. Dr. SCHELLMAN: We're going to go out - this is the quantity search. We do it as a function of the mass. So one can say let's assume that there's 160 GeV. By the way, that's about the massive - I think it's a Terbium atom. We normally say gold because it's only the rare earths that are in the right mass range, but 160 GeV. Let's say we're going to look there. What we do is we run our - we go through all of our experimental data, and we say if the Standard Model says that Higgses are produced, we should see five of them or something like that, and you say well, did we see five, or did we not? And that's how we can set a limit. If we don't see that, we say well, it's the Standard Model. It can't have a mass of 160 GeV. FLATOW: And so then you've narrowed down where you should be able to look. Dr. SCHELLMAN: Yes, exactly. FLATOW: Now do you think that you folks out there at Fermilab have a powerful enough accelerator (unintelligible) where the buffalo roam, to actually find something at that mass? Dr. SCHELLMAN: Okay, so if it's the Standard Model Higgs, the results that we've gotten through the direct measurement and are announcing today rule out a range between 160 and 170 GeV. Now the people at CERN, in the early 2000s, ruled out any mass below about 114, and we have other indirect limits that show, which I can - which are also related to results from today - which say it has to be less than 185 GeV. So at this point, we've ruled out a reasonable fraction of the region already. The question is where is it elsewise, and that depends on how well we can run. I think if we run - so we have twice as much data, and we become somewhat cleverer, we may actually be able to see a hint over the full Standard Model mass range. That's a possibility. But the LHC guys are going to be much, much more powerful in terms of the number of interactions they can record. So in the long run, the really high statistic sample is going to come from them. FLATOW: So you're trying to sort of get in ahead of - they had those technical problems with leaking stuff over there at the Large Hadron Collider. Do you think you can use this time period to find that stuff before they do? Dr. SCHELLMAN: That's what we're trying to do. I would just like to point out that this is not an international battle, or if it is, the sides are not well-defined. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. SCHELLMAN: We did an accounting. I'm on the D0 Collaboration. There's also the CDF Collaboration. So there's two of us involved in this. Those are the American collaborations, and we did a count of the people actually doing work on the D0 Collaboration about a year ago, and we discovered that more than half our collaborators were not only not from the United States but not even from United States institutions. And there are huge French, German, English and Italian and Japanese and Indian and Chinese contingents on the so-called American experiments, whereas there are also huge American contingents on the LHC experiment. So it may be a battle of the labs, but it's not a battle of the countries. FLATOW: Well at this point then, with such expectations, will it be more surprising if neither of the labs find the Higgs than if they do find it? Dr. SCHELLMAN: That would be certainly one of the most interesting things. If we find it - you know, we'll find a hint. Maybe they'll find it for real, but it would be an immensely interesting result if the Higgs does not show up anywhere in the Standard Model mass range because that shows that there's something going on beyond this very, very successful Standard Model that is perhaps getting frustratingly successful for us. FLATOW: Yeah, so you need something to throw a monkey wrench into it. Dr. SCHELLMAN: Yeah, that would be great. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Talk about one other announcement this week. There's also the precise measurement of something else. Dr. SCHELLMAN: Oh, there's two actually. FLATOW: Okay, let's talk about them. Dr. SCHELLMAN: Okay. That's actually where the other squeezing of the Higgs comes about is that I'm actually a member of the W Boson Mass Team(ph). You can directly look for the Higgs, but the Higgs can also have effect even if you can't see it. If you can very precisely measure certain parameters that are predicted by the Standard Model, the existence of the Higgs at a given mass will shift them ever so slightly, and we have measured - this week we're announcing both a better measurement of the mass of the top quark, that's coming out today I think, and also we announced on Wednesday a better measurement of the mass of the W boson, which we measured to 500 parts per million, and that measurement, combined with the top mass, are what set that 185 GeV absolute upper limit, regardless of if you look directly. Just the fact that those particles have the right masses, and they aren't shifted by the presence of the Higgs also sets another limit at 185. So there's that very interesting gap between 170 and 185 that we believe is actually going to be closed pretty soon, once we've finalized our analysis of those other measurements. So those are very, very precise measurements done on large numbers of interactions, while the direct search for the Higgs is looking for - well, it's kind of like looking for a needle in all of the haystacks in the United States. FLATOW: I get you. Let me - I have just a couple of minutes left. Let's talk about the top quark. Is it also news that you found a single one, an isolated one, instead of one in a pair? Dr. SCHELLMAN: Oh yes. That has two - we also did that this week. Both\u2026 FLATOW: You had a busy week out there. Dr. SCHELLMAN: Yeah, it's been - oh my gosh. It's been - it's the CDF and the D0 Collaboration both found that you could see tops being produced singly, and this is both an interesting study because it has the same signature as a low-mass Higgs. So understanding that is very important for finding the low-mass Higgs, but it also establishes that the top quark is just a normal quark like the other quarks in a very significant way. Before that, tops were produced in pairs through the strong interaction, and that didn't tell you if they were just like the other quarks or something completely different. And you could get some hints that they were probably just normal particles, but the existence of this single top means that it's produced in a normal way, through the weak interactions, and so it's sort of more of a garden-variety quark. There's no other class of very heavy particles that it belongs to, so\u2026 FLATOW: And the quarks are the basic building blocks. Dr. SCHELLMAN: Yes. Those are the basic building blocks. There's six different kinds of quarks that we know of, and this indicates they're probably - it sort of means that the top quark isn't an example of some other weird kind. It really is an ordinary, very heavy, garden-variety quark. FLATOW: So you're happy to see that? Dr. SCHELLMAN: Well once again\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. SCHELLMAN: Yeah, it makes that Standard Model seem more and more standard. FLATOW: You don't need new physics to explain. Dr. SCHELLMAN: Yeah, you don't need new physics at this point. FLATOW: Yeah, but if you don't find that Higgs boson\u2026 Dr. SCHELLMAN: Yes, that will be a very exciting thing to see. So I don't know which way we're betting here. FLATOW: You got a straddle on this one? You got one on each to say we got some, maybe we will, we won't? Dr. SCHELLMAN: Yeah, I think, well at this point, we're sort of exactly there. I mean, if there is a Higgs, it's probably on the low-end mass side, and we may be able to at least say it's unlikely to be there. We probably won't be able to say we're absolutely, positively certain it's there. FLATOW: Can you give us a time frame on that? Dr. SCHELLMAN: Well, the time frame for the Tevatron really is - we're going to keep running, we hope, for the next couple years, but at some point, our friends at the LHC are going to turn on, and they're going to be looking at it, too, and that's a much more powerful machine. So it's going to be a very exciting two or three years as we may be having both groups running simultaneously. We are a little better off. We have somewhat less background, but that's a very, very powerful machine. So in the end, they're going to be able to really study this in infinite precision. FLATOW: Well, I hope your frequent flyer miles are collecting as you do this. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. SCHELLMAN: Thank you. FLATOW: Thank you, Dr. Schellman, for taking time to be with us. Dr. SCHELLMAN: Okay. FLATOW: Heidi Schellman is professor of physics at Northwestern University, is on the W Mass Team of the D0 Collaboration at Fermilab. We're going to short break, let your mind clear a little bit. (Soundbite of laughter) (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: Get your head wrapped around finding the Higgs boson and rooting. Those of you rooting that they're not going to find it, well, we'll give you time to think about it, also. We're going to come back and talk about batteries, some really interesting new battery technology, which may lead to a very fast battery that can be charged very quickly. So we'll talk about that after this break. Stay with us.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow.

Dr. SCHELLMAN: Well, the time frame for the Tevatron really is - we're going to keep running, we hope, for the next couple years, but at some point, our friends at the LHC are going to turn on, and they're going to be looking at it, too, and that's a much more powerful machine.  So it's going to be a very exciting two or three years as we may be having both groups running simultaneously. We are a little better off. We have somewhat less background, but that's a very, very powerful machine.  So in the end, they're going to be able to really study this in infinite precision.  FLATOW: Well, I hope your frequent flyer miles are collecting as you do this.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. SCHELLMAN: Thank you.  FLATOW: Thank you, Dr. Schellman, for taking time to be with us.  Dr. SCHELLMAN: Okay.  FLATOW: Heidi Schellman is professor of physics at Northwestern University, is on the W Mass Team of the D0 Collaboration at Fermilab.  We're going to short break, let your mind clear a little bit.  (Soundbite of laughter)  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: Get your head wrapped around finding the Higgs boson and rooting. Those of you rooting that they're not going to find it, well, we'll give you time to think about it, also.  We're going to come back and talk about batteries, some really interesting new battery technology, which may lead to a very fast battery that can be charged very quickly. So we'll talk about that after this break. Stay with us. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2009 NPR.  All rights reserved.

In a moment we'll hear about a South American country that is just beginning to come to terms with the disease. First, the District of Columbia. Washington, D. C. released a report yesterday showing that three percent of adults and teens in the city have been diagnosed with HIV-AIDS. That's huge, three percent, one out of every 33 people. The disease in the nation's capital hits African-American men the hardest and it's a problem for heterosexuals as well as men who have sex with men. NPR's Brenda Wilson reports. BRENDA WILSON: The District of Columbia's HIV-AIDS report reveals what many had long suspected. Washington has a serious HIV epidemic. More than 15,000 people in the district have been diagnosed with HIV and AIDS. That's three percent of the half million people who are 13 or older living in the city. Yesterday, the city found itself compared to countries in West Africa that have lower rates of infection, but many more people infected, to which Mayor Adrian Fenty had this to say. Mayor ADRIAN FENTY (Washington, D. C. ): Yes, we are one of the worst, not only in the region or the country, but in the world. So the only way I know as a human being to solve a problem is to face it head-on. WILSON: The overwhelming majority of the cases are in the African-American community, which makes up more than half of Washington D. C. 's population. Black men were the hardest hit, but there were as many heterosexuals diagnosed with the disease as men who have sex with men. In a separate survey of heterosexuals in neighborhoods of the city most affected by the epidemic, nearly half of the people who participated didn't know the HIV status of the last person they had sex with. An even greater number didn't use condoms. Mayor FENTY: No matter what else is causing these statistics to be so high in the District of Columbia, just in this set of findings we know that we've got a lot of work to do as a government to educate, to get information out, and as a community to step up and realize how dangerous we are in our sexual behavior. WILSON: But there was good news. The city has nearly doubled the number of people who are being tested for HIV. Dr. Shannon Hader, who is the city's 12th HIV-AIDS director in five years, says that testing not only gets people into treatment early, it can slow the spread of the disease. Dr. SHANNON HADER (HIV-AIDS Director, Washington, D. C. ): If you know your status earlier, if you know you're HIV positive, that's actually one of the best prevention interventions there is. Most of the people who transmit HIV don't know that they're infected. WILSON: As to what has to happen next, Hader says, the city may have to change strategies. Instead of just counseling individuals, she says this severe epidemic calls for getting more condoms, clean needles, and tailored information into hard-hit neighborhoods. Dr. HADER: I'm not sure we always kept our eye on the ball. And somewhere the message hadn't gotten out enough to everyday people and gotten internalized where you know what, when you have a common disease, it's a common problem. It doesn't take extreme amounts of risk behavior in an area where you have extreme rates of disease to protect yourself. WILSON: Not all cities report both HIV and AIDS, so a comparison is difficult. Looking at AIDS rates alone, however, D. C. ranks fifth behind San Francisco, New York, Miami, and Fort Lauderdale. Brenda Wilson, NPR News.

Because AIDS came to Bolivia later than many of its neighbors in South America, it's only been in the last three years that the government there has made a concerted effort to educate the public and to provide free drugs. From the Bolivian capital La Paz, Ruxandra Guidi reports. (Soundbite of crowd) RUXANDRA GUIDI: The only public AIDS clinic in Bolivia's largest city, Santa Cruz, often keeps its doors closed. Doctors, nurses, technicians and receptionists will go on strike when they run out of gauze and needles and many other basics. Then they'll make some noise. (Soundbite of clapping) GUIDI: Eventually they'll get their supplies from the government, but not after strikes that can last as long as two weeks. In the meantime, hundreds of patients will miss their appointments and prescriptions and form lines that go around the block. This is grave because any interruption in HIV drug treatment will increase the likelihood that patients will develop resistance to the drugs. Gonzalo Borda is the clinic's director. Mr. GONZALO BORDA (Clinic director): (Through translator) Forty-six percent of all HIV-positive people in Bolivia are treated at this clinic. So if we can't control HIV in Santa Cruz, we won't be able to control it in Bolivia. GUIDI: Santa Cruz is a growing city made up of immigrants \u2014 from other cities, from the countryside, and from neighboring Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay. Because of this, it's where most new cases of HIV are diagnosed and where most treatments are given. With a population of nine million, Bolivia had only an estimated 1,500 cases of HIV in 2005. But that number doubled within just a year, forcing the government to acknowledge it had a potential crisis in its hands. Ronny Rossel is the national coordinator for the first AIDS government program based in the capital, La Paz. Mr. RONNY ROSSEL (Bolivian Official): (Through translator) We've made HIV a priority and passed the so-called AIDS law, where we define the government's responsibility toward HIV-positive patients, providing free care and drugs for anyone who needs it. GUIDI: Rossel estimates there are around 8,000 HIV cases now in Bolivia. The law passed last year makes generic drugs from Brazil and India available to anyone free of cost. But Bolivia's macho culture and its indigenous and cultural diversity make it difficult to reach many at-risk groups. There are an estimated 40 different ethnic groups in the country, many of them with their unique languages and social and family traditions. Barely any efforts have been made by the government to increase HIV awareness and to dispel the myth that it's an illness only affecting prostitutes and gays. (Soundbite of coughing) GUIDI: Juan Carlos Quipildor is from Santa Cruz. He became infected with HIV while he worked abroad in Argentina, has been living with the virus for over 10 years. He and his daughter, Fernandita, were the first Bolivians to go public about having the disease. (Soundbite of child playing) GUIDI: Quipildor has two children, Andres who's three and healthy, and Fernandita, who's 12. Ms. FERNANDITA QUIPILDOR (AIDS Patient): (Through Translator) I live with my dad and I'm doing well. We always help each other during the bad days, because when my mom was sick, we also stuck together and took care of her until she died. GUIDI: On this day, Quipildor and his daughter are at his mother's house. Quipildor has just found out that he lost his job, and that he and his kids may have to move in here for the time being. He says his mother has come a long way since she first found out he was HIV-positive. Mr. JUAN CARLOS QUIPILDOR (AIDS Patient): (Through Translator) Our old mentality here in Bolivia was that only prostitutes and homosexuals could get infected \u2014 so when they told us that my exam came out positive, my mother fainted. When she woke up, the first thing she asked me: Are you going to die? . GUIDI: Quipildor and Fernandita both seem to be doing well, more than a decade since they were diagnosed. But, Quipildor says, they still have a long way to go to get the support and care they really need. For NPR News, I'm Ruxandra Guidi, La Paz, Bolivia.

So how do you treat pain in a limb that isn't there? That's something that our friends at Radio Lab have been wondering about. (Soundbite of music) JAD ABUMRAD: Hey, Steve. INSKEEP: Hey. That's Jad Abumrad from WNYC. ROBERT KRULWICH: And this is me, Robert Krulwich. INSKEEP: And before we get started, we should explain what Radio Lab is for those people who don't recall. KRULWICH: Radio Lab is a place where we explore big ideas that make us really rethink ourselves\u2026 ABUMRAD: And the whole world around us. KRULWICH: And this time we are thinking about how to fix an arm that isn't there. Dr. V. S. RAMACHANDRAN (Neurologist, University of California San Diego): I am V. S. Ramachandran. KRULWICH: He's a well-known neurologist. He works in California. Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: The University of California San Diego. KRULWICH: And one day, he says a patient showed up in his office, and it seems that the guy had had this arm amputated - it was his left arm - and that ever since, this man had an uncanny feeling that he still had an arm where his real arm used to be. Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Yes. Now, it's important to emphasize this is not a delusion. He doesn't think he has an arm. He knows he doesn't. He's not crazy. But he vividly feels its presence. KRULWICH: And the rough part was that this arm, it hurt. This sometimes happens to people with phantom limbs. He would have days where his phantom arm would seize up in pain. Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Doctor, it hurts. KRULWICH: Really badly. Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: He goes into this painful, clenching spasm. The nails dig into my palm. ABUMRAD: So, he has a phantom hand at the end of his phantom limb. Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Yes. And he'll say things like it's going to a cramp with the nails digging into the phantom palm, and it's excruciatingly painful. KRULWICH: But there are no nails, there is no palm. Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: There's no nail, there's no palm. KRULWICH: And weirdest of all, the patient couldn't do anything about it. He'd tried to unclench his phantom nails from his phantom palm to make the pain stop, but he couldn't. Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: He said I cannot move the phantom. KRULWICH: The phantom arm wouldn't obey. Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: I cannot volitionally move it. And I started thinking to myself, what does he mean when he says he cannot move his phantom limb? It's like an oxymoron. There is no arm there. (Soundbite of music) KRULWICH: Dr. Ramachandran was confused. What's going on? He checked with the patient and discovered that 11 years earlier, before the amputation, he'd had an injury to his spine. And after that, his real left arm was paralyzed. He could not move it. He tried. His brain would issue the commands. Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: His brain was saying move the arm, but he was getting visual feedback, and indeed feedback from his muscles, saying no. Move the arm. No. Move. No. KRULWICH: And this went on for months. Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Move. No. KRULWICH: So maybe, thought Dr. Ramachandran, maybe this patient got so frustrated trying to move his real arm, that at some point\u2026 Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: After a few months or a year, the paralysis got learned by the brain, stamped into the circuitry of the brain. And I call it learned\u2026 KRULWICH: Learned\u2026 Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: \u2026paralysis. KRULWICH: \u2026paralysis. So even when they cut the patient's arm off a year after the accident, he still didn't get any relief because the problem wasn't in his arm. It was learned paralysis. It was in his head now. (Soundbite of music) INSKEEP: We're learning with the people from Radio Lab. And let me make sure I understand this. The guy's in pain because he can't move a paralyzed arm which does not exist anymore. KRULWICH: Or so Ramachandran thought. But then he thought, maybe we can help this guy by tricking his brain into thinking the arm isn't paralyzed. But now the question is how do you trick a brain? How would you do that? Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: How would you do that, indeed? KRULWICH: He thought for a bit. Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Then I had this way of using a mirror propped inside a cardboard box. KRULWICH: A what? Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: A mirror propped inside a cardboard box. KRULWICH: A mirror parked inside a\u2026you mean, like a box\u2026 Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Propped up. KRULWICH: Oh. It was kind of a Home Depot solution, really. Ramachandran took a long and skinny mirror, the kind you'd hang on a closet door. ABUMRAD: Right. KRULWICH: And he propped it up using a cardboard box, and then turned it sideways - placed the side right in front of the patient, like right on his nose. ABUMRAD: So he couldn't see himself. KRULWICH: No, couldn't see anything in the mirror yet, unless he hooked his neck around, took a peak. ABUMRAD: Oh, okay. KRULWICH: Otherwise, he's just looking at the side. Ramachandran says - and I want you to imagine this with me, Jad. ABUMRAD: Sure. KRULWICH: He says I want you to take your good arm, your real arm, okay, and stick it out in front of the mirror. So, do that. ABUMRAD: Okay. KRULWICH: Now, make it do what the phantom arm does. Take your good arm, make it stiff, curl your hand into a fist, dig your fingernails into your palm deeply, make it hurt. You doing that? ABUMRAD: Yeah, it's kind of hurting. KRULWICH: Okay. Now when I tell you, crook your head so you can look into the mirror, and on your left, just where the phantom ought to be, let's pretend that that's your phantom arm. It's cramped, it's curled exactly as you'd imagine it. So now look in the mirror. ABUMRAD: Okay. KRULWICH: And there's your arm. You see it there in the mirror. Your phantom arm. ABUMRAD: Got it. KRULWICH: Now, very slowly, keeping your eye on the mirror now, I want you to uncurl your hand. Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Patient says, okay. He opens his real hand. My God. And, of course, it looks like his phantom is opening. That's not surprising. He's got the mirror there. But he says, my God, doctor, you're not going to believe this. The movements have all come back. All these movements in my fingers, in my elbow, in my wrist from 11 years ago come flooding into my mind. KRULWICH: So his pretend nails are now ungripping from his pretend palm, and the whole problem of the pretend pain goes away. Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Goes away. That's what he said. KRULWICH: For how long, by the way? Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Till the mirror was in place. KRULWICH: But when Dr. Ramachandran took away the mirrors, the pain came back. (Soundbite of music) Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: I said fine, c'est la vie, you know. And then I said, look, why don't you practice with the mirror for a few weeks every day for an hour, then maybe if you do it repeatedly, you can unlearn the learned pain. KRULWICH: So the guy goes home, gets out a mirror. You give him a mirror to take home? Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Correct. And\u2026 KRULWICH: And he does it over and over. Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: \u2026(unintelligible) $2, take it with you. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: So he takes it with him. He's delighted. And then after about another week, he phones me and he sounds all agitated on the phone. And I said what's going on? He said, doctor, you're not going to believe this. It's gone. I said, what's gone? I thought maybe the mirror was gone. He said, no, no, not the mirror. The phantom is gone. KRULWICH: Gone, gone? Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: That's what I said: Gone, gone? What do you mean phantom is gone? He said, well, this phantom arm that I've been having for the last 11 years, it's disappeared. Well, my initial reaction was alarm. I said, my God, does this bother you? And he said no. You know, this happened three days ago. And in the last three days, you remember the excruciating elbow pain and wrist pain I got several times a day? Well, I don't have them anymore because I don't have an arm. And\u2026 KRULWICH: This is amputation by mirror. Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Yeah. So, as I tell my medical colleagues jokingly, I say this is the first example in the history of medicine of a successful amputation of a phantom limb. (Soundbite of laughter) INSKEEP: Reminds you that the most brilliant things are often the simplest. KRULWICH: Yeah, absolutely. INSKEEP: Robert, Jad, thanks for stopping by. ABUMRAD: Hey, no problem. KRULWICH: You're welcome.

Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Yes. Now, it's important to emphasize this is not a delusion. He doesn't think he has an arm. He knows he doesn't. He's not crazy. But he vividly feels its presence.  KRULWICH: And the rough part was that this arm, it hurt. This sometimes happens to people with phantom limbs. He would have days where his phantom arm would seize up in pain.  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Doctor, it hurts.  KRULWICH: Really badly.  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: He goes into this painful, clenching spasm. The nails dig into my palm.  ABUMRAD: So, he has a phantom hand at the end of his phantom limb.  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Yes. And he'll say things like it's going to a cramp with the nails digging into the phantom palm, and it's excruciatingly painful.  KRULWICH: But there are no nails, there is no palm.  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: There's no nail, there's no palm.  KRULWICH: And weirdest of all, the patient couldn't do anything about it. He'd tried to unclench his phantom nails from his phantom palm to make the pain stop, but he couldn't.  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: He said I cannot move the phantom.  KRULWICH: The phantom arm wouldn't obey.  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: I cannot volitionally move it. And I started thinking to myself, what does he mean when he says he cannot move his phantom limb? It's like an oxymoron. There is no arm there.  (Soundbite of music)  KRULWICH: Dr. Ramachandran was confused. What's going on? He checked with the patient and discovered that 11 years earlier, before the amputation, he'd had an injury to his spine. And after that, his real left arm was paralyzed. He could not move it. He tried. His brain would issue the commands.  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: His brain was saying move the arm, but he was getting visual feedback, and indeed feedback from his muscles, saying no. Move the arm. No. Move. No.  KRULWICH: And this went on for months.  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Move. No.  KRULWICH: So maybe, thought Dr. Ramachandran, maybe this patient got so frustrated trying to move his real arm, that at some point\u2026  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: After a few months or a year, the paralysis got learned by the brain, stamped into the circuitry of the brain. And I call it learned\u2026  KRULWICH: Learned\u2026  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: \u2026paralysis.  KRULWICH: \u2026paralysis. So even when they cut the patient's arm off a year after the accident, he still didn't get any relief because the problem wasn't in his arm. It was learned paralysis. It was in his head now.  (Soundbite of music)  INSKEEP: We're learning with the people from Radio Lab. And let me make sure I understand this. The guy's in pain because he can't move a paralyzed arm which does not exist anymore.  KRULWICH: Or so Ramachandran thought. But then he thought, maybe we can help this guy by tricking his brain into thinking the arm isn't paralyzed. But now the question is how do you trick a brain? How would you do that?  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: How would you do that, indeed?  KRULWICH: He thought for a bit.  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Then I had this way of using a mirror propped inside a cardboard box.  KRULWICH: A what?  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: A mirror propped inside a cardboard box.  KRULWICH: A mirror parked inside a\u2026you mean, like a box\u2026  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Propped up.  KRULWICH: Oh. It was kind of a Home Depot solution, really. Ramachandran took a long and skinny mirror, the kind you'd hang on a closet door.  ABUMRAD: Right.  KRULWICH: And he propped it up using a cardboard box, and then turned it sideways - placed the side right in front of the patient, like right on his nose.  ABUMRAD: So he couldn't see himself.  KRULWICH: No, couldn't see anything in the mirror yet, unless he hooked his neck around, took a peak.  ABUMRAD: Oh, okay.  KRULWICH: Otherwise, he's just looking at the side. Ramachandran says - and I want you to imagine this with me, Jad.  ABUMRAD: Sure.  KRULWICH: He says I want you to take your good arm, your real arm, okay, and stick it out in front of the mirror. So, do that.  ABUMRAD: Okay.  KRULWICH: Now, make it do what the phantom arm does. Take your good arm, make it stiff, curl your hand into a fist, dig your fingernails into your palm deeply, make it hurt. You doing that?  ABUMRAD: Yeah, it's kind of hurting.  KRULWICH: Okay. Now when I tell you, crook your head so you can look into the mirror, and on your left, just where the phantom ought to be, let's pretend that that's your phantom arm. It's cramped, it's curled exactly as you'd imagine it. So now look in the mirror.  ABUMRAD: Okay.  KRULWICH: And there's your arm. You see it there in the mirror. Your phantom arm.  ABUMRAD: Got it.  KRULWICH: Now, very slowly, keeping your eye on the mirror now, I want you to uncurl your hand.  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Patient says, okay. He opens his real hand. My God. And, of course, it looks like his phantom is opening. That's not surprising. He's got the mirror there. But he says, my God, doctor, you're not going to believe this. The movements have all come back. All these movements in my fingers, in my elbow, in my wrist from 11 years ago come flooding into my mind.  KRULWICH: So his pretend nails are now ungripping from his pretend palm, and the whole problem of the pretend pain goes away.  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Goes away. That's what he said.  KRULWICH: For how long, by the way?  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Till the mirror was in place.  KRULWICH: But when Dr. Ramachandran took away the mirrors, the pain came back.  (Soundbite of music)  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: I said fine, c'est la vie, you know. And then I said, look, why don't you practice with the mirror for a few weeks every day for an hour, then maybe if you do it repeatedly, you can unlearn the learned pain.  KRULWICH: So the guy goes home, gets out a mirror. You give him a mirror to take home?  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Correct. And\u2026  KRULWICH: And he does it over and over.  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: \u2026(unintelligible) $2, take it with you.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: So he takes it with him. He's delighted. And then after about another week, he phones me and he sounds all agitated on the phone. And I said what's going on? He said, doctor, you're not going to believe this. It's gone. I said, what's gone? I thought maybe the mirror was gone. He said, no, no, not the mirror. The phantom is gone.  KRULWICH: Gone, gone?  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: That's what I said: Gone, gone? What do you mean phantom is gone? He said, well, this phantom arm that I've been having for the last 11 years, it's disappeared. Well, my initial reaction was alarm. I said, my God, does this bother you? And he said no. You know, this happened three days ago. And in the last three days, you remember the excruciating elbow pain and wrist pain I got several times a day? Well, I don't have them anymore because I don't have an arm. And\u2026  KRULWICH: This is amputation by mirror.  Dr. RAMACHANDRAN: Yeah. So, as I tell my medical colleagues jokingly, I say this is the first example in the history of medicine of a successful amputation of a phantom limb.  (Soundbite of laughter)  INSKEEP: Reminds you that the most brilliant things are often the simplest.  KRULWICH: Yeah, absolutely.  INSKEEP: Robert, Jad, thanks for stopping by.  ABUMRAD: Hey, no problem.  KRULWICH: You're welcome.

I'm Ira Flatow and we're broadcasting live from Florida State University in Tallahassee today as part of their Origins '09 conference. And the conference marks 200 years since the birth of Charles Darwin and a 150 since the publication of \"On the Origin of Species,\" the book that unveiled Darwin's new theory on evolution. But this hour we're going to talk about our origins going much further way back - way back, when the appearance of even the earliest species - I'm talking about the origin of the universe. How did all of this get started, everything that we see around us? How did it all get here? Where did it come from? Where do the forces of nature from? I'm getting just out of breath thinking about it. The stuff we take for granted, for example, like gravity. My next guest, Dr. Lisa Randall, has been thinking, researching, and writing about these mysteries and she has formulated some interesting explanations for them. And those explanations include the existence of extra dimensions, a la Rod Serling, where are you? This is really interesting stuff, and might make you think that we're talking about science fiction, but we're not. And if you'd like to talk with us about that, our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK, and we have almost 10,000 twitterers on our - tweeting us these days, and you can join the tweeterer twitterers at the S-sign followed by SciFri, if you like to you do that. Also in Second Life we have our avatars having a meeting up there and sending in questions to us. Lisa Randall is the author of \"Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions. \" She is also a professor of physics at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Dr. LISA RANDALL (Harvard University): Thank you for having me here. FLATOW: Good to see you. You're here for the Origins conference. How much do we really know about the origin of the universe? How much speculation? Give us a little update on that. Dr. RANDALL: Well, you know, it's a little bit ironic that the title is Origins because what we know about is evolution. We know how things have changed over time. But what we don't actually know, I will confess right from the beginning, is how things started. We don't understand the very first moments. But we do have an incredibly precise and detailed theory of how the universe has come to evolve over time, the Big Bang theory, coupled with something called cosmological inflation. So we know the universe began as some hot plasma that's cooled down over time. We can see evidence of the radiation in the sky and look at that radiation and it tells us detailed properties of what the universe looked like earlier on. We can see evidence that the universe is expanding. We can see evidence that actually details nuclear abundances. FLATOW: Right. Dr. RANDALL: So it's a very precise theory. FLATOW: Yeah. But one of the great mysteries of the universe is why we only can see four percent of it, right? Isn't 96 percent of the universe\u2026 Dr. RANDALL: You're jumping right into the stuff we don't know. FLATOW: Dark stuff. Well, I mean we talk about this all the time. I love to talk about this, you know, the dark energy and the dark matter. Dr. RANDALL: Well, yeah, it's good names, so people love to talk about it. But it's true, so we have this great theory at work, but the fact is that we don't know\u2026 FLATOW: How can it work if we don't know what 96 percent of the universe is made out of? (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: You know, it's like I sell you a toaster and I say, well, it doesn't work for 96 percent of the time, but that four percent of the time it's a great toaster. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. RANDALL: But for you to get your toaster to work, all you need to do is press that button. FLATOW: Right. Dr. RANDALL: You don't need the detailed properties. And in the same way, we have dark matter and dark energy out there, and we know what its gravitational properties are. And we know some things about (unintelligible)we haven't seen it. So we know enough about its properties that we can actually determine how it's affected the universe's evolution. But we don't know fundamentally what it is, if it's a particle, what is its mass, what are its other interactions other than gravity. So we see the gravitational effects but we don't know what else\u2026 FLATOW: And one of the holy grails of physics has been to try to unite all the different particles and forces of things, right? We have particles, we have forces, we have objects and we have forces and trying to unite all of them, and it has not, it's - it's worked pretty well except possibly for just getting gravity in there, right? It just refuses to bend. Dr. RANDALL: Well, it - actually, gravity makes things bend quite a bit. FLATOW: That was a bad choice of words. I knew when it came out of my mouth. Dr. RANDALL: But actually, we have made progress. We don't know for a fact that things are unified - and again, this gets back to this question of sort of origins versus late-stage evolution. We understand a lot about forces. We understand that if we can track them back to how strong they would have been at higher energies, that actually it looks like they might have unified, they could have had the same strength. We don't know for a fact that this has happened. We haven't seen experimental evidence, for example, through proton decay, but there is evidence that this could have been true. And the way a matter organizes itself, it looks like its true. It doesn't obviously work with gravity. Gravity looks different, but particularly in these extra-dimensional theories, which we can go in to later, it does look like there's a possibility that all of this can fit together, at least in a higher dimensional universe. So it's something that's a little beyond\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. RANDALL: \u2026what we really have knew in detail experimentally, but there is theoretical motivation to think that this might have happened. FLATOW: Well, let's talk about - let's talk about gravity a bit more, because you talk about it in your book and in writings as one of the great mysteries about gravity, is why you can have a refrigerator magnet hold that little note upon the refrigerator, yet you have the whole mass of the Earth tugging in the opposite directions, and it can't pull that little note off the refrigerator. Dr. RANDALL: Right. FLATOW: It's so weak, it can't even do that, and that's something that you have been exploring. Dr. RANDALL: And the fact that, you know, we can raise our arms and jump up and down. We have the entire Earth acting on us. But the point is that gravity is a fundamental force. That is to say, if I took two elementary particles, an electron and positron or two electrons, and asked about the relative strength of gravity and electromagnetism, gravity is far, far weaker, over (unintelligible) weaker. It's an extremely weak force at a fundamental level. And that is one of the puzzles that we face as particle physicists - why should gravity be so much weaker than the other forces that we know about? And even if you're willing to just grant me - okay, there's this incredibly tiny number that exists, it almost seems inconsistent, and this is why we pay so much attention to it. If you put together quantum mechanics and special relativity and you asked about what those two theories together tell us, we would expect that gravity should be comparable in strength to these other forces. No, we can adjust parameters. We can put in what we call a fine tuning. FLATOW: We could cheat. Dr. RANDALL: It's almost a cheat. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. RANDALL: Technically it works. But everyone knows it's more like a placeholder. FLATOW: Okay, I'll go with that word. Dr. RANDALL: Everyone knows that there should be some explanations for that. FLATOW: Right. Dr. RANDALL: And that's what really motivates a lot of our thinking now because there's this puzzle. It exists. We know there should be some more satisfying resolution, and that's what's led us to some of these more interesting theories that we talked about. FLATOW: And one of your ways of resolving this, saying there are not just four dimensions here. There's a fifth dimension. Let me see if I get this right, and you'll tell me I've got it all wrong. The reason that gravity is weak is because we're feeling only a small part of the force of gravity because it resides next to us, unseen, in a different dimension, in a fifth dimension, and it just slightly comes into our dimension. Did I do that justice at all? Dr. RANDALL: That's not too far off. FLATOW: Not too far off. So - and before I talk about this, I want to say that this puzzle of the weakness of gravity is a puzzle that's plagued particle physics for years, ever since we put together what's known as the standard model of physics. Just like for cosmology, we really do know quite a bit, in particle physics, we know quite a bit, but this puzzle about explaining the weakness of gravity has been around for years, and physicists have puzzled over it. And there are some potential explanations without invoking an extra dimension of space, but they're not entirely satisfying, which is one of the reasons it made sense to think about, could it be explained in another dimension. And what Raman Sundrum and I found is that if there is another dimension, you can have gravity essentially concentrated in another dimension. It's actually not that far away because it decreases so quickly as you go away from that region where it's concentrated that if you're anywhere expect at that place, you could find that gravity. It's naturally very weak. FLATOW: Is that dimension all around us? We just don't see it? Dr. RANDALL: I could be everywhere. FLATOW: Is it next to us? It is above us? Does it surround us? Are these too simple questions, right? Dr. RANDALL: Very simple. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: They're simple for our - well, my little mind. Dr. RANDALL: No, the problem is that, so when we think about extra dimensions, of course we all get puzzled because we don't see those extra dimensions, we don't feel them, we don't experience them. And the fact is, we don't know if that's a function of the way we are, how we see things. For example, it could be that the way we see it through photons, maybe don't go through the extra dimension. So maybe we can only see the dimensions that we know of, the three. But that doesn't mean they don't exist. And one of the things that we do as physicists is say, suppose that was there. Is it consistent with what we've seen so far? And it's completely consistent to have an extra dimension that we haven't yet observed. FLATOW: Is it possible to find that dimension? Dr. RANDALL: That's a great question, and what we can find, if this explanation of the weakness of gravity is correct, we can find evidence that the extra dimension exists, and it would be not by looking directly into the extra dimension but by having it sort of come to us in the sense that there could be extra particles that essentially travel in the extra dimension. They have momentum associated with the extra dimensions. But what we would see are particles that look like the ones we know about. That is to say, they interact in similar ways, but they're heavier because they have this momentum from the extra dimension. FLATOW: They're given the momentum from the extra dimension? Dr. RANDALL: Essentially. FLATOW: Do we watch them cross over here? Dr. RANDALL: Well, we would just see them as particles. We would say look, there's a heavy particle. Oh, but look at that, it has properties very similar to particles we know about. And in fact, you can look at detailed properties and say, you know, maybe that particle is associated with gravity, and it's by doing detailed tests of looking at what we see that we can say does this particle spectrum agree with what you would predict if there was an extra dimension. FLATOW: And how would we see the particle if it's in the other dimension? Dr. RANDALL: Ah. FLATOW: Ah, there's the rub. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. RANDALL: No, there's not a rub. We're all looking forward to it because we're hoping that the Large Hadron Collider, otherwise known as the LHC - this giant accelerator that will hopefully turn on this year, located near Geneva, Switzerland - is going to collide together beams of protons at incredibly high energy. Now why high energy? Because E=mc2. So if I have high energy, I can make particles that have higher mass, m. And these particles that have this mass from the extra dimension or any other particle associated with this -explaining this weakness of gravity should be able to be produced there, and so there will be incredibly detailed experiments that look for when those proton beams collide, what comes out? What comes out that's new that we wouldn't have had otherwise? FLATOW: So you'll be looking for those particles? Dr. RANDALL: I won't be looking, but I'll be looking forward to my experimental colleagues looking for that. FLATOW: And that will - will that prove it or just suggest that you're on the right trail? Dr. RANDALL: Well, you know, this question of proof in science is always a slippery slope because as you know, we prove things with some probability. We say this is - there is some confidence level in what we see. So we will be able to - we won't be able to absolutely prove - but we will be able to get, to be able to show that there is very strong evidence or not very strong evidence for any particular theory. FLATOW: We'll come back and talk more with Lisa Randall, author of \"Warp Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions. \" Also, we'll take your questions here in our audience and also on 1-800-989-8255 is our number. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break. (Soundbite of applause) (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. You're listening to Science Friday from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to Science Friday from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow here in Tallahassee, talking with Lisa Randall, who is author of \"Warp Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions. \" She's also a professor of physics at Harvard University, and she was telling us there will be hopefully some experiments happening at the Large Hadron Collider, which is really a big, underground ring at the border of - the French border in Switzerland. And what - if we find a particle that will give us some idea that possibly this, your idea, is correct, is there one particle in particular that you're looking for? Dr. RANDALL: Well, again, I just want to emphasize that they're looking for whatever solves the weakness of gravity. They're looking for a Higgs particle that will explain how particles acquire mass, and they're going to try to find whatever explains the weakness of gravity. If the warped geometry that Raman and I worked on is the answer, the particle they might find would be what's called a Kaluza-Klein mode of the graviton. FLATOW: I beg your pardon. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. RANDALL: Exactly, exactly. FLATOW: The - say that again? Dr. RANDALL: So the graviton is the particle that communicates gravity. It's analogous to a photon that communicates the force of electromagnetism. That is to say, charged particles exchange a photon, every massive particle exchanges gravitons. A Kaluza-Klein partner of a graviton is a particle that's like the graviton. That is to say, it interacts with everything that has mass or energy, but it's heavier, and it's heavier because it has extra-dimensional momentum. So it's a particle that really is associated with the existence of extra dimensions whose properties we understand. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go our audience microphone. Yes, sir. Unidentified Man #1: Dr. Randall, I'm a big fan, just first off. Dr. RANDALL: Thank you. Unidentified Man #1: The question I have for you is, you've spoken of fifth-dimensional space. I know mathematically, they've shown there's many more dimensions beyond this, I believe up to 13 at last count. How do these additional dimensions jive with your model? FLATOW: Yes, that was my next question. String theory talks about all these dimensions. You're only talking about one more dimension at a time. Dr. RANDALL: I'm only - so let me explain, first of all, what I do. I don't strictly do string theory. I'm trying to understand how the properties of our universe can be explained through theoretical ideas such as those that emerge from string theory. So I don't necessarily need the full panoply of whatever is in string theory. We can say there might be an extra dimension. What would its effect be? If there are these other dimensions, they obviously have to be hidden, just like the fifth one does, the fifth dimension of space-time. And it could be that they're curled up in a tiny size. It could be that they're warped. One of the other things that Raman and I showed is that an extra dimension could be hidden because it's extremely warped. So obviously, if these other dimensions are there, they have to be hidden in some way. However, we're really focusing on what plays a role in what we can observe, what we can explain about our universe and what we can observe, and that's why we're just concentrating on this fifth space-time dimension. FLATOW: What a great name for a group, Fifth Dimension. Nah, it would never work. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Never going to work. Let's got to phones, to\u2026 Dr. RANDALL: I have the album cover in my office. FLATOW: I'll be you do, framed no less. Let's go to Tavert(ph) in Tucson. Hi, welcome to Science Friday. Hi, are you there? TAVERT (Caller): Hi. FLATOW: Go ahead. TAVERT: Well, I just had a question. You know, you think about, like, electromagnetism, which I know you were comparing to gravity in ways, but it being weaker. Electromagnetism having, you know, positive and negative force. Is there any evidence, be it observed or theoretical, that gravity has, you know, two sides of its force, you know, or maybe polar like electromagnetism? Dr. RANDALL: Well, one of the other great mysteries that we sort of started to allude to about the universe is the fact that we now know that the acceleration of the universe is actually accelerating. And that is, in some sense, accounted for by, in some sense, what people would call a repulsive gravitational force. It looks like it has a different side. Really, we understand it in terms of a different type of matter or energy distribution. That's what we call the dark energy, that would accelerate it. But you can, in some sense, think of that as having an opposite sign. FLATOW: Let's go to the next person at the microphone, yeah. Unidentified Woman #1: Dr. Randall, I have a very simple question, but I don't think the answer's very simple. Have physicists decided whether the universe is finite or infinite yet? Is there any way layman can understand why this controversy goes on, and is there any way to explain it? My students are constantly asking this. Dr. RANDALL: Okay, so the first answer is no. I guess we haven't decided. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. RANDALL: The second answer is\u2026 FLATOW: That was pretty fast. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. RANDALL: Yeah. The second answer is yes, there's a reason. We can understand why we can't decide this because we actually only see a finite part of the universe. We know now that the speed of light is finite, and we know the universe has existed, as far as we know, for 13. 6 billion years. So we can only see out that far into the universe. Beyond that, we don't know what happens. There's no evidence that it's finite, and I say that as physicists, we don't actually spend a whole lot of time debating that because we concentrate on things that experimentally observable. So people have asked if it's finite over observable scales, and there's no evidence for that. FLATOW: Thanks for the question. When the Big Bang started, at that moment of the explosion, was it traveling faster than the speed of light? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. RANDALL: No. FLATOW: No, okay. I thought I'd throw that out because everybody keeps asking me, and I keep saying no, and I said, I'll ask Lisa Randall. So (unintelligible). Okay, yes, question. ARIAT(ph): Hello, Ms. Randall, and I'm Ariat, and I have a three-part question for you. First of all, since the universe is constantly expanding, will it ever stop? And how can it keep expanding? Second, since to expand you need to expand into some space around you, what does the universe expand into? And that space, do you think that we can access that space from worm holes and black holes, and maybe it might be another universe or parallel world? Dr. RANDALL: First of all, it's Professor Randall. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. RANDALL: Second of all, we know it's - what's driving expansion is the fact that there is energy throughout the universe, and that produces a gravitational field, and that determines how the universe evolved. And it's often a common misconception that it has - the universe has to evolve into something. The universe is, by definition, everything there is. So the universe can be expanding. And we tend to think of it, because we're familiar with pictures of something expanding into something else, but a better picture is if you sort of imagine it maybe as the surface of a balloon where the balloon itself is expanding and forget about the outside. Just think of the balloon as the universe. So the universe itself can be expanding, but you shouldn't think of it as expanding into something else. FLATOW: You know, what strikes me, as having read a lot of historical science, this is the exact same questions that Albert Einstein was asked 75 years ago by kids who used to write him letters, and he used to write back with the same sort of questions. We're still asking those same questions. Dr. RANDALL: And actually, I mean, Einstein was perplexed by the fact that his solution, when you solve the solution for the equations of motion, it looked like you had an expanding universe. That's what he tried to fudge to make it static because at that point, there was no evidence of an expanding universe. I mean, it's really amazing how recent that discovery is, late 1920s, (unintelligible). FLATOW: And what is even more astounding to me, who follows this sort of thing, is that the expansion did not happen at the beginning. It only kicked in a few billion years ago. That the rapid expansion - at least from what I read - it was only like only 5 or 8 billion years ago that the force was observed. (unintelligible) backwards. Now you'll say I'm incorrect, but I'm happy to hear it. Dr. RANDALL: I mean, we have a detailed theory of how it expanded, and maybe you're referring to the period (unintelligible)\u2026 FLATOW: Yes. Well, no, I'm referring to the dark energy. Dr. RANDALL: Oh, you're referring to the dark energy. Well, the fact that the dark\u2026 FLATOW: Didn't kick in until just a few billion years ago. Dr. RANDALL: Well, the dark energy kicked in rather recently, and that's less surprising - well, it's coincidental in some sense that it's recent, and that's one of the mysteries, why should it be taking over now? But the fact that eventually dark energy takes over is less mysterious because dark energy is something that just sits there throughout time. So even if there's a tiny amount of dark energy, as you can imagine, as things expand, radiation dilutes, matter dilutes - everything else dilutes, but dark energy just sits there. So at some point, the dark energy will win, even no matter how small it started relative to the - as long as there's something around. FLATOW: And we have no idea what that energy is. Dr. RANDALL: Well, you know, sometimes it's even hard to ask what we mean by asking what that energy is. I mean\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: (Unintelligible) 96 percent. Dr. RANDALL: Well, no. There's only 70 percent, 25 percent's dark matter. FLATOW: Well, we don't know what the dark - well, we know what they might be. Dr. RANDALL: We know how to think about dark matter. FLATOW: Okay. Okay. I'll give you that. Dr. RANDALL: Dark energy, that's another mystery which is just - why isn't it enormously bigger? I mean, according to, again, the same thing - the quantum mechanics and special relativity, we expect to have energy that just (unintelligible). That's one of the things that I (unintelligible) on, is that the absolute value of energy is meaningful. I mean, before that, you know, in your college or whatever - high school class, you learn about relative energies. But the absolute energy is meaningful too, because it determines the evolution of the universe. And understanding why that value is what it is, is a big mystery. FLATOW: Mm-hmm, 1-800-989-8255. Yes, another question out there. MARIE(ph): My name is Marie and I have a question to Dr. Randall. Well, to get it a little bit distracted from physics, I have a question about women and science. And you've been a woman - you probably been asked this many, many times but I'm still wondering, you can tell us how it is for you, being a woman, in physics. Usually physics is dominated by men and maybe it's not true anymore, maybe it was 50 years ago, 60 years ago - does it play to your advantage or vice versa or maybe you can recall some funny stories the way, you know\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) MARIE: \u2026the way you were explaining (unintelligible)\u2026 FLATOW: We only have a half hour left (unintelligible) (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Go ahead. Dr. RANDALL: I don't know where to start to answer that question. You know, there's\u2026 FLATOW: What's it like to be a woman physicist? Let's start with the first one. Is it - is it unusual now? Dr. RANDALL: You know, it's the only thing I've ever been. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. RANDALL: It's still unusual. I mean, it's still mostly men. But it's the only thing I've ever been. I mean, you do the science and you hope that that suffices. I mean, of course, there are situations where it's unusual - like, for example, this one where I'd rather be answering a question about science and I'm answering a question about this. But it's - there's no simple answer. I mean it's - there's a long conversation to be had. And I'm not saying it's a simple thing and I'm not saying that it's easy. But\u2026 FLATOW: Maybe you should write a book about it, maybe write a book and get it out of the way. Dr. RANDALL: You know, I thought it was much better, actually, to write a book about science and just say, you know, there are women doing science. I thought that was much more important. FLATOW: Okay. (Soundbite of applause) FLATOW: Well, let me ask you one - let me ask you another off-topic question, but I think it's very much relevant in the news these days. President Obama says he wants to restore science to its proper place. (Soundbite of applause) FLATOW: Where do you see that proper place is? Dr. RANDALL: Actually it's very nice you gave me that lead in because when people from the NSF found out I was going to be on this show, they said, you know, could you put in a plug for basic science? Because it's actually appalling how ill-funded basic science is. I mean, you know, when I was told that, I said, well, can I get some numbers? And the amounts of money that goes into the kind of research we do through the NSF and through the DOE, it's amazingly small. And last year, it decreased. And, you know, this is how we produce the next generation of, at least some of the great thinkers, and people who think scientifically. And it's very easy to get, you know, when we think about the short term, to think about immediate solutions. But we think about big questions that take a long time, but it's also a way of thinking about the world that clearly has been useful to us over the years. And I think one can't emphasize enough how important basic science is and how important it is to keep supporting it over time. FLATOW: Doesn't that put the responsibility on you, as a scientist and other scientists, to be able to explain to the public what you do and the importance of it? Dr. RANDALL: And that is one of the reasons that I thought it was important to try to write a book or to try to be in places like this to explain it, because it's very nice for us all to understand that of course the excitement of science is doing the science and sharing it with your colleagues. But it's also exciting to find out that there are all this people out here who want to know what you're doing. And they want to understand it. And it doesn't mean that everyone is obligated to understand it. But if people want to know why this is exciting, what's happening, what it means they should be - that information should be out there. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. RANDALL: And I thought it was important to communicate that. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So, we only have a few minutes left in this segment. So where do you, yourself, go now? You wait for these experiments to produce some results and\u2026 Dr. RANDALL: We don't wait. FLATOW: You don't wait. You're just moving on to the next\u2026 Dr. RANDALL: Well, so, what are we thinking about now? We're thinking about ways - so we interact with the experiments in the sense of we try to think about are there - first of all, what they should look for in the terms of what models we build. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. RANDALL: How they should look. Are there experiments they're not doing that they should be doing? Or is there a way to stretch their capabilities. So, we're thinking about that. A lot of us in particle physics are also thinking about cosmological issues these days. Dark matter is very exciting. I'll talk about that in the talk later tonight. But right now is a very exciting time dark matter. And there does seem to be perhaps a connection between dark matter and the scales that will be studied at the Large Hadron Collider. So, it's important to understand what the implications of particle physics could be for cosmology and vice versa. FLATOW: So we might get some dark matter particles out of the Large Hadron Collider? Dr. RANDALL: It's conceivable that we will at least understand what is the overall theory in which the dark matter particle resides. And, if we're very lucky, actually there could be evidence of the dark matter particle. FLATOW: So this is an exciting time to be a physicist. Dr. RANDALL: It is an exciting time to be a physicist. I'm glad you said that. FLATOW: Yeah. I'm in the wrong business. Thank you very much, Dr. Randall, for taking time to be with us today. (Soundbite of applause) FLATOW: Lisa Randall is author of \"Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimension. \" We're here in Tallahassee on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. And we're going to switch - there you go. Can't walk on my own button (unintelligible). Thank you, Charles.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow and we're broadcasting live from Florida State University in Tallahassee today as part of their Origins '09 conference. And the conference marks 200 years since the birth of Charles Darwin and a 150 since the publication of \"On the Origin of Species,\" the book that unveiled Darwin's new theory on evolution. But this hour we're going to talk about our origins going much further way back - way back, when the appearance of even the earliest species - I'm talking about the origin of the universe. How did all of this get started, everything that we see around us? How did it all get here? Where did it come from? Where do the forces of nature from? I'm getting just out of breath thinking about it.  The stuff we take for granted, for example, like gravity. My next guest, Dr. Lisa Randall, has been thinking, researching, and writing about these mysteries and she has formulated some interesting explanations for them. And those explanations include the existence of extra dimensions, a la Rod Serling, where are you? This is really interesting stuff, and might make you think that we're talking about science fiction, but we're not. And if you'd like to talk with us about that, our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK, and we have almost 10,000 twitterers on our - tweeting us these days, and you can join the tweeterer twitterers at the S-sign followed by SciFri, if you like to you do that.  Also in Second Life we have our avatars having a meeting up there and sending in questions to us. Lisa Randall is the author of \"Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions. \" She is also a professor of physics at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Dr. LISA RANDALL (Harvard University): Thank you for having me here.  FLATOW: Good to see you. You're here for the Origins conference. How much do we really know about the origin of the universe? How much speculation? Give us a little update on that.  Dr. RANDALL: Well, you know, it's a little bit ironic that the title is Origins because what we know about is evolution. We know how things have changed over time. But what we don't actually know, I will confess right from the beginning, is how things started. We don't understand the very first moments. But we do have an incredibly precise and detailed theory of how the universe has come to evolve over time, the Big Bang theory, coupled with something called cosmological inflation.  So we know the universe began as some hot plasma that's cooled down over time. We can see evidence of the radiation in the sky and look at that radiation and it tells us detailed properties of what the universe looked like earlier on. We can see evidence that the universe is expanding. We can see evidence that actually details nuclear abundances.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. RANDALL: So it's a very precise theory.  FLATOW: Yeah. But one of the great mysteries of the universe is why we only can see four percent of it, right? Isn't 96 percent of the universe\u2026  Dr. RANDALL: You're jumping right into the stuff we don't know.  FLATOW: Dark stuff. Well, I mean we talk about this all the time. I love to talk about this, you know, the dark energy and the dark matter.  Dr. RANDALL: Well, yeah, it's good names, so people love to talk about it. But it's true, so we have this great theory at work, but the fact is that we don't know\u2026  FLATOW: How can it work if we don't know what 96 percent of the universe is made out of?  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: You know, it's like I sell you a toaster and I say, well, it doesn't work for 96 percent of the time, but that four percent of the time it's a great toaster.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. RANDALL: But for you to get your toaster to work, all you need to do is press that button.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. RANDALL: You don't need the detailed properties. And in the same way, we have dark matter and dark energy out there, and we know what its gravitational properties are. And we know some things about (unintelligible)we haven't seen it. So we know enough about its properties that we can actually determine how it's affected the universe's evolution. But we don't know fundamentally what it is, if it's a particle, what is its mass, what are its other interactions other than gravity. So we see the gravitational effects but we don't know what else\u2026  FLATOW: And one of the holy grails of physics has been to try to unite all the different particles and forces of things, right? We have particles, we have forces, we have objects and we have forces and trying to unite all of them, and it has not, it's - it's worked pretty well except possibly for just getting gravity in there, right? It just refuses to bend.  Dr. RANDALL: Well, it - actually, gravity makes things bend quite a bit.  FLATOW: That was a bad choice of words. I knew when it came out of my mouth.  Dr. RANDALL: But actually, we have made progress. We don't know for a fact that things are unified - and again, this gets back to this question of sort of origins versus late-stage evolution. We understand a lot about forces. We understand that if we can track them back to how strong they would have been at higher energies, that actually it looks like they might have unified, they could have had the same strength.  We don't know for a fact that this has happened. We haven't seen experimental evidence, for example, through proton decay, but there is evidence that this could have been true. And the way a matter organizes itself, it looks like its true. It doesn't obviously work with gravity. Gravity looks different, but particularly in these extra-dimensional theories, which we can go in to later, it does look like there's a possibility that all of this can fit together, at least in a higher dimensional universe. So it's something that's a little beyond\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. RANDALL: \u2026what we really have knew in detail experimentally, but there is theoretical motivation to think that this might have happened.  FLATOW: Well, let's talk about - let's talk about gravity a bit more, because you talk about it in your book and in writings as one of the great mysteries about gravity, is why you can have a refrigerator magnet hold that little note upon the refrigerator, yet you have the whole mass of the Earth tugging in the opposite directions, and it can't pull that little note off the refrigerator.  Dr. RANDALL: Right.  FLATOW: It's so weak, it can't even do that, and that's something that you have been exploring.  Dr. RANDALL: And the fact that, you know, we can raise our arms and jump up and down. We have the entire Earth acting on us. But the point is that gravity is a fundamental force. That is to say, if I took two elementary particles, an electron and positron or two electrons, and asked about the relative strength of gravity and electromagnetism, gravity is far, far weaker, over (unintelligible) weaker. It's an extremely weak force at a fundamental level. And that is one of the puzzles that we face as particle physicists - why should gravity be so much weaker than the other forces that we know about?  And even if you're willing to just grant me - okay, there's this incredibly tiny number that exists, it almost seems inconsistent, and this is why we pay so much attention to it. If you put together quantum mechanics and special relativity and you asked about what those two theories together tell us, we would expect that gravity should be comparable in strength to these other forces. No, we can adjust parameters. We can put in what we call a fine tuning.  FLATOW: We could cheat.  Dr. RANDALL: It's almost a cheat.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. RANDALL: Technically it works. But everyone knows it's more like a placeholder.  FLATOW: Okay, I'll go with that word.  Dr. RANDALL: Everyone knows that there should be some explanations for that.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. RANDALL: And that's what really motivates a lot of our thinking now because there's this puzzle. It exists. We know there should be some more satisfying resolution, and that's what's led us to some of these more interesting theories that we talked about.  FLATOW: And one of your ways of resolving this, saying there are not just four dimensions here. There's a fifth dimension. Let me see if I get this right, and you'll tell me I've got it all wrong. The reason that gravity is weak is because we're feeling only a small part of the force of gravity because it resides next to us, unseen, in a different dimension, in a fifth dimension, and it just slightly comes into our dimension. Did I do that justice at all?  Dr. RANDALL: That's not too far off.  FLATOW: Not too far off. So - and before I talk about this, I want to say that this puzzle of the weakness of gravity is a puzzle that's plagued particle physics for years, ever since we put together what's known as the standard model of physics.  Just like for cosmology, we really do know quite a bit, in particle physics, we know quite a bit, but this puzzle about explaining the weakness of gravity has been around for years, and physicists have puzzled over it.  And there are some potential explanations without invoking an extra dimension of space, but they're not entirely satisfying, which is one of the reasons it made sense to think about, could it be explained in another dimension.  And what Raman Sundrum and I found is that if there is another dimension, you can have gravity essentially concentrated in another dimension. It's actually not that far away because it decreases so quickly as you go away from that region where it's concentrated that if you're anywhere expect at that place, you could find that gravity. It's naturally very weak.  FLATOW: Is that dimension all around us? We just don't see it?  Dr. RANDALL: I could be everywhere.  FLATOW: Is it next to us? It is above us? Does it surround us? Are these too simple questions, right?  Dr. RANDALL: Very simple.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: They're simple for our - well, my little mind.  Dr. RANDALL: No, the problem is that, so when we think about extra dimensions, of course we all get puzzled because we don't see those extra dimensions, we don't feel them, we don't experience them.  And the fact is, we don't know if that's a function of the way we are, how we see things. For example, it could be that the way we see it through photons, maybe don't go through the extra dimension. So maybe we can only see the dimensions that we know of, the three.  But that doesn't mean they don't exist. And one of the things that we do as physicists is say, suppose that was there. Is it consistent with what we've seen so far? And it's completely consistent to have an extra dimension that we haven't yet observed.  FLATOW: Is it possible to find that dimension?  Dr. RANDALL: That's a great question, and what we can find, if this explanation of the weakness of gravity is correct, we can find evidence that the extra dimension exists, and it would be not by looking directly into the extra dimension but by having it sort of come to us in the sense that there could be extra particles that essentially travel in the extra dimension.  They have momentum associated with the extra dimensions. But what we would see are particles that look like the ones we know about. That is to say, they interact in similar ways, but they're heavier because they have this momentum from the extra dimension.  FLATOW: They're given the momentum from the extra dimension?  Dr. RANDALL: Essentially.  FLATOW: Do we watch them cross over here?  Dr. RANDALL: Well, we would just see them as particles. We would say look, there's a heavy particle. Oh, but look at that, it has properties very similar to particles we know about. And in fact, you can look at detailed properties and say, you know, maybe that particle is associated with gravity, and it's by doing detailed tests of looking at what we see that we can say does this particle spectrum agree with what you would predict if there was an extra dimension.  FLATOW: And how would we see the particle if it's in the other dimension?  Dr. RANDALL: Ah.  FLATOW: Ah, there's the rub.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. RANDALL: No, there's not a rub. We're all looking forward to it because we're hoping that the Large Hadron Collider, otherwise known as the LHC - this giant accelerator that will hopefully turn on this year, located near Geneva, Switzerland - is going to collide together beams of protons at incredibly high energy.  Now why high energy? Because E=mc2. So if I have high energy, I can make particles that have higher mass, m. And these particles that have this mass from the extra dimension or any other particle associated with this -explaining this weakness of gravity should be able to be produced there, and so there will be incredibly detailed experiments that look for when those proton beams collide, what comes out? What comes out that's new that we wouldn't have had otherwise?  FLATOW: So you'll be looking for those particles?  Dr. RANDALL: I won't be looking, but I'll be looking forward to my experimental colleagues looking for that.  FLATOW: And that will - will that prove it or just suggest that you're on the right trail?  Dr. RANDALL: Well, you know, this question of proof in science is always a slippery slope because as you know, we prove things with some probability.  We say this is - there is some confidence level in what we see. So we will be able to - we won't be able to absolutely prove - but we will be able to get, to be able to show that there is very strong evidence or not very strong evidence for any particular theory.  FLATOW: We'll come back and talk more with Lisa Randall, author of \"Warp Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions. \" Also, we'll take your questions here in our audience and also on 1-800-989-8255 is our number. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break.  (Soundbite of applause)  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. You're listening to Science Friday from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to Science Friday from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow here in Tallahassee, talking with Lisa Randall, who is author of \"Warp Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions. \" She's also a professor of physics at Harvard University, and she was telling us there will be hopefully some experiments happening at the Large Hadron Collider, which is really a big, underground ring at the border of - the French border in Switzerland.  And what - if we find a particle that will give us some idea that possibly this, your idea, is correct, is there one particle in particular that you're looking for?  Dr. RANDALL: Well, again, I just want to emphasize that they're looking for whatever solves the weakness of gravity. They're looking for a Higgs particle that will explain how particles acquire mass, and they're going to try to find whatever explains the weakness of gravity.  If the warped geometry that Raman and I worked on is the answer, the particle they might find would be what's called a Kaluza-Klein mode of the graviton.  FLATOW: I beg your pardon.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. RANDALL: Exactly, exactly.  FLATOW: The - say that again?  Dr. RANDALL: So the graviton is the particle that communicates gravity. It's analogous to a photon that communicates the force of electromagnetism. That is to say, charged particles exchange a photon, every massive particle exchanges gravitons.  A Kaluza-Klein partner of a graviton is a particle that's like the graviton. That is to say, it interacts with everything that has mass or energy, but it's heavier, and it's heavier because it has extra-dimensional momentum.  So it's a particle that really is associated with the existence of extra dimensions whose properties we understand.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go our audience microphone. Yes, sir.  Unidentified Man #1: Dr. Randall, I'm a big fan, just first off.  Dr. RANDALL: Thank you.  Unidentified Man #1: The question I have for you is, you've spoken of fifth-dimensional space. I know mathematically, they've shown there's many more dimensions beyond this, I believe up to 13 at last count. How do these additional dimensions jive with your model?  FLATOW: Yes, that was my next question. String theory talks about all these dimensions. You're only talking about one more dimension at a time.  Dr. RANDALL: I'm only - so let me explain, first of all, what I do. I don't strictly do string theory. I'm trying to understand how the properties of our universe can be explained through theoretical ideas such as those that emerge from string theory.  So I don't necessarily need the full panoply of whatever is in string theory. We can say there might be an extra dimension. What would its effect be?  If there are these other dimensions, they obviously have to be hidden, just like the fifth one does, the fifth dimension of space-time. And it could be that they're curled up in a tiny size. It could be that they're warped. One of the other things that Raman and I showed is that an extra dimension could be hidden because it's extremely warped.  So obviously, if these other dimensions are there, they have to be hidden in some way. However, we're really focusing on what plays a role in what we can observe, what we can explain about our universe and what we can observe, and that's why we're just concentrating on this fifth space-time dimension.  FLATOW: What a great name for a group, Fifth Dimension. Nah, it would never work.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Never going to work. Let's got to phones, to\u2026  Dr. RANDALL: I have the album cover in my office.  FLATOW: I'll be you do, framed no less. Let's go to Tavert(ph) in Tucson. Hi, welcome to Science Friday. Hi, are you there?  TAVERT (Caller): Hi.  FLATOW: Go ahead.  TAVERT: Well, I just had a question. You know, you think about, like, electromagnetism, which I know you were comparing to gravity in ways, but it being weaker. Electromagnetism having, you know, positive and negative force. Is there any evidence, be it observed or theoretical, that gravity has, you know, two sides of its force, you know, or maybe polar like electromagnetism?  Dr. RANDALL: Well, one of the other great mysteries that we sort of started to allude to about the universe is the fact that we now know that the acceleration of the universe is actually accelerating.  And that is, in some sense, accounted for by, in some sense, what people would call a repulsive gravitational force. It looks like it has a different side.  Really, we understand it in terms of a different type of matter or energy distribution. That's what we call the dark energy, that would accelerate it.  But you can, in some sense, think of that as having an opposite sign.  FLATOW: Let's go to the next person at the microphone, yeah.  Unidentified Woman #1: Dr. Randall, I have a very simple question, but I don't think the answer's very simple. Have physicists decided whether the universe is finite or infinite yet?  Is there any way layman can understand why this controversy goes on, and is there any way to explain it? My students are constantly asking this.  Dr. RANDALL: Okay, so the first answer is no. I guess we haven't decided.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. RANDALL: The second answer is\u2026  FLATOW: That was pretty fast.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. RANDALL: Yeah. The second answer is yes, there's a reason. We can understand why we can't decide this because we actually only see a finite part of the universe. We know now that the speed of light is finite, and we know the universe has existed, as far as we know, for 13. 6 billion years.  So we can only see out that far into the universe. Beyond that, we don't know what happens. There's no evidence that it's finite, and I say that as physicists, we don't actually spend a whole lot of time debating that because we concentrate on things that experimentally observable.  So people have asked if it's finite over observable scales, and there's no evidence for that.  FLATOW: Thanks for the question. When the Big Bang started, at that moment of the explosion, was it traveling faster than the speed of light?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. RANDALL: No.  FLATOW: No, okay. I thought I'd throw that out because everybody keeps asking me, and I keep saying no, and I said, I'll ask Lisa Randall. So (unintelligible). Okay, yes, question.  ARIAT(ph): Hello, Ms. Randall, and I'm Ariat, and I have a three-part question for you. First of all, since the universe is constantly expanding, will it ever stop? And how can it keep expanding?  Second, since to expand you need to expand into some space around you, what does the universe expand into? And that space, do you think that we can access that space from worm holes and black holes, and maybe it might be another universe or parallel world?  Dr. RANDALL: First of all, it's Professor Randall.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. RANDALL: Second of all, we know it's - what's driving expansion is the fact that there is energy throughout the universe, and that produces a gravitational field, and that determines how the universe evolved.  And it's often a common misconception that it has - the universe has to evolve into something. The universe is, by definition, everything there is. So the universe can be expanding. And we tend to think of it, because we're familiar with pictures of something expanding into something else, but a better picture is if you sort of imagine it maybe as the surface of a balloon where the balloon itself is expanding and forget about the outside. Just think of the balloon as the universe.  So the universe itself can be expanding, but you shouldn't think of it as expanding into something else.  FLATOW: You know, what strikes me, as having read a lot of historical science, this is the exact same questions that Albert Einstein was asked 75 years ago by kids who used to write him letters, and he used to write back with the same sort of questions. We're still asking those same questions.  Dr. RANDALL: And actually, I mean, Einstein was perplexed by the fact that his solution, when you solve the solution for the equations of motion, it looked like you had an expanding universe. That's what he tried to fudge to make it static because at that point, there was no evidence of an expanding universe.  I mean, it's really amazing how recent that discovery is, late 1920s, (unintelligible).  FLATOW: And what is even more astounding to me, who follows this sort of thing, is that the expansion did not happen at the beginning. It only kicked in a few billion years ago. That the rapid expansion - at least from what I read - it was only like only 5 or 8 billion years ago that the force was observed. (unintelligible) backwards. Now you'll say I'm incorrect, but I'm happy to hear it.  Dr. RANDALL: I mean, we have a detailed theory of how it expanded, and maybe you're referring to the period (unintelligible)\u2026  FLATOW: Yes. Well, no, I'm referring to the dark energy.  Dr. RANDALL: Oh, you're referring to the dark energy. Well, the fact that the dark\u2026  FLATOW: Didn't kick in until just a few billion years ago.  Dr. RANDALL: Well, the dark energy kicked in rather recently, and that's less surprising - well, it's coincidental in some sense that it's recent, and that's one of the mysteries, why should it be taking over now? But the fact that eventually dark energy takes over is less mysterious because dark energy is something that just sits there throughout time.  So even if there's a tiny amount of dark energy, as you can imagine, as things expand, radiation dilutes, matter dilutes - everything else dilutes, but dark energy just sits there.  So at some point, the dark energy will win, even no matter how small it started relative to the - as long as there's something around.  FLATOW: And we have no idea what that energy is.  Dr. RANDALL: Well, you know, sometimes it's even hard to ask what we mean by asking what that energy is. I mean\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: (Unintelligible) 96 percent.  Dr. RANDALL: Well, no. There's only 70 percent, 25 percent's dark matter.  FLATOW: Well, we don't know what the dark - well, we know what they might be.  Dr. RANDALL: We know how to think about dark matter.  FLATOW: Okay. Okay. I'll give you that.  Dr. RANDALL: Dark energy, that's another mystery which is just - why isn't it enormously bigger? I mean, according to, again, the same thing - the quantum mechanics and special relativity, we expect to have energy that just (unintelligible). That's one of the things that I (unintelligible) on, is that the absolute value of energy is meaningful. I mean, before that, you know, in your college or whatever - high school class, you learn about relative energies.  But the absolute energy is meaningful too, because it determines the evolution of the universe. And understanding why that value is what it is, is a big mystery.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm, 1-800-989-8255. Yes, another question out there.  MARIE(ph): My name is Marie and I have a question to Dr. Randall. Well, to get it a little bit distracted from physics, I have a question about women and science. And you've been a woman - you probably been asked this many, many times but I'm still wondering, you can tell us how it is for you, being a woman, in physics. Usually physics is dominated by men and maybe it's not true anymore, maybe it was 50 years ago, 60 years ago - does it play to your advantage or vice versa or maybe you can recall some funny stories the way, you know\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  MARIE: \u2026the way you were explaining (unintelligible)\u2026  FLATOW: We only have a half hour left (unintelligible)  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Go ahead.  Dr. RANDALL: I don't know where to start to answer that question. You know, there's\u2026  FLATOW: What's it like to be a woman physicist? Let's start with the first one. Is it - is it unusual now?  Dr. RANDALL: You know, it's the only thing I've ever been.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. RANDALL: It's still unusual. I mean, it's still mostly men. But it's the only thing I've ever been. I mean, you do the science and you hope that that suffices. I mean, of course, there are situations where it's unusual - like, for example, this one where I'd rather be answering a question about science and I'm answering a question about this.  But it's - there's no simple answer. I mean it's - there's a long conversation to be had. And I'm not saying it's a simple thing and I'm not saying that it's easy. But\u2026  FLATOW: Maybe you should write a book about it, maybe write a book and get it out of the way.  Dr. RANDALL: You know, I thought it was much better, actually, to write a book about science and just say, you know, there are women doing science. I thought that was much more important.  FLATOW: Okay.  (Soundbite of applause)  FLATOW: Well, let me ask you one - let me ask you another off-topic question, but I think it's very much relevant in the news these days. President Obama says he wants to restore science to its proper place.  (Soundbite of applause)  FLATOW: Where do you see that proper place is?  Dr. RANDALL: Actually it's very nice you gave me that lead in because when people from the NSF found out I was going to be on this show, they said, you know, could you put in a plug for basic science? Because it's actually appalling how ill-funded basic science is. I mean, you know, when I was told that, I said, well, can I get some numbers? And the amounts of money that goes into the kind of research we do through the NSF and through the DOE, it's amazingly small. And last year, it decreased. And, you know, this is how we produce the next generation of, at least some of the great thinkers, and people who think scientifically.  And it's very easy to get, you know, when we think about the short term, to think about immediate solutions. But we think about big questions that take a long time, but it's also a way of thinking about the world that clearly has been useful to us over the years. And I think one can't emphasize enough how important basic science is and how important it is to keep supporting it over time.  FLATOW: Doesn't that put the responsibility on you, as a scientist and other scientists, to be able to explain to the public what you do and the importance of it?  Dr. RANDALL: And that is one of the reasons that I thought it was important to try to write a book or to try to be in places like this to explain it, because it's very nice for us all to understand that of course the excitement of science is doing the science and sharing it with your colleagues. But it's also exciting to find out that there are all this people out here who want to know what you're doing. And they want to understand it. And it doesn't mean that everyone is obligated to understand it.  But if people want to know why this is exciting, what's happening, what it means they should be - that information should be out there.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. RANDALL: And I thought it was important to communicate that.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So, we only have a few minutes left in this segment. So where do you, yourself, go now? You wait for these experiments to produce some results and\u2026  Dr. RANDALL: We don't wait.  FLATOW: You don't wait. You're just moving on to the next\u2026  Dr. RANDALL: Well, so, what are we thinking about now? We're thinking about ways - so we interact with the experiments in the sense of we try to think about are there - first of all, what they should look for in the terms of what models we build.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. RANDALL: How they should look. Are there experiments they're not doing that they should be doing? Or is there a way to stretch their capabilities. So, we're thinking about that. A lot of us in particle physics are also thinking about cosmological issues these days. Dark matter is very exciting. I'll talk about that in the talk later tonight. But right now is a very exciting time dark matter. And there does seem to be perhaps a connection between dark matter and the scales that will be studied at the Large Hadron Collider. So, it's important to understand what the implications of particle physics could be for cosmology and vice versa.  FLATOW: So we might get some dark matter particles out of the Large Hadron Collider?  Dr. RANDALL: It's conceivable that we will at least understand what is the overall theory in which the dark matter particle resides. And, if we're very lucky, actually there could be evidence of the dark matter particle.  FLATOW: So this is an exciting time to be a physicist.  Dr. RANDALL: It is an exciting time to be a physicist. I'm glad you said that.  FLATOW: Yeah. I'm in the wrong business. Thank you very much, Dr. Randall, for taking time to be with us today.  (Soundbite of applause)  FLATOW: Lisa Randall is author of \"Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimension. \"  We're here in Tallahassee on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.

I'm Ira Flatow. We're in Tallahassee today, broadcasting from Florida State University, where they are celebrating the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth. And by the way, this is also the 150th year since the publication of \"On the Origin of Species,\" Darwin's manuscript that laid out his new theory of evolution by natural selection. Of course, everyone has heard of Darwin. He gets most of the credit for the theory of evolution, and while he deserves to be recognized for his contributions, of course, he couldn't have gotten there without some help. And so for the rest of the hour, the rest of the story, as the late Paul Harvey might have said today. In his new book, \"Remarkable Creatures, my first guest tells us about scientists and adventurers, some trained, some - many of them self-taught - who inspired Darwin and helped prove that he was right. From Alexander von Humboldt to Henry Bates and Roy Chapman Andrews - they're names that you might now have heard of but whose contributions really were enormous. There's even one naturalist who was, let's say, dangerously close to scooping Darwin on his own work. So we're going to talk all about that with my guest, Sean B. Carroll. He is the author of \"Extraordinary Creatures: Epic Adventures in the Search for the Origins of Species. \" He's a professor of molecular biology and genetics at the University of Wisconsin - I'm sure he's happy to be here in Florida, today - and investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Sean. Mr. SEAN B. CARROLL (Biologist; Author, \"Remarkable Creatures\"): Thanks for having me, Ira. FLATOW: The title of your book, I really think it really has a double meaning, \"Extraordinary Creatures,\" because I think it's talking about some of the people in the book, as well as the animals. They were extraordinary people, were they not? Mr. CARROLL: Absolutely. So these were people that had tremendous spirit, tremendous passion for exploring the unknown, and they were driven to discover strange and beautiful creatures, or bizarre fossils, or ancient hominids, whatever it might be. So yeah, it's an intentional double\u2026 FLATOW: Well you know - and I didn't realize how brace some of these people\u2026 They went through malaria and floods, and all kinds of shipwrecks, things like that. Mr. CARROLL: Yeah - cannibals, poisonous snakes, sandstorms, bandits, any number of years spent in jungles or deserts. You know, sometimes it was the animals that were the most dangerous. Sometimes it was the infectious diseases. Sometimes it was the other people that were around. So that was part of the game of exploring the parts of the world that most of the modern world didn't know about. FLATOW: Our number is 1-800-989-8255 if you'd like to talk with Sean Carroll about his book and about origins in general. Also, you can tweet us on Twitter, @scifri, the at sign and S-C-I-F-R-I. And also in Second Life - a whole bunch of avatars are collecting in our Second Life island, and you can - on our SCIENCE FRIDAY island, you can join in and ask questions there, too. Let's talk about some of these people that most people have never heard about. Let's begin where you begin, with a really very interesting guy named Alexander Von Humboldt. Who was he? Mr. CARROLL: Well, Humboldt was a wealthy Prussian, a polymath. He was versed in every field of science and many other disciplines, as well. He was very well-traveled. He had done a fair amount of experimental science in Europe, testing the electrical activity of tissues - many of those experiments conducted on himself. FLATOW: Ouch. Mr. CARROLL: Yeah. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. CARROLL: And then he undertook a voyage in 1799 to 1804 where he traveled through South America and much of central America and wound up that voyage, in fact, in the United States by visiting with Thomas Jefferson. But in the course of that voyage\u2026 He was a compulsive measurer. So he measured everything, the heights of mountains, the temperature of various, you know, waters, taking star positions. He documented a lot of the pre-Columbian world that people didn't know about, collected all sorts of botanical specimens, zoological specimens. He played various games with, for example, electric eels. You know, he was interested in electrical things, and so he and his companion, a botanist named Aim\u00e9 Bonpland, they would sort of handle these eels, and they'd try to figure out if one was handling and touched the other person, would they get a shock, etcetera. So it was sort of a\u2026 FLATOW: And did they? Did they shock themselves? Mr. CARROLL: Well, they said - I don't think they ever figured out exactly what the rhyme or reason was. They just reported that the jolt was so strong, it was stronger than anything they had felt in Europe when they were doing deliberate experiments with electricity. So yeah, he was fascinated by everything, and he documented everything - wound up his trip, as I said, by going to the United States to sit down with Thomas Jefferson. FLATOW: That sounds amazing, just because Jefferson was an amateur himself? He was interested in all this stuff? Mr. CARROLL: Right. So of all things, imagine a letter. The letter of introduction was, you know, to Thomas Jefferson, saying, well, I would like to sit down and talk with you about fossils. Jefferson was a fossil collector. He had brought a lot of fossils to the White House, and he had written what we think is the first American paper on paleontology - prior to becoming president. And he thought that these great creatures that were represented by things like mastodons and mammoths; and an animal that Jefferson had described, it was a kind of giant ground sloth - he thought they were still roaming somewhere in the American West. He did not - Jefferson did not think that animals could go extinct. And so, when he sent, for example, Lewis and Clark west, he told them to be on the lookout for, you know, big elephant-looking things. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: And from reading your book, this is partly a religious belief, was it not, of the time? Mr. CARROLL: Yeah, that the creator would not\u2026 FLATOW: The creator would not let things go extinct. Mr. CARROLL: Yeah, yeah. So that world that - obviously Jefferson, we all recognize him as a brilliant mind, and Von Humboldt was absolutely brilliant -but the world they lived in saw nature as something in perfect harmony; designed such that everything was in its place and sort of living in perfect harmony, both the living things and even the inanimate things; sort of like a landscape painting. It was not to be perturbed. And when Humboldt wrote his travels, he, in fact, he'd sort of copied Jefferson's style from his notes on the state of Virginia and wrote up numerous volumes on his travels through South America and Central America - and these volumes made Humboldt world-famous. FLATOW: And so Darwin would have read these? Mr. CARROLL: Yeah, as a student at Cambridge, Darwin read Von Humboldt's travels, and this inspired him to want to go to the tropics. FLATOW: Did they correspond with each other? Mr. CARROLL: Well, only after Darwin had written \"Voyage of the Beagle. \" So, only after Darwin's voyage, did they correspond. And it's quite a touching correspondence between the young pupil who was inspired to take his voyage and the old sage of Europe. But the - what Darwin describes is, very often he had these volumes of Humboldt, and he was reading them just to buck up his courage on his own voyage - because, you know, he was homesick. He was only a 22-year-old man when he went on the Beagle, and he was constantly seasick. And so\u2026 FLATOW: That's a bad place to be when you're seasick Mr. CARROLL: Yeah. That's commonly - a five-year voyage is not recommended. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. CARROLL: But Von Humboldt's description of what he saw, that's what pulled Darwin, you know, to South America, and that's what kept him going. He didn't know what was going to be around the next bend, what was going to be in the next valley, what was going to be around the next bay. And the impact of prior travelers, you know, to inspire the next generation -well that's still what goes on today. FLATOW: You make the point that while Darwin did not set out on his journey with evolution in mind, two of his contemporaries did - Alfred Russel Wallace and Henry Walter Bates. Mr. CARROLL: Henry Walter Bates, yeah. Now they were younger than Darwin. So they had the benefit, for example, Darwin - to put a time frame on this -Darwin traveled from 1831 to 1836 and then wrote up \"The Voyage of the Beagle,\" his adventures, in the late 1830s. And so when Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Wallace were dreaming of going to the tropics, they had read Darwin, and they had read Humboldt. And in  the 1840s, the idea of, at least the question of \"The Origin of Species\" was percolating in popular culture. And the fundamental question was whether species were specially created by God, immutable, or whether they had come about by natural laws. And so Wallace and Bates, who were two avid collectors - Wallace said, well, let's go to South America, to the Amazon, to collect facts to gather towards the question of the origin of species. FLATOW: And of course, there was a controversy that's been going on for years. Should Wallace be deemed the person who actually created the theory first - or be given credit or share in it? Why has that surfaced? Was he so good and so close, as Darwin was? Mr. CARROLL: Yeah, Wallace was a remarkable man. And I think if Darwin was sitting right here today, he'd be heaping praise on Wallace. And I think what's happened is some amnesia after - I mean, Wallace has been gone almost 100 years. In his day, when Wallace had made his discoveries, and the joint ideas of Wallace and Darwin had been presented, and then Darwin published \"The Origin of Species\" - Wallace was famous, and Wallace was getting quite a great deal of credit, and justifiably so. Because what Wallace had done, and what people are generally not aware of, is that Wallace had traveled to the Amazon for four years, and once exhausted, headed home - only to have his ship catch fire and sink and to lose all his specimens to the bottom of the Atlantic. FLATOW: Wow, everything he had collected. Mr. CARROLL: Everything he had collected in the Amazon went down. FLATOW: Went down. How many years of research? Mr. CARROLL: Four years of collecting and\u2026 FLATOW: So you go out in the field, you brave all the elements, sickness, health, pirates, whatever. You got four years of collection, and you have nothing to show for it. Mr. CARROLL: Nothing to show for it. And of course, I think that would break a lot of people. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. CARROLL: And he spend 10 days in an open lifeboat - and not even knowing if he was going to be rescued. FLATOW: Wow. Mr. CARROLL: And while he said on the rescue ship home that, you know, he would never trust himself on the ocean again, as soon as he got back to England he changed his mind and he said well, I'm not satisfied. I don't have answers toward questions I wanted to ask. I don't have anything to show for the foreign lands that I have explored. And he went off - this time to the Malay Archipelago. He spent eight years traipsing through the jungles in the Malay Archipelago, collecting. He made 96 island-to-island crossings, covering 14,000 miles. He collected 120,000 specimens. FLATOW: And we don't hear about him at all. Mr. CARROLL: No. FLATOW: And all of this, and it's just Darwin that we hear all the time. Mr. CARROLL: Yeah, there's probably a complex set of reasons for that. But Wallace was a remarkable individual, and really Wallace saw similar things that Darwin had. Just as Darwin had seen species particular to particular islands of the Galapagos, say birds, Wallace saw butterflies that were unique to Malay Archipelago and inspired the same sort of thinking. And when you compare what these men were writing as they were putting their thoughts together, there's remarkable parallels to what they were thinking. And I think it's a great example of, you know, two great minds thinking alike. FLATOW: And they got along, right? Mr. CARROLL: They got along beautifully. FLATOW: This, to me, is the most amazing part of it. Mr. CARROLL: They got along beautifully, so\u2026 FLATOW: The competitiveness was not there. Mr. CARROLL: No. I think that - and I think the most telling is Wallace's private correspondence to friends, that he had nothing but the greatest admiration\u2026 And these letters are very touching, and they can be found, for example, on Web sites these days, where a lot of the correspondence is documented. He had nothing but praise and admiration for Darwin. He was relieved that it was really Darwin that brought the theory to the public in the book \"On the Origin of Species. \" He felt that Darwin had created an entirely new branch of science, and he was quite happened to be mentioned in the same breath, or as Darwin did in \"The Origin of Species,\" right at the outset, - mentioned in Darwin's writing. And he dedicated his own book of his Malay Archipelago travels to Charles Darwin. FLATOW: We're talking with Sean Carroll, author of \"Remarkable Creature: Epic Adventures in the Search for the Origins of Species,\" and speaking of nothing but praise, I have nothing but praise for this book. This book is terrific. It's a great book for people who want to know all about the different adventurers. And we'll get into one of them a little bit later who was actually the role model for \"Raiders of the Lost Ark. \" We'll talk about it after this break. So stay with us. We'll be right back from Tallahassee. Don't go away. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow here in Tallahassee. We're talking about - this hour - about the theory of evolution and all the folks who helped Darwin come to his conclusions and provide the evidence to prove he was right. A lot of them dug up the stuff he said might be there. My guest is Sean B. Carroll, the author of \"Extraordinary Creatures: Epic Adventures in the Search for the Origin of Species. \" It's a terrific book. Let's see if we can get some phone calls in before we go on to the next question. If you're here in the audience, please step up to the mike. Let's go to the phones. Let's see if we can go to Ron in Harbor(ph), Pennsylvania. Hi, Ron, are you there? Well, let's go to Brian(ph) in Baltimore. Hi there, Brian. BRIAN (Caller): Hey, how are you doing? FLATOW: Hi there. Go ahead. BRIAN: Hi. Okay, I've got a question. Well, you made the comment about Jefferson, and it kind of dawned on me that, you know, with some hindsight, you can have such brilliant people as Jefferson who could think of things in terms of what was known of the day. My question kind of pertains to that, in terms of what other scientists had theories out there that were being considered, at the time, in competition with the theory of evolution? And I'll take my answer off the air. Thank you. FLATOW: Okay, thanks for calling. Mr. CARROLL: Well, one of the most prominent ones was Lamarque in France, another - a great zoologist. So there were many fantastic scientists, geologists and biologists or zoologists, that were trying to make sense of what they saw in nature. And Lamarque had, basically, the idea that change could take place in a lifetime that then would be passed on to their offspring. So he was aware that change was taking place but didn't have the right idea about how that happened. So Lamarque would probably be the most popular idea that was prevalent at Europe at the time but had not gained traction in England. FLATOW: Let's talk about some of the other terrific characters that you have. I say that with all great love for them, of course - being one myself, some sort of character. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Another one is Eugene Dubois. Who - tell me about - was\u2026 Mr. CARROLL: This is unbelievable. This is one of the most - I think this is the most single-minded expedition I know of in all of natural history. So Dubois is a physician, a Dutch physician, a young physician. He's climbing the ranks. He's brilliant. He's succeeded at everything he's touched - but he's read a lot. And he's reading a lot, this is now in the 1880s. So it's well after \"The Origin of Species,\" but there's a lot of discussion about humans. What about humans? What about the origin of humans? And he gets it in his mind that the most important thing that anybody could discover is the link between apes and humans, and he's going to be the one to do it. And so he says where can I find this link? And he decides well - he's kind of looking at a world map, and he thinks, I think it's going to be in Asia, not Africa - and looking at that map, gee, where could I go? Well, the Dutch East Indies are a Dutch colony. How could I pay my way? Well, I'm a physician. I'll enlist in the Dutch army. FLATOW: What a great idea. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. CARROLL: So he was about to be a full professor of medicine at the University of Amsterdam, and without telling his wife\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. CARROLL: \u2026he enlisted for eight years in the Dutch army. FLATOW: Do you think there was a message there somewhere? Mr. CARROLL: Well, she went along with it, and they had a young baby, and so that was it. They left Amsterdam for Sumatra, and he went and started to experience - be experienced with diseases that he didn't even know existed in the world - but started exploring the caves on Sumatra. And he thought - because there's where Neanderthals had been found in Europe -that ancient hominids, ancient humans, would be found in caves. And after some time in Sumatra, he said this doesn't look so good, I'm going to move over to Java. So he uproots the family again - moves over to Java - and he gets a crew of workmen helping him. And sure enough, after about four years, they find a molar, a skull cap, and a thighbone. This guy has hit the jackpot. It's what we call, today, Homo Erectus. And to understand how lucky Dubois was, what you have to realize is that as soon as he made this find, all sorts of people wanted to follow his footsteps to Asia. No one found anything else for 40 years. So on the Trinil River in Java, he finds these hominid fossils. You know, you've got to think that this is the luckiest dart that anyone has ever\u2026 FLATOW: Well, but doesn't that cast doubt on his finding if everybody's saying we're not finding\u2026? Mr. CARROLL: Well, then they did. Then 40 years last, in the late 1920s, then they found more Homo Erectus on Java, and more things were found in China, and the picture was fleshed out. FLATOW: Was this Java Man? Mr. CARROLL: This is Java Man, that's right, yeah. So Eugene Dubois was - certainly opened a whole new vista on human origins. But you have to appreciate - and there's a picture, actually, in the book that I love because the veranda of his house is piling up with bones. You've got to realize when you're looking for human fossils, you're finding all the other animals that lived at that time, a lot of big animals with big bones. And so he's unearthing tons and tons and tons of bones, really looking for a needle in a haystack of other mammal bones. And he finds that needle. It's remarkable good fortune, but you know, hard-earned good fortune because he put his life on the line to explore these caves and riverbeds in Indonesia. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is the number. Talking with Sean B. Carroll, author of \"Remarkable Creatures. \" Let's talk about the model for Indiana Jones - and there really is one, is there not? Mr. CARROLL: Yeah. George Lucas had admitted this to some degree: Roy Chapman Andrews. So this is a fellow who grew up in Beloit, Wisconsin and liked the outdoors, in the late 1800s. And he collected things, kept them up in his attic, labeled them and saw - went to the Field Museum in Chicago, and that made a big impression on him - that he wanted to work in a natural history museum. So when he graduated college - he was not a very good student. He actually was really good at taxidermy, paid his way through college by stuffing the hunting trophies of Wisconsin hunters - went to the Natural History Museum and applied for a job. And the director tried to kind of ease him down gently and said well, look, we don't have any position here for you. And he said, but you need somebody to sweep the floors, don't you? And he said, man, a man with a college degree doesn't want to sweep floors. And Roy Chapman Andrews said yeah, but these aren't just any floors. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. CARROLL: So his first job was as a floor sweeper at the American Museum of Natural History. Now making a long story short, he was eager to get any kind of real work, and he wound up working on whales and that sent him all over the world. And he fell in love with the Orient, and he wanted to explore Asia, and he wanted to mount some tremendous expedition. And he got the idea of exploring the Gobi Desert, Inner Mongolia, and mounting the largest natural-history expedition ever undertaken. Now this was going to cost a lot of money. FLATOW: Yeah, there's no National Science Foundation. Mr. CARROLL: Yeah, there's no government support for this. But he had learned. He had rubbed shoulders a little bit when he was at the museum with some of the donors to the museum and people like Andrew Carnegie. And so he went around to the titans of industry and finance in New York, J. P. Morgan, the Rockefellers, Chase - told them about this grand idea. And the reason why he was partly going into Inner Mongolia, he wanted to find hominid fossils. He was selling this whole expedition on the idea that they would find more ancient man, just as Dubois had found several decades earlier. And so they all ponied up a serious amount of money. And he put together this plan which involved a caravan of camels that would head out early and have their supplies out in the desert. And then he would travel with a team of geologists and other paleontologists and a cinematographer - he had a good mind for publicity - in a fleet of cars, 1922 vehicles, and bounced their way across the Gobi Desert, looking for ancient hominids. And they didn't find any. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: So they went home with nothing, right? Mr. CARROLL: Well, not quite. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. CARROLL: They weren't in the desert but a couple days, and they started finding fossils, dinosaur fossils, mammal fossils - everywhere. They found dinosaurs. They sort of described places - it was almost as though they were as common as sheep - on hillsides. And they found, for example, what we know today as Velociraptor. They found Ovaraptor. They found the first dinosaur eggs. They found the first evidence of mammals living alongside dinosaurs. So they didn't find what they had set out to find, but they found terrific stuff that made great copy. The dinosaur eggs wound up on the cover of Time magazine, and Roy Chapman Andrews became world-famous. And he repeated this expedition for several years, through the 1920s, you know, piling up quite a great collection, and he was a great yarn spinner. FLATOW: Yeah. And he had actually - if you see - there's a great picture in your book, in \"Remarkable Creatures,\" he is sitting there on a rock with a six-shooter\u2026 Dr. CARROLL: That's right. FLATOW: \u2026just like Indiana Jones, in the hat and the whole bit, right? Dr. CARROLL: His trademark, he always carried a pistol and a ranger hat. Now you might think those were props, but where he was going in the Gobi Desert, he had to use the pistol, in fact, a few times to ping off some shots to scare away bandits. The roads that they traveled were often victimized by bandits. It was pretty rough country. But he had this whole style about him. And he brought a cinematographer. So there is footage of these expeditions, that the American Museum of National History has all these archival footage, which is just fantastic watching these cars bounce across the desert, seeing the fossils be excavated, the first dinosaur eggs being shown. And the same person who did the cinematography did beautiful landscape photography. So the still photography of this expedition is fantastic. So it was a lot of fun to research all this. But he became famous and appeared in a lot of newsreels back in the U. S. And George Lucas has been quoted as saying that, you know, as a boy, he watched there newsreels that were often shown before featured films, that people like Roy Chapman Andrews were featured in these things. And the whole ranger hat and the gun and, you know, going into the desert and sort of the swashbuckling nature of it, in some way, became incorporated into the character of Indiana Jones. FLATOW: Wow. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to this gentleman in the audience. Yes, sir. Unidentified Man #1 (Audience Member): You were talking about Wallace and the fact that his ship went down, it burned. Has there ever been any talk of an expedition that go in sea if they can recover anything? Were there be anything you recover? You got me thinking about Indiana Jones now. So this whole\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Yeah. That's a good question. Dr. CARROLL: That's a great question. I don't know how deep the water is. This was somewhere about 700 or 800 miles east of Bermuda, so I don't know how deep that would be, and I don't know how well this ship would hold up. But - and I don't know how much burned, because, obviously, if it really just burned while on the surface and then all of you had was embers that sank, it would be a little bit different. But it's a great question. One thing I thought about doing is this was - the ship was most likely insured. So I've been tempted to go, next time in London, to go to Lloyd's records, because there's records of all these shipwrecks, and see what else we can learn about what people know about that ship, whether there was any effort to salvage anything. So it's something well worth looking into. FLATOW: Wow. I would imagine that it'd be hard - things that wrecked in the ocean are hard to find. Gold lasts forever, but fossils might not. Dr. CARROLL: And butterflies, even less so. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: And butterflies. Yeah. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: You have said that you believe we are in a second golden age of biology. What do you mean by that? Dr. CARROLL: Well, a second golden age evolution in biology. I think the first golden age was this era of these great voyages, particularly of Darwin and Wallace and Bates and their discoveries and their writings, the birth of the theory of evolution. But in terms of understanding how evolution works, there's been a transformation, certainly in the last couple of decades, where biologists, you know, all of the world are able to see in great detail how adaptation works, how evolution works, how different forms of the animal and the plant kingdom have evolved. They've been able to resolve the tree of life, the tree that Darwin first drew and actually said that some time, we'll have a complete tree of life and understand the relationships of all the creatures on the planet. And that dream is much closer because of the power that's come through understanding the DNA record of evolution. And this DNA record has absolutely exploded. Twenty years ago, if you typed out all of the DNA information scientists have gathered and put it in a normal size book, it would just fill one volume, just like that book. But if you now typed out all the DNA information we have and stack those books, it'd be somewhere close to two miles high. And we're just mining this record for information about how species adapt to particular habitats on the history of life. And some of the new volumes going into that record are from extinct species. So the capability now to sequence DNA from wooly mammoths, from fossil material, including the Neanderthals, our closest extinct cousin, is giving us tremendous amount of information about the past. FLATOW: Now you sort of switched careers for a little bit to write this book, right? You're an evolutionary biologist, but you're writing a historical book. When you go in and you look at the records, do you say, what am I doing here? (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: This is not my topic, but I'm yet making all these discoveries that some of the great historians may have missed? Dr. CARROLL: Well, I don't know about great historians missing - there is a chance, I think - certainly, I think every historian would say that they're going to take a fresh look at any historical record. FLATOW: Right. Dr. CARROLL: But the historical record is at the same time being opened up to people like myself and anyone in the audience with a browser, because a lot of these documents, including correspondence and rough manuscripts and field diaries and notebooks and all that, are being put online. And I found some of the gems that I used in this book, really from - that I didn't know existed from any other source when I looked at rough drafts and said, my goodness. Look at what he is saying. Look at how he's saying it. Something that may not be present, for example, in the published form of later works. FLATOW: So you could actually see - let me just remind everybody that this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Sean Carroll, author of \"Remarkable Creatures. \" Could you actually look at Darwin's rough draft\u2026 Dr. CARROLL: Oh, absolutely. FLATOW: \u2026and see things that were not there in the final, or had changed? Yes? Dr. CARROLL: Oh, yeah. Certainly. There are big changes between - as Darwin wrote down - he first wrote about a 35-page sketch of his idea about species in 1842 - I can happily say that not only have I see that online, I actually held it in my hands - and then two years later extended that to about 230 pages. And while there's resemblance to what we see in \"The Origin of Species,\" clearly, these ideas were changing, and some things he decided not to emphasize at all. So some of his early writings, he was very much pointing out how his thinking was absolutely at odds with creationism, with a creationist idea that every species were especially created. You won't find any of that language, you know, on \"The Origin of Species. \" FLATOW: Mm-hmm. You right that Darwin played a dodging game for 20 years. What was he dodging? Dr. CARROLL: Well, he was dodging that very fact. He was dodging his concern, certainly as a young man just coming from a voyage when he realized that species do change, and this was heresy. The doctrine, the dogma was that species were immutable, created by God. And he thought, no, species come about in a natural process, as natural as the way, you know, waves, you know, shake the sea coast or the way planets move around in the heavens. He knew that he couldn't go public with this. And there was a mixture of concerns. One was, you know, he wanted more evidence. Another was the people who had trained them, for whom he had very tender feelings, the people who - such as Reverend John Henslow, who he corresponded with throughout the voyage and who always bucked up his courage and received specimens from Darwin and distributed them to the best experts in the country. I mean, Darwin loved Henslow. And, you know, Reverend John Henslow, if you were a member of the Cambridge or Oxford faculty, you were an ordained clergymen of the Anglican church. And this was - to say that species changed was heresy, you know, to these men. And so, you know, he was sensitive to that. And his courage didn't really grow until much later. FLATOW: So he put off publishing for 20 years\u2026 Dr. CARROLL: Yeah. FLATOW: \u2026what he could have done 20 years before. Dr. CARROLL: Oh, yeah. In 1844, he had a 230-page manuscript that spells it all out in really full detail. And he said to his wife at the time, he said, you know, should I die, you know, see to it this is published. So he was willing to have it published after he was dead, but not while he is alive. At least that was his thinking in 1841. FLATOW: Did he feel Wallace breathing down his neck, or other scientists that he felt, I'd better do this now? Dr. CARROLL: No. He didn't feel - in the 1840s, he didn't feel that sort of urgency. FLATOW: But I mean, 20 years later, what finally was the\u2026 Dr. CARROLL: Well, he always said he was going to write this big book. And he was working on the big book for a few years when Wallace's letter from the Malay Archipelago arrived. And he said to his friends, whom he had confided all his thoughts to, he said, you know, Wallace couldn't have written a better abstract with my theory if he had had, you know, all my notebooks in front of him. So he saw a - you know, immediately that what Wallace had conceived was, you know, the - potentially, the nucleus of the idea that he had. And I think that had to give Darwin the energy to complete the big book that we know as \"On the Origin of Species. \" FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And he published that right then\u2026 Dr. CARROLL: A year later. A year after\u2026 FLATOW: He did it in\u2026 Dr. CARROLL: 1859. FLATOW: \u20261859. Dr. CARROLL: Yeah. FLATOW: That's where we got that 150th anniversary\u2026 Dr. CARROLL: That's right. FLATOW: \u2026this year. All right. We're going to take a short break and then come back and talk more with Sean B. Caroll, who's author of the \"Remarkable Creatures: Epic Adventures in the Search for the Origins of Species. \" Also joining us will be D. Bruce Means, who's going to talk about little things, stuff a little bit closer to home, and that's stuff here in Florida. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow here in Tallahassee in Florida, broadcasting from the Origins '09 conference on origins, very interesting stuff that's going on down here. And we're talking this hour about evolution and the remarkable naturalists and scientists who traverse the globe of facing all kinds of hardships, collecting evidence that Darwin needed to cement his theory. With me is Dr. Sean B. Carroll, who's author of \"Remarkable Creatures: Epic Adventures in the Search for the Origins of Species. \" And also joining us now is another very famous naturalist who - you know, because we are broadcasting from FSU this hour - FSU is in Tallahassee. And while you may know Tallahassee is the state capital, you may not know that the area around the capital's a really hot spot of biodiversity in North America. And it's actually happening right here on our desk at the moment, where a snake has magically appeared out of the pocket of my next guest, and that's Dr. D. Bruce Means. He is the author of \"Stalking the Plumed Serpent and Other Adventures in Herpetology. \" He's president and executive director of the Coastal Plains Institute and Land Conservancy, and adjunct professor of biology at Florida State University. He has also recently described the new family of frogs, not here in the Panhandle, but in Guyana, and we'll ask him about that. And if you want to check out one of Bruce Means' eastern diamondbacks that he caught near Tallahassee, you can go to our Web site, it's sciencefriday. com, and watch Flora Lichtman's latest SciFri pick of the week. And we went out there yesterday, Flora went out there and got a good look at their diamondback. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Dr. D. BRUCE MEANS (Author, \"Stalking the Plumed Serpent and Other Adventures in Herpetology\"): Thank you (unintelligible). Glad to be here. FLATOW: That was some trick you just did. I've never been - I've been upstaged many times, but never by a snake coming out of - right here on SCIENCE FRIDAY. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. MEANS: Yeah. It doesn't make the impact of the video show would've had. But\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Well, I mean, there is an awful lot of biodiversity around here in North Florida, is there not? Dr. MEANS: Absolutely. And that's what the snake is all about. This is a race of king snake found just in this area. And the area between Tallahassee and Pensacola, Florida is very special because it's highly rich in species of plants and animals. For instance, it has more snakes, more frogs, more turtles, and a whole bunch of other things in high numbers in the United States and Canada. So it's a biodiversity hot spot of great importance. And not very much is known about it. FLATOW: Hmm. And you actually have a subspecies of snake named after you. Dr. MEANS: Well, that's this guy here, you know. FLATOW: How did that happen? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. MEANS: Oh, golly. It goes back to the 1960s. I've been here a long time. I used to ride through the national forest locally, and I found this strange-looking snake. It's a king snake, which normally is black with rings - light around it. And this thing is totally solidly colored, light-colored animal. And the long story of it is, I did what biologists have done, trying to understand the variation in animals. I bred different individuals to each other, got young, crossbred them, bred them back to the parents. And I crossed this thing with the normal king snake. And what I discovered was it's a race that's uniquely found in one area between two rivers. And one wants to ask, well, how did that develop? You look for an isolating mechanism. And right in the middle of that spot are two old barrier islands that, apparently, there - the early populations got established there, and the snake, you know, drifted and the color matches the sand, or the background. And that particular area has 15 plants that are endemic to the same region. So, it's looking at biodiversity by understanding the variation that occurs in (unintelligible). FLATOW: Right. So you can have evolutionary process going on just in the island next door. DR. MEANS: Absolutely. That's classic. FLATOW: Yeah. DR. MEANS: Yeah. FLATOW: That's classic, I mean, but is it something as close as right outside your own backyard? DR. MEANS: And that's true all over the world. That's been the case. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Tell us about the difference - I think most Americans are familiar with Southern Florida. It's in the news a lot. It's got the\u2026 DR. MEANS: Right. FLATOW: \u2026swamps. It's got all kinds of different stuff we see on the news. But how is the biodiversity different in the Panhandle than it is in the Everglades and the other places in the Florida Panhandle? DR. MEANS: Very different. It's quite easy to explain, as a matter of fact. Peninsular Florida, as you go down the peninsula, it becomes less and less relieved. There's less and less physical diversity. And there's a thing called a peninsula effect that happens with plants and animals. The plants and animals that occur at the base of the peninsula, 50 to 60 percent of them don't make the tip of the peninsula. For instance, the whole\u2026 FLATOW: Really? DR. MEANS: \u2026bottom of the peninsula is the Everglades, whereas up here we have lots of relief, ravines and things that we don't have down in South Florida. And this is continental up here. You know, the peninsula is a flatter, lower lying land. So - and it also juts into the warmer climes of the world. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. DR. MEANS: So you'd expect things to be different down there, and indeed they are. And up here, we have this wonderful hotspot. FLATOW: Wow. And you also have cooler weather up here, right, than you have down in Southern Florida. DR. MEANS: Right, we certainly do. But not as cold as I don't like. (Soundbite of laughter) DR. MEANS: I was raised in Alaska, and I came here to get away from all that. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Such a difference. Let's see if we have any questions from the -anybody up there at the mic want to ask a question? Yes, step up please. Go ahead. Unidentified Man #2 (Audience Member): Yes, Dr. Carroll, I hope everyone is coping with our pollen pretty well here. So, but Dr. Carroll, you mentioned last night briefly about genetic research that's kind of looking back, trying to hopefully explain and support on natural selection. Can you give a couple of examples? I mean, had there been genetic research that kind of helps explain diversity? Dr. CARROLL: Oh, absolutely. There's been an explosion of information about adaptation of all sorts of creatures. And I hate to tell you, but it's all plugged in another book called \"The Making of The Fittest. \" Understanding how all sorts of species - mice, fish, plants, etc. - are adapting to their local conditions and documenting how that's occurring at the DNA level and where the new traits come from, where the new capabilities come from. There're many, many, many case studies now, and that's well documented. Color vision, for example, in animals is another case. So just, say, in the last 10 years, there's just dozens and dozens of examples where we know the precise basis of adaptation at the DNA level. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Unidentified Man #2: Thanks. FLATOW: Yes, sir. Why don't you just step up and ask the next question? Go ahead. Unidentified Child #1 (Audience Member): Also, you were talking about how Darwin found (unintelligible) bones. Did his theory - was it incorrect or correct? Dr. CARROLL: Well, Darwin himself found all sorts of fossils when he was on the Beagle of mammals. He found things that were related to sloths and to armadillos and to llamas and things like that. He didn't find any - he didn't know anything about, really, human fossils. But his idea that species change is certainly correct, and his idea that fossils represented older, now extinct creatures that were related and gave rise to living - the current living species was certainly correct. But he was waiting for a lot more evidence to understand the whole history of life. And that's when a whole lot more scientists had to contribute to over the last 150 years. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Bruce, you know, Florida is obviously not a good enough place to spend all your time, because you've been going to Guyana, and you actually have found some interesting new things there. Tell us about that. Dr. MEANS: Yes. The kind of work that Sean does is work that I need to do. You know, I'm an old-fashioned biologist that looks at the animals and tries to figure out whether they have different species based on their morphology. But it turns out, the DNA that we use\u2026 FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. MEANS: \u2026for human fingerprint analysis and the like is very, very - I mean, for finding out whether\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. MEANS: \u2026you know, (unintelligible) is very, very useful. And so, if you apply it to a bunch of salamanders that you can't tell apart morphologically, the DNA will tell you, oh, yeah, these are related to each other because they have much closer genetic relationships and these don't, and therefore you may have a new species. Any person who is a field biologist, who's trained in the temperate zones of the world - and most of us are - in order to really understand evolution and ecology, we need to have some experience in the tropics because the world, for most of its history, and even now, has more tropical environments than it does, well, has always has more tropical environments than the temperate ones. FLATOW: Right. Dr. MEANS: So, I went by backpack to South America when I was younger, 25 years ago, and I start exploring one particularly wonderful area that I've fallen in love with. And that's led to lots of interesting things. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And you talked about - what about your frogs, family of frogs? Dr. MEANS: And those indeed are some of the most interesting things. I've been exploring mountains in Guyana - which used to be British Guyana - Venezuela and Brazil, that rise to almost 10,000 feet. They're flat top mesas, but they're clothed with rainforest on the slopes and the upper slopes are cloud forest. A lot of people have studied them by helicopping(ph) to the summits, but nobody's done any transects of the slopes because you can't land there. FLATOW: Right. Dr. MEANS: So, I've been trying to do that. And I found all these - so every time I go back to one of these mountains, it's only 35 kilometers by 17, and I've made three expeditions there. Every time, I find two or three new frogs new to science. I've got an earthworm that's about four feet long, big around as. . . FLATOW: So you were looking for frogs and discovered the earthworm. Dr. MEANS: The earthworm, crabs and a whole bunch. But among these frogs - and here's where the DNA comes in - among these frogs, they all look relatively similar. And so, I collaborated with people who have a DNA lab. And two of these little frogs were so different from all the rest of them, that they are a family of frogs unique because their DNA is so different. And, in fact, they fit in a category between all the frogs that - there are many frogs in the new world that lay eggs that develop directly into little froglets. But then all the other frogs as we know, the more primitive condition is to lay eggs that develop into tadpoles. We don't - this one's in between, and we don't know what it does. And guess what? Isn't that a raison for going back, doing the whole thing? FLATOW: Absolutely. Isn't it great when we don't know what something does? Dr. MEANS: Yes. Yes. FLATOW: I mean, you know, that's the best part about science, is finding the thing we don't what it does. Dr. MEANS: That's right. Yeah. FLATOW: Sean, these people you were talking about in your book found a lot of things that they didn't know what did or where they came from or what the fossils meant. Dr. CARROLL: No. And that was the joy of their lives, is pursuing - exploring the unknown, not knowing what was around the corner. And, you know, Bruce is the embodiment of this. He's exploring territories that still exist in the world that people do not know what is there and discovering things that bridge important gaps in our knowledge in science. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Would you like to have been around there, Bruce, with those guys? Dr. MEANS: Oh, yes, indeed. It was easier to find all kinds of new things. But that's not what it's all about. What it's about is in order to know how important biodiversity is, you have to know what the components are, the components of the species. It's not so easy to have a eureka moment where you say, oh, there's a new species, when you're out\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. MEANS: \u2026these days. But using the techniques of DNA and other new biological techniques, there still is plenty out there to find. In fact, E. O. Wilson has - and others have claimed we only know about 10 percent of the animals and plants on this planet. FLATOW: And lot of those are vanishing. Dr. MEANS: Yes, absolutely. But you don't know they're vanishing\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. MEANS: \u2026(unintelligible) if you don't what they are. FLATOW: Right. Dr. MEANS: So, we still have lots of that basic work to do. FLATOW: Let's see if we can go to the audience, ask a question here. Yes, step right up. Yeah. Unidentified Child #2 (Audience Member): I have a question for Mr. Carroll. Earlier on, you mentioned how Wallace and Darwin were such beautiful friends. I was wondering were there any people in his time that tried to put him down or, you know, used his ideas and claimed them as their own, since I know that some people cheated Archimedes in that way. Dr. CARROLL: That's a great question. Darwin faced a lot of opposition. And, in fact, really, we should be talking about Owen as the father of evolution because there was a person in England - the person who named, for example, the word dinosaur and who was the leading expert on fossils that were being excavated from - especially all over the shoreline of England long before Darwin came back from the Beagle. But Owen absolutely rejected any idea that species changed. And when - and he was a, really, a bitter enemy of Darwin's ideas. So there were people, many people who, in the scientific establishment, who opposed Darwin's ideas at first. And Darwin just had to wait for them to die off. FLATOW: Hmm. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Talking about evolution this hour in SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow here in Tallahassee with Sean Carroll and Bruce Means. Sean is author of the book \"Remarkable Creatures: Epic Adventures in the Search for the Origins of Species. \" That last comment you made about scientists waiting for the others to die off is universal, is it not, through the history of science? Dr. CARROLL: I think it's part of human nature. FLATOW: That's how - you know, books have been written about, to get a new idea accepted, you just have to wait for the old guy to - now an old woman might die off. (unintelligible) they even had women in science years ago. Let's see if we can go right to the audience. Lots of questions there. Yes, sir, please. Unidentified Man #3 (Audience Member): Okay. For Dr. Carroll, how much - the publication in 1859 of the - of \"Natural Selection\" has an explanation of evolutionary change. How much of was due to the spark of insight of Darwin and Wallace? How much was it due uniquely to them, or was it on the immediate horizon just due to the mass of descriptive biology that was being accumulated at that time? Dr. CARROLL: I would say it was - the vast majority of that was the credit to Darwin and Wallace. This was a revolutionary idea in - the two boldest ideas that Darwin had, the idea that all living species had descended from ancestors who descended from earlier ancestors all the way back - I don't think anyone could claim they had that idea - and the idea of natural selection as a mechanism for change. And Darwin presented such an integrated synthesis of evidence from so many fields that while there may have been people that had some notions about species changing or variation among individuals and things like this, Darwin really pulled it all together. You know, I think it's sort of like saying, well, there were some baseball players around, but this was - Darwin and Wallace, they were the Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio, you know, of the time. They were really at the actual, you know, top of the game and had the most information that was most pertinent to the solution to the big question. FLATOW: I only have about a minute left. Is there - are there other people you would've liked to have put in? I mean, how did you do triage, whom to leave out in the book? Dr. CARROLL: Well, I mean, there were a lot of criteria. They had to do something dramatic, they had to find something important, and I actually had to admire them. I didn't write about anybody I didn't like. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. CARROLL: There was so much I found to admire in these people. I think it put a pretty good collection together. FLATOW: You got one name who you would maybe make the second cut? Dr. CARROLL: No, I think the next - I look forward to writing the next book about the next 20 years of adventures that people are going to take because some of these stories were just completed in 2006 and 2007. The passion is very much alive in the scientific community. FLATOW: Who's out there now? Who's working now? Dr. CARROLL: Well, the paleontologists. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. CARROLL: I mean, Darwin didn't know a lot about the history of life. The paleontologists - Darwin said that the crust of the Earth is a vast museum. We've only uncovered a tiny percentage of what's down there FLATOW: All right. It's a great way to end. I want to thank you both for taking time to be with us. Bruce Means, who is a local hero here in Northern Florida in the Panhandle. He's head of the Coastal Plains Institution. Carroll, author of \"Remarkable Creatures: Epic Adventures in the Search for the Origins of Species. \" Gentlemen, thank you for taking time to be with us today. Dr. CARROLL: Thank you.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. We're in Tallahassee today, broadcasting from Florida State University, where they are celebrating the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth.  And by the way, this is also the 150th year since the publication of \"On the Origin of Species,\" Darwin's manuscript that laid out his new theory of evolution by natural selection.  Of course, everyone has heard of Darwin. He gets most of the credit for the theory of evolution, and while he deserves to be recognized for his contributions, of course, he couldn't have gotten there without some help.  And so for the rest of the hour, the rest of the story, as the late Paul Harvey might have said today. In his new book, \"Remarkable Creatures, my first guest tells us about scientists and adventurers, some trained, some - many of them self-taught - who inspired Darwin and helped prove that he was right. From Alexander von Humboldt to Henry Bates and Roy Chapman Andrews - they're names that you might now have heard of but whose contributions really were enormous.  There's even one naturalist who was, let's say, dangerously close to scooping Darwin on his own work. So we're going to talk all about that with my guest, Sean B. Carroll.  He is the author of \"Extraordinary Creatures: Epic Adventures in the Search for the Origins of Species. \" He's a professor of molecular biology and genetics at the University of Wisconsin - I'm sure he's happy to be here in Florida, today - and investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Sean.  Mr. SEAN B. CARROLL (Biologist; Author, \"Remarkable Creatures\"): Thanks for having me, Ira.  FLATOW: The title of your book, I really think it really has a double meaning, \"Extraordinary Creatures,\" because I think it's talking about some of the people in the book, as well as the animals. They were extraordinary people, were they not?  Mr. CARROLL: Absolutely. So these were people that had tremendous spirit, tremendous passion for exploring the unknown, and they were driven to discover strange and beautiful creatures, or bizarre fossils, or ancient hominids, whatever it might be. So yeah, it's an intentional double\u2026  FLATOW: Well you know - and I didn't realize how brace some of these people\u2026 They went through malaria and floods, and all kinds of shipwrecks, things like that.  Mr. CARROLL: Yeah - cannibals, poisonous snakes, sandstorms, bandits, any number of years spent in jungles or deserts. You know, sometimes it was the animals that were the most dangerous. Sometimes it was the infectious diseases. Sometimes it was the other people that were around.  So that was part of the game of exploring the parts of the world that most of the modern world didn't know about.  FLATOW: Our number is 1-800-989-8255 if you'd like to talk with Sean Carroll about his book and about origins in general. Also, you can tweet us on Twitter, @scifri, the at sign and S-C-I-F-R-I. And also in Second Life - a whole bunch of avatars are collecting in our Second Life island, and you can - on our SCIENCE FRIDAY island, you can join in and ask questions there, too.  Let's talk about some of these people that most people have never heard about. Let's begin where you begin, with a really very interesting guy named Alexander Von Humboldt. Who was he?  Mr. CARROLL: Well, Humboldt was a wealthy Prussian, a polymath. He was versed in every field of science and many other disciplines, as well. He was very well-traveled. He had done a fair amount of experimental science in Europe, testing the electrical activity of tissues - many of those experiments conducted on himself.  FLATOW: Ouch.  Mr. CARROLL: Yeah.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. CARROLL: And then he undertook a voyage in 1799 to 1804 where he traveled through South America and much of central America and wound up that voyage, in fact, in the United States by visiting with Thomas Jefferson.  But in the course of that voyage\u2026 He was a compulsive measurer. So he measured everything, the heights of mountains, the temperature of various, you know, waters, taking star positions. He documented a lot of the pre-Columbian world that people didn't know about, collected all sorts of botanical specimens, zoological specimens.  He played various games with, for example, electric eels. You know, he was interested in electrical things, and so he and his companion, a botanist named Aim\u00e9 Bonpland, they would sort of handle these eels, and they'd try to figure out if one was handling and touched the other person, would they get a shock, etcetera. So it was sort of a\u2026  FLATOW: And did they? Did they shock themselves?  Mr. CARROLL: Well, they said - I don't think they ever figured out exactly what the rhyme or reason was. They just reported that the jolt was so strong, it was stronger than anything they had felt in Europe when they were doing deliberate experiments with electricity.  So yeah, he was fascinated by everything, and he documented everything - wound up his trip, as I said, by going to the United States to sit down with Thomas Jefferson.  FLATOW: That sounds amazing, just because Jefferson was an amateur himself? He was interested in all this stuff?  Mr. CARROLL: Right. So of all things, imagine a letter. The letter of introduction was, you know, to Thomas Jefferson, saying, well, I would like to sit down and talk with you about fossils.  Jefferson was a fossil collector. He had brought a lot of fossils to the White House, and he had written what we think is the first American paper on paleontology - prior to becoming president.  And he thought that these great creatures that were represented by things like mastodons and mammoths; and an animal that Jefferson had described, it was a kind of giant ground sloth - he thought they were still roaming somewhere in the American West.  He did not - Jefferson did not think that animals could go extinct. And so, when he sent, for example, Lewis and Clark west, he told them to be on the lookout for, you know, big elephant-looking things.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: And from reading your book, this is partly a religious belief, was it not, of the time?  Mr. CARROLL: Yeah, that the creator would not\u2026  FLATOW: The creator would not let things go extinct.  Mr. CARROLL: Yeah, yeah. So that world that - obviously Jefferson, we all recognize him as a brilliant mind, and Von Humboldt was absolutely brilliant -but the world they lived in saw nature as something in perfect harmony; designed such that everything was in its place and sort of living in perfect harmony, both the living things and even the inanimate things; sort of like a landscape painting.  It was not to be perturbed. And when Humboldt wrote his travels, he, in fact, he'd sort of copied Jefferson's style from his notes on the state of Virginia and wrote up numerous volumes on his travels through South America and Central America - and these volumes made Humboldt world-famous.  FLATOW: And so Darwin would have read these?  Mr. CARROLL: Yeah, as a student at Cambridge, Darwin read Von Humboldt's travels, and this inspired him to want to go to the tropics.  FLATOW: Did they correspond with each other?  Mr. CARROLL: Well, only after Darwin had written \"Voyage of the Beagle. \" So, only after Darwin's voyage, did they correspond. And it's quite a touching correspondence between the young pupil who was inspired to take his voyage and the old sage of Europe.  But the - what Darwin describes is, very often he had these volumes of Humboldt, and he was reading them just to buck up his courage on his own voyage - because, you know, he was homesick. He was only a 22-year-old man when he went on the Beagle, and he was constantly seasick. And so\u2026  FLATOW: That's a bad place to be when you're seasick  Mr. CARROLL: Yeah. That's commonly - a five-year voyage is not recommended.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. CARROLL: But Von Humboldt's description of what he saw, that's what pulled Darwin, you know, to South America, and that's what kept him going. He didn't know what was going to be around the next bend, what was going to be in the next valley, what was going to be around the next bay.  And the impact of prior travelers, you know, to inspire the next generation -well that's still what goes on today.  FLATOW: You make the point that while Darwin did not set out on his journey with evolution in mind, two of his contemporaries did - Alfred Russel Wallace and Henry Walter Bates.  Mr. CARROLL: Henry Walter Bates, yeah. Now they were younger than Darwin. So they had the benefit, for example, Darwin - to put a time frame on this -Darwin traveled from 1831 to 1836 and then wrote up \"The Voyage of the Beagle,\" his adventures, in the late 1830s.  And so when Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Wallace were dreaming of going to the tropics, they had read Darwin, and they had read Humboldt. And in  the 1840s, the idea of, at least the question of \"The Origin of Species\" was percolating in popular culture. And the fundamental question was whether species were specially created by God, immutable, or whether they had come about by natural laws.  And so Wallace and Bates, who were two avid collectors - Wallace said, well, let's go to South America, to the Amazon, to collect facts to gather towards the question of the origin of species.  FLATOW: And of course, there was a controversy that's been going on for years. Should Wallace be deemed the person who actually created the theory first - or be given credit or share in it? Why has that surfaced? Was he so good and so close, as Darwin was?  Mr. CARROLL: Yeah, Wallace was a remarkable man. And I think if Darwin was sitting right here today, he'd be heaping praise on Wallace. And I think what's happened is some amnesia after - I mean, Wallace has been gone almost 100 years.  In his day, when Wallace had made his discoveries, and the joint ideas of Wallace and Darwin had been presented, and then Darwin published \"The Origin of Species\" - Wallace was famous, and Wallace was getting quite a great deal of credit, and justifiably so. Because what Wallace had done, and what people are generally not aware of, is that Wallace had traveled to the Amazon for four years, and once exhausted, headed home - only to have his ship catch fire and sink and to lose all his specimens to the bottom of the Atlantic.  FLATOW: Wow, everything he had collected.  Mr. CARROLL: Everything he had collected in the Amazon went down.  FLATOW: Went down. How many years of research?  Mr. CARROLL: Four years of collecting and\u2026  FLATOW: So you go out in the field, you brave all the elements, sickness, health, pirates, whatever. You got four years of collection, and you have nothing to show for it.  Mr. CARROLL: Nothing to show for it. And of course, I think that would break a lot of people.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. CARROLL: And he spend 10 days in an open lifeboat - and not even knowing if he was going to be rescued.  FLATOW: Wow.  Mr. CARROLL: And while he said on the rescue ship home that, you know, he would never trust himself on the ocean again, as soon as he got back to England he changed his mind and he said well, I'm not satisfied. I don't have answers toward questions I wanted to ask. I don't have anything to show for the foreign lands that I have explored.  And he went off - this time to the Malay Archipelago. He spent eight years traipsing through the jungles in the Malay Archipelago, collecting. He made 96 island-to-island crossings, covering 14,000 miles. He collected 120,000 specimens.  FLATOW: And we don't hear about him at all.  Mr. CARROLL: No.  FLATOW: And all of this, and it's just Darwin that we hear all the time.  Mr. CARROLL: Yeah, there's probably a complex set of reasons for that. But Wallace was a remarkable individual, and really Wallace saw similar things that Darwin had.  Just as Darwin had seen species particular to particular islands of the Galapagos, say birds, Wallace saw butterflies that were unique to Malay Archipelago and inspired the same sort of thinking.  And when you compare what these men were writing as they were putting their thoughts together, there's remarkable parallels to what they were thinking. And I think it's a great example of, you know, two great minds thinking alike.  FLATOW: And they got along, right?  Mr. CARROLL: They got along beautifully.  FLATOW: This, to me, is the most amazing part of it.  Mr. CARROLL: They got along beautifully, so\u2026  FLATOW: The competitiveness was not there.  Mr. CARROLL: No. I think that - and I think the most telling is Wallace's private correspondence to friends, that he had nothing but the greatest admiration\u2026 And these letters are very touching, and they can be found, for example, on Web sites these days, where a lot of the correspondence is documented.  He had nothing but praise and admiration for Darwin. He was relieved that it was really Darwin that brought the theory to the public in the book \"On the Origin of Species. \" He felt that Darwin had created an entirely new branch of science, and he was quite happened to be mentioned in the same breath, or as Darwin did in \"The Origin of Species,\" right at the outset, - mentioned in Darwin's writing.  And he dedicated his own book of his Malay Archipelago travels to Charles Darwin.  FLATOW: We're talking with Sean Carroll, author of \"Remarkable Creature: Epic Adventures in the Search for the Origins of Species,\" and speaking of nothing but praise, I have nothing but praise for this book. This book is terrific. It's a great book for people who want to know all about the different adventurers.  And we'll get into one of them a little bit later who was actually the role model for \"Raiders of the Lost Ark. \" We'll talk about it after this break. So stay with us. We'll be right back from Tallahassee. Don't go away.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow here in Tallahassee. We're talking about - this hour - about the theory of evolution and all the folks who helped Darwin come to his conclusions and provide the evidence to prove he was right.  A lot of them dug up the stuff he said might be there. My guest is Sean B. Carroll, the author of \"Extraordinary Creatures: Epic Adventures in the Search for the Origin of Species. \" It's a terrific book.  Let's see if we can get some phone calls in before we go on to the next question. If you're here in the audience, please step up to the mike. Let's go to the phones. Let's see if we can go to Ron in Harbor(ph), Pennsylvania. Hi, Ron, are you there?  Well, let's go to Brian(ph) in Baltimore. Hi there, Brian.  BRIAN (Caller): Hey, how are you doing?  FLATOW: Hi there. Go ahead.  BRIAN: Hi. Okay, I've got a question. Well, you made the comment about Jefferson, and it kind of dawned on me that, you know, with some hindsight, you can have such brilliant people as Jefferson who could think of things in terms of what was known of the day.  My question kind of pertains to that, in terms of what other scientists had theories out there that were being considered, at the time, in competition with the theory of evolution? And I'll take my answer off the air. Thank you.  FLATOW: Okay, thanks for calling.  Mr. CARROLL: Well, one of the most prominent ones was Lamarque in France, another - a great zoologist. So there were many fantastic scientists, geologists and biologists or zoologists, that were trying to make sense of what they saw in nature. And Lamarque had, basically, the idea that change could take place in a lifetime that then would be passed on to their offspring. So he was aware that change was taking place but didn't have the right idea about how that happened.  So Lamarque would probably be the most popular idea that was prevalent at Europe at the time but had not gained traction in England.  FLATOW: Let's talk about some of the other terrific characters that you have. I say that with all great love for them, of course - being one myself, some sort of character.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Another one is Eugene Dubois. Who - tell me about - was\u2026  Mr. CARROLL: This is unbelievable. This is one of the most - I think this is the most single-minded expedition I know of in all of natural history.  So Dubois is a physician, a Dutch physician, a young physician. He's climbing the ranks. He's brilliant. He's succeeded at everything he's touched - but he's read a lot. And he's reading a lot, this is now in the 1880s. So it's well after \"The Origin of Species,\" but there's a lot of discussion about humans. What about humans? What about the origin of humans?  And he gets it in his mind that the most important thing that anybody could discover is the link between apes and humans, and he's going to be the one to do it.  And so he says where can I find this link? And he decides well - he's kind of looking at a world map, and he thinks, I think it's going to be in Asia, not Africa - and looking at that map, gee, where could I go?  Well, the Dutch East Indies are a Dutch colony. How could I pay my way? Well, I'm a physician. I'll enlist in the Dutch army.  FLATOW: What a great idea.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. CARROLL: So he was about to be a full professor of medicine at the University of Amsterdam, and without telling his wife\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. CARROLL: \u2026he enlisted for eight years in the Dutch army.  FLATOW: Do you think there was a message there somewhere?  Mr. CARROLL: Well, she went along with it, and they had a young baby, and so that was it. They left Amsterdam for Sumatra, and he went and started to experience - be experienced with diseases that he didn't even know existed in the world - but started exploring the caves on Sumatra.  And he thought - because there's where Neanderthals had been found in Europe -that ancient hominids, ancient humans, would be found in caves. And after some time in Sumatra, he said this doesn't look so good, I'm going to move over to Java.  So he uproots the family again - moves over to Java - and he gets a crew of workmen helping him. And sure enough, after about four years, they find a molar, a skull cap, and a thighbone. This guy has hit the jackpot. It's what we call, today, Homo Erectus.  And to understand how lucky Dubois was, what you have to realize is that as soon as he made this find, all sorts of people wanted to follow his footsteps to Asia. No one found anything else for 40 years.  So on the Trinil River in Java, he finds these hominid fossils. You know, you've got to think that this is the luckiest dart that anyone has ever\u2026  FLATOW: Well, but doesn't that cast doubt on his finding if everybody's saying we're not finding\u2026?  Mr. CARROLL: Well, then they did. Then 40 years last, in the late 1920s, then they found more Homo Erectus on Java, and more things were found in China, and the picture was fleshed out.  FLATOW: Was this Java Man?  Mr. CARROLL: This is Java Man, that's right, yeah. So Eugene Dubois was - certainly opened a whole new vista on human origins. But you have to appreciate - and there's a picture, actually, in the book that I love because the veranda of his house is piling up with bones.  You've got to realize when you're looking for human fossils, you're finding all the other animals that lived at that time, a lot of big animals with big bones.  And so he's unearthing tons and tons and tons of bones, really looking for a needle in a haystack of other mammal bones. And he finds that needle.  It's remarkable good fortune, but you know, hard-earned good fortune because he put his life on the line to explore these caves and riverbeds in Indonesia.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is the number. Talking with Sean B. Carroll, author of \"Remarkable Creatures. \"  Let's talk about the model for Indiana Jones - and there really is one, is there not?  Mr. CARROLL: Yeah. George Lucas had admitted this to some degree: Roy Chapman Andrews. So this is a fellow who grew up in Beloit, Wisconsin and liked the outdoors, in the late 1800s. And he collected things, kept them up in his attic, labeled them and saw - went to the Field Museum in Chicago, and that made a big impression on him - that he wanted to work in a natural history museum.  So when he graduated college - he was not a very good student. He actually was really good at taxidermy, paid his way through college by stuffing the hunting trophies of Wisconsin hunters - went to the Natural History Museum and applied for a job.  And the director tried to kind of ease him down gently and said well, look, we don't have any position here for you. And he said, but you need somebody to sweep the floors, don't you?  And he said, man, a man with a college degree doesn't want to sweep floors. And Roy Chapman Andrews said yeah, but these aren't just any floors.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. CARROLL: So his first job was as a floor sweeper at the American Museum of Natural History. Now making a long story short, he was eager to get any kind of real work, and he wound up working on whales and that sent him all over the world. And he fell in love with the Orient, and he wanted to explore Asia, and he wanted to mount some tremendous expedition.  And he got the idea of exploring the Gobi Desert, Inner Mongolia, and mounting the largest natural-history expedition ever undertaken. Now this was going to cost a lot of money.  FLATOW: Yeah, there's no National Science Foundation.  Mr. CARROLL: Yeah, there's no government support for this. But he had learned. He had rubbed shoulders a little bit when he was at the museum with some of the donors to the museum and people like Andrew Carnegie. And so he went around to the titans of industry and finance in New York, J. P. Morgan, the Rockefellers, Chase - told them about this grand idea.  And the reason why he was partly going into Inner Mongolia, he wanted to find hominid fossils. He was selling this whole expedition on the idea that they would find more ancient man, just as Dubois had found several decades earlier.  And so they all ponied up a serious amount of money. And he put together this plan which involved a caravan of camels that would head out early and have their supplies out in the desert. And then he would travel with a team of geologists and other paleontologists and a cinematographer - he had a good mind for publicity - in a fleet of cars, 1922 vehicles, and bounced their way across the Gobi Desert, looking for ancient hominids. And they didn't find any.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: So they went home with nothing, right?  Mr. CARROLL: Well, not quite.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. CARROLL: They weren't in the desert but a couple days, and they started finding fossils, dinosaur fossils, mammal fossils - everywhere. They found dinosaurs. They sort of described places - it was almost as though they were as common as sheep - on hillsides.  And they found, for example, what we know today as Velociraptor. They found Ovaraptor. They found the first dinosaur eggs. They found the first evidence of mammals living alongside dinosaurs.  So they didn't find what they had set out to find, but they found terrific stuff that made great copy. The dinosaur eggs wound up on the cover of Time magazine, and Roy Chapman Andrews became world-famous.  And he repeated this expedition for several years, through the 1920s, you know, piling up quite a great collection, and he was a great yarn spinner.  FLATOW: Yeah. And he had actually - if you see - there's a great picture in your book, in \"Remarkable Creatures,\" he is sitting there on a rock with a six-shooter\u2026  Dr. CARROLL: That's right.  FLATOW: \u2026just like Indiana Jones, in the hat and the whole bit, right?  Dr. CARROLL: His trademark, he always carried a pistol and a ranger hat. Now you might think those were props, but where he was going in the Gobi Desert, he had to use the pistol, in fact, a few times to ping off some shots to scare away bandits. The roads that they traveled were often victimized by bandits. It was pretty rough country. But he had this whole style about him. And he brought a cinematographer. So there is footage of these expeditions, that the American Museum of National History has all these archival footage, which is just fantastic watching these cars bounce across the desert, seeing the fossils be excavated, the first dinosaur eggs being shown. And the same person who did the cinematography did beautiful landscape photography. So the still photography of this expedition is fantastic. So it was a lot of fun to research all this.  But he became famous and appeared in a lot of newsreels back in the U. S. And George Lucas has been quoted as saying that, you know, as a boy, he watched there newsreels that were often shown before featured films, that people like Roy Chapman Andrews were featured in these things. And the whole ranger hat and the gun and, you know, going into the desert and sort of the swashbuckling nature of it, in some way, became incorporated into the character of Indiana Jones.  FLATOW: Wow. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to this gentleman in the audience. Yes, sir.  Unidentified Man #1 (Audience Member): You were talking about Wallace and the fact that his ship went down, it burned. Has there ever been any talk of an expedition that go in sea if they can recover anything? Were there be anything you recover? You got me thinking about Indiana Jones now. So this whole\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Yeah. That's a good question.  Dr. CARROLL: That's a great question. I don't know how deep the water is. This was somewhere about 700 or 800 miles east of Bermuda, so I don't know how deep that would be, and I don't know how well this ship would hold up. But - and I don't know how much burned, because, obviously, if it really just burned while on the surface and then all of you had was embers that sank, it would be a little bit different. But it's a great question.  One thing I thought about doing is this was - the ship was most likely insured. So I've been tempted to go, next time in London, to go to Lloyd's records, because there's records of all these shipwrecks, and see what else we can learn about what people know about that ship, whether there was any effort to salvage anything. So it's something well worth looking into.  FLATOW: Wow. I would imagine that it'd be hard - things that wrecked in the ocean are hard to find. Gold lasts forever, but fossils might not.  Dr. CARROLL: And butterflies, even less so.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: And butterflies. Yeah.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: You have said that you believe we are in a second golden age of biology. What do you mean by that?  Dr. CARROLL: Well, a second golden age evolution in biology. I think the first golden age was this era of these great voyages, particularly of Darwin and Wallace and Bates and their discoveries and their writings, the birth of the theory of evolution.  But in terms of understanding how evolution works, there's been a transformation, certainly in the last couple of decades, where biologists, you know, all of the world are able to see in great detail how adaptation works, how evolution works, how different forms of the animal and the plant kingdom have evolved. They've been able to resolve the tree of life, the tree that Darwin first drew and actually said that some time, we'll have a complete tree of life and understand the relationships of all the creatures on the planet.  And that dream is much closer because of the power that's come through understanding the DNA record of evolution. And this DNA record has absolutely exploded. Twenty years ago, if you typed out all of the DNA information scientists have gathered and put it in a normal size book, it would just fill one volume, just like that book. But if you now typed out all the DNA information we have and stack those books, it'd be somewhere close to two miles high.  And we're just mining this record for information about how species adapt to particular habitats on the history of life. And some of the new volumes going into that record are from extinct species. So the capability now to sequence DNA from wooly mammoths, from fossil material, including the Neanderthals, our closest extinct cousin, is giving us tremendous amount of information about the past.  FLATOW: Now you sort of switched careers for a little bit to write this book, right? You're an evolutionary biologist, but you're writing a historical book. When you go in and you look at the records, do you say, what am I doing here?  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: This is not my topic, but I'm yet making all these discoveries that some of the great historians may have missed?  Dr. CARROLL: Well, I don't know about great historians missing - there is a chance, I think - certainly, I think every historian would say that they're going to take a fresh look at any historical record.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. CARROLL: But the historical record is at the same time being opened up to people like myself and anyone in the audience with a browser, because a lot of these documents, including correspondence and rough manuscripts and field diaries and notebooks and all that, are being put online.  And I found some of the gems that I used in this book, really from - that I didn't know existed from any other source when I looked at rough drafts and said, my goodness. Look at what he is saying. Look at how he's saying it. Something that may not be present, for example, in the published form of later works.  FLATOW: So you could actually see - let me just remind everybody that this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Sean Carroll, author of \"Remarkable Creatures. \"  Could you actually look at Darwin's rough draft\u2026  Dr. CARROLL: Oh, absolutely.  FLATOW: \u2026and see things that were not there in the final, or had changed? Yes?  Dr. CARROLL: Oh, yeah. Certainly. There are big changes between - as Darwin wrote down - he first wrote about a 35-page sketch of his idea about species in 1842 - I can happily say that not only have I see that online, I actually held it in my hands - and then two years later extended that to about 230 pages. And while there's resemblance to what we see in \"The Origin of Species,\" clearly, these ideas were changing, and some things he decided not to emphasize at all. So some of his early writings, he was very much pointing out how his thinking was absolutely at odds with creationism, with a creationist idea that every species were especially created. You won't find any of that language, you know, on \"The Origin of Species. \"  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. You right that Darwin played a dodging game for 20 years. What was he dodging?  Dr. CARROLL: Well, he was dodging that very fact. He was dodging his concern, certainly as a young man just coming from a voyage when he realized that species do change, and this was heresy. The doctrine, the dogma was that species were immutable, created by God. And he thought, no, species come about in a natural process, as natural as the way, you know, waves, you know, shake the sea coast or the way planets move around in the heavens. He knew that he couldn't go public with this.  And there was a mixture of concerns. One was, you know, he wanted more evidence. Another was the people who had trained them, for whom he had very tender feelings, the people who - such as Reverend John Henslow, who he corresponded with throughout the voyage and who always bucked up his courage and received specimens from Darwin and distributed them to the best experts in the country. I mean, Darwin loved Henslow.  And, you know, Reverend John Henslow, if you were a member of the Cambridge or Oxford faculty, you were an ordained clergymen of the Anglican church. And this was - to say that species changed was heresy, you know, to these men. And so, you know, he was sensitive to that. And his courage didn't really grow until much later.  FLATOW: So he put off publishing for 20 years\u2026  Dr. CARROLL: Yeah.  FLATOW: \u2026what he could have done 20 years before.  Dr. CARROLL: Oh, yeah. In 1844, he had a 230-page manuscript that spells it all out in really full detail.  And he said to his wife at the time, he said, you know, should I die, you know, see to it this is published. So he was willing to have it published after he was dead, but not while he is alive. At least that was his thinking in 1841.  FLATOW: Did he feel Wallace breathing down his neck, or other scientists that he felt, I'd better do this now?  Dr. CARROLL: No. He didn't feel - in the 1840s, he didn't feel that sort of urgency.  FLATOW: But I mean, 20 years later, what finally was the\u2026  Dr. CARROLL: Well, he always said he was going to write this big book. And he was working on the big book for a few years when Wallace's letter from the Malay Archipelago arrived. And he said to his friends, whom he had confided all his thoughts to, he said, you know, Wallace couldn't have written a better abstract with my theory if he had had, you know, all my notebooks in front of him. So he saw a - you know, immediately that what Wallace had conceived was, you know, the - potentially, the nucleus of the idea that he had. And I think that had to give Darwin the energy to complete the big book that we know as \"On the Origin of Species. \"  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And he published that right then\u2026  Dr. CARROLL: A year later. A year after\u2026  FLATOW: He did it in\u2026  Dr. CARROLL: 1859.  FLATOW: \u20261859.  Dr. CARROLL: Yeah.  FLATOW: That's where we got that 150th anniversary\u2026  Dr. CARROLL: That's right.  FLATOW: \u2026this year. All right. We're going to take a short break and then come back and talk more with Sean B. Caroll, who's author of the \"Remarkable Creatures: Epic Adventures in the Search for the Origins of Species. \" Also joining us will be D. Bruce Means, who's going to talk about little things, stuff a little bit closer to home, and that's stuff here in Florida. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow here in Tallahassee in Florida, broadcasting from the Origins '09 conference on origins, very interesting stuff that's going on down here. And we're talking this hour about evolution and the remarkable naturalists and scientists who traverse the globe of facing all kinds of hardships, collecting evidence that Darwin needed to cement his theory.  With me is Dr. Sean B. Carroll, who's author of \"Remarkable Creatures: Epic Adventures in the Search for the Origins of Species. \" And also joining us now is another very famous naturalist who - you know, because we are broadcasting from FSU this hour - FSU is in Tallahassee. And while you may know Tallahassee is the state capital, you may not know that the area around the capital's a really hot spot of biodiversity in North America. And it's actually happening right here on our desk at the moment, where a snake has magically appeared out of the pocket of my next guest, and that's Dr. D. Bruce Means.  He is the author of \"Stalking the Plumed Serpent and Other Adventures in Herpetology. \" He's president and executive director of the Coastal Plains Institute and Land Conservancy, and adjunct professor of biology at Florida State University. He has also recently described the new family of frogs, not here in the Panhandle, but in Guyana, and we'll ask him about that.  And if you want to check out one of Bruce Means' eastern diamondbacks that he caught near Tallahassee, you can go to our Web site, it's sciencefriday. com, and watch Flora Lichtman's latest SciFri pick of the week. And we went out there yesterday, Flora went out there and got a good look at their diamondback.  Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Dr. D. BRUCE MEANS (Author, \"Stalking the Plumed Serpent and Other Adventures in Herpetology\"): Thank you (unintelligible). Glad to be here.  FLATOW: That was some trick you just did. I've never been - I've been upstaged many times, but never by a snake coming out of - right here on SCIENCE FRIDAY.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. MEANS: Yeah. It doesn't make the impact of the video show would've had. But\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Well, I mean, there is an awful lot of biodiversity around here in North Florida, is there not?  Dr. MEANS: Absolutely. And that's what the snake is all about. This is a race of king snake found just in this area. And the area between Tallahassee and Pensacola, Florida is very special because it's highly rich in species of plants and animals.  For instance, it has more snakes, more frogs, more turtles, and a whole bunch of other things in high numbers in the United States and Canada. So it's a biodiversity hot spot of great importance. And not very much is known about it.  FLATOW: Hmm. And you actually have a subspecies of snake named after you.  Dr. MEANS: Well, that's this guy here, you know.  FLATOW: How did that happen?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. MEANS: Oh, golly. It goes back to the 1960s. I've been here a long time. I used to ride through the national forest locally, and I found this strange-looking snake. It's a king snake, which normally is black with rings - light around it. And this thing is totally solidly colored, light-colored animal. And the long story of it is, I did what biologists have done, trying to understand the variation in animals. I bred different individuals to each other, got young, crossbred them, bred them back to the parents. And I crossed this thing with the normal king snake.  And what I discovered was it's a race that's uniquely found in one area between two rivers. And one wants to ask, well, how did that develop? You look for an isolating mechanism. And right in the middle of that spot are two old barrier islands that, apparently, there - the early populations got established there, and the snake, you know, drifted and the color matches the sand, or the background. And that particular area has 15 plants that are endemic to the same region. So, it's looking at biodiversity by understanding the variation that occurs in (unintelligible).  FLATOW: Right. So you can have evolutionary process going on just in the island next door.  DR. MEANS: Absolutely. That's classic.  FLATOW: Yeah.  DR. MEANS: Yeah.  FLATOW: That's classic, I mean, but is it something as close as right outside your own backyard?  DR. MEANS: And that's true all over the world. That's been the case.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Tell us about the difference - I think most Americans are familiar with Southern Florida. It's in the news a lot. It's got the\u2026  DR. MEANS: Right.  FLATOW: \u2026swamps. It's got all kinds of different stuff we see on the news. But how is the biodiversity different in the Panhandle than it is in the Everglades and the other places in the Florida Panhandle?  DR. MEANS: Very different. It's quite easy to explain, as a matter of fact. Peninsular Florida, as you go down the peninsula, it becomes less and less relieved. There's less and less physical diversity. And there's a thing called a peninsula effect that happens with plants and animals. The plants and animals that occur at the base of the peninsula, 50 to 60 percent of them don't make the tip of the peninsula. For instance, the whole\u2026  FLATOW: Really?  DR. MEANS: \u2026bottom of the peninsula is the Everglades, whereas up here we have lots of relief, ravines and things that we don't have down in South Florida. And this is continental up here. You know, the peninsula is a flatter, lower lying land. So - and it also juts into the warmer climes of the world.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  DR. MEANS: So you'd expect things to be different down there, and indeed they are. And up here, we have this wonderful hotspot.  FLATOW: Wow. And you also have cooler weather up here, right, than you have down in Southern Florida.  DR. MEANS: Right, we certainly do. But not as cold as I don't like.  (Soundbite of laughter)  DR. MEANS: I was raised in Alaska, and I came here to get away from all that.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Such a difference. Let's see if we have any questions from the -anybody up there at the mic want to ask a question? Yes, step up please. Go ahead.  Unidentified Man #2 (Audience Member): Yes, Dr. Carroll, I hope everyone is coping with our pollen pretty well here. So, but Dr. Carroll, you mentioned last night briefly about genetic research that's kind of looking back, trying to hopefully explain and support on natural selection. Can you give a couple of examples? I mean, had there been genetic research that kind of helps explain diversity?  Dr. CARROLL: Oh, absolutely. There's been an explosion of information about adaptation of all sorts of creatures. And I hate to tell you, but it's all plugged in another book called \"The Making of The Fittest. \" Understanding how all sorts of species - mice, fish, plants, etc. - are adapting to their local conditions and documenting how that's occurring at the DNA level and where the new traits come from, where the new capabilities come from. There're many, many, many case studies now, and that's well documented. Color vision, for example, in animals is another case.  So just, say, in the last 10 years, there's just dozens and dozens of examples where we know the precise basis of adaptation at the DNA level.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Unidentified Man #2: Thanks.  FLATOW: Yes, sir. Why don't you just step up and ask the next question? Go ahead.  Unidentified Child #1 (Audience Member): Also, you were talking about how Darwin found (unintelligible) bones. Did his theory - was it incorrect or correct?  Dr. CARROLL: Well, Darwin himself found all sorts of fossils when he was on the Beagle of mammals. He found things that were related to sloths and to armadillos and to llamas and things like that. He didn't find any - he didn't know anything about, really, human fossils. But his idea that species change is certainly correct, and his idea that fossils represented older, now extinct creatures that were related and gave rise to living - the current living species was certainly correct. But he was waiting for a lot more evidence to understand the whole history of life. And that's when a whole lot more scientists had to contribute to over the last 150 years.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Bruce, you know, Florida is obviously not a good enough place to spend all your time, because you've been going to Guyana, and you actually have found some interesting new things there. Tell us about that.  Dr. MEANS: Yes. The kind of work that Sean does is work that I need to do. You know, I'm an old-fashioned biologist that looks at the animals and tries to figure out whether they have different species based on their morphology. But it turns out, the DNA that we use\u2026  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. MEANS: \u2026for human fingerprint analysis and the like is very, very - I mean, for finding out whether\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. MEANS: \u2026you know, (unintelligible) is very, very useful. And so, if you apply it to a bunch of salamanders that you can't tell apart morphologically, the DNA will tell you, oh, yeah, these are related to each other because they have much closer genetic relationships and these don't, and therefore you may have a new species.  Any person who is a field biologist, who's trained in the temperate zones of the world - and most of us are - in order to really understand evolution and ecology, we need to have some experience in the tropics because the world, for most of its history, and even now, has more tropical environments than it does, well, has always has more tropical environments than the temperate ones.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. MEANS: So, I went by backpack to South America when I was younger, 25 years ago, and I start exploring one particularly wonderful area that I've fallen in love with. And that's led to lots of interesting things.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And you talked about - what about your frogs, family of frogs?  Dr. MEANS: And those indeed are some of the most interesting things. I've been exploring mountains in Guyana - which used to be British Guyana - Venezuela and Brazil, that rise to almost 10,000 feet. They're flat top mesas, but they're clothed with rainforest on the slopes and the upper slopes are cloud forest.  A lot of people have studied them by helicopping(ph) to the summits, but nobody's done any transects of the slopes because you can't land there.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. MEANS: So, I've been trying to do that. And I found all these - so every time I go back to one of these mountains, it's only 35 kilometers by 17, and I've made three expeditions there. Every time, I find two or three new frogs new to science. I've got an earthworm that's about four feet long, big around as. . .  FLATOW: So you were looking for frogs and discovered the earthworm.  Dr. MEANS: The earthworm, crabs and a whole bunch. But among these frogs - and here's where the DNA comes in - among these frogs, they all look relatively similar. And so, I collaborated with people who have a DNA lab. And two of these little frogs were so different from all the rest of them, that they are a family of frogs unique because their DNA is so different.  And, in fact, they fit in a category between all the frogs that - there are many frogs in the new world that lay eggs that develop directly into little froglets. But then all the other frogs as we know, the more primitive condition is to lay eggs that develop into tadpoles. We don't - this one's in between, and we don't know what it does. And guess what? Isn't that a raison for going back, doing the whole thing?  FLATOW: Absolutely. Isn't it great when we don't know what something does?  Dr. MEANS: Yes. Yes.  FLATOW: I mean, you know, that's the best part about science, is finding the thing we don't what it does.  Dr. MEANS: That's right. Yeah.  FLATOW: Sean, these people you were talking about in your book found a lot of things that they didn't know what did or where they came from or what the fossils meant.  Dr. CARROLL: No. And that was the joy of their lives, is pursuing - exploring the unknown, not knowing what was around the corner. And, you know, Bruce is the embodiment of this. He's exploring territories that still exist in the world that people do not know what is there and discovering things that bridge important gaps in our knowledge in science.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Would you like to have been around there, Bruce, with those guys?  Dr. MEANS: Oh, yes, indeed. It was easier to find all kinds of new things. But that's not what it's all about. What it's about is in order to know how important biodiversity is, you have to know what the components are, the components of the species. It's not so easy to have a eureka moment where you say, oh, there's a new species, when you're out\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. MEANS: \u2026these days. But using the techniques of DNA and other new biological techniques, there still is plenty out there to find. In fact, E. O. Wilson has - and others have claimed we only know about 10 percent of the animals and plants on this planet.  FLATOW: And lot of those are vanishing.  Dr. MEANS: Yes, absolutely. But you don't know they're vanishing\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. MEANS: \u2026(unintelligible) if you don't what they are.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. MEANS: So, we still have lots of that basic work to do.  FLATOW: Let's see if we can go to the audience, ask a question here. Yes, step right up. Yeah.  Unidentified Child #2 (Audience Member): I have a question for Mr. Carroll. Earlier on, you mentioned how Wallace and Darwin were such beautiful friends. I was wondering were there any people in his time that tried to put him down or, you know, used his ideas and claimed them as their own, since I know that some people cheated Archimedes in that way.  Dr. CARROLL: That's a great question. Darwin faced a lot of opposition. And, in fact, really, we should be talking about Owen as the father of evolution because there was a person in England - the person who named, for example, the word dinosaur and who was the leading expert on fossils that were being excavated from - especially all over the shoreline of England long before Darwin came back from the Beagle.  But Owen absolutely rejected any idea that species changed. And when - and he was a, really, a bitter enemy of Darwin's ideas. So there were people, many people who, in the scientific establishment, who opposed Darwin's ideas at first. And Darwin just had to wait for them to die off.  FLATOW: Hmm.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Talking about evolution this hour in SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow here in Tallahassee with Sean Carroll and Bruce Means. Sean is author of the book \"Remarkable Creatures: Epic Adventures in the Search for the Origins of Species. \"  That last comment you made about scientists waiting for the others to die off is universal, is it not, through the history of science?  Dr. CARROLL: I think it's part of human nature.  FLATOW: That's how - you know, books have been written about, to get a new idea accepted, you just have to wait for the old guy to - now an old woman might die off. (unintelligible) they even had women in science years ago.  Let's see if we can go right to the audience. Lots of questions there. Yes, sir, please.  Unidentified Man #3 (Audience Member): Okay. For Dr. Carroll, how much - the publication in 1859 of the - of \"Natural Selection\" has an explanation of evolutionary change. How much of was due to the spark of insight of Darwin and Wallace? How much was it due uniquely to them, or was it on the immediate horizon just due to the mass of descriptive biology that was being accumulated at that time?  Dr. CARROLL: I would say it was - the vast majority of that was the credit to Darwin and Wallace. This was a revolutionary idea in - the two boldest ideas that Darwin had, the idea that all living species had descended from ancestors who descended from earlier ancestors all the way back - I don't think anyone could claim they had that idea - and the idea of natural selection as a mechanism for change.  And Darwin presented such an integrated synthesis of evidence from so many fields that while there may have been people that had some notions about species changing or variation among individuals and things like this, Darwin really pulled it all together.  You know, I think it's sort of like saying, well, there were some baseball players around, but this was - Darwin and Wallace, they were the Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio, you know, of the time. They were really at the actual, you know, top of the game and had the most information that was most pertinent to the solution to the big question.  FLATOW: I only have about a minute left. Is there - are there other people you would've liked to have put in? I mean, how did you do triage, whom to leave out in the book?  Dr. CARROLL: Well, I mean, there were a lot of criteria. They had to do something dramatic, they had to find something important, and I actually had to admire them. I didn't write about anybody I didn't like.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. CARROLL: There was so much I found to admire in these people. I think it put a pretty good collection together.  FLATOW: You got one name who you would maybe make the second cut?  Dr. CARROLL: No, I think the next - I look forward to writing the next book about the next 20 years of adventures that people are going to take because some of these stories were just completed in 2006 and 2007. The passion is very much alive in the scientific community.  FLATOW: Who's out there now? Who's working now?  Dr. CARROLL: Well, the paleontologists.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. CARROLL: I mean, Darwin didn't know a lot about the history of life. The paleontologists - Darwin said that the crust of the Earth is a vast museum. We've only uncovered a tiny percentage of what's down there  FLATOW: All right. It's a great way to end. I want to thank you both for taking time to be with us.  Bruce Means, who is a local hero here in Northern Florida in the Panhandle. He's head of the Coastal Plains Institution. Carroll, author of \"Remarkable Creatures: Epic Adventures in the Search for the Origins of Species. \"  Gentlemen, thank you for taking time to be with us today.  Dr. CARROLL: Thank you.

The actually - the very essence of the word organic. And that is carbon, but not just any carbon, but the beautiful molecules of pure carbon. Chances are that some of you in the audience, as we speak, are wearing pure carbon. Some of you might be wearing diamonds. Actually there's a woman looking at her diamond ring right now knowing that that's a pure carbon in a crystal lattice and makes it very strong. Some other people - I don't have my pocket protector on today, but let me assure you that when it's on it has some pencils in there and it's got graphite in it. And that's a form of pure carbon that's not very hard at all because it has a different structure to it - how the atoms are arranged in it and the little sheaths that slide past one another making it very slippery. Well, back in the mid-1980's, my next guest and his colleagues discovered a third kind of pure carbon and they called it buckminsterfullerene. And because they looked at Buckminster Fuller, the geodesic domes and say, hey, they're built exactly the same way and they got to be known in the short version as buckyballs because they had a very particular shape. The carbon atoms were arranged in a sphere just like a soccer ball. You know, the soccer ball has two different colors on it. Well, that's exactly the different arrangements that a buckyball has, pentagons and hexagons that are connected together. And there is really an interesting story behind the discovery of the buckyballs and where that discovery has led and where it is going. And here to talk about it is the man who made that discovery. Harry Kroto received the 1996 Nobel Prize in chemistry. He's a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Florida State University. And did you know, he had a Nobel Prize winner living right here amongst you, right here in town? (Soundbite of applause) FLATOW: And very happy to have Dr. Kroto - thank you for taking time to be with us today. Dr. HARRY KROTO (1996 Nobel Prize Winner in Chemistry): My pleasure. FLATOW: How did that discovery come about? I've got about two minutes to the break, let's see if you can give me a capsulized version. Dr. KROTO: Well, it fits very well into the origin issue because I'm intermediate between laser and (unintelligible) because I was interested in what was going on in stars - carbon stars - stars that produce carbon. All the carbon in your body is produced into a carbon star. And it blew up, blew your carbon atoms out into space. And today, they landed up here in this room today. And you're lucky to be here because most of the people who could be here, in the empty seats, are still out there. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. KROTO: And a lot of people around who, I think, we should send back out into space as well. (Soundbite of laughter) But basically, I was interested in some discoveries we made earlier by radioastronomy of carbon, which was in the interstellar medium. These were carbon chain molecules. And one day I ended up in Rick Smalley's lab with Bob Curl, who's a friend of mine, and he was jumping around (unintelligible) character. And he had this laser vaporization system which vaporized silicone and carbides. And it struck me, we could simulate the conditions in the star, which is basically your mommy. I mean that's where your carbon came from. And in - to understand the chemistry  - and when we managed to get around to that experiment, it would work perfectly, exactly as I thought it would. But there was this crazy C60 molecule turned up at the same time. And it's blighted my life ever since. FLATOW: Wow. We'll see if we can make it even worse for you today. We're going to have to take a break and come back more and talk with Harry Kroto about buckyballs and buckminsterfullerenes and buckypaper and all kinds of new kinds of things. So, stay with us. We'll be right back after this break. (Soundbite of applause) I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow here in Tallahassee at Florida State University talking with Harry Kroto who received the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and who was the first to discover the buckyballs. You were telling us a little bit of that history that you've tried to imitate what was going on out in the deep recesses of space right there in your laboratory and out pop these buckyballs. Dr. KROTO: That's exactly what happened. And so, we can conjecture that these things are out in space as well. And that's not yet proven, but I think they're there. FLATOW: And then what was so special about the properties of these that made them different from the diamonds and graphite? Dr. KROTO: Well, first of all, they're actually pure as opposed to diamonds and graphite which are not. FLATOW: They're not pure? Dr. KROTO: No, no. FLATOW: That's a myth. We're dispelling a myth - all these years. Dr. KROTO: Yeah. What is on the surface of diamond will be hydrogen and hydroxyls and OH groups and many groups. So the surface will not be actually pure. It's actually not carbon. There are things attached, atoms attached to it\u2026 FLATOW: Impurities. Dr. KROTO: Yes. So, C60 is the only pure form. So, you should pay me what you're prepared to pay for your diamonds if you're\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Can you make\u2026 Dr. KROTO: If only. FLATOW: Can you make me a buckyball of three carats? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. KROTO: Yeah, I could\u2026 FLATOW: Can't do that yet, can you? Dr. KROTO: No, no. But it's an interesting point, yeah. But the, I think the major aspect of the discovery of C60 is that it changed our whole perspective on the nanoscale world and what we call self-assembly. What happens is we allow things to assemble from the bottom up. And that's nanotechnology and nanoscience. And it, to some extent, catalyzed a new perspective - not a new area of science - but a new perspective on the way that the 21st century chemistry and material science will move. We didn't really fully appreciate that something symmetric as this would self-assemble. And, in fact, the first five papers said we were wrong. FLATOW: Really? Dr. KROTO: I mean - yeah. I mean, it's an interesting point. We didn't have to wait for them to die to prove it. We actually just shoved it down their throat. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. KROTO: That is, if we could actually make it after five years. And I mean, it's an important point when you have a paradigm-shifting breakthrough, it's very hard to actually accept and it was difficult for us as well. FLATOW: Right. Dr. KROTO: I mean, in a sense, it seemed like when you take all the balls on the billiard table they would - and then throw them on the table - they would automatically end up in the triangle on a snooker table. That's what it appeared to be. But, in fact, people haven't fully appreciated it was energy-driven and not what we call entropy-driven. FLATOW: Right. Dr. KROTO: So, now we understand that and now I think we can move on to this new world in which we're going to assemble, say, chips from the bottom up by chemistry. FLATOW: And give us an example of what you're talking about. What's the potential for kinds of products, so we could make computer chips that way, you say? Dr. KROTO: Well, let me just make a dig at you. FLATOW: I like digs. Dr. KROTO: Basically, I think it's an important thing that people in fundamental science always get a bit worried about is, that we're always asked what are the applications. And to some extent, we're not driven by that. FLATOW: Right. Dr. KROTO: Fundamental science is driven by just curiosity. And so, what I would emphasize is that our breakthrough really changed our views about, I think, two-dimensional space, two-dimensional materials, how they would behave. We used to think graphite would just be flat. Well, it's not. We know that in small bits it will curl up and close up. But I will get around to the applications - but, by and large, that's what people want. If they're going to pay scientists to do science\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. KROTO: \u2026they would want some payoff at the end. And to some extent what has happened - what always has happened - is it's difficult to convince people to pay money just to have a good time. FLATOW: Right. Dr. KROTO: But mind you, they don't - they don't worry about kids. I mean, we're just big kids, really, so you want your kids to have a good time. You don't mind that they don't go out to work for a while. But by and large, what happens is they uncover unexpected things. And a fundamental science does that. I think it uncovers the big surprises that no one appreciate, that no one thought was going to be there. FLATOW: Such as? Give me some of the big surprises that it uncovered? Dr. KROTO: Well, DNA is a good example of a big surprise. Who would have thought that this breakthrough would have been used 50 years later to free someone from prison, who had been in prison 25 years? FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. KROTO: Now, there was no way that you could predict DNA fingerprinting, and some - here in Tallahassee, a gentleman who was in 25 years for a crime he didn't commit. So, in a sense, it's the fundamental science, looking at the way the world works, which brings the surprise they didn't expect. Lasers are a good example. I mean, who would've expected that everybody would have a laser, say, just as well - in the supermarkets, just to work out\u2026 FLATOW: I mean\u2026 Dr. KROTO: \u2026what was going on. Everything\u2026 FLATOW: That you can make for just a few cents. Dr. KROTO: Yeah. Absolutely unbelievable. FLATOW: Yeah. Absolutely, yeah. Dr. KROTO: And Charlie Townes would never have dreamt about that. And I asked him, I said, well, what makes you most satisfied with your discovery. He said, when a gentleman came up to him and had his sight, sort of - he had laser eye surgery and could see again. He said, you know, that's nothing. He could never have expected anything like that. And I think that's why we have to be very careful about what we sustain. We need funding for fundamental science, because out of that fundamental science, the unexpected discoveries lead to massive breakthroughs. And if you're only looking at applications and strategic things, you leave this other area - very important ones - behind. FLATOW: What fundamental things don't we understand yet about this world? Dr. KROTO: Well, I think we really don't understand self-assembly very well, in the sense that it should be possible - and this goes back to your early statement about what applications - we should be able to dip a sort of disc into chemistry - into a chemical dish and then bring it out and we've got a DVD, okay? Or, we should be able to pour two chemicals together and make a computer. I mean\u2026 FLATOW: That should be possible, you\u2026 Dr. KROTO: Well, you know, we are - the best\u2026 FLATOW: We're self-assembled. Dr. KROTO: You are an example\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. KROTO: \u2026of nanotechnology, nanoscience. If you call it atom by atom, molecule by molecule, assembly of a complex and some not-so-complex organisms, then that's nanotechnology. So when people say, oh, you know, I heard something that's 60 percent of Americans think that nanotechnology is immoral and unethical. Well, they should all get - drop-dead then, because they are examples of nanotechnology. Because you've been set - assembled atom by atom, molecule by molecule, on the basis of this fantastic DNA blueprint. And so when are you going to understand that? Well, if we can - if you can be assembled by evolutionary process into what we are, we should - you know, we're in the 21st century. We should be able to assemble a transistor by this method, and I think we're on the way to doing that. And that's very exciting, which means that you could probably put a supercomputer into your wristwatch, you can lower the energy consumption. We should be able to build bridges that won't fall down in earthquakes. We should be able to print solar cells onto thin plastic sheets instead of using newspapers. I know newspapers are a problem, but some of them are not worth printing, I might point out. So - but, some of them are, and unfortunately the ones that are folding are the ones that are worth printing. But we should be able to print solar cells onto thin plastic sheets and cover up, you know, large parts of the world which probably should be covered up, you know? FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah. All using the self-assembly of nanotechnologies? Dr. KROTO: Yeah. FLATOW: We should be able to set up a set of instructions\u2026 Dr. KROTO: Yeah. FLATOW: \u2026to make something like our DNA makes something, it's a blueprint\u2026 Dr. KROTO: Yeah. FLATOW: \u2026and say, do it, and watch it self-assemble. Dr. KROTO: Well, that's been done. That's what we are. FLATOW: Yeah. So, yeah. Dr. KROTO: So it can be done. We just have to learn from biology how to do it. But we also have - it would be nice to be able to do it outside aqueous solution, because we are still (unintelligible) all this is in water. Some of the processes that we're familiar with, sort of electrons, they - conduction is really a non-aqueous system. And that's hard. That's where we should now make the breakthrough and learn from nature how to do that. FLATOW: Are you not fearful about what Michael Crichton wrote about in \"Prey,\" that these self-assembling things would get out of hand and become intelligent and\u2026 Dr. KROTO: No. I, you know, we've already gotten mosquitoes around here, which are, you know? Let me just say, we can't even make a mosquito, right? FLATOW: Right. Dr. KROTO: If you want to know a fantastic animal, it's a mosquito. It can sense you there, it can land on the ceiling upside down, and the closest we've got\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. KROTO: \u2026is a helicopter. And you try and let - put a helicopter on the ceiling. FLATOW: The closest thing to a mosquito we have is a mojito. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: So let's go to the questions right here. Unidentified Man #1: You talked about curiosity and having fun - wanted to hear your thoughts on exciting young people about science, going into the field and maybe doing some of the things that you've done. Dr. KROTO: Well, they're already excited about these things up to the age of eight or nine or 10. The problem is boys meets girls and girls meet boys at that age, and that seems to be a stumbling block. Some of them manage to get over this by the age of about 15 and 16 and decide science is better than the girls, you know? But, no, I'm being facetious, but it is a problem. And I think the biggest problem that I see is that the language of science is mathematics and symbolism. And if you don't learn that much earlier, then you may never be able to appreciate it so much. The curiosity is there, but it's like a language. If you can't speak Japanese, it's very difficult to appreciate the culture of Japan. And if you're Japanese and you don't understand English, it's very difficult to really appreciate Shakespeare. You can get the story, but the real culture is a problem. And there are many other - I mean, every scientist you would speak to has their own pet eye view of this. And my pet one is that the world now, is too easy for our young people, who are now 15, 16, 17 to get along with. They don't need any common sense to survive. Their mobile phone works, and when it doesn't work they throw it away because they can't fix it. There's nothing fixable. There's nothing that is like the world that I had, because if I - if something broke, I had to fix it, okay? So the radio didn't work, I took the back off, the fifth valve on the left wasn't lit up. I can see how it worked, took it out, put a new one in. FLATOW: But they were made to be fixable? Dr. KROTO: They were made to be\u2026 FLATOW: These things are not made to be fixable. Dr. KROTO: Well, that's true. I mean, my wristwatch here is liquid crystal display. It has basically a microprocessor in there, it's got computing capacity, it's made out of a material you didn't know. It's got a battery in there. This is 35 years old and it's still working. It's fantastic. But if it didn't - if it stopped working, that's it. FLATOW: You just chuck it out. Dr. KROTO: And I - as a kid, I had a watch, pocket watch, and I opened it up, and I could see how it works. So our kids don't how this world works. And that means we have - we are now in a - we used to have common sense. And that common sense told us that the sun goes around the Earth. Uncommon sense of Galileo was, let's just check this out. No, it doesn't. We are rotating. What has happened now is there not a lot of common sense, the hands-on things that we need to survive. And there's a lot of common nonsense, especially in the evolution debate here in Florida. (Soundbite of applause) FLATOW: All right. I'm surprised that hasn't come up yet. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. KROTO: I had to make a comment. FLATOW: We're talking about Harry Kroto this hour on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow with Harry Kroto, who is a 1996 Nobel Prize winner in chemistry. Do you want to make - talk about it all, while you have the chance? Dr. KROTO: Not really. It's very exciting. I would like to say, I think, for young people who go into science to win prizes, don't do that. FLATOW: Don't do\u2026 Dr. KROTO: I have - my - I went into science because - for a job, and I was very proud of what I've done by 1984, '85. And I was successful, I - there was no hope of a Nobel Prize. Then we made this unbelievably exciting discovery, and then the thing went away (unintelligible). But if I, we haven't made that discovery, I would have been very happy with what I've done. But I would say that one other thing is, is that I think we have to use the communication network for children now, and that's one thing that - one reason why I'm here in Florida\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. KROTO: \u2026is that Florida State wanted me to work on educational outreach using the Internet. And that's what we're doing, and what - particularly aimed at teachers. We have a GEOSET program, Global Educational Outreach for Science, Engineering and Technology, aimed at helping teachers to teach better. I think we've got to forget saying, oh, we've no science teachers. We got to use what's out there. We're not going to change that in 20 years. How can we do that? Well, Google, Wikipedia and YouTube. I call it the GooYouWiki(ph) world. It's changed everything. It's going to leave you guys behind if you're not careful. FLATOW: Hey, I'm part of that GooYouWiki world. Dr. KROTO: Yeah. But I think it shows that we can change the dynamics of teaching by giving people out there mechanism for their creativity to be put into a world that captures information. And Florida State is going to be the place where we're branching out to other places. FLATOW: Well, see, speaking of a young world, let's get the last question from a youngster in the audience. Yes? Unidentified Man #2: How did you come across buckyballs? Dr. KROTO: Well, as I mentioned, in the mid '70s - we did some radar astronomy - which you would just say that have nothing to do with anything on the Earth. I'm just interested in what was in space, we found carbon out there. Then for about five, six to 10 years, I'm thinking, why is it there and then looked at these carbon stars, which have been discovered, which were blowing your carbon. You were actually - all your atoms, your carbon, nitrogen and oxygen atoms were once inside a star. It's unbelievable. You're a bit of stardust. I thought it was fantastically exciting. I wanted to understand the chemistry in that star. In Texas, Rick Smalley, who sadly died three years ago, had developed a fantastic apparatus for vaporizing carbon with a laser. You take a laser and you vaporize metals. He - so I suggested, well, let's vaporize some graphite and simulate the conditions in the star, the chemistry in the star. And it was, as I said, it was just perfect. Everything worked, except for one thing, this damned C60 molecule turned up, huge peaks, saying look, you're wasting your time, look at me, this handsome C60 molecule. I'm the most important guy on the block, and it turned out to be so. And then we didn't know what it was. It had 60 atoms. And then, Both Rick and I have been to expo in 1967, long before you're born, in fact probably before your mother was born. That was a problem for me. And it - so Buckminster Fuller's ideas were in our minds. And on the basis of Buckminster Fuller's geodesic structures, we worked out what the structure was. And then we'd found out that it was the same as a soccer ball, and I couldn't believe it. FLATOW: Well, Harry, we have to get you out to talk some more, you know, because you are the best walking example of how good a teacher can be. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: You explain things - and just pure enthusiasm, you know. I know I'm part of the (unintelligible) world. You're not going to be a part of that, but, you know, you have this gift of the gab, I say. Dr. KROTO: Thanks a lot. FLATOW: No. And I'm glad that you have the burden of explaining this because you explain it very well. Dr. KROTO: Okay. Well, Bruce had a snake, but I've got Indiana Jones' hat, you see? FLATOW: There you go. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: There is no better way to round up our show today than to say thank you very much, Harry, for\u2026 Dr. KROTO: Okay. FLATOW: Dr. Harry Kroto, who received the 1996 Nobel Prize in chemistry, professor in the department of chemistry and biochemistry at Florida State University in Tallahassee.  IRA FLATOW, host:  We're going to, for the rest of the hour, talking about the stuff of life. The actually - the very essence of the word organic. And that is carbon, but not just any carbon, but the beautiful molecules of pure carbon. Chances are that some of you in the audience, as we speak, are wearing pure carbon. Some of you might be wearing diamonds.  Actually there's a woman looking at her diamond ring right now knowing that that's a pure carbon in a crystal lattice and makes it very strong. Some other people - I don't have my pocket protector on today, but let me assure you that when it's on it has some pencils in there and it's got graphite in it. And that's a form of pure carbon that's not very hard at all because it has a different structure to it - how the atoms are arranged in it and the little sheaths that slide past one another making it very slippery.  Well, back in the mid-1980's, my next guest and his colleagues discovered a third kind of pure carbon and they called it buckminsterfullerene. And because they looked at Buckminster Fuller, the geodesic domes and say, hey, they're built exactly the same way and they got to be known in the short version as buckyballs because they had a very particular shape.  The carbon atoms were arranged in a sphere just like a soccer ball. You know, the soccer ball has two different colors on it. Well, that's exactly the different arrangements that a buckyball has, pentagons and hexagons that are connected together. And there is really an interesting story behind the discovery of the buckyballs and where that discovery has led and where it is going.  And here to talk about it is the man who made that discovery. Harry Kroto received the 1996 Nobel Prize in chemistry. He's a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Florida State University. And did you know, he had a Nobel Prize winner living right here amongst you, right here in town?  (Soundbite of applause)  FLATOW: And very happy to have Dr. Kroto - thank you for taking time to be with us today.  Dr. HARRY KROTO (1996 Nobel Prize Winner in Chemistry): My pleasure.  FLATOW: How did that discovery come about? I've got about two minutes to the break, let's see if you can give me a capsulized version.  Dr. KROTO: Well, it fits very well into the origin issue because I'm intermediate between laser and (unintelligible) because I was interested in what was going on in stars - carbon stars - stars that produce carbon. All the carbon in your body is produced into a carbon star. And it blew up, blew your carbon atoms out into space. And today, they landed up here in this room today.  And you're lucky to be here because most of the people who could be here, in the empty seats, are still out there.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. KROTO: And a lot of people around who, I think, we should send back out into space as well.  (Soundbite of laughter)  But basically, I was interested in some discoveries we made earlier by radioastronomy of carbon, which was in the interstellar medium. These were carbon chain molecules. And one day I ended up in Rick Smalley's lab with Bob Curl, who's a friend of mine, and he was jumping around (unintelligible) character. And he had this laser vaporization system which vaporized silicone and carbides. And it struck me, we could simulate the conditions in the star, which is basically your mommy. I mean that's where your carbon came from.  And in - to understand the chemistry  - and when we managed to get around to that experiment, it would work perfectly, exactly as I thought it would. But there was this crazy C60 molecule turned up at the same time. And it's blighted my life ever since.  FLATOW: Wow. We'll see if we can make it even worse for you today. We're going to have to take a break and come back more and talk with Harry Kroto about buckyballs and buckminsterfullerenes and buckypaper and all kinds of new kinds of things.  So, stay with us. We'll be right back after this break.  (Soundbite of applause)  I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow here in Tallahassee at Florida State University talking with Harry Kroto who received the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and who was the first to discover the buckyballs.  You were telling us a little bit of that history that you've tried to imitate what was going on out in the deep recesses of space right there in your laboratory and out pop these buckyballs.  Dr. KROTO: That's exactly what happened. And so, we can conjecture that these things are out in space as well. And that's not yet proven, but I think they're there.  FLATOW: And then what was so special about the properties of these that made them different from the diamonds and graphite?  Dr. KROTO: Well, first of all, they're actually pure as opposed to diamonds and graphite which are not.  FLATOW: They're not pure?  Dr. KROTO: No, no.  FLATOW: That's a myth. We're dispelling a myth - all these years.  Dr. KROTO: Yeah. What is on the surface of diamond will be hydrogen and hydroxyls and OH groups and many groups. So the surface will not be actually pure. It's actually not carbon. There are things attached, atoms attached to it\u2026  FLATOW: Impurities.  Dr. KROTO: Yes. So, C60 is the only pure form. So, you should pay me what you're prepared to pay for your diamonds if you're\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Can you make\u2026  Dr. KROTO: If only.  FLATOW: Can you make me a buckyball of three carats?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. KROTO: Yeah, I could\u2026  FLATOW: Can't do that yet, can you?  Dr. KROTO: No, no. But it's an interesting point, yeah. But the, I think the major aspect of the discovery of C60 is that it changed our whole perspective on the nanoscale world and what we call self-assembly. What happens is we allow things to assemble from the bottom up. And that's nanotechnology and nanoscience.  And it, to some extent, catalyzed a new perspective - not a new area of science - but a new perspective on the way that the 21st century chemistry and material science will move. We didn't really fully appreciate that something symmetric as this would self-assemble. And, in fact, the first five papers said we were wrong.  FLATOW: Really?  Dr. KROTO: I mean - yeah. I mean, it's an interesting point. We didn't have to wait for them to die to prove it. We actually just shoved it down their throat.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. KROTO: That is, if we could actually make it after five years. And I mean, it's an important point when you have a paradigm-shifting breakthrough, it's very hard to actually accept and it was difficult for us as well.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. KROTO: I mean, in a sense, it seemed like when you take all the balls on the billiard table they would - and then throw them on the table - they would automatically end up in the triangle on a snooker table. That's what it appeared to be. But, in fact, people haven't fully appreciated it was energy-driven and not what we call entropy-driven.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. KROTO: So, now we understand that and now I think we can move on to this new world in which we're going to assemble, say, chips from the bottom up by chemistry.  FLATOW: And give us an example of what you're talking about. What's the potential for kinds of products, so we could make computer chips that way, you say?  Dr. KROTO: Well, let me just make a dig at you.  FLATOW: I like digs.  Dr. KROTO: Basically, I think it's an important thing that people in fundamental science always get a bit worried about is, that we're always asked what are the applications. And to some extent, we're not driven by that.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. KROTO: Fundamental science is driven by just curiosity. And so, what I would emphasize is that our breakthrough really changed our views about, I think, two-dimensional space, two-dimensional materials, how they would behave. We used to think graphite would just be flat. Well, it's not. We know that in small bits it will curl up and close up.  But I will get around to the applications - but, by and large, that's what people want. If they're going to pay scientists to do science\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. KROTO: \u2026they would want some payoff at the end. And to some extent what has happened - what always has happened - is it's difficult to convince people to pay money just to have a good time.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. KROTO: But mind you, they don't - they don't worry about kids. I mean, we're just big kids, really, so you want your kids to have a good time. You don't mind that they don't go out to work for a while. But by and large, what happens is they uncover unexpected things. And a fundamental science does that.  I think it uncovers the big surprises that no one appreciate, that no one thought was going to be there.  FLATOW: Such as? Give me some of the big surprises that it uncovered?  Dr. KROTO: Well, DNA is a good example of a big surprise. Who would have thought that this breakthrough would have been used 50 years later to free someone from prison, who had been in prison 25 years?  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. KROTO: Now, there was no way that you could predict DNA fingerprinting, and some - here in Tallahassee, a gentleman who was in 25 years for a crime he didn't commit. So, in a sense, it's the fundamental science, looking at the way the world works, which brings the surprise they didn't expect.  Lasers are a good example. I mean, who would've expected that everybody would have a laser, say, just as well - in the supermarkets, just to work out\u2026  FLATOW: I mean\u2026  Dr. KROTO: \u2026what was going on. Everything\u2026  FLATOW: That you can make for just a few cents.  Dr. KROTO: Yeah. Absolutely unbelievable.  FLATOW: Yeah. Absolutely, yeah.  Dr. KROTO: And Charlie Townes would never have dreamt about that. And I asked him, I said, well, what makes you most satisfied with your discovery. He said, when a gentleman came up to him and had his sight, sort of - he had laser eye surgery and could see again.  He said, you know, that's nothing. He could never have expected anything like that. And I think that's why we have to be very careful about what we sustain. We need funding for fundamental science, because out of that fundamental science, the unexpected discoveries lead to massive breakthroughs.  And if you're only looking at applications and strategic things, you leave this other area - very important ones - behind.  FLATOW: What fundamental things don't we understand yet about this world?  Dr. KROTO: Well, I think we really don't understand self-assembly very well, in the sense that it should be possible - and this goes back to your early statement about what applications - we should be able to dip a sort of disc into chemistry - into a chemical dish and then bring it out and we've got a DVD, okay? Or, we should be able to pour two chemicals together and make a computer. I mean\u2026  FLATOW: That should be possible, you\u2026  Dr. KROTO: Well, you know, we are - the best\u2026  FLATOW: We're self-assembled.  Dr. KROTO: You are an example\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. KROTO: \u2026of nanotechnology, nanoscience. If you call it atom by atom, molecule by molecule, assembly of a complex and some not-so-complex organisms, then that's nanotechnology. So when people say, oh, you know, I heard something that's 60 percent of Americans think that nanotechnology is immoral and unethical. Well, they should all get - drop-dead then, because they are examples of nanotechnology. Because you've been set - assembled atom by atom, molecule by molecule, on the basis of this fantastic DNA blueprint.  And so when are you going to understand that? Well, if we can - if you can be assembled by evolutionary process into what we are, we should - you know, we're in the 21st century. We should be able to assemble a transistor by this method, and I think we're on the way to doing that. And that's very exciting, which means that you could probably put a supercomputer into your wristwatch, you can lower the energy consumption.  We should be able to build bridges that won't fall down in earthquakes. We should be able to print solar cells onto thin plastic sheets instead of using newspapers. I know newspapers are a problem, but some of them are not worth printing, I might point out. So - but, some of them are, and unfortunately the ones that are folding are the ones that are worth printing.  But we should be able to print solar cells onto thin plastic sheets and cover up, you know, large parts of the world which probably should be covered up, you know?  FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah. All using the self-assembly of nanotechnologies?  Dr. KROTO: Yeah.  FLATOW: We should be able to set up a set of instructions\u2026  Dr. KROTO: Yeah.  FLATOW: \u2026to make something like our DNA makes something, it's a blueprint\u2026  Dr. KROTO: Yeah.  FLATOW: \u2026and say, do it, and watch it self-assemble.  Dr. KROTO: Well, that's been done. That's what we are.  FLATOW: Yeah. So, yeah.  Dr. KROTO: So it can be done. We just have to learn from biology how to do it. But we also have - it would be nice to be able to do it outside aqueous solution, because we are still (unintelligible) all this is in water.

That's where we should now make the breakthrough and learn from nature how to do that.  FLATOW: Are you not fearful about what Michael Crichton wrote about in \"Prey,\" that these self-assembling things would get out of hand and become intelligent and\u2026  Dr. KROTO: No. I, you know, we've already gotten mosquitoes around here, which are, you know? Let me just say, we can't even make a mosquito, right?  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. KROTO: If you want to know a fantastic animal, it's a mosquito. It can sense you there, it can land on the ceiling upside down, and the closest we've got\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. KROTO: \u2026is a helicopter.

Everything worked, except for one thing, this damned C60 molecule turned up, huge peaks, saying look, you're wasting your time, look at me, this handsome C60 molecule. I'm the most important guy on the block, and it turned out to be so. And then we didn't know what it was. It had 60 atoms.  And then, Both Rick and I have been to expo in 1967, long before you're born, in fact probably before your mother was born. That was a problem for me. And it - so Buckminster Fuller's ideas were in our minds. And on the basis of Buckminster Fuller's geodesic structures, we worked out what the structure was. And then we'd found out that it was the same as a soccer ball, and I couldn't believe it.

There's also money expected for research on human embryonic stem cells. President Obama has announced his intention to lift restrictions on federal funds for that research, restrictions that were imposed by President Bush. This poses something of a dilemma for states that have spending their own money on that research. NPR's Joe Palca reports. JOE PALCA: President George W. Bush placed severe restrictions on federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research, restrictions scientists said would delay the development of cures. So a half-dozen states - including California, Maryland and New York - decided to commit state funds to fill the gap, as it were. Ever since President Obama announced his plans to free up federal dollars for embryonic stem cell research, stem cell advocates have been trying to figure out what that will mean for their state programs. SUSAN SOLOMON: We have been doing a lot of thinking and planning about that, and I spent much of the day on conference calls with my staff about that. PALCA: Susan Solomon heads the New York Stem Cell Foundation. It's a nonprofit organization not a state agency. She helped push the state to adopt an 11-year, $600 million initiative to fund stem cell research two years ago. Naturally, she's thrilled that more money will be coming for stem cell research. SOLOMON: What you want to do is put the federal dollars to the best use. PALCA: And since New York researchers have had access to state money, they've started stem cell research that could immediately benefit from an infusion of federal dollars. SOLOMON: They have projects to be attached to quickly. PALCA: She says state funds remain critical, because there are still areas of stem cell research that are off-limits to federal support. For example, there's a congressional ban on creating new stem cell lines with federal money. In Maryland, Karen Rothenberg says the decision to fund stem cell research was more about economics than health. Rothenberg is dean of the University of Maryland Law School and chair of the state stem cell fund. KAREN ROTHENBERG: It was a strategic part of a much larger model of biotechnology advancement and economic development in the state. PALCA: But Rothenberg acknowledges a question hangs over every state stem cell program now that the federal government has indicated its intention to fund more embryonic stem cell research. ROTHENBERG: Why do we need to have this state special fund if we've now got this opening of the possibility of federal money? PALCA: Why indeed, says Caltech biologist David Baltimore. He was a member of the board overseeing California's stem cell program. He says it's unusual for states to support a specific area of biomedical research. DAVID BALTIMORE: They did it only in extremis, because the federal government was not doing it. But now that the federal government will be in this area, the rationale for the individual state programs becomes much less compelling. And I think they're going to have to rethink the basis on which they're carrying out their funding, if they continue funding at all. PALCA: But rethinking is not really an option in California. In 2004, the voters there passed Proposition 71, committing the state to spending $3 billion over the next decade. Alan Trounson heads the state's stem cell program. He says that money isn't going away. ALAN TROUNSON: Because it would require that the people would have to put a referendum in another proposition, if you like, to dismantle it. And I think that's most unlikely for that to occur. PALCA: So while some states may reconsider their commitment to stem cell funding, California's will be there for a while.

Now, a large study suggests that eating a lot of those juicy burgers and steaks may actually shorten your life. NPR's Patti Neighmond looked into what that study means for meat lovers. PATTI NEIGHMOND: This was a large study, over half a million men and women over the age of 50. They answered questions about specifics of their diet, and then researchers documented who died over the next 10 years. They found that people who ate the most red meat - that's beef, lamb and pork -were 30 percent more likely to die from heart disease or any type of cancer. While the study's biggest weakness is that it relied on people's memories of what they'd eaten over the previous year, epidemiologist Michael Thun, with the American Cancer Society, says the findings support what research has found over the last 20 years: Limit the amount of red meat in your diet. Dr. \ufffdMICHAEL THUN (Epidemiologist, American Cancer Society): Choose fish, poultry or beans as an alternative. And when you eat meat, eat smaller portions, select leaner cuts, and don't consider it the main course every day or even more than one time a day. Consider it a treat. NEIGHMOND: Which doesn't mean eliminate all red meat from your diet. While that wouldn't be a bad idea, Thun says it's okay to eat meat but, like so much else, in moderation. A few times a week is probably fine. A few times a month is better. And when you do eat red meat, he says, be careful how you cook it. Dr. \ufffdTHUN: When you heat meat, and particularly fat, at very high temperatures, you can produce a number of chemical groups that damage DNA. NEIGHMOND: So the American Cancer Society recommends baking, broiling or poaching instead of frying or grilling. And if you do grill, they say, try microwaving meat first to reduce the fat content, and then put it on the grill. Another problem the study found: processed meat, meats which are preserved, salted, smoked. The message here is simple, says nutritionist Barry Popkin from the University of North Carolina. Avoid them or at least, cut way back. Dr. \ufffdBARRY POPKIN (Nutritionist, University of North Carolina): There are a bunch of people that consume a pepperoni pizza daily or a hot dog a couple times a week, and they need to really cut that down to once a month. NEIGHMOND: In the study, the women who ate the most red meat were more likely to die from heart disease than men who ate a lot of red meat. Researchers don't know why. Epidemiologist Michael Thun says it's important to remember the risk associated with red meat is a lot less, even in fairly large quantities, than risks that result from other lifestyle choices like, for example, smoking. Dr. \ufffdTHUN: And smoking, depending on the age at which you're doing it and how long you've done it, is, say, tripling the death rate from all causes. NEIGHMOND: Compare that tripling of risk, a 300 percent increase in death, to what the study found about red meat, a 30 percent increase. Dr. \ufffdTHUN: I mean, smoking is in a class by itself, approached only, really, by moderate to severe obesity. NEIGHMOND: Researchers say the take-home message from the study is clear. When you do eat meat, make it mostly fish or poultry. In the study, people who ate more of these meats had the lowest death rate. Researchers don't know whether that was because something in the white meat was beneficial, like omega-3 fatty acids in fish, for example, or whether eating white meat just meant people ate less red meat.

Bush's presidency. That decision meant that women had to be 18 or older to access emergency contraception over the counter. As NPR's Richard Knox reports, the court said the Food and Drug Administration based its policy on politics, not science. RICHARD KNOX: Judge Edward Korman told the FDA that within 30 days, it must allow 17-year-old girls access to the so-called morning after pill without a prescription. And then he said the agency must reconsider its ruling that over-the-counter access to the pill should have age limits at all. One of the youngest plaintiffs in the case is 15-year-old Angelica Jaffe of Brooklyn. She was happy about the decision. Ms. ANGELICA JAFFE: It felt like a good thing, that people are actually listening to us, which was a good feeling. KNOX: Judge Korman's decision was strongly worded. He said the FDA repeatedly and unreasonably delayed a decision on over-the-counter access to emergency contraception, and he agreed with the plaintiffs that the agency's decision was arbitrary and capricious. Nancy Northup is president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represented five dozen medical and women's groups who brought the suit. Ms. NANCY NORTHUP (President, Center for Reproductive Rights): The decision is a very clear indictment of the politics in women's reproductive health decisions during the Bush administration. KNOX: It's unusual to get the kind of glimpse behind FDA's closed doors that Judge Korman's 46-page decision allows. The opinion quotes one staffer as saying, if this is not enough data upon which to base a decision, it's unclear what would constitute enough. It also quotes FDA staffers saying decisions were driven by the White House. The ruling felt like vindication to Susan Wood. Four years ago, she resigned in protest as director of FDA's Office of Women's Health. Dr. SUSAN WOOD (Former Director, FDA Office of Women's Health): This court decision is putting the responsibility back at FDA to do this again and this time, use the right process and respect what the evidence has to say, and reach a conclusion that's not been interfered with by the political leadership. KNOX: Those who fought for years against over-the-counter sale of emergency contraceptive pills say they'll fight on as the FDA takes the issue up again. Wendy Wright heads a group called Concerned Women for America. Ms. WENDY WRIGHT (President, Concerned Women for America): The FDA should not be interfering with the parental oversight with minor girls, and that's, in fact, what this judge has determined it ought to be doing. KNOX: Wright notes that the morning-after pill contains a higher hormone dose than regular contraceptives that require a prescription. She says the FDA has never done this before with an over-the-counter medication. She also said that emergency contraceptives have not lived up to the claims that their proponents made. Ms. WRIGHT: What we do know is that since the morning-after pill has been easily available, there has not been a decrease in the number of unexpected pregnancies, and there is no evidence at this point that the number of abortions has gone down. KNOX: Wright says one prominent researcher, James Trussell, has changed his earlier view that widespread use of the morning-after pill would reduce unintended pregnancies by half. Trussell heads Princeton University's Office of Population Research. Mr. JAMES TRUSSELL (Director, Office of Population Research, Princeton University): I mean, I did believe that at one time, and I wish that it were true, but I do not believe that it's true. KNOX: The latest evidence, Trussell says, is that many women still don't use the morning-after pill after unprotected sex, or don't use it consistently. But he's also happy about this week's court ruling. Trussell says the FDA's job is to determine whether a drug is safe and effective for individual women, not what its effect is going to be on society. Richard Knox, NPR News.

After months of merely rumbling, the volcano is now spewing ash nine miles into the sky. Scientists say the explosions could go on for months, and that's unwelcome news for central Alaska. Falling ash can clog the engines of snowmobiles and airplanes, both of which are essential to get people around there. Alaska Public Radio Network's Annie Feidt has more. ANNIE FEIDT: The volcano is located about 100 miles southwest of Anchorage, on the edge of the icy waters of Cook Inlet. As Redoubt's explosions continue, Alaskans will become as familiar with the daily ash fall advisories as they are with the weather forecasts. Geophysicist John Power calls the gritty substance messy and invasive. But the biggest problem ash poses is for airplanes. Dr. JOHN POWER (Geophysicists, Alaska Volcano Observatory): Aircraft and ash really don't mix. It's the principal hazard that you see in Alaska. You can imagine flying an airplane into a sandblaster - that's what happens when an airplane encounters an ash cloud. Presently, airplanes are doing all they can to stay out of the ash. FEIDT: The winds have so far carried the ash to the north and west of the most populated areas of the state. The tiny community of Skwentna was one of the first to report a dusting of the finely crushed volcanic rock. Steve Childs helps run a lodge in the village.

Mr. CHILDS: We're going to have to be. We got plenty of food in the freezer and moose hanging in a shed. So, we'll be sitting it out for a little bit. FEIDT: Childs remembers the last time Mount Redoubt erupted, 20 years ago. Scientists are looking back at that event to try to predict how the current episode will play out. John Power, with the Alaska Volcano Observatory, says in 1989, Redoubt continued sending out massive ash explosions for five months. Dr. POWERS: In this business, the past is always the key to the future. We might expect the volcano to behave that way again. However, it does have a way of writing a new history, if you will, and the volcano could behave very differently. It could shut down at this point, go into a longer eruption. It's really something where we're going to have to wait and see. FEIDT: And it's not just Alaska residents who will be waiting and seeing for weeks to come. Redoubt's ash clouds could have far-reaching impacts. During the 1989 eruption, ash hampered airline travel as far away as Texas. For NPR News, I'm Annie Feidt in Anchorage.

Mr. CHILDS: We're going to have to be. We got plenty of food in the freezer and moose hanging in a shed. So, we'll be sitting it out for a little bit.  FEIDT: Childs remembers the last time Mount Redoubt erupted, 20 years ago. Scientists are looking back at that event to try to predict how the current episode will play out. John Power, with the Alaska Volcano Observatory, says in 1989, Redoubt continued sending out massive ash explosions for five months.  Dr. POWERS: In this business, the past is always the key to the future. We might expect the volcano to behave that way again. However, it does have a way of writing a new history, if you will, and the volcano could behave very differently. It could shut down at this point, go into a longer eruption. It's really something where we're going to have to wait and see.  FEIDT: And it's not just Alaska residents who will be waiting and seeing for weeks to come. Redoubt's ash clouds could have far-reaching impacts. During the 1989 eruption, ash hampered airline travel as far away as Texas.  For NPR News, I'm Annie Feidt in Anchorage.

The national picture is anything by hopeful. Joanne Silberner referred to a finding that was actually published by Dr. Ashish Jha of the Harvard School of Public Health in the New England Journal of Medicine, and he's with me in the studio. Hi. Dr. ASHISH JHA (Harvard School of Public Health): Hello. SIEGEL: The finding was 1. 5 percent of US hospitals have a comprehensive electronic records system. Dr. JHA: Yeah. The number is not quite as dire as that, which is that another, about, eight percent of hospitals have a very basic electronic record. But no matter how you slice, 90 percent of American hospitals don't have an electronic health record. SIEGEL: And doctors and their practices, a little bit better than that, but not much. Dr. JHA: Not much. About 80 percent of doctors don't have an electronic health record. So we have a long way to go. SIEGEL: President Obama is now the second president in a row to be urging a conversion to electronic medical records. So, obviously, the idea doesn't strike people in the medical profession as quite so compelling as it strikes our policymakers. Why? What don't they see in it that's advantageous? Dr. JHA: Well, it's challenging. You know, these systems are very, very expensive. They're very disruptive to put in. And if there are financial savings to be had, if there are efficiencies to be gained, it's unlikely to go to the hospital or be felt by the doctor who puts in the system. So you're asking people to pay for electronic records and have the way they deliver care be disrupted, and yet may not - they may not reap the benefits. SIEGEL: Does the benefit - do I as a patient get to reap the benefit? Dr. JHA: You certainly do. So the patient certainly reaps the benefits, insurance companies can reap the benefits in terms of lower health care costs, but the doctors and hospitals, not as much. SIEGEL: But you also acknowledge that physician resistance is a contributing factor, here. And to suggest that it's not entirely a balance sheet calculation, it's a change that people don't like. Dr. JHA: That's right. You know, nobody likes change. And these systems are extremely disruptive. They change the way doctors practice medicine. It takes a little while to get used to. The good news is when you ask doctors a year later are you happy about the change, almost universally, they're very, very happy. They would never go back to a paper-based record. SIEGEL: Well, let's take all those points of resistance by doctors and hospitals and offer up against them $19 billion for electronic health records that's in the economic stimulus package. Dr. JHA: Yeah. SIEGEL: Is that enough to win over medical hearts and minds? Dr. JHA: It's a very good start. I think it's going to help a lot of doctors in the doctor's office getting an electronic record in. It's going to be a much smaller part of what is needed for the hospital sector. Unfortunately, it's just a down payment, and it's going to help some hospitals. But for a majority of them, they're going to need more financial aid than that. SIEGEL: Should I be concerned about the privacy of my medical records once they're out there, digitized in various databases? Dr. JHA: You know, that's always a concern. And the bottom line is I think both policymakers, doctors, hospitals are very aware of this issue. I think the technology exists to make sure that those records are kept confidential. I think that that is not the major barrier. I understand people's concerns, but I think at the end of the day, that's a solvable problem. SIEGEL: Now, to be perfectly candid, on this program a couple of weeks ago, we had a failure of the digital sound editing system that crashed and it left us winging it for about an hour. Fortunately, we had no patients in surgery at that moment. I mean, should we be sanguine about the reliability of such systems in hospitals or should we say no, I'd rather have some kind of hard copy back-up for everything we do. Dr. JHA: Yeah, that's a terrific question. And this is what makes these systems expensive, is you do need to build in those redundancies. You have to have duplicate and triplicate efforts for exactly the scenario you mentioned. I don't think that should take us away from putting in the electronic record, but we do have to thoughtful about the fact that these systems really need to be resilient.

I'm Ira Flatow. It wasn't too long ago, a few weeks ago that Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal denigrated something called volcano monitoring as sort of a waste of money. And well, they're denigrating it there in Alaska today, where they're seriously watching a volcano. Alaska's Mountain Redoubt continues to spurt and sputter. It began erupting last Sunday, and since then scientists at the USGS has been keeping a close eye on this 10,000-plus-foot volcano. And it's latest eruption occurred earlier this morning, sending a plum of ash to an altitude of 32,000 feet. And the volcano activity has caused some airline flights to be postponed, has disrupted the operations of some fuel oil terminals in the area, and put the residents of Kenai Peninsula on high alert. But don't expect a lava to start flowing down the side of Mt. Redoubt anytime soon. Joining now to tell us why and give us an update on the activity is my guest David Schneider, a Geophysicist at the US Geological Survey's Alaska Volcano Observatory. He's on the line with us now. Give us an update, Dr. Schneider. What's happening? Dr. DAVID SCHNEIDER (Geophysicist, US Geological Survey's Alaska Volcano Observatory): Well, our latest eruption was this morning at about 8:40 a. m. local time, and it was another pretty highly explosive eruption, put an ash cloud up to about 50,000 feet this time. FLATOW: Wow. Dr. SCHNEIDER: But it's not drifting towards any heavily populated parts of Alaska. It's been a pretty busy week here. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Is it dumping ash? It's not dumping ash on anybody yet, though. Dr. SCHNEIDER: Well, they don't really live near the volcano. And so, in this, the way the wind is blowing today, it's headed away from the - the populated parts of Alaska. FLATOW: And the last time we had an eruption like this was when? Dr. SCHNEIDER: About 12 hours prior to that. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Well, I\u2026 Dr. SCHNEIDER: Yeah. We have had over 10 explosive events here in the past week. Prior to that the most recent activity at Redoubt was in 1989 to 90 over a period of about four months or so. FLATOW: Thank you for being kind and anticipating what I really wanted to ask you. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Well, you know, the people have a vision of a volcano erupting and sending - spewing out the ash and dust, the clouds, and then all this hot red lava coming down the side. Dr. SCHNEIDER: Yes. This is a kind of boring lava for a lot of people. You know, it's a very viscous type of lava that doesn't really flow. And that leads to its explosivity, because it doesn't flow out of the vent. It tends to plug it up until the pressure becomes so great that it gets blasted out. Or, in the case of Redoubt, the dome continues to grow on a very precarious slope and it just fails due to over steepening. And that failure, that gravitational failure will sort of uncork the bottle, if you will. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And volcano watching, can you tell a volcano is going to be active before it actually happens? Dr. SCHNEIDER: If the volcano is instrumented, we can give some advance warning. We've been watching read out, really, since last fall. And when - increased our level of concern there for aviation and for ground hazards back late last year. And so, people had a fair bit of warning here to make preparations for ash fall and for the airlines and actually the Air Force base here, just north of here in Anchorage, to redeploy some aircraft as well. FLATOW: Give us an idea of the geology that we're talking about here. We know about Mount St. Helens on the area down there along the American Pacific and the Seattle area. Is this is the same as the Cascades? Is it the same kind of chain that goes up the coast into Alaska? Dr. SCHNEIDER: Yeah, that's correct. There's about 50 historically active volcanoes in Alaska that stretch about - along about 1,200 mile arc from just west of Anchorage, all the way out to the tip of the Aleutians. So, if you picture the - you know, usually, Alaska's down there south of California in most maps, but there's an arc of islands that stretches out across the North Pacific, and those are mainly volcanic islands. You know, some of these volcanoes rise up, you know, in excess of 10,000 feet. And readout's quite spectacular, because it's - you know, it's altitude's about 10,000 feet, but it's only about 25 miles from the ocean. And so there's a quite a lot of relief there visible from the Kenai Peninsula. And you can even see it here from Anchorage. FLATOW: So, is this part of the famous Ring of Fire? Dr. SCHNEIDER: Absolutely, this is the northern branch of the Ring of Fire. And, you know, these volcanoes tend to erupt explosively because of the magma type that's produced. FLATOW: So there's not going to be the lava dome here? Dr. SCHNEIDER: Well, there be a - we're anticipating at some point that Redoubt will stabilize and produce a lava dome, like it did during 1989 to 90, where there was a whole series of domes that were in place. There just won't be much of a flow of lava down the slopes. It just piles up because it's a very, very sticky substance. FLATOW: And the, as you say, these volcanoes tend to explode rather than flow around. Dr. SCHNEIDER: Yeah. That's right, just based mainly on the type of lava that are produced. We do have some volcanoes further west in the Aleutians that produce more of a lava flow type of eruption. But you can get really good pictures of those, because they're underneath the clouds. FLATOW: Yeah. Well, tell us what kind of sensors you have. Where do you put them? How do you monitor a volcano? Dr. SCHNEIDER: Sure. Volcanoes are monitored - our bread and butter is a - seismometers. And those are placed in networks around the volcano because the precursory earthquakes tend to be very small, maybe magnitude ones or twos, and so - at largest. And so the sensors need to be very local to the volcano. Then we put some farther away because typically what happens during eruption is seismometers are destroyed. In some volcanoes, we'll have real time, GPS sensors that can telemeter the data back, radio the data back to the observatory, and can measure deformation of millimeters. That would give some idea of the volume of magma that might be in the volcano. We conduct overflights that measure volcanic gases, and we use satellites routinely to look down and look for evidence of increased thermal activity. FLATOW: And how many - you mentioned there were dozens of these volcanoes. How of them are actually monitored? Dr. SCHNEIDER: You know, we - of the 50 historically active volcanoes in Alaska, about 30 of them have real-time seismic monitoring networks. And a smaller - a much smaller number have - continuous GPS receivers on them. FLATOW: And will you get closer to try to see what's happening actually inside the volcano? Dr. SCHNEIDER: You know, closer's a - you know, we - closer's never good. And so we can do quite a bit of work safely by taking overflights and looking down on the volcano, measuring gas. We have thermal imagers - a thermal imager that we can use out of a helicopter to take the temperature of the volcano remotely. We also Web cam - a battery powered Web cam just north of the volcano that sends us back information, to give visual observation as well. And what's really become very valuable in this eruption are a couple of weather radars. One, just the regular weather radar, FAA weather radar located about 40 miles away, and then a new USGS radar we just installed last Saturday\u2026 FLATOW: Wow. Dr. SCHNEIDER: \u2026it just became operational - to scan back and forth very rapidly over the volcano to detect an ash cloud. FLATOW: Wow. So you're going to be watching this very closely. Dr. SCHNEIDER: We have been. It's a bit of busy week. You know, it's been busy year in Alaska, actually. This is the third major eruption of a volcano since July. We had two out in Aleutians in July and August that were very large explosive eruptions that produced drifting gas and ash clouds that disrupted aviation across the Lower 48. FLATOW: So, it seems like it's making it's way around the rim, there. It started out in the Aleutians\u2026 Dr. SCHNEIDER: It does seem to be that way - kind of feel like a slot machine where you pull the lever and see which, you know, how the bars line up. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: So this is an active season, so to speak. Would you expect more, then? More volcanoes to erupt? Dr. SCHNEIDER: You know, right now, the ones that are active, we can - where there's earthquakes occurring, we can give a more short-term forecast. But, you know, quiet for the next day is the same as quiet for the next year. I mean, for things that are quiet, there's differentiating between stages of quiet. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. SCHNEIDER: So we'll just keep our eyes and ears on the ground here to see what's going on. FLATOW: Thank you, Dr. Schneider. Dr. SCHNEIDER: You're welcome.

I'm Michele Norris. MELISSA BLOCK, host: And I'm Melissa Block. Major cities across the country are putting a controversial new idea to the test. It has to do with getting homeless people off the streets. And according to a new study, it actually works. The name of the approach says it all: Housing First. NPR's Joseph Shapiro reports. JOSEPH SHAPIRO: The traditional way to help chronically homeless people is to get them into a temporary shelter, help them get sober or deal with a psychiatric illness. And then, once that hard work is done, they're ready to find a place to live. Housing First turns all that upside down. It finds the permanent place to live first. It doesn't matter if the homeless person is still drinking or using drugs because having a home is considered therapeutic by itself. And that's when case workers can best help someone with their problems. That makes sense to Richard Corbett. Mr. RICHARD CORBETT: This is home. The first time I came in here, I couldn't believe it because I had been on the street about a year at the time. SHAPIRO: Now, he lives in this sparse, two-room apartment with high, white ceilings in a solid row house in Washington, D. C. Corbett's 61. He's got a kind of Kris Kringle look with long, white hair and a bushy beard. He's struggled with depression and alcoholism. When he lived on the scary streets and in shelters, he says he'd drink just to fall asleep. He doesn't have to do that anymore. Mr. CORBETT: I think the safety of having a place that I could fall asleep on my own without having to force myself to go to sleep and not have to worry about being hit in the night with a brick upside the head and being robbed, something like that. SHAPIRO: Corbett says he doesn't drink very often now and only moderately when he does. Staff at Pathways to Housing got him into this apartment and then got him counseling. Mary Larimer is a clinical psychologist at the University of Washington. She studied a 75-unit apartment building for homeless people in Seattle because it used the Housing First approach and because it had created controversy. Ms. MARY LARIMER (Clinical Psychologist, University of Washington): The controversy is that there are a number of individuals who feel that it's important to use housing as a carrot and that by housing people who are not yet ready or able to stop their addictive behaviors and allowing them to continue to drink alcohol in the house that you - that we would be reducing their chances of sobriety or in some ways would be enabling them. SHAPIRO: So Larimer and her co-researchers studied the people who lived at the building called 1811 Eastlake. It takes on some of the hardest homeless people to help, those who are constantly on the streets and drunk. The research appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association, and it finds that their drinking dropped steadily over the first year they had their own apartments, from on average about 16 drinks a day to about 11. That's still a lot of booze, but even a small drop made a big difference. The study tracked down records of the time they spent in detox, in hospitals and jail and then compared how much government spent on them versus those still living on the streets. Larimer found the cost savings were enormous, about $2,500 less per person per month. Ms. LARIMER: Ultimately, abstinence is the safest goal and the desirable goal. I also think that there are people who are not in a position to attain abstinence immediately and that certainly people's chances of becoming abstinent are a lot better when they are in a warm, safe environment, and they have lots of caring people and services available to them immediately. SHAPIRO: Back at his home, Richard Corbett points out the pots in the front yard where he's getting ready to plant flowers. Mr. CORBETT: I'm in a much better place than before I got this place. It's just, it's a feeling of respect and dignity that I didn't have before.

Now a team of scientists in Sweden has shown that they do regenerate, just very, very slowly. The team reached its conclusions thanks to above-ground atomic bomb tests carried out during the Cold War. NPR's Joe Palca explains. JOE PALCA: Okay, here's how it works. Ratan Bhardwaj is a physician and scientist who went to work at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. Dr. RATAN BHARDWAJ (Karolinska Institute): We had this common idea of asking a very crazy question of - could we possibly date old cells? PALCA: That is, tell when the cell first came to be. Now, there are some cells in your body that you've had since you were a baby, but others are constantly turning over. Your outer layer of skin cells have only been around for a matter of days or weeks. But cells don't have dates stamped on them when they're born, so Bhardwaj and his colleagues had to come up with another way of dating them, and then they thought of the above-ground atomic bomb tests in the Cold War. Dr. BHARDWAJ: The atomic bombs liberated a demonstrable amount of C14, which we could actually trace and figure out how old that cell is based on that. PALCA: C14 is a radioactive form of carbon. This stuff spread all over the planet and got into everything, including people. Not enough to make them sick, but enough to detect in their cells. So the atomic bomb tests provided the date stamp Bhardwaj needed. Even after the tests ended, there was more Carbon 14 around than before the tests, so there was a Carbon 14 date stamp even for people born in the 1980s, just a smaller one. As they report in the journal Science, when  Bhardwaj and his colleagues used Carbon 14 levels to see how many heart muscle cells were turning over, to their surprise they saw there were some - not a lot, but some. Dr. BHARDWAJ: Only about a percent turnover in a 20-year-old, but the amazing thing is that that level isn't zero, and that's precisely what we didn't understand before. PALCA: The rate actually goes down to about a third of a percent for people in their 70s, but Bhardwaj says the point is, it's not zero. Dr. CHUCK MURRY (University of Washington): The longstanding view has been that the heart is one of the least regenerative organs in the body. PALCA: Chuck Murry is a stem cell biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. There are three classes of cells in the heart: the ones that make up blood vessels, the ones that make up connective tissue, and the ones that make up the heart muscle. Murry says the blood vessels and connective tissue clearly regenerate. Dr. MURRY: And the big debate really has been whether there is any turnover of the muscle cells. PALCA: Murry says the new research proves there is, and he says there are two main implications from this research. Dr. MURRY: The first is that your heart muscle cells are very long-lived and that you're going to probably die with most of the cells that you were born with. So you'd better take good care of them. PALCA: You know what he means: eat the right foods, get exercise, etcetera, etcetera. Dr. MURRY: The second thing is the more optimistic note, which is since there is a little bit of turnover, if we can figure out how this works, we can exploit it therapeutically. PALCA: In other words, find some way to coax the heart into repairing itself after a heart attack or trauma. That would be an unexpected bit of good news inspired by the Cold War atomic tests.

The idea might seem torn from the pages of a science fiction novel, but a new study in the journal Biological Science says it might not be so far off. NPR's Alix Spiegel has this story about an experimental treatment for kleptomania. One note: We've agreed not to use the last name of one person in this story because she admits to criminal behavior. ALIX SPIEGEL: Darlene(ph) has stolen hundreds of things in her 59 years: a $16 Sunbeam clothing iron, three bras from the Lane Bryant store near her house, televisions, and frozen dinners and her neighbor's pet rabbit. So it takes a minute for her to remember, when asked the exact nature of the last item she jacked. DARLENE: I would say the $10 paperback book from The Giant. SPIEGEL: Darlene, you see, is a former librarian, so books have always had a particular attraction. She says she's stolen more books than any other thing. DARLENE: Books were a really big thing with me, especially self-help books or recovery books. SPIEGEL: So you would steal self-help and recovery books? DARLENE: Yeah. It doesn't make a lot of sense. SIEGEL: It does make sense. In those books, Darlene would search out clues to her dysfunction, strategies for overcoming what felt like an uncontrollable need to steal. But for years, it didn't work, no matter what she tried, and she tried a lot. She'd wear tight clothing when she went into stores so there'd be no place to hide things. She'd shop with friend. And after a stint in jail for stealing, she found another strategy. DARLENE: I wore my inmate ID under my shirt. And whenever I would be tempted, I would look at that, but some part of me didn't really know how to stop. SPIEGEL: Which brings us to the subject of Professor Jon E. Grant and the pill for kleptomania. Grant is a professor of psychiatry at the University of Minnesota who for years has run a clinic for people with impulse control disorders, things like\u2026 Dr. JON E. GRANT (Psychiatrist, University of Minnesota): Gambling, sex, fire-setting, stealing. SPIEGEL: Now, traditionally, psychiatrists have classified these kinds of behavioral problems under a different category than substance abuse disorders like alcoholism or drug addiction, problems which involve actual chemical substances which are sometimes hard to shake. But after years of work, Grant began to wonder about that separation. Clients in both groups, he noticed, always said the same thing. Dr. GRANT: People will say, I know I shouldn't drink. I have problems when I drink, but I can't control my drinking. People were describing behaviors in this very same way. I know I shouldn't gamble. It causes me problems, but I gamble. I know I shouldn't shoplift, but I like doing it, and it causes me problems. I can't stop it. SPIEGEL: So Grant decided to try an experiment. In the mid-'90s, the FDA had approved a drug called Naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Dozens of studies have shown that it works pretty well, around 20 to 30 percent of the time. So Grant decided to test the pill on people with kleptomania. Dr. GRANT: Based on the fact that this clinically presents like an addiction, our thought was, why shouldn't we use a medication that's approved by the FDA for addiction to see if it can help people with shoplifting? SPIEGEL: The results of this small study were recently published in the journal Biological Psychiatry. It turns out that the people with kleptomania did respond to the pill. Before the pill, Grant notes\u2026 Dr. GRANT: On average, people were spending about an hour a week stealing. Almost two-thirds of them had quit any stealing behavior at the end of the study. SPIEGEL: Except for the people on placebos. Their behavior stayed pretty much the same. So why did the pill work? Grant says that kleptomania, like drug abuse, is an addiction which provides the practitioner with an intense high or rush. And the more you do it, the more you develop a dependence on that kind of sensation. But Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist, which is science talk for buzz kill. Basically, it's the no-fun pill. Dr. GRANT: This will block that thrill, and therefore, they will desire to do it less. SPIEGEL: Darlene is now on the pill and says it's helping her immensely. Still, for good measure, every time she goes to the store, she says she carries her clinging cross, a cross that she clings to, in the palm of her right hand. DARLENE: It's kind of made out of wood. It has a dove on it. And I put it in my right hand, try to think of the death of Christ, and I try to give up my feelings of stealing to Jesus. SPIEGEL:  Darlene says that most of the time, these twin supports, Naltrexone and Jesus, keep her on the straight and narrow. Alix Spiegel, NPR News, Washington.

Dr. GRANT: Based on the fact that this clinically presents like an addiction, our thought was, why shouldn't we use a medication that's approved by the FDA for addiction to see if it can help people with shoplifting?  SPIEGEL: The results of this small study were recently published in the journal Biological Psychiatry. It turns out that the people with kleptomania did respond to the pill. Before the pill, Grant notes\u2026  Dr. GRANT: On average, people were spending about an hour a week stealing. Almost two-thirds of them had quit any stealing behavior at the end of the study.  SPIEGEL: Except for the people on placebos. Their behavior stayed pretty much the same. So why did the pill work?  Grant says that kleptomania, like drug abuse, is an addiction which provides the practitioner with an intense high or rush. And the more you do it, the more you develop a dependence on that kind of sensation.  But Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist, which is science talk for buzz kill. Basically, it's the no-fun pill.  Dr. GRANT: This will block that thrill, and therefore, they will desire to do it less.  SPIEGEL: Darlene is now on the pill and says it's helping her immensely. Still, for good measure, every time she goes to the store, she says she carries her clinging cross, a cross that she clings to, in the palm of her right hand.  DARLENE: It's kind of made out of wood. It has a dove on it. And I put it in my right hand, try to think of the death of Christ, and I try to give up my feelings of stealing to Jesus.  SPIEGEL:  Darlene says that most of the time, these twin supports, Naltrexone and Jesus, keep her on the straight and narrow.  Alix Spiegel, NPR News, Washington.

I'm Ira Flatow. Mr. GIAMPAOLO GIULIANI: (Italian spoken) FLATOW: That's Giampaolo Giuliani, a research technician at Italy's National Institute for Nuclear Physics, and it's one of the countless interviews he's done this week. He spends his days at the lab, working with instruments that detect neutrinos produced by collapsing stars, but he has a passion on the side and that is seismology. He has his own seismic instruments feeling the movements of the earth below and he monitors them regularly. And what makes this story more interesting is that a few weeks ago he measured a strange emission of radon gas from the earth's crust and from that observation he predicted that a disastrous earthquake would strike Abruzzo region on Sunday, March 29th. Well, that Sunday passed uneventfully. No earthquake. Scientists criticized him for straying too far outside his field and he was reported to the police for scare-mongering. But a week later the big one shook the region, leaving hundreds dead, and now Giuliani wants an apology. Our question today - could there be something to his method or was it just a coincidence? Here to talk about it is Susan Hough, a seismologist with the U. S. Geological Survey in Pasadena. She joins us by phone from a seismology meeting in Monterey. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Hough. Dr. SUSAN HOUGH (U. S. Geological Survey): Thank you. It's great to be here. FLATOW: Well, we've heard about this radon theory before, haven't we? Dr. HOUGH: Yes. It goes back at least to the '70s - the idea that this gas might be released as precursor to earthquakes. FLATOW: And did it really carry any water? Dr. HOUGH: Not that most - the mainstream community believes. There have been a lot of observations and people looked at it a lot in the '70s, and the closer they looked the more they - you know, you sort of see a blip in radon and then you see an earthquake sometimes, but when you try to show that there is a statistical correlation, it's never been borne out. FLATOW: So it could be just a coincidence? Dr. HOUGH: Yeah, well, it could be a complete coincidence. It could be that radon occasionally does get released when you have - we do have fore shocks to a lot of earthquakes. And when you have little earthquakes you are shifting things around underground. It's possible that sometimes that does release radon and so maybe sometimes there is a radon signal\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. HOUGH: \u2026that has something to do with the earthquake. The problem is it's just all too complicated to say that one follows the other. FLATOW: Now, I remember back in those days, there were all kinds of supposedly predictive measures you had. You had the lights that might appear coming up from the movement of the Earth, causing some bipezio(ph) electric. You had all kinds of water rising in wells, animals taking to the hills, all kinds of things like that, remember? Dr. HOUGH: Yeah. And they were sort of a heyday in the '70s when people were optimistic. And scientists were very optimistic. There were some promising results that came out of different directions - China, Russia - there was sort of this Cold War thing where the Russkies and Chinese were ahead of us and, you know, we needed to invest and catch up. But it was just - the closer we looked at all this methods and more they just sort of evaporated on us. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number - talking about earthquake predictions. But in fact there was a real I remember back in the 80's that was in Parkfield. There was a whole section of the San Andreas fault area set up to see if you could actually predict one or see what kinds of precursors might be when an earthquake hits. Dr. HOUGH: Yeah, that was the one prediction that the mainstream seismological community sort of endorsed, that this moderate earthquakes would hit Parkfield within four, five years of 1988 and that was based on a sequence of moderate earthquakes that had happened supposedly every 22 years. FLATOW: Right. Dr. HOUGH: And so there was this prediction, and then '88 came and went and '92 and '93 and there was a lot of debate. But most of the instruments stayed in and then the earthquake finally did happen but it was in - oh gosh, 2004, 2005. But it was\u2026 FLATOW: Just 20 years too late? Dr. HOUGH: Yeah. It was 37 years instead of 22. So - but it was, you know, a lot of people consider it a qualified success because seismologists said this part of the San Andreas is going to break. It's going to be magnitude six and its going to be within, in about 22 years, and it wasn't completely wrong, so\u2026 FLATOW: But there - no real predictive strategy came out of that? Dr. HOUGH: Well, no, not in - the experiment was designed to sort of trap the next big one and look for subtle changes that would give you a meaningful short term prediction that you could hang your hat on - you can't. If you predict an earthquake within a few years, you really can't take a lot of action to - but if it's within a few days that's a kind of prediction we want and so we were looking to see if there were changes in the ground, and it was really a negative result. There was nothing picked up on all these sensors right before the earthquake happened. FLATOW: Well, if you had a lot of small quakes, let's say, foreshocks, as you did in Italy, would you expect a big one to follow? Dr. HOUGH: Okay, we do know that about half of all earthquakes have foreshocks and that's the one precursor that we sort of believe is real. The problem is that most small earthquakes are not foreshocks, so you can't - when we have a small quake - say, in California - we know there is a five percent chance that it's going to be followed by something bigger within three days. And so that gives you a higher probability. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. HOUGH: But it's a fairly weak one, so you can't sound alarm bells every time you have little earthquakes. FLATOW: Because we have a lot of them every day, right? Dr. HOUGH: Yeah. FLATOW: Or dozens of them. Dr. HOUGH: Yeah. And we don't know - there's no way to tell a foreshock from a garden variety little earthquake until something bigger happens. FLATOW: Has your office been deluged with calls about this Italian? Dr. HOUGH: Well, a number of - the seismologists all left for Monterey, so\u2026 FLATOW: Get out of town. Dr. HOUGH: Yeah, you know, I'm not sure - I suspect there are calls coming in to the Cal Tech - to the USGS - or calls that are reaching the meeting here, because obviously it's a big new story. FLATOW: Just to set the record straight, that probably had nothing to do with the earthquake? Dr. HOUGH: It possibly did, it possibly didn't. One problem, you know, I was thinking about it - if we have big radon release and then there's an earthquake and you think, okay, surely that, you know, they are tied together, they might be. But in 1989 a whole of bunch of people came to a baseball stadium in San Francisco for a World Series game and there was an earthquake. And they were very close in time and I could say that World Series games are a precursor to earthquakes. FLATOW: Wow. Dr. HOUGH: And it's absurd\u2026 FLATOW: There's a thought. Dr. HOUGH: But yeah, the point is that sometimes you just have coincidences and how do you know it's not a coincidence. FLATOW: Alright, where's the game played this year? Well, we don't know yet. So we'll have to watch out. Thank you, Dr. Hough for taking time to be with us. Dr. HOUGH: Oh, you're welcome. FLATOW: Susan Hough is a seismologist at the U. S.

I'm Ira Flatow. When it comes to high school science textbooks, Texas has a lot of clout, and that's because whichever book the Texas Board of Education approves, it's used by all the students in the state, and that's a very big market. So textbook publishers have, in the past, tailored their books to meet Texas standards, and those books, the Texas-tailored books, get used by students in lots of other states, too. So the recent wrangling over new science standards by the Texas Board of Education was especially interesting to follow because what happens in Texas might not stay in Texas. The Texas School Board voted to adopt new science standards, standards that are, well, sort of confusing. If you look at the newspaper headlines the next morning, you can see that even the newspaper reporters had a hard time sorting it out, as well as the cable TV stations. Joining us now to make sense of it is Eugenie Scott. She's executive director of the National Center for Science Education in Oakland. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Dr. EUGENIE SCOTT (Executive Director, National Center for Science Education): Thank you, Ira. It's nice to be here. CONAN: We were watching the news stories the day after the vote was taken, and as I say, it seems like there was a lot of confusion. The headlines seemed to be giving victory to each side. Is that your take on it? Dr. SCOTT: It was confusing, and I can understand why people would be confused, because there are a lot of ups and downs. Let me just give you the short version. You are absolutely right. This is all about textbooks. The science standards in Texas were up for revision. Committees were appointed to revise them, and the committees made some changes that were intended to avoid problems that occurred the last time textbooks were adopted. There was wording in the old standards that called for teaching the strengths and weaknesses of scientific theories. And creationists on the board used that wording as a club to try to get publishers to rewrite books to include, well frankly, a lot of creationist junk science. But in 2003, they were a minority, and so they failed. They are now a near-majority, and this time, when the standards were revised, the board ignored the committee's intent and put back language that would allow them to do the same thing when textbooks come up for adoption two years from now. And this is what's scary about what happened a couple weeks ago. They did this by inserting - well, it's a son of strengths and weaknesses, frankly. The phrase they use is examining all sides, which sounds innocuous, but it's going to be used the same way that strengths and weaknesses had been used years ago, to try to get the creationist ideas into the textbooks. And then they also added a bunch of standards that provide loopholes for teaching creationist ideas, and as if this wasn't enough, they also added a bunch of qualifiers to the standards that would weaken the presentation of evolution, make it more tentative, make it more likely students wouldn't take it seriously and so forth. Although, you know, as you say, the newspapers were kind of confused about what happened. There were so many amendments and so many revisions, and it was very confusing to follow, and frankly, they tried to get a whole lot more bad stuff in, and the moderates on the school board managed to thwart a lot of it, but there's still plenty to worry about. So it's definitely a mixed bag, and I think on the whole, not a victory for science education. FLATOW: I understand also that the age of the universe is no longer to be found in Texas science standards. Dr. SCOTT: Not specifically, no. That was one of the things they took out. They took out\u2026 FLATOW: How do you teach science without talking about the age of the universe? Dr. SCOTT: Well, teachers can still do this, but they won't be directly told to tell students that it's 14-billion years old, plus or minus. This is one of the weakening amendments that I was talking about, when they modified what were fairly straightforward science standards to include more wishy-washy language like, for example - oh, let's see what's a good example? Proposed transitional fossils is one of the phrases that was stuck in when, in the earth science standards, talking about changes in the earth's atmosphere that could have occurred; radioactive decay, which is thought to allow proto-planet differentiation - all these qualifying terms just to make it seem a little wimpier and to water down the coverage of evolution. And that's problematic, because what that does is it sends a signal to teachers that they have to be tentative about evolution, which is unfortunate. FLATOW: Yeah, in fact, the wedge document that we saw before talked about talking about, you know, teaching the problem that might be with evolution. Dr. SCOTT: Oh yeah, well that's what this is all about. FLATOW: And the fact that we're just talking about there might be a problem is sort of a victory for them, is it not? Dr. SCOTT: Oh yeah, absolutely. I mean, most of the time the creationists claim great victory whenever anything like this happens, but this time, it's not just spin. They did get what they want, and they're high-fiving it all over the place. They're very happy. And you're right, there's intelligent-design fingerprints all over this document. FLATOW: I mean, even - go ahead, I'm sorry. Dr. SCOTT: I was going to say there's a couple of additions that were made where comments about the complexity of the cell, which is one of the things that intelligent-design proponents obsess about, and complexity of the cell is not something that you would talk about in high school. I mean, you talk about the basics, you talk about cell division, and you know, solutions and stuff. You don't get above that. But there's - the origin of life is one of the things that the intelligent-design people are quite distressed about. And so there was a qualifier added to one of the origin-of-life statements in the earth and space science standards about - given the complexity of living systems, did all these things happen? So it's just a way of, you know, being able - trying to provide loopholes to bring in the creationist arguments, to bring in the intelligent-design arguments. Now whether that's actually going to happen depends on two things. It depends on how strongly the teachers in Texas buck the system, so to speak, how - whether they interpret these standards as being able to teach straight science in them; and even more importantly for the rest of us in the country, is whether the textbook publishers will knuckle under to this sort of thing, because there are ways of wording your textbook text, ways of expressing things that would work around some of these things. But it's going to take some work. And certainly we're going to try to work with the textbook publishers to see that that happens. FLATOW: You know, we were talking about how confused the press were, how they were covering this. And I was just reading CNN on the CNN site, where they talked - it was Texas board comes down on two sides of creationism debate, and even inside the language that the reporting uses, it says proponents of evolution. I mean, it's like saying proponents of a round Earth, you know. Dr. SCOTT: The Earth, it's spherical, it's spherical. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: I mean, but that kind of language, you know, it's making its way as if to legitimize that there is no evolution, because there are proponents and non-proponents of it. Dr. SCOTT: Yeah, it's very frustrating. I mean, obviously it's part of the responsibility of the press to report a variety of positions that are expressed about a particular issue, but it is not - it's not responsible journalism to present two sides that are obviously so disproportionate as being equally valid. I mean, the percentage of scientists that deny evolution is miniscule, and none of them are in the relevant fields. You know, there's the old joke that lawyers have about expert witnesses that for every Ph. D. , there is an equal and opposite Ph. D. , and that is not what the case is in the situation of evolution at all. I mean, there's hundreds of thousands of scientists who are researching and contributing to evolutionary theory and just a small handful of naysayers, and why are we giving these people attention in our public schools? FLATOW: Well, that's what - I have Chester(ph) on the line from St. Louis. Hi, Chester. CHESTER (Caller): Yes, hello. FLATOW: Go ahead. CHESTER: I was just wondering, you know, why does it matter what the people of Texas teach their children? It's their children, and it's their tax dollars. Evolution is not going to, you know, provide better fuel economy for my vehicle or anything that really matters to us on a day-to-day basis. Dr. SCOTT: Well, I would tend to disagree with you on that, Chester. You are a living, breathing human being. You are a mammal and a vertebrate, and you have medical problems, and evolution is going to, and has, made some contributions to your health and well-being, as well as making some, making a lot of contributions to the stability of the agricultural system that you depend upon for the fuel in your tank, if not your automobile's. So actually, evolution is a whole lot more important in biology than most people think. And I think the reason why many people don't understand that is because it is either not taught or very poorly taught at the high school level, and frankly, it's not taught all that well at the college level. FLATOW: And teachers avoid teaching it, don't they, if they can? Dr. SCOTT: Well for good reason. I mean, there's a lot of people - well, there's not that many people, but there's a very loud minority of people who object to evolution for religious reasons, and they tend to make their views known to teachers. And unless teachers are supported by their supervisors, their principals, the board of education and citizens in the community who care about science education, it's much easier for a teacher to just fold under that kind of pressure, because, you know, if they wanted to fight, they'd have gone into law. This is a helping profession. You want to teach kids and not have to argue with parents all the time. So the easiest thing to do is just to skip evolution that semester. FLATOW: Is it possible that textbook publishers could say all right, we'll make a special edition for Texas if it's so important for them? Dr. SCOTT: Well, that's a very interesting issue about the current situation with the Texas Education Standards, because it's different now than it was 10 years ago. There's a lot more digital publishing, there's a lot more modular publishing in the textbook industry, and if Texas wanted to it could - excuse me, if the publishers wanted to, they could come out with a Texas edition that had all the crappy science in it and come out with a standard science edition for the rest of the country. They're not going to do that on their own because it costs more money, and we're in a recession, and they're not going to be looking for ways to spend money, certainly. But I think if the textbooks submitted to Texas in a couple of years are compromised in this way, then I think it's important for the scientists and citizens and parents in the rest of the country to say, you know, up with this we will not put - we will not buy these books. You have to write a straight science book for us without all of these weaknesses and other nonsense that Texas made you put in. FLATOW: Just about a minute to go. The other states, are they hanging in there? Dr. SCOTT: Well, you know, it's touch and go. Every time a state revises its science education standards, we have to be on the lookout for the watering-down of evolution or the bringing-in of these alleged weaknesses of evolution. There's usually about four to six states per year that revise their standards, and there always seems to be some sort of problem. Most of these we can solve behind the scenes - I don't mean we personally. NCSE works with people in states to, you know, monitor these things and try to get good information out to the decision-makers. But Texas is a really big state, like you said in the intro, and it makes a lot of sense for us to pay a lot of attention to Texas because it really is the 500-pound gorilla here. FLATOW: Thank you, Dr. Scott, for taking time to be with us. Good luck to you. Dr. SCOTT: Thanks, Ira.

Dr. EUGENIE SCOTT (Executive Director, National Center for Science Education): Thank you, Ira. It's nice to be here.  CONAN: We were watching the news stories the day after the vote was taken, and as I say, it seems like there was a lot of confusion. The headlines seemed to be giving victory to each side. Is that your take on it?  Dr. SCOTT: It was confusing, and I can understand why people would be confused, because there are a lot of ups and downs. Let me just give you the short version.  You are absolutely right. This is all about textbooks. The science standards in Texas were up for revision. Committees were appointed to revise them, and the committees made some changes that were intended to avoid problems that occurred the last time textbooks were adopted.  There was wording in the old standards that called for teaching the strengths and weaknesses of scientific theories. And creationists on the board used that wording as a club to try to get publishers to rewrite books to include, well frankly, a lot of creationist junk science.  But in 2003, they were a minority, and so they failed. They are now a near-majority, and this time, when the standards were revised, the board ignored the committee's intent and put back language that would allow them to do the same thing when textbooks come up for adoption two years from now.  And this is what's scary about what happened a couple weeks ago. They did this by inserting - well, it's a son of strengths and weaknesses, frankly. The phrase they use is examining all sides, which sounds innocuous, but it's going to be used the same way that strengths and weaknesses had been used years ago, to try to get the creationist ideas into the textbooks.  And then they also added a bunch of standards that provide loopholes for teaching creationist ideas, and as if this wasn't enough, they also added a bunch of qualifiers to the standards that would weaken the presentation of evolution, make it more tentative, make it more likely students wouldn't take it seriously and so forth.  Although, you know, as you say, the newspapers were kind of confused about what happened. There were so many amendments and so many revisions, and it was very confusing to follow, and frankly, they tried to get a whole lot more bad stuff in, and the moderates on the school board managed to thwart a lot of it, but there's still plenty to worry about.  So it's definitely a mixed bag, and I think on the whole, not a victory for science education.  FLATOW: I understand also that the age of the universe is no longer to be found in Texas science standards.  Dr. SCOTT: Not specifically, no. That was one of the things they took out. They took out\u2026  FLATOW: How do you teach science without talking about the age of the universe?  Dr. SCOTT: Well, teachers can still do this, but they won't be directly told to tell students that it's 14-billion years old, plus or minus.  This is one of the weakening amendments that I was talking about, when they modified what were fairly straightforward science standards to include more wishy-washy language like, for example - oh, let's see what's a good example?  Proposed transitional fossils is one of the phrases that was stuck in when, in the earth science standards, talking about changes in the earth's atmosphere that could have occurred; radioactive decay, which is thought to allow proto-planet differentiation - all these qualifying terms just to make it seem a little wimpier and to water down the coverage of evolution.  And that's problematic, because what that does is it sends a signal to teachers that they have to be tentative about evolution, which is unfortunate.  FLATOW: Yeah, in fact, the wedge document that we saw before talked about talking about, you know, teaching the problem that might be with evolution.  Dr. SCOTT: Oh yeah, well that's what this is all about.  FLATOW: And the fact that we're just talking about there might be a problem is sort of a victory for them, is it not?  Dr. SCOTT: Oh yeah, absolutely. I mean, most of the time the creationists claim great victory whenever anything like this happens, but this time, it's not just spin.  They did get what they want, and they're high-fiving it all over the place. They're very happy. And you're right, there's intelligent-design fingerprints all over this document.  FLATOW: I mean, even - go ahead, I'm sorry.  Dr. SCOTT: I was going to say there's a couple of additions that were made where comments about the complexity of the cell, which is one of the things that intelligent-design proponents obsess about, and complexity of the cell is not something that you would talk about in high school.  I mean, you talk about the basics, you talk about cell division, and you know, solutions and stuff. You don't get above that. But there's - the origin of life is one of the things that the intelligent-design people are quite distressed about. And so there was a qualifier added to one of the origin-of-life statements in the earth and space science standards about - given the complexity of living systems, did all these things happen?  So it's just a way of, you know, being able - trying to provide loopholes to bring in the creationist arguments, to bring in the intelligent-design arguments.  Now whether that's actually going to happen depends on two things. It depends on how strongly the teachers in Texas buck the system, so to speak, how - whether they interpret these standards as being able to teach straight science in them; and even more importantly for the rest of us in the country, is whether the textbook publishers will knuckle under to this sort of thing, because there are ways of wording your textbook text, ways of expressing things that would work around some of these things.  But it's going to take some work. And certainly we're going to try to work with the textbook publishers to see that that happens.  FLATOW: You know, we were talking about how confused the press were, how they were covering this. And I was just reading CNN on the CNN site, where they talked - it was Texas board comes down on two sides of creationism debate, and even inside the language that the reporting uses, it says proponents of evolution.  I mean, it's like saying proponents of a round Earth, you know.  Dr. SCOTT: The Earth, it's spherical, it's spherical.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: I mean, but that kind of language, you know, it's making its way as if to legitimize that there is no evolution, because there are proponents and non-proponents of it.  Dr. SCOTT: Yeah, it's very frustrating. I mean, obviously it's part of the responsibility of the press to report a variety of positions that are expressed about a particular issue, but it is not - it's not responsible journalism to present two sides that are obviously so disproportionate as being equally valid.  I mean, the percentage of scientists that deny evolution is miniscule, and none of them are in the relevant fields. You know, there's the old joke that lawyers have about expert witnesses that for every Ph. D. , there is an equal and opposite Ph. D. , and that is not what the case is in the situation of evolution at all.  I mean, there's hundreds of thousands of scientists who are researching and contributing to evolutionary theory and just a small handful of naysayers, and why are we giving these people attention in our public schools?  FLATOW: Well, that's what - I have Chester(ph) on the line from St. Louis. Hi, Chester.  CHESTER (Caller): Yes, hello.  FLATOW: Go ahead.  CHESTER: I was just wondering, you know, why does it matter what the people of Texas teach their children? It's their children, and it's their tax dollars. Evolution is not going to, you know, provide better fuel economy for my vehicle or anything that really matters to us on a day-to-day basis.  Dr. SCOTT: Well, I would tend to disagree with you on that, Chester. You are a living, breathing human being. You are a mammal and a vertebrate, and you have medical problems, and evolution is going to, and has, made some contributions to your health and well-being, as well as making some, making a lot of contributions to the stability of the agricultural system that you depend upon for the fuel in your tank, if not your automobile's.  So actually, evolution is a whole lot more important in biology than most people think. And I think the reason why many people don't understand that is because it is either not taught or very poorly taught at the high school level, and frankly, it's not taught all that well at the college level.  FLATOW: And teachers avoid teaching it, don't they, if they can?  Dr. SCOTT: Well for good reason. I mean, there's a lot of people - well, there's not that many people, but there's a very loud minority of people who object to evolution for religious reasons, and they tend to make their views known to teachers. And unless teachers are supported by their supervisors, their principals, the board of education and citizens in the community who care about science education, it's much easier for a teacher to just fold under that kind of pressure, because, you know, if they wanted to fight, they'd have gone into law.  This is a helping profession. You want to teach kids and not have to argue with parents all the time. So the easiest thing to do is just to skip evolution that semester.  FLATOW: Is it possible that textbook publishers could say all right, we'll make a special edition for Texas if it's so important for them?  Dr. SCOTT: Well, that's a very interesting issue about the current situation with the Texas Education Standards, because it's different now than it was 10 years ago.  There's a lot more digital publishing, there's a lot more modular publishing in the textbook industry, and if Texas wanted to it could - excuse me, if the publishers wanted to, they could come out with a Texas edition that had all the crappy science in it and come out with a standard science edition for the rest of the country.  They're not going to do that on their own because it costs more money, and we're in a recession, and they're not going to be looking for ways to spend money, certainly.  But I think if the textbooks submitted to Texas in a couple of years are compromised in this way, then I think it's important for the scientists and citizens and parents in the rest of the country to say, you know, up with this we will not put - we will not buy these books. You have to write a straight science book for us without all of these weaknesses and other nonsense that Texas made you put in.  FLATOW: Just about a minute to go. The other states, are they hanging in there?  Dr. SCOTT: Well, you know, it's touch and go. Every time a state revises its science education standards, we have to be on the lookout for the watering-down of evolution or the bringing-in of these alleged weaknesses of evolution.  There's usually about four to six states per year that revise their standards, and there always seems to be some sort of problem. Most of these we can solve behind the scenes - I don't mean we personally. NCSE works with people in states to, you know, monitor these things and try to get good information out to the decision-makers.  But Texas is a really big state, like you said in the intro, and it makes a lot of sense for us to pay a lot of attention to Texas because it really is the 500-pound gorilla here.  FLATOW: Thank you, Dr. Scott, for taking time to be with us. Good luck to you.  Dr. SCOTT: Thanks, Ira.  FLATOW: Eugenie Scott is executive director of the National Center for Science Education in Oakland, California.  We're going to switch gears and come back and talk about climate change and how the new administration is tackling it. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this break.

He says it would maybe expose a underwater ridge that then the Israelites could walk along. ROBERTS: Let's talk about the burning bush. According to the Old Testament, Moses talks to a burning bush. It's basically God giving Moses his marching orders to take on pharaoh and twist pharaoh's royal arm until he lets Moses' people go. What's the verdict on the burning bush? Mr. LUKAS: Most people take on this description of the burning bush, which is that the bush burned, and it was not consumed. You have a Norwegian physicist, Dag Kristian Dysthe. He has an article about a similar thing happening in Mali, and a number of people have pointed to that sort of spontaneous combustion as being what might have happened. ROBERTS: So if that explains the flames, what explains the voice? Mr. LUKAS: Well, there's one person who I found who took on explaining the voice, and that is a Hebrew University psychologist named Benny Shanon. Essentially for him, the whole Exodus story is just the Israelites tripping on an ayahuasca, like, you know, hallucinogen, and the burning bush is just, you know, Moses tripping on this hallucinogenic drug and hearing the voices of God. ROBERTS: So we're exposing Moses as a junkie here. We're blowing the lid on the Israelites' drug habit. Mr. LUKAS: That's pretty much it. (Soundbite of laughter) ROBERTS: Well, I don't know if we can top that dramatic moment, but there is always a dramatic moment at the seder table. It's been Passover this week - where the leader dips his hand into wine and, you know, flicks wine across the table, says all the names of the 10 plagues in Hebrew. And you actually managed to find someone who has a sort of unified scientific explanation for all the plagues. Mr. LUKAS: It's an epidemiologist named John Marr. He thinks that the plagues were caused by dinoflagellates. It's essentially this big algae bloom that turned the Nile red and ended up killing all the fish, which ended up killing all the frogs, and then that just set off this whole chain of events that ended in the death of the firstborn son, which he thinks is caused by what he calls a mycotoxin, which I think is some sort of fungus in the grain, and because the firstborn sons had, you know, preference when they were eating food, they were the first ones who were exposed to the grain. ROBERTS: In some ways, the scientific explanations are as incredible as the stories themselves. And so much of a part of the stories are about faith. So, do we really need to hold them up to scientific rigor? Mr. LUKAS: When I set out to write the article, I wasn't trying to, you know, prove or disprove the biblical account, but the response was really stunning to me in the Slate sort of reader discussion forums. It was just this avalanche of people, really staunch secularists on the one side and really true believers on the other side, who saw the article as a sort of refutation of religion in general. But in some ways, I see the scientific explanations as a sort of continuation of what Passover is all about, which is, to me, it's a holiday of contestation and questioning and rewriting. And then you have this quote from Haggadah, which I think is really great, and I brought along with me. It says, even if all of us were wise, all men - and I would add, or women - of understanding, there is still a mitzvah upon us to tell about the Exodus from Egypt, and whoever elaborates on it is praiseworthy. And I just saw my article as sort of continuing this tradition of elaborating on the story. ROBERTS: Michael Lukas' article on the science of Passover appeared this week on slate. com. When he's not deconstructing Bible stories, he's finishing up a novel about the end of the Ottoman Empire. He joined me from member station WHA in Madison, Wisconsin. Thanks so much.

That's because infants are hard-wired to react to simple emotions, like fear or physical pain, in other people. But it takes years before children are able to feel another person's psychological pain. And now scientists are beginning to understand how the brain learns that sort of compassion. NPR's Jon Hamilton has the story. JON HAMILTON: Scientists at the University of Southern California scanned the brains of 13 people as they responded to stories designed to provoke a range of emotions. Mary Helen Immordino-Yang says it was easy to get their brains to react to another person's physical pain. All it took was a few seconds of video. Dr. MARY HELEN IMMORDINO-YANG (Scientist, University of Southern California): For example, a tennis player reaching for an outside shot, and then you just see her ankle break as she lands on it. Dr. ANTONIO DAMASIO (University of Southern California, Brain and Creativity Institute) : Ouch. Dr. IMMORDINO-YANG: Right. HAMILTON: The person reacting there is Antonio Damasio of USC's Brain and Creativity Institute. He's also an author of the study. Damasio says scientists know quite a bit about which parts of the brain make us wince when we witness a physical injury. They're the same parts of the brain that register when we're injured ourselves. And he says that ability seems to have appeared pretty early in human evolution. Even animals need to know when a friend needs help or a foe has been hurt. Dr. ANTONIO DAMASIO (University of Southern California, Brain and Creativity Institute): Probably took longer in evolution to get to a stage in which human beings could look at another human being, not see anything externally wrong with them, but imagine that there was something quite wrong in terms of their feelings, in terms of their mental pain. HAMILTON: Damasio says we have to learn some kinds of compassion. And he says the brain scans showed it's a lot harder to get a reaction to psychological pain than physical pain. The USC team asked people to listen to recordings of real stories told by real people, including this woman with cerebral palsy. Unidentified Woman: I've never been kissed. And I have to be honest, I don't see myself in a romantic relationship at all. HAMILTON: People's brains had to work a lot harder before they showed compassion. But Damasio says even the most complex psychological emotions engaged many of the same brain systems that respond to physical states. Dr. DAMASIO: They end up recruiting parts of the brain that are normally used to regulate our own life, which to put it in a very simple way, is like saying that these emotions go deep in our brain, and they also go deep in our body, in our flesh. HAMILTON: The study found another difference between the brain's response to another person's broken leg, rather than their broken heart. Dr. IMMORDINO-YANG: The reaction that people had to compassion for physical predicaments happened much more quickly in the brain than the reaction that they had to compassion for social or psychological predicaments, which was a much slower process to ramp up. HAMILTON: Antonio Damasio says that finding raises questions about the effects of news programs and video games in which a traumatic psychological event may flash by in just a second or two. Damasio says that could be a problem for children who are still developing compassion. Dr. DAMASIO: And what if this is happening to a child who does not have parents or guardians around that can say, well, wait a minute, there are terrible implications for the person who just underwent that particular event.

Well, think again. NPR's Allison Aubrey reports. ALLISON AUBREY: It's probably an understatement to say that most people don't want bugs in their beds, particularly ones that bite and feed off our blood. So EPA's Dale Kemery says they brought experts together to figure out the best way to treat bedbugs and prevent outbreaks in homes, apartments and hotels, where they've been spotted in droves from New York to Florida. Mr. DALE KEMERY (Spokesman, EPA): They're very resistant critters. And they've been treated in the past like cockroaches. But that's not the proper treatment for them. AUBREY: The EPA invited entomologist Harold Harlan to the conference, a 25-year veteran of fighting pests in the U. S. military, a man who I think it's fair to say has a special rapport with bedbugs. When I asked him to tell me more about these reddish-brown tick-looking insects, he pulled out of this coat pocket a small container of live bedbugs. Dr. HAROLD HARLAN (Entomologist): See, this one's settled down to feed. See, that one's crawling. AUBREY: Some were quick to crawl towards Harlan's hands where he lets them bite and feed off his blood. As we wait, he tells me he's been doing this for years. As a way to keep his research subjects alive, when he lifts up his pants leg I can see the scaly irritated skin on his calf from some earlier bites. Dr. HARLAN: These are itching today, right, that batch there. AUBREY: Oh, I see that it's a little bit red, a little welty. Dr. HARLAN: Some people actually get a blister raised at each bite, similar to the effect of a sting of a fire ant. AUBREY: Harlan says his skin isn't very sensitive, but for many people, the delayed reactions that come two to five days after a bedbug bite can be painfully itchy and emotionally nightmarish, leaving some too panicky to get back in their beds. One bed of solace Harlan says he can offer is that bedbugs don't spread disease. Dr. HARLAN: I'm confident they do not transmit anything. AUBREY: Listening to Harlan in the audience were all kinds of people eager to learn more about bedbugs: city health officials, housing administrators, apartment managers and people in the pest control industry. Doug Summers runs a bedbug detection operation in Florida using dogs that are trained to sniff out infestations. And he says they're pretty efficient at it. Mr. DOUG SUMMERS (Bedbug Detection Operation, Florida): We can go through about approximately two minutes a room with better than the 90 percent accuracy, which it's nearly impossible to do with a visual human inspector that's unaided. AUBREY: Detection is tough because bedbugs hide in crevices and can remain motionless for months at a time. Once they do go out on the prowl, they're fast. Researchers have trailed bedbugs crawling from one hotel room to the next overnight. Entomologist Dini Miller of Virginia Tech spoke at the conference about why Americans assumed that bedbugs were a thing of the past. Dr. DINI MILLER (Entomologist, Virginia Tech): We had used DDT so liberally in the 1950s that we had actually eradicated them from most environments in the United States. AUBREY: Miller says the bedbug resurgence is likely due to many things including international travel and commerce, as well pesticide resistance. She says if you ever suspect that bedbugs have hitched a ride home in your suitcase, put all of your clothes in the dryer. The 120 degree heat is deadly to the insects and then you can sleep tight knowing that the bedbugs won't bite. Allison Aubrey, NPR News.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  If you remember being tucked into bed with the line, sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs bite, you might've thought the critters were just a figment of someone's imagination. Well, think again.  NPR's Allison Aubrey reports.  ALLISON AUBREY: It's probably an understatement to say that most people don't want bugs in their beds, particularly ones that bite and feed off our blood. So EPA's Dale Kemery says they brought experts together to figure out the best way to treat bedbugs and prevent outbreaks in homes, apartments and hotels, where they've been spotted in droves from New York to Florida.  Mr. DALE KEMERY (Spokesman, EPA): They're very resistant critters. And they've been treated in the past like cockroaches. But that's not the proper treatment for them.  AUBREY: The EPA invited entomologist Harold Harlan to the conference, a 25-year veteran of fighting pests in the U. S. military, a man who I think it's fair to say has a special rapport with bedbugs. When I asked him to tell me more about these reddish-brown tick-looking insects, he pulled out of this coat pocket a small container of live bedbugs.  Dr. HAROLD HARLAN (Entomologist): See, this one's settled down to feed. See, that one's crawling.  AUBREY: Some were quick to crawl towards Harlan's hands where he lets them bite and feed off his blood. As we wait, he tells me he's been doing this for years. As a way to keep his research subjects alive, when he lifts up his pants leg I can see the scaly irritated skin on his calf from some earlier bites.  Dr. HARLAN: These are itching today, right, that batch there.  AUBREY: Oh, I see that it's a little bit red, a little welty.  Dr. HARLAN: Some people actually get a blister raised at each bite, similar to the effect of a sting of a fire ant.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, Host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Two months ago, as part of our economic coverage reporter Alix Spiegel introduced us to Sylvia Martinez. Like a lot of Americans, she was struggling emotionally after losing her job. It got so bad for her that she actually attempted suicide. Alix has continued to track Martinez as she tries to find a job in this terrible market. And today, we have an update. ALIX SPIEGEL: Chapter two of the story of Sylvia Martinez begins last Friday in a parking lot, six months after she lost her job as an HR Manager. You see, Friday was the morning of her second interview at a small company, the first real possibility after six months of applying for 20-plus jobs a week. And Sylvia was pulling every string she knew to pull. SYLVIA MARTINEZ: As soon as I got back into the car, I started to pray and I started texting people and sending them emails, saying, you know, pray for me please. I really need this job. SPIEGEL: As far as she knew, the interview had gone great. The salary was below what she had made at her last job. But then Sylvia had said that she was hoping for at least 40,000. She told them she was very flexible. MARTINEZ: And I told them that if you give me a penny more than what I am making from unemployment, I don't care. I just want to make a penny more. I just want to feel useful again. SPIEGEL: There was reason for optimism. The hiring manager seemed to like her and Sylvia says during the interview, the company bookkeeper pulled her aside and told that she was the only person they'd had in for a second look, which put Sylvia over the moon. MARTINEZ: I felt confident all weekend long. I kept saying, you know, when I go to work on Tuesday, when I go to work on Tuesday. SPIEGEL: But work is not what happened on Tuesday. (SOUNDBITE OF SHUTTING DOOR)SPIEGEL: On Wednesday afternoon, when Sylvia climbed out of her 2003 Saturn Vue with her 20-year-old daughter, the remains of Tuesday still hung in the air. MARTINEZ: I can still smell it. SPIEGEL: Tuesday, you see, was the day of the fire. Not in Sylvia's apartment but two floors up. It was small but set off a faulty sprinkler which left Sylvia's apartment covered in water. Sylvia was living in the apartment with her daughter and her son. Now Sylvia's couch was drying in the kitchen and much of the living room ceiling was on the floor. As her daughter salvaged some things from the bathroom, Sylvia stood by the door, her eyes glazed. MARTINEZ: I loved my apartment, I really did. SPIEGEL: The night before, Sylvia had spent two hours on the curb outside her building crying. But given the state of her life, Sylvia knew there wasn't much time to mourn. The property manager had gotten her family a hotel room for the night and by three in the morning, Sylvia says she was job hunting again. MARTINEZ: I couldn't sleep at that point. So I went back downstairs to the business center and logged on and sent my friend my resume. SPIEGEL: Sylvia says in the mornings, she always checks the listings at washingtonpost. com and monster, then applies for jobs. But since she didn't know her schedule for the day, she wanted her friend to do it for her. MARTINEZ: I don't want for something to come up and not be able to have the chance to send my resume. SPIEGEL: By 8 AM she says, she had applied for two more jobs from the business center computer. And there was a very good reason for this vigilance. She says Wednesday, yesterday, was the last day of her unemployment benefits. MARTINEZ: Today was the last check I received. SPIEGEL: So what does that mean for you? MARTINEZ: It means income. It means that I might be homeless next month. SPIEGEL: Sylvia genuinely believes this. Believes that she and her family are 15 or so days away from homeless. But though she feels that this is true, she finds it almost impossible to focus on this reality in a productive way. Every time she tries to think about the problem, the plan, she is physically overcome. MARTINEZ: I have an anxiety attack. My heart starts beating really fast. I just get overwhelmed by just thinking about it, like I can literally feel the blood rushing to my brain. SPIEGEL: Sylvia knows the only hope for her family now is her 20 year old daughter whose job as a customer service rep at a Fortune 500 company brings her maybe enough for a small studio apartment. But there too, Sylvia is struggling to come to terms. SPIEGEL: So have you talked about this with your daughter? MARTINEZ: No. SPIEGEL: What have you said to her about it? MARTINEZ: Nothing. Nothing. SPIEGEL: Sylvia says she is too ashamed. She has always been the caregiver. Often she says she finds herself marveling, amazed at what has happened to her. MARTINEZ: Six months ago I was fine. I had a home, my bills were paid. I had a job. SPIEGEL: Now she has $50, a wet couch and a sinking sensation of diminishing possibilities. Alix Spiegel NPR News, Washington.

I'm Ira Flatow. If you wander the narrow streets of Venice, hitting dead ends at the canals, you of course realize it's like no other modern city. It's obvious, but just west of the serene civilization is one of Italy's biggest industrial areas, Porto Marghera, where the roads have names like Chemical Avenue, Oil Street, Refinery Way, and a number of the chemical plants and refineries are shuttered now. But soon, these abandoned industrial areas will be the spot for a big, new, green energy project, and this is going to be something interesting. It's Italy's first algae-to-electricity power plant, and the developers are hoping that the plant will produce enough electricity from the algae to power half the city of Venice - and all that with zero emissions. How do you like that? How's it going to work? Is it really feasible? That's what we're going to be talking about with my next guest, Al Darzins. He is at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colorado. Welcome to Science Friday, Dr. Darzins. Dr. AL DARZINS (Principal Group Manager, National Bioenergy Center, National Renewable Energy Laboratory): Hello, thank you. FLATOW: Let's talk about the facility being planned for Venice. How do you turn algae into electricity? Dr. DARZINS: Well, I mean, apparently they are going to be using a technology based from a company here on the U. S. , whereby they will grow the algae in what are known as closed photobioreactors, essentially large tubes; collect the algae, remove all the water, dry the algae; and then probably gasify that algae in a system that they call plasma gasification. That generates hot gases that can be then burned, turn a turbine, to generate electricity. FLATOW: So they're going to turn it into biomass, basically? Dr. DARZINS: Right. So they're going to grow, actually, biomass, the algae as a feedstock, and then use that feedstock to actually do the gasification process. FLATOW: Now this is different - I've always heard that people want to grow algae to take biodiesel out of it, make fuel oil out of it, but this is not what they're doing. Dr. DARZINS: Absolutely. This is dramatically different than really what most of the people in the world are looking at for algae. Algae are a really good source of potentially bioenergy routes. They make a lot of things like hydrogen oils, lipids if you will, carbohydrates, sugars -but then the biomass itself could be used as a feedstock. And so this piece that they're looking at in Italy is really kind of a small part of where the larger, general interest is in algae, and that is actually on the oils that they produce. FLATOW: Right, 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Also you can tweet us @scifri, @-S-C-I-F-R-I, or join us in Second Life. You say it is different than what most people are doing, and how feasible is it, then? Dr. DARZINS: Well, that's the ultimate question, really, for any algae technology. It's always going to come down to cost. And so in our experience, some of the plasma gasification technologies, you know, they can be rather capital and energy intensive. You then have to figure into that the cost of growing the algae in these closed systems, which are expensive; the cost of harvesting and removing all the water; and then, in theory, drying the algae before you actually do the gasification. So what that all entails and what that costs is going to be absolutely critical to the bottom line and whether this is cost-effective and sustainable. FLATOW: Yeah, because it's going to take all that energy to, what, to dry it and do all the kinds of things you need to do to it. Dr. DARZINS: Absolutely, and that extends to really any algal biofuels technology - whether it's producing oils for biodiesel or there are some algae that actually can produce ethanol, as well. And so, all the processes that go into producing those fuels, what that costs is going to be absolutely critical in the future. FLATOW: Yeah, and of course when you burn it, you're then going to produce some of the greenhouse gases themselves, right? Dr. DARZINS: That's true, but I think in the process in Italy, I think they plan on reusing the CO2 to actually channel back into the growth of the algae because the algae need nutrients, sunlight, water and CO2 to grow. FLATOW: And what is their schedule for getting this all done? Dr. DARZINS: You know, that's a really good question. I would imagine that the first thing is to generate some sort of a pilot or demonstration. I mean, it's unlikely that they'll go to full-bore commercialization. They'll probably have to start out very slowly with a pilot or demonstration plant just to see whether this works. FLATOW: You know, I've seen algae demonstration plants out in our deserts out there in the southwest, but Venice is not a southwest desert. Dr. DARZINS: Well, and that's absolutely critical. So where you site a particular algae facility is going to be absolutely critical. Now in Venice, water is probably not a problem. They have a lot of water. You know, will sunlight be a problem? Again, you know, how much solar insulation do they get every year is going to be a huge issue. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Jim in Chicago. Hi, Jim. JIM (Caller): Hi, I just wanted to know what company it was that produced that technology. FLATOW: Good question. Dr. DARZINS: I think it was a company based out of Washington called Solena, S-O-L-E-N-A. FLATOW: Yeah, out of Washington - state of Washington. Dr. DARZINS: I think that's correct. FLATOW: Is there a lot of research going on in algae? Dr. DARZINS: Oh, you would not believe the amount of research going on just over the last couple years. I mean, the Department of Energy actually funded an algae program for almost 20 years, from 1979 to '96, and then they terminated the program because of budget cuts. But just over the last couple years, there has been a virtual explosion in the interest in algal biofuels. There are probably well over 100, 150, maybe as many as 200 companies, worldwide - can you believe it? - that are actually looking into commercializing algal biofuels. FLATOW: Let me just correct myself. That was Washington, D. C. Dr. DARZINS: Oh was it D. C. ? Okay. FLATOW: Yeah, not the state. Don't listen to anything I say because I'm going to get it wrong. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: But also what I find interesting about this is that they're going to cultivate a species of algae that actually grows in the Venetian lagoon water, right? Dr. DARZINS: Yeah. And again when you talk to Jerry Brand next, you know, you'll find out that there are many different algal species that have the ability to grow in fresh water. They can grow in brackish water. They can grow in sea water, and there are some organisms that can grow, like, in the Great Salt Lake. And so there's a huge diversity of organisms out there that potentially you could use for algal biofuels development. FLATOW: Now some questions coming in from the Internet. One is a very simple one. Why don't you just dry it and burn it? Why do you have to go through this multi-stage process? Dr. DARZINS: Well, I mean, I think what they want to do is generate - once you have the so-called synthetic gas or syngas, which is carbon monoxide and hydrogen, you can do a lot of things with it. You can burn it to generate the electricity, but then you can also use that to make other fuels, as well. So there's a lot of flexibility in going the gasification route. FLATOW: Jeff(ph) in Portland, Oregon. Hi, welcome. JEFF (Caller): Hi, well thanks so much, Ira. That's an exciting program, what an exciting concept. I've heard that algae is the answer. I had a question - and you kind of addressed it - about the Venice lagoon. I'm kind of concerned in that regard, but are these going to be independent places that will be growing so there will be no spreading of algae through parts of the biosphere where we don't want it? And quickly, I mean kind of coincidentally, I've heard also that algae is the answer when it comes to both fuel and food. FLATOW: Yeah, I've heard that, too. We'll talk about it a bit. JEFF: Thank you. FLATOW: Yeah, thanks for the question. Dr. DARZINS: Well, to address the caller's first issue. So as far as I know, the plans, at least in Venice, are to grow the algae in these large kind of vertically standing tubes if you will. And so they will essentially be enclosed, and so that's really going to limit, you know, where these algae can go in the environment. That is true - for the second question - algae can be used as both a food and fuel, but most of the food applications are grown in, you know, places like California and Hawaii, where, you know, they're growing these organisms that really don't produce a lot of the oils that we're looking for for biofuels. FLATOW: But if you grow algae for using biofuels, taking the oil out of it, could you then not squeeze the oil out and use the other byproducts, use as. . . Dr. DARZINS: Absolutely. In fact, there's a lot of people that are talking. Once you remove the oil, there's really a lot of high-quality protein still left in that algae meal. And so that could be fed to, for instance, cattle or other animals, and perhaps even down the road maybe to be used for human consumption. FLATOW: Yeah, it just all depends on which algae you choose. Dr. DARZINS: Absolutely. FLATOW: And we're going to get into that a little bit more. Thank you, Al, for taking time to be with us. Dr. DARZINS: My pleasure. Al Darzins is the principal group manager of the National Bioenergy Center at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colorado. And we're going to move on now to talk more about algae, continuing in this green vein. We're going to take a look behind this organism and its developments in algal power in Venice, or - and I talked a bit about squeezing algae, squeezing the oil out of the algae. My next guest is something of an algae aficionado. He actually curates a collection, a collection of thousands of different kinds of algae. You've got your fresh water, your salt water, your red, your green, your yellow. He has some incubating at precise temperature in glass tubes. He furnishes them with a steady supply of carbon-dioxide-rich air. He has others, like some extreme specimens from Antarctica and the Gobi Desert that are cryogenically preserved with liquid nitrogen, and he is an algae librarian. You know, an algae librarian can lead a lonelier life than the Maytag repairman. But lately, a throng of biotech engineers have been knocking on my next guest's door, eager to get their hands on some of these specimens for their energy projects. Jerry Brand is the director of the culture collection of algae at the University of Texas at Austin. Welcome to Science Friday. Mr. JERRY BRAND (Director, Culture Collection of Algae, University of Texas at Austin): Hello, Ira. FLATOW: Hi. There are a lot of folks interested now. Mr. BRAND: More than I could've imagined two years ago. Yes, there's a great deal of interest now. FLATOW: And when they come in, what do they ask for? Mr. BRAND: Well, the first thing they say, likely, I would say not nearly all say this, but a predominant thing to say is that - well, I prepared my facility now. All I need is the alga. Get me the algae. FLATOW: Oh, it's just like baking a cake. I've got the flour. Give me the yeast. Just throw it in there. Mr. BRAND: That's kind of what I get a lot of times. FLATOW: And you tell them it's not that simple. Mr. BRAND: That's exactly right. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Because? Mr. BRAND: The reason is that different algae grow better under some conditions than other ones do, and so it depends on the conditions where they want to grow the algae. It depends on what product they want from the algae. And not only that, most kinds of algae haven't really even been researched very much in detail. So we don't even know which ones for sure have the most potential to grow vigorously, to behave well in large cultures, and to produce a lot of the products that people are interested in. FLATOW: Well, how many different kinds are there? Mr. BRAND: I would say no one really knows. The estimates keep going up. Some conservative estimates say maybe less than a couple hundred thousand, but others claim that there may be more than a million kinds of just one group of algae alone, called diatoms. And so it kind of depends on how you divide them up. There's sort of - almost like a continuum in the genetic contents. So when you separate one species from another, where do you draw the line? Do you divide them with very - based on very subtle differences in their genetic content, or do we make the breaks more broadly? FLATOW: But theoretically, then, with all these different kinds, you should be able to find one for everybody. Mr. BRAND: You really would think you could. The problem is the alga does what it wants to do, not what man wants it to do. And living out in nature, it's very analogous, I would say, to growing wheat. When farmers, or let's say hunters and gatherers, first wanted to grow wheat, there was just a few stalks of this stuff, and it probably was enough to support a few people every square mile. But you had to develop new varieties. You had to learn culturing techniques. You had to learn a lot of things before you could really get wheat that was highly productive and useful to make bread and so forth. FLATOW: All right, Jerry, can you hang with us there for a second? Mr. BRAND: Sure. FLATOW: We're going to take a short break and come back and talk more with Jerry Brand and his algae library out there at the University of Texas at Austin, the Hook'em Horns territory. So stay with us. We'll be right back, talking algae, 1-800-989-8255, or Twitter us. The tweets can go to @scifri. We'll be right back after this break. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to Science Friday from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking algae in anticipation of Earth Day coming up, with Jerry Brand at the University of Texas, who has an algae collection. He's actually director of the Culture Collection of Algae. Jerry, walk me through your collection. What would I see if I walked through your collection there? Mr. BRAND: Well, what you would see is transparent, glass containers, test tubes, flasks and so forth, most of which have liquid in. Some have some gelatin material called agar, and all of them have - are colored, and the color is due to the algae that are growing on the surface of the agar or throughout that liquid. So you see a very colorful collection of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of these containers of algae of different colors. Not all algae are green. They come in a variety of different colors. FLATOW: And how did you get started on this madness of collecting algae? Mr. BRAND: Well, the way I got started actually was as a physiologist interested in photosynthesis, and I realized, as others did, that algae was an ideal source for studying photosynthesis. And I ended up becoming more interested in the algae than I did the specific process, photosynthesis, and so that's how I became involved. FLATOW: Wow, that's terrific, and algae can grow just about anywhere, can't it? Mr. BRAND: Well, they've got to have light. As long as there's a source of light available, it's remarkable the diversity of places that they can grow, in practically every habitat where there's light. And they can survive, in fact, up in the air, traveling for hundreds of miles through the atmosphere in resting stages or in rather dry, in a rather dry state. So they have different forms of existing even under very harsh conditions. FLATOW: Yeah, you know, in fact I remember going - you know, I used to go to the zoo here in New York and see the polar bears had green fur, and I learned years later that was algae growing inside the little shafts of their fur. Mr. BRAND: That's exactly right. That's one of the interesting places you can find them. I've actually seen them under the bark of tree. If you have a young sapling that looks dark, but there's enough light gets through it that they grow right just underneath the bark of a tree where you'd never think a photosynthetic organism could grow. So you never know where you'll find them. As long as there's light, they're going to be there. FLATOW: Here's a question from Twitter. A tweet came in from MTatter(ph) who wants to know: Are you engineering the plants to be more efficient and reduce costs? Mr. BRAND: Many, many people are. There's one group of bacteria-like algae called cyanobacteria. And they are very much like bacteria, and it's quite easy to get new genetic material into many strains of those. And so there's a number of scientists around the world who are attempting to modify those such that they grow under more favorable conditions for producing, say, a fuel, or they produce a more desirable product. And so this is something that we are doing some of, but it's being done in lots of laboratories throughout the world, probably a couple of hundred laboratories throughout the world. FLATOW: John(ph) in Newtown, Pennsylvania. Hi, welcome to Science Friday. JOHN (Caller): Hey, Ira, good show. I'd like to ask your guest if you were to engineer algae, would there - you know, it's a very virulent plant. Is there a danger that the engineered algae could go wild and maybe hurt the wild algae? FLATOW: Good question. Mr. BRAND: That's an extremely good question and one that's being addressed now, very seriously, since we realize in order to provide a fuel source from algae or any other commodity, we would have to grow huge amounts of it. The first thing I would say is, that in my opinion, most algae are what we would call pandemic. It means that if you bring something in from a foreign place, if it's a small alga, microscopic, it's probably - you're not going to probably introduce something foreign, something that wouldn't eventually get there anyway. But now when we're talking about genetically engineered algae, that's something different. I think there would have to be a lot of testing going on before this could be approved. So this has not been adequately addressed yet, at least not to the public, but it's something that's been very seriously discussed in meetings of those who are trying to develop biofuels and other commodities from algae. So we're well aware of the problem. The testing procedures and things that we would need to do to authorize these to be used have not been put in place yet. FLATOW: So you really - it's interesting. You talked about that in relationship to when people started cultivating the grasses, or the wheat, and had to come up with the kind of wheat they needed to eat. We're now into - what do you call it, algaecultural, algae agricultural? What would be the right way to phrase that? Mr. BRAND: Well, I guess you could call it a form of agriculture. Let's see. What would be another room for it? I don't know what the phrase\u2026 FLATOW: Okay, well we'll create a room for you: algae agricultural. Mr. BRAND: All right, that's okay. It's a kind of mariculture, I suppose, if it's marine waters you're using, and of course, some people think of doing that in salt water and some in fresh water. So it's a kind of mariculture, I suppose, but algae agricultural is probably a much better term. FLATOW: And the idea is to come up with something that we can use and harvest the best for whatever purpose we want to do with it. Mr. BRAND: That's exactly right. We would like to have an alga that's tailor made for the specific products that we want. FLATOW: Do you think that algae would be able to produce enough oil, let's say, to make a difference? Mr. BRAND: Well theoretically, yes. Many people have done calculations that indicate that in scale, algae could make a significant dent in our fuel requirements, if we can do it, as Al Darzins said a few minutes ago, if would could do it economically. And so far, there's not been any real demonstration of that, although it appears like the possible price is coming down. But it would take a lot of land, and the reason why algae are so attractive is because algae can grow on land where not much else can grow, in deserts and arid land, various conditions. And so it would take a lot of land, but it doesn't necessarily take land that's needed for other things. FLATOW: One last question from Twitter. Lee Rosen(ph) writes: How much carbon can be captured in the algae energy production process? Mr. BRAND: That's a good question. Some people think that, well, if you put in 40-percent carbon dioxide, 40 percent of the air is carbon dioxide and bubble it into your algae, you can do better than putting in five percent. That's not necessarily true. You're only capturing carbon as fast as the alga's growing, and I don't remember exactly what the percentage of an alga is carbon, probably in the range of 30 or 40 percent. So a lot of the mass of the alga goes into carbon, but you can only remove the carbon as fast as that alga's growing. So if it only doubles once every day, which many of them do, that's how fast you're going to capture the carbon. FLATOW: I had seen stores of pilot programs in the Southwest where algae were growing in a greenhouse next to a power plant, and they fed the CO2 into the greenhouse, and they said they could suck out 80 percent of the CO2 coming out the stack, but it grew so fast you'd have to take - it like tripled overnight or something like that. Mr. BRAND: That's right, and not necessarily overnight but over a period of a day, when the photosynthesis is allowing it to grow. That's exactly right. Some tiny algae can double three times in a day. That means by nightfall, there's eight times as many as there were when the sun came up in the morning. So some small ones can reproduce very, very rapidly. And so in that case, they can capture an awful lot of CO2 during that period of time. FLATOW: So scaling it up is the problem here, making sure you don't have bad algae at the bottom of a pile someplace. Mr. BRAND: That's exactly right. That is a problem. FLATOW: All right, Jerry. Thank you for taking time to be with us. Mr. BRAND: It's a pleasure. Thank you for having me on. FLATOW: Have a good weekend. Mr. BRAND: Bye. FLATOW: Jerry Brand is the director of the culture collection of algae at the University of Texas at Austin.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is Science Friday from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow.  If you wander the narrow streets of Venice, hitting dead ends at the canals, you of course realize it's like no other modern city. It's obvious, but just west of the serene civilization is one of Italy's biggest industrial areas, Porto Marghera, where the roads have names like Chemical Avenue, Oil Street, Refinery Way, and a number of the chemical plants and refineries are shuttered now.  But soon, these abandoned industrial areas will be the spot for a big, new, green energy project, and this is going to be something interesting. It's Italy's first algae-to-electricity power plant, and the developers are hoping that the plant will produce enough electricity from the algae to power half the city of Venice - and all that with zero emissions.  How do you like that? How's it going to work? Is it really feasible? That's what we're going to be talking about with my next guest, Al Darzins. He is at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colorado. Welcome to Science Friday, Dr. Darzins.  Dr. AL DARZINS (Principal Group Manager, National Bioenergy Center, National Renewable Energy Laboratory): Hello, thank you.  FLATOW: Let's talk about the facility being planned for Venice. How do you turn algae into electricity?  Dr. DARZINS: Well, I mean, apparently they are going to be using a technology based from a company here on the U. S. , whereby they will grow the algae in what are known as closed photobioreactors, essentially large tubes; collect the algae, remove all the water, dry the algae; and then probably gasify that algae in a system that they call plasma gasification.  That generates hot gases that can be then burned, turn a turbine, to generate electricity.  FLATOW: So they're going to turn it into biomass, basically?  Dr. DARZINS: Right. So they're going to grow, actually, biomass, the algae as a feedstock, and then use that feedstock to actually do the gasification process.  FLATOW: Now this is different - I've always heard that people want to grow algae to take biodiesel out of it, make fuel oil out of it, but this is not what they're doing.  Dr. DARZINS: Absolutely. This is dramatically different than really what most of the people in the world are looking at for algae. Algae are a really good source of potentially bioenergy routes. They make a lot of things like hydrogen oils, lipids if you will, carbohydrates, sugars -but then the biomass itself could be used as a feedstock.  And so this piece that they're looking at in Italy is really kind of a small part of where the larger, general interest is in algae, and that is actually on the oils that they produce.  FLATOW: Right, 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Also you can tweet us @scifri, @-S-C-I-F-R-I, or join us in Second Life. You say it is different than what most people are doing, and how feasible is it, then?  Dr. DARZINS: Well, that's the ultimate question, really, for any algae technology. It's always going to come down to cost. And so in our experience, some of the plasma gasification technologies, you know, they can be rather capital and energy intensive.  You then have to figure into that the cost of growing the algae in these closed systems, which are expensive; the cost of harvesting and removing all the water; and then, in theory, drying the algae before you actually do the gasification.  So what that all entails and what that costs is going to be absolutely critical to the bottom line and whether this is cost-effective and sustainable.  FLATOW: Yeah, because it's going to take all that energy to, what, to dry it and do all the kinds of things you need to do to it.  Dr. DARZINS: Absolutely, and that extends to really any algal biofuels technology - whether it's producing oils for biodiesel or there are some algae that actually can produce ethanol, as well. And so, all the processes that go into producing those fuels, what that costs is going to be absolutely critical in the future.  FLATOW: Yeah, and of course when you burn it, you're then going to produce some of the greenhouse gases themselves, right?  Dr. DARZINS: That's true, but I think in the process in Italy, I think they plan on reusing the CO2 to actually channel back into the growth of the algae because the algae need nutrients, sunlight, water and CO2 to grow.  FLATOW: And what is their schedule for getting this all done?  Dr. DARZINS: You know, that's a really good question. I would imagine that the first thing is to generate some sort of a pilot or demonstration. I mean, it's unlikely that they'll go to full-bore commercialization. They'll probably have to start out very slowly with a pilot or demonstration plant just to see whether this works.  FLATOW: You know, I've seen algae demonstration plants out in our deserts out there in the southwest, but Venice is not a southwest desert.  Dr. DARZINS: Well, and that's absolutely critical. So where you site a particular algae facility is going to be absolutely critical. Now in Venice, water is probably not a problem. They have a lot of water. You know, will sunlight be a problem? Again, you know, how much solar insulation do they get every year is going to be a huge issue.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Jim in Chicago. Hi, Jim.  JIM (Caller): Hi, I just wanted to know what company it was that produced that technology.  FLATOW: Good question.  Dr. DARZINS: I think it was a company based out of Washington called Solena, S-O-L-E-N-A.  FLATOW: Yeah, out of Washington - state of Washington.  Dr. DARZINS: I think that's correct.  FLATOW: Is there a lot of research going on in algae?  Dr. DARZINS: Oh, you would not believe the amount of research going on just over the last couple years. I mean, the Department of Energy actually funded an algae program for almost 20 years, from 1979 to '96, and then they terminated the program because of budget cuts. But just over the last couple years, there has been a virtual explosion in the interest in algal biofuels. There are probably well over 100, 150, maybe as many as 200 companies, worldwide - can you believe it? - that are actually looking into commercializing algal biofuels.  FLATOW: Let me just correct myself. That was Washington, D. C.  Dr. DARZINS: Oh was it D. C. ? Okay.  FLATOW: Yeah, not the state. Don't listen to anything I say because I'm going to get it wrong.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: But also what I find interesting about this is that they're going to cultivate a species of algae that actually grows in the Venetian lagoon water, right?  Dr. DARZINS: Yeah. And again when you talk to Jerry Brand next, you know, you'll find out that there are many different algal species that have the ability to grow in fresh water. They can grow in brackish water. They can grow in sea water, and there are some organisms that can grow, like, in the Great Salt Lake.  And so there's a huge diversity of organisms out there that potentially you could use for algal biofuels development.  FLATOW: Now some questions coming in from the Internet. One is a very simple one. Why don't you just dry it and burn it? Why do you have to go through this multi-stage process?  Dr. DARZINS: Well, I mean, I think what they want to do is generate - once you have the so-called synthetic gas or syngas, which is carbon monoxide and hydrogen, you can do a lot of things with it. You can burn it to generate the electricity, but then you can also use that to make other fuels, as well. So there's a lot of flexibility in going the gasification route.  FLATOW: Jeff(ph) in Portland, Oregon. Hi, welcome.  JEFF (Caller): Hi, well thanks so much, Ira. That's an exciting program, what an exciting concept. I've heard that algae is the answer. I had a question - and you kind of addressed it - about the Venice lagoon. I'm kind of concerned in that regard, but are these going to be independent places that will be growing so there will be no spreading of algae through parts of the biosphere where we don't want it?  And quickly, I mean kind of coincidentally, I've heard also that algae is the answer when it comes to both fuel and food.  FLATOW: Yeah, I've heard that, too. We'll talk about it a bit.  JEFF: Thank you.  FLATOW: Yeah, thanks for the question.  Dr. DARZINS: Well, to address the caller's first issue. So as far as I know, the plans, at least in Venice, are to grow the algae in these large kind of vertically standing tubes if you will. And so they will essentially be enclosed, and so that's really going to limit, you know, where these algae can go in the environment.  That is true - for the second question - algae can be used as both a food and fuel, but most of the food applications are grown in, you know, places like California and Hawaii, where, you know, they're growing these organisms that really don't produce a lot of the oils that we're looking for for biofuels.  FLATOW: But if you grow algae for using biofuels, taking the oil out of it, could you then not squeeze the oil out and use the other byproducts, use as. . .  Dr. DARZINS: Absolutely. In fact, there's a lot of people that are talking. Once you remove the oil, there's really a lot of high-quality protein still left in that algae meal. And so that could be fed to, for instance, cattle or other animals, and perhaps even down the road maybe to be used for human consumption.  FLATOW: Yeah, it just all depends on which algae you choose.  Dr. DARZINS: Absolutely.  FLATOW: And we're going to get into that a little bit more. Thank you, Al, for taking time to be with us.  Dr. DARZINS: My pleasure.  Al Darzins is the principal group manager of the National Bioenergy Center at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colorado.  And we're going to move on now to talk more about algae, continuing in this green vein. We're going to take a look behind this organism and its developments in algal power in Venice, or - and I talked a bit about squeezing algae, squeezing the oil out of the algae.  My next guest is something of an algae aficionado. He actually curates a collection, a collection of thousands of different kinds of algae. You've got your fresh water, your salt water, your red, your green, your yellow. He has some incubating at precise temperature in glass tubes.  He furnishes them with a steady supply of carbon-dioxide-rich air. He has others, like some extreme specimens from Antarctica and the Gobi Desert that are cryogenically preserved with liquid nitrogen, and he is an algae librarian.  You know, an algae librarian can lead a lonelier life than the Maytag repairman. But lately, a throng of biotech engineers have been knocking on my next guest's door, eager to get their hands on some of these specimens for their energy projects.  Jerry Brand is the director of the culture collection of algae at the University of Texas at Austin. Welcome to Science Friday.  Mr. JERRY BRAND (Director, Culture Collection of Algae, University of Texas at Austin): Hello, Ira.  FLATOW: Hi. There are a lot of folks interested now.  Mr. BRAND: More than I could've imagined two years ago. Yes, there's a great deal of interest now.  FLATOW: And when they come in, what do they ask for?  Mr. BRAND: Well, the first thing they say, likely, I would say not nearly all say this, but a predominant thing to say is that - well, I prepared my facility now. All I need is the alga. Get me the algae.  FLATOW: Oh, it's just like baking a cake. I've got the flour. Give me the yeast. Just throw it in there.  Mr. BRAND: That's kind of what I get a lot of times.  FLATOW: And you tell them it's not that simple.  Mr. BRAND: That's exactly right.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Because?  Mr. BRAND: The reason is that different algae grow better under some conditions than other ones do, and so it depends on the conditions where they want to grow the algae. It depends on what product they want from the algae. And not only that, most kinds of algae haven't really even been researched very much in detail.  So we don't even know which ones for sure have the most potential to grow vigorously, to behave well in large cultures, and to produce a lot of the products that people are interested in.  FLATOW: Well, how many different kinds are there?  Mr. BRAND: I would say no one really knows. The estimates keep going up. Some conservative estimates say maybe less than a couple hundred thousand, but others claim that there may be more than a million kinds of just one group of algae alone, called diatoms.  And so it kind of depends on how you divide them up. There's sort of - almost like a continuum in the genetic contents. So when you separate one species from another, where do you draw the line? Do you divide them with very - based on very subtle differences in their genetic content, or do we make the breaks more broadly?  FLATOW: But theoretically, then, with all these different kinds, you should be able to find one for everybody.  Mr. BRAND: You really would think you could. The problem is the alga does what it wants to do, not what man wants it to do. And living out in nature, it's very analogous, I would say, to growing wheat.  When farmers, or let's say hunters and gatherers, first wanted to grow wheat, there was just a few stalks of this stuff, and it probably was enough to support a few people every square mile. But you had to develop new varieties. You had to learn culturing techniques. You had to learn a lot of things before you could really get wheat that was highly productive and useful to make bread and so forth.  FLATOW: All right, Jerry, can you hang with us there for a second?  Mr. BRAND: Sure.  FLATOW: We're going to take a short break and come back and talk more with Jerry Brand and his algae library out there at the University of Texas at Austin, the Hook'em Horns territory. So stay with us. We'll be right back, talking algae, 1-800-989-8255, or Twitter us. The tweets can go to @scifri. We'll be right back after this break.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to Science Friday from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking algae in anticipation of Earth Day coming up, with Jerry Brand at the University of Texas, who has an algae collection. He's actually director of the Culture Collection of Algae.  Jerry, walk me through your collection. What would I see if I walked through your collection there?  Mr. BRAND: Well, what you would see is transparent, glass containers, test tubes, flasks and so forth, most of which have liquid in. Some have some gelatin material called agar, and all of them have - are colored, and the color is due to the algae that are growing on the surface of the agar or throughout that liquid.  So you see a very colorful collection of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of these containers of algae of different colors. Not all algae are green. They come in a variety of different colors.  FLATOW: And how did you get started on this madness of collecting algae?  Mr. BRAND: Well, the way I got started actually was as a physiologist interested in photosynthesis, and I realized, as others did, that algae was an ideal source for studying photosynthesis.

FLATOW: Yeah, you know, in fact I remember going - you know, I used to go to the zoo here in New York and see the polar bears had green fur, and I learned years later that was algae growing inside the little shafts of their fur.

And to take on a few of those questions, we turn to medical ethics expert Nancy Berlinger, who joins me now from New York. Welcome to the show. Dr. NANCY BERLINGER (Medical Ethicist; Deputy Director and Research Associate, The Hastings Center): Thank you. LYDEN: So you had to think that some people are going to get tested and find that they're in a lower risk group and perhaps use these results as an excuse to keep smoking, don't you? Dr. BERLINGER: Absolutely. I thought in the report, the idea, the Aunt Ethel syndrome, was really helpful because when we think about, you know, a person who we probably all know who had a lifelong smoking habit and didn't develop lung cancer, we probably are not thinking about the other chronic diseases that this person probably had. If we just think about that disease in isolation, lung cancer, we may forget the whole story of what we know about what smoking can do to people. LYDEN: Do tests like this, Nancy Berlinger, have an effect in terms of - we also heard maybe if it's highly scary to some people, that's a good thing. Dr. BERLINGER: Definitely understanding cancer risk through the identification of biomarkers is hugely important. But one thing that really worries me is that - let's say you had a consumer version of this test, not something that you would use in a laboratory or in a doctor's office, but something you would market to people. Where would you market this test? You would market it in the same low income neighborhoods where the cigarette billboards are. You would market it to smokers. You wouldn't market it to people who don't smoke and say, here, you can start smoking. You would direct it to people who already have an addiction that is already impairing their health, and that raises very severe ethical consequences not just for an individual, but for an entire community. LYDEN: Beyond that, there are some big ethical questions. Take insurance companies. If this test passes muster, could we be seeing high risk smokers paying more for their policies? Dr. BERLINGER: That's an interesting question. It's definitely something that we're concerned about every time a test comes online that there would be some sort of way or using a test to sort people out. LYDEN: Uh-huh. You know, stepping back from this test for just a moment, we'll soon have tests, it seems, for just about everything. What challenges does that present for ethicists? Dr. BERLINGER: Well, there's always the idea that a test equals certainty. Any clinician, any physician, any scientist, any ethicist who looks at a test knows that the test usually looks at a range of people, a range of samples - and this test is a good example. People who had low levels of this metabolite had lower risk of developing lung cancer. And those with high levels had much higher risk of developing lung cancer. However, there's this always, you know, the kind of muddy middle. There aren't that many tests that are absolutely predictive. And especially, there are not that many that I know of that will tell you categorically that you won't get something. So putting all of our faith in a test and not in the totality of what we can do to prevent health problems rather than testing once they've already taken route is the big public health challenge. LYDEN: Nancy Berlinger is the deputy director of The Hastings Center, a bioethics research institute. Thank you very much. Dr. BERLINGER: Thank you.  JACKI LYDEN, host:  That new medical test Joanne just reported on raises as many questions as it answers. And to take on a few of those questions, we turn to medical ethics expert Nancy Berlinger, who joins me now from New York.  Welcome to the show.  Dr. NANCY BERLINGER (Medical Ethicist; Deputy Director and Research Associate, The Hastings Center): Thank you.  LYDEN: So you had to think that some people are going to get tested and find that they're in a lower risk group and perhaps use these results as an excuse to keep smoking, don't you?  Dr. BERLINGER: Absolutely. I thought in the report, the idea, the Aunt Ethel syndrome, was really helpful because when we think about, you know, a person who we probably all know who had a lifelong smoking habit and didn't develop lung cancer, we probably are not thinking about the other chronic diseases that this person probably had.  If we just think about that disease in isolation, lung cancer, we may forget the whole story of what we know about what smoking can do to people.  LYDEN: Do tests like this, Nancy Berlinger, have an effect in terms of - we also heard maybe if it's highly scary to some people, that's a good thing.

I'm Jacki Lyden. Scientists announced today they found a urine test that could determine which smokers will develop lung cancer and which will not. But the researchers say a clean test won't be an excuse to smoke. NPR's Joanne Silberner has more. JOANNE SILBERNER: Call it the Aunt Ethel(ph) syndrome. That's your 85-year-old aunt who smoked for 70 years with no sign of lung cancer yet. According to the American Cancer Society, about eight to 15 percent of smokers will develop lung cancer over their lifetimes. Jian-Min Yuan of the University of Minnesota and a group of researchers in Asia wanted to know more about this phenomenon. Dr. JIAN-MIN YUAN (Associate Professor, University of Minnesota): We tried to answer the question, can we use some (unintelligible) marker to predict a risk of lung cancer for people who smoke? SILBERNER: They had a massive database to work with, years of health information on more than 50,000 people in Singapore and Shanghai. They picked out about 500 who developed lung cancer. Yuan and his colleagues checked urine samples of the afflicted unafflicted smokers for the presence of a particular chemical called NNAL. They came up with a clear answer. Dr. YUAN: We can predict certain smokers have a higher risk for the lung cancer if they continue to smoke. SILBERNER: The one-third of smokers with the highest levels of NNAL were twice as likely to get lung cancer as the one-third of smokers in the lowest level. And when the researchers looked for a nicotine byproduct in the urine, the difference was even more dramatic. Those who had the highest levels of both chemicals were at more than eight times the risk of developing lung cancer as people with the lowest levels. Scientists know that NNAL causes lung cancer in animals. Tyler Jacks, a lung cancer researcher at MIT, says genetics may dictate how the body deals with various carcinogens in smoke and thus a smoker's risk of lung cancer. Mr. TYLER JACKS (Researcher, Massachusetts Institute of Technology): The efficiency with which those compounds are broken down will determine how long those harmful compounds are exposed to the cells of the lung or other parts of the body where they could do damage. SILBERNER: A low reading in Yuan's test could be useful information. Dr. YUAN: You tell the people you have a lower level of that marker, and maybe you have a relatively lower lung cancer risk, you know, compared to other smokers. SILBERNER: But ask any cancer specialist whether a negative test for NNAL is good news, and you'll get the answer Jacks gives. Mr. JACKS: In no way would we suggest that a test of this sort would allow an individual to smoke with no risk at all. SILBERNER: First off, people with low levels of NNAL still are at some risk of lung cancer. There are plenty of other carcinogens in tobacco smoke. And cigarettes also cause heart disease, emphysema and cancer in other parts of the body. Could you use a high test result to scare people? (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. JACKS: That would be one useful thing to do. If you could identify individuals whose metabolic makeup were such that they were highly prone to lung cancer following cigarette smoking, you might well be able to scare the pants off them. SILBERNER: And a high NNAL urine test might justify more frequent screening for lung cancer so it can be caught earlier in a more treatable stage, though that remains to be proven. The results of the study were presented today at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research. Joanne Silberner, NPR News.

To get some historical context, I talked with science writer Laurie Garrett. Her books include \"The Coming Plague,\" \"Newly Emerging Diseases\" and \"A World Out of Balance. \" We started with a basic primer on three key words: outbreak, epidemic and pandemic. Ms. LAURIE GARRETT (Senior Fellow, Global Health Program, Council on Foreign Relations): Well, those are dicey terms. Everybody has their own way of defining them. But basically, it boils down to it's an outbreak when it's a small cluster of cases. It becomes an epidemic when it goes well beyond that cluster but still within local boundaries, either the nation or immediate region. It becomes pandemic when it jumps continents or certainly goes the full length of one continental area, such as the Americas. LYDEN: I see. Most flu outbreaks, as we know, Laurie, hit the elderly and young children the hardest, but most of the dead in Mexico are young, vigorous people. Why would that be? Ms. GARRETT: There could be two possible explanations for that, the good news one and a bad news one. The good news one would be that the vaccine that people got this fall, who did get a flu vaccine, has offered some margin of protection against this virus. And that might mean then that we can just make up huge batches of it and bring this whole thing to a halt. If that's the case, then that would explain why young adults have not been protected because they generally don't get vaccinated with flu. And the main recommendations here in the United States is for the vaccine to be delivered to vulnerable populations, the elderly and very young children. So that would be the good news explanation. The bad news explanation would be that this is following a pattern we've seen in the past, particularly in 1918 and with the bird flu in Asia over the last five or six years, where the real killer effect of the infection is not actually the virus directly itself, but rather the immune response to this very foreign, very strange virus that, from the perspective of the body, you've never seen before, and you don't have routine antibody capacity to respond to it. And so, what happens is if you're actually, ironically, young and vigorous and healthy, you have a very strong immune system, and your immune responds with a nuclear-bomb-like effect against this invading virus and fills your lungs with fluids, actually worsens the situation. And if that is indeed what's going on in Mexico, it's quite worrisome. LYDEN: Looking at it historically, is there any comparison about this -with this Mexican outbreak and 1918, the great world pandemic? Ms. GARRETT: Well, Jacki, the big thing about flu and the reason that it's always a problem, and we always have a different flu circulating around the country every single year, is that this is a very, very sloppy virus. It is a large, what's called RNA virus, meaning that its genetics are stored as RNA, not DNA, and it actually has chromosomes, just like humans have chromosomes, except that this virus' chromosomes are really a mess. They're not well-maintained. And so, when the virus reproduces, literally, its whole genetic material falls apart, and then it absorbs. As it reassembles and makes progeny, it absorbs genetic material from the environment that it's in. So if it's in a human cell, it picks up little human RNA. If it's in a pig cell, it picks up pig. If it's in a chicken cell, chicken. What we see with this virus that's so unusual and that, as far as we know, has never happened before is that it has picked up genetic material from three different species: chickens, pigs and humans, and mixed them all up. And in that sense, it is only similar to what we saw in 1918. And what seems to have happened in 1918, although a lot of the scientific work is so new that we're still figuring it all out, is that a virus emerged that circulated around the world as a human flu. It was dangerous, but not terrible, but then it circulated both through pigs and through horses in the U. S. cavalry that was bivouacked in World War I in Kansas, and something that it picked up, probably from the horses, turned it into the super virulent, horribly deadly strain, which, according to the latest estimates, killed around 100 million people worldwide. LYDEN: I'm sitting here trying not to be alarmed and reach for a mask. We've seen people in these masks. Do they work? Ms. GARRETT: The truth is we don't really know what kind of masks work the best for something like influenza, and we don't really know how long you can use any given mask. LYDEN: So, how else can people protect themselves? Ms. GARRETT: It seems that the Mexican authorities are taking the logical response, and that is to advise people to stay at home, to avoid congregating in large settings with large numbers of people. And what I've seen in almost every epidemic I've been in is that the worst thing you can do, unless it's a matter of life and death, is go to a hospital. LYDEN: Science writer Laurie Garrett. She's currently director for the Global Health Program at the Council on Foreign Relations. And she's a former NPR science correspondent. Thanks very much, Laurie. Ms. GARRETT: Thank you.

I'm Ira Flatow. We've all seen those CSI detective shows. They're all over the place on TV. They usually involve some homo sapiens lying on the ground, or in a bed, or someplace in a pool of blood. But you know, there is a whole other world of CSI that you hardly ever get to see on TV, and that's wildlife CSI - crimes involving animals, where the victims have hooves or tusks or feathers, and the witnesses never talk, but they might crow. And so for the rest of the hour, the world of illegal animal trafficking, where bear gallbladders, ounce for ounce, cost more than cocaine. Forensic teams fly to remote regions in Alaska to investigate beaches littered with beheaded walruses. Now that's a CSI show. These crime scene scientists have to actually develop methods on the fly, like the protocol for a walrus autopsy; or the unique DNA signature in bear bile. Say that three times. It's a world where undercover agents buy vials of crushed tiger bone or pounds of caviar to get in there tight with the criminals. And there's only one forensic lab in the whole world that handles this stuff, and the director of that lab is here to talk about it, and he's one of my two guests. Let me introduce them. Ken Goddard is the director of the National Fish and Wildlife Laboratory in Ashland, Oregon, Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Mr. KEN GODDARD (National Fish and Wildlife Service Forensics Laboratory): Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: You're welcome. Laurel Neme is the author of the book \"Animal Investigators: How the World's First Wildlife Forensic Lab is Solving Crimes and Saving Endangered Species. \" Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Dr. LAUREL NEME (Author): Thank you. FLATOW: Dr. Goddard, how'd you get involved in this? Mr. GODDARD: First of all, I'm not a doctor. I got to a masters degree. I was running a police crime lab when I got the opportunity to set up a crime lab for wildlife. I'd been a homicide investigator, a crime-scene investigation, did all the homo-sapiens type of investigations, and this just seemed intriguing. FLATOW: And Dr. Neme, you are a doctor. Dr. NEME: I am a Ph. D. type. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: And what was your motivation for writing this book? Dr. NEME: Well, I'd been working in the field for about 10 years, going back and forth to Africa, working on natural-resource management, and one day I was talking to this Tanzanian game warden about a 10-year-old case where poachers had scattered these tainted pumpkins around watering holes, and then the elephants would eat them and die. And at first they didn't know what was happening to these elephants, why they were dying, if it was a new cause, you know, a new disease or whatnot, but all of them were missing their tusks. And it turned out that this game warden had done training at the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service Forensic Lab, and with the help of that lab and subsequence investigation, they discovered that poachers were, in fact, poisoning these pumpkins, and they did that so that they could slide out the tusks instead of hacking them out of the elephant. And in the middle of our conversation, the phone rings. And when he hangs up, he tells me that they just found a bunch of hippos who'd been poisoned in the very same manner for their ivory teeth. And I realized two things, one that this poisoning for profit was not going to stop, and secondly that this lab was having an impact 10 years later in this hippo case because it was giving them a lot of clues to the method of the poachers, even though it wasn't directly involved. So that's when I started investigating the cases. FLATOW: So is it actually possible to go to the crime scene there and use all the clues and figure out who the poachers are? Dr. NEME: It is, it is, especially once you start knowing what to look for. FLATOW: Uh-huh, and it's not the kind of stuff we're normally thinking about. Dr. NEME: No because at first, they weren't looking at all at the pumpkins. They were just looking at the animals and thinking they had a new disease on their hand. FLATOW: Dr. Goddard, what is the difference? What is the transition like from moving from human CSI to animal CSI? Mr. GODDARD: There isn't a lot of difference. You know, all crime labs do basically the same thing. We examine evidence in a triangular fashion. We try to link suspect, victim and crime scene together. The real difference in our case is our victim is a non-human animal, and we have to figure out what it is first to determine what type of crime has been committed. Lots of variations, you know: time of day, was it legal to hunt this animal, is this animal a hybrid, in which case it might be perfectly legal to kill it. What time of day was it killed in terms of hunting season? What kind of weapon? So things you don't run into in a normal homicide investigation. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number if you'd like to talk about the animal CSI. Give me an example of what a typical case would be like. Mr. GODDARD: Oh, the typical case for us ranges from anything from a feather coming in to hundreds of samples of caviar for possible smuggling, poaching or just illegal commercialization; Asian medicinals coming in from China, Southeast Asia, containing perhaps rhino horn, tiger-bone potions; deer or elk, moose meat; wolf possibly killed by a rancher, possibly going after sheep; just dozens and dozens of variations on a theme. FLATOW: It seems, Dr. Neme, that you must have had lots of cases, then, to choose from. How did you choose which ones to put in your book? Dr. NEME: You're absolutely right. I had hundreds to choose from. And I actually started with the science and talking with Ken and others at the lab about what scientifically were the most interesting cases from their perspective. I also was trying to look for cases that featured different parts of the lab - so pathology, morphology, chemistry - and also cases that had different outcomes. Because really what's powerful about the science is that the science is neutral. And you analyze the evidence, and it doesn't really matter what the outcome is. The evidence is the evidence. And I think that I wanted to show that by having - also selecting cases where the outcomes could be quite different. FLATOW: Give me an example of your favorite case. Dr. NEME: There was a case involving hundreds of headless walrus washing up on the beaches of northwest Alaska. And what's interesting is that the legal question here was not whether it was a protected species or not, or even who did it - to match a suspect to the actual killing - but rather if there was a pattern of illegal hunting. And the law is such that the Marine Mammal Protection Act allows Native Alaskans to hunt walrus, provided they do so for subsistence and not in a wasteful manner. And taking just the tusks may or may not be illegal. You know, the walrus could be lost during a hunt, or perhaps it died naturally and then washed ashore, and then the tusks would be the only thing that could be salvaged. So taking them wouldn't be illegal. Or else the weather might have turned while hunters were on the ice, and they took the quickest thing that they could so that the whole hunt wouldn't be lost, and that wouldn't be illegal, either. But here the lab was asked to see if someone shot the walrus, solely for their tusks and didn't attempt to retrieve anything else but that they could have - and that would've been a crime. And so the lab was called in, in essence, to discern the intent of the hunters. FLATOW: And was there, like, a break in the case at some point that just helped you solve the case? Dr. NEME: Well, it took years of investigation, going back and forth, and a lot of trial and error to figure out what you could tell from a walrus carcass. You know, they started by doing necropsies, which are animal autopsies, on the beaches, but just getting to the carcasses was tricky. So the walrus had washed ashore over hundreds of remote miles of rocky beach, and they had to fly in, and under the best of circumstances, the beach landings were difficult. The surface would change from day to day. So you didn't know what to expect. One day, it might have small undulations and the next what they call whoop-de-dos, which are two- to three-foot crests and troughs in the gravel, and as I tell in \"Animal Investigators,\" in the first year of the investigation, they were only able to examine six out of 61 dead walrus. Plus, the necropsies didn't provide the information they'd hoped. So they needed to find another way. FLATOW: Ken, you were involved in that case, were you not? Mr. GODDARD: Yes I was. It was probably one of the more interesting crime-scene investigations I'd done. One: because, as Laurel explained, it was difficult to get there to reach the walruses. The landings were interesting. We actually lost a plane. It crashed. Nobody got hurt, but we had to wade across an Arctic stream to get to our survival gear and crime-scene gear. So this had a little extra excitement to the whole thing. Plus, the Native Americans were watching us offshore with scoped rifles, which (unintelligible) element. CONAN: Wow, that makes you a little nervous. Yeah, did you in fact ever find out who was killing the walruses? Mr. GODDARD: Well, we were able to show what had happened. The proposal was that the Native Americans had illegally taken them just for their heads. When they were questioned, they said no, it wasn't us. The Russian MIGs offshore were using the walruses for target practice, and they washed ashore all shot up and all decomposed, and therefore it wasn't a violation of the subsistence hunting just to take the ivory. So we had to go in there and try to figure it out, and it turned out the neck bones were the clue. When the heads were taken off of the walruses - that's in fact what did happen on the ice flows. The Native Americans were using their hunting rifles to kill them, and they cut the heads off and pushed the carcasses overboard. The neck bones were exposed to saltwater for about 30 days while they were down below, and it ultimately floated back up and washed ashore and baked in the sun for a couple of weeks until we showed up and cut them open. FLATOW: Hmm. And did you confront the, as they say in the movie, the perpetrators? Mr. GODDARD: Well, see, this is one of the issue of \"CSI\" that they really get wrong. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. GODDARD: And it's partly my fault. I've been an adviser to the show for a while but\u2026 FLATOW: Uh-huh. Mr. GODDARD: \u2026we tell them that they get it wrong. CSIs don't confront. We don't interrogate. We don't chase after the suspects. That's pretty much the last person we ever want to see at a crime scene. We allow the agents to do that sort of thing. FLATOW: And so, what was the outcome when the agents did it? Mr. GODDARD: Well, they confronted the elders, the group. Ultimately, I guess, in fact, Ed and I did confront in the sense that we went up to the walrus commission meeting at Point Hope four years later and presented our findings to the walrus commission. And ultimately, as we walked our way through the process, they start nodding their heads and said, yes, okay, well, we knew that was what was happening but we didn't know if you guys could tell. FLATOW: Hmm. Mr. GODDARD: And to some extent, at least for a while, it resolved the situation. FLATOW: I imagine your job must be much more difficult than regular human CSI people. Mr. GODDARD: It's a - there's a lot of differences to it. I spent my first years out in the desert of San Bernardino, digging up bodies and running the grave through a sieve. So, it wasn't like I wasn't\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. GODDAR: \u2026used to that kind of thing. But the animal twists are far more fascinating. FLATOW: And you can't ask the brother or relative, a sister or whatever, when did you last see that animal? Mr. GODDAR: Yeah, that's a problem for the detectives, the investigator. Generally, they'll have stories, you know, that they'll either try to prove or disprove. And the CSIs will be collecting evidence and get it to a laboratory to help either verify or disprove the story. Well, in the wildlife violations, you have dead animals, and if they're alive they're not talking in a real sense. FLATOW: At what point do you get called in on the case? Mr. GODDARD: Well, generally, evidence is sent to us. It's fairly rare that we would go out to a crime scene mostly because there's relatively few of us. There's 24 scientists in our lab, and we're far more effective, you know, being here at the lab with our instrumentation, working the evidence than, you know, being gone for several days out in the field. So, we put a lot of effort into training our agents, game wardens, and even - well, out in Africa, we were training African rangers on how to work animal crime scenes. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're talking about animal investigators on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Laurel Neme, who is the author of \"Animal Investigators: How the World's First Wildlife Forensics Lab Is Solving Crimes and Saving Endangered Species. \" Also, Ken Goddard, who is director of the National Fish and Wildlife Forensics Laboratory in Ashland, Oregon. How long has the lab in existence? Mr. GODDARD: We started building the lab in 1986. We started hiring in '88, and worked our first case in 1989. So, about 20 years. FLATOW: Huh. Interesting. Let's get some calls from our listeners. Ken in Kelso, Washington. Hi, Ken. KEN (Caller): Hi there. Hi, Ken Goddard. Mr. GODDARD: Hi, sir. KEN: Ken, I'd like to find out if you could describe how DNA fits in to wildlife forensics and basically the differences in the techniques that are used and the results in human DNA analysis. And I'll take my call off the air. Thanks. Mr. GODDARD: Sure. DNA is really one of the more powerful tools we have. Originally, we were using it to try to identify species. Now that we have some other techniques, hemoglobin analysis, we use DNA to individualize, to match, let's say, a gut pile at a kill site to a head on a wall, meat in a freezer, blood on the car, airplane clothing. And we also use DNA techniques where there is no blood, I guess, to identify species. An example being caviar, where we have to examine caviar shipments to see if the type of sturgeon roe in the shipment matches the permit. So, we use - we have six scientists working DNA analysis in our laboratory, and they're kept very busy. FLATOW: So, you use DNA in the caviar. Mr. GODDARD: Sure, that's our way of distinguishing the 27 species of sturgeon and one of paddlefish. FLATOW: Wow. I would never have thought about - that's why you sit there and I sit here. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. GODDARD: We didn't know about it either when we were first - it was first proposed to us. FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. GODDARD: We were told that CITES, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, was getting ready to list the sturgeon and were we ready to make the identifications? And we weren't. So, we had a pretty rapid research process on our hands. FLATOW: Dr. Neme, what do you find most fascinating about this work? Dr. NEME: Well, I think it goes - it's fascinating because of the CSI aspect, but it's also fascinating what it can do for wildlife trafficking and conservation more generally. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. NEME: And I think, you know, you take - one of the - you take DNA and one of the things that's interesting about DNA is that it can also identify when a animal is captive-bred versus wild-caught. And there's a loophole in the law that allows people to own and possess captive-bred animals like birds, pet birds or reptiles. And if you have the parents, you can figure out whether the offspring is captive-bred and, therefore, legal, whereas\u2026 FLATOW: Hmm. Dr. NEME: \u2026it can be used to help prevent wild-caught species from getting into the legal market. FLATOW: So you can trace back where the bird may have originated from? Dr. NEME: Correct, if you have the parents. I think one of the issues with DNA is that it's very powerful, but you also need something to compare it to. FLATOW: I see. Dr. NEME: And for that, I think the lab needs a very robust collection of reference specimens and it depends on\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. NEME: \u2026what the species is as to whether it has that. Like, for instance, for reptiles, it's very difficult because the lab currently, its database has 100 amphibian and reptile species, but there are over 8,700 species of reptiles that it could possibly have. So that's one of the limitations. FLATOW: Yeah. That's something - you got to get your library bigger. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. GODDARD: Laurel was actually explaining another CSI response we did where we went out and took blood from several hundred macaws. And it ended up to be a pretty bloody adventure on our part. We ended up deafened and pretty much torn apart by these birds. We were trying very hard not to hurt them, but they fought back. FLATOW: I think some TV producer must be listening. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Stay with us. We have to take a short break. We'll come back and talk a lots more about the CSI with Ken Goddard and Laurel Neme, author of \"Animal Investigators. \" Also, bring on another guest who's - who'll talk - who is a special agent, so he'll tell us about some stories he has. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY at NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking with Daniel Fisher, professor of geological sciences and curator of the Museum of Paleontology, University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Also, Laurel Neme, author of the book \"Animal Investigations. \" And talking about the wildlife forensic lab, joining us now is Sal Amato, a special agent in charge of the Northeast region for the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement in Hadley, Massachusetts. Welcome to the show, Mr. Amato. Mr. SAL AMATO (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement): Thank you. Good afternoon. FLATOW: Good afternoon. I understand that you went undercover as a special agent a few years ago having to deal with abalone poaching. Is that right? Mr. AMATO: Yes, actually. But my time when I was working abalone poachers was actually when I was working with the state of California. Prior to coming on with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, I was a game warden out in California. And I did some of my time with their special operations unit, went undercover, did some work with them on - in the central coast trying to tackle a problem that the state was having with abalone poachers. FLATOW: Hah. So you had - what kind of experience do you need for that kind of work? Mr. AMATO: Well, in a lot of ways, it's trial by fire. You learn on the job. Hopefully we did. In California, we had a cadre of some pretty senior officers that had some experience and could pass that on to the younger guys. But - and that's really how that type of thing goes. You're learning how to, you know, there is some, you know, formal training you can go to, but a lot of what you learn to be an effective covert officer is just on the job and trying to\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. AMATO: \u2026find creative ways to fit in. FLATOW: Do you have to set up a sting like you do with people? Mr. AMATO: It depends on what part of the trade you're trying to, you know, tackle, whether it's the actual poacher, you know, taking the animal or you're trying to tackle the, you know, the stores or the wholesalers that are moving, you know, causing the demand and moving the product. So, it really depends. And, you know, frankly, some of the most successful operations tackle the whole trade from, you know, the people that are involved in the take to the people that are involved in the transportation, and then again\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. AMATO: \u2026the companies or people that are involved in causing the demands in the beginning. FLATOW: You cover a lot of territory, the whole Northeast. Mr. AMATO: I do. We have agents and wildlife inspectors spread throughout 13 states in the Northeast, and we're spread pretty thin. You know, we only have about 35 special agents to cover that area and less than that inspectors. FLATOW: And what kind of cases would you have going on at the same time there? Mr. AMATO: It's a unique part of our job is that you really never know what you're going to get involved in, especially when you throw in, you know, the largest wildlife park in the nation in New York. We can get involved in quite a bit with international trade, everything from ivory to, you know, rhino horns, some live reptile trade. Our investigators get involved in, you know, trying to protect critical habitat for endangered species in the Northeast. FLATOW: Right. Mr. AMATO: It really varies. We get involved in so much, and that's why this job is never dull because you never know what you're going to be dealing with. FLATOW: We always hear about exotic birds escaping from JFK or something. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. AMATO: You know, we try to make sure that that doesn't happen. But exotic birds do come in and out of there quite a bit. Some of that is completely lawful if done with the right permits and under the right circumstances. But obviously, some of it comes in hair curlers and smuggled, and we try to address that and curb it to the best extent we can. FLATOW: Also with me is Ken Goddard, director of the National Fish and Wildlife Forensic Lab, and Laurel Neme, who is author of the book \"Animal Investigators. \" Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Some interesting phone calls. Let's go to Carol(ph) in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Hi, Carol. CAROL (Caller): Hi, Ira. FLATOW: Hi there. CAROL: In Indian country here, there's a huge black market in bald eagle feathers. A couple of years ago, NPR did a one-line story, and I never heard anything else about it, about a hiker in British Columbia who had found 40 dead remains of bald eagles there. And when I mentioned it to one of the tribal people I know, he laughed and he said, well, come to a - come to any powwow and you can probably see where those feathers wound up. So, is it - what do you do? How do you penetrate something that has that cache of cultural purity? FLATOW: Interesting question. Let me ask Sal. Do you have any suggestions for that? Mr. AMATO: Well, that is a very complex and frankly controversial topic. You know, we are juggling the rights of Native Americans to practice their religion, and their religion may involve the use of migratory bird and eagle feathers. Dr. NEME: Religion, huh? Mr. AMATO: We're also balancing that - you know, that doesn't include the commercialization of those types of things. And when people get involved with the sale of them, we try to, you know, take on that challenge. It is a challenge. It's one that we are - we actively work. You know, it's more prevalent in certain parts of the country where, you know, frankly these powwows and these - the Native American get-togethers are more prevalent than in the Northeast. But it is an issue. It's a complex issue for us, but it's one that we do try to take on. FLATOW: Laurel, any comments on that? Dr. NEME: Yeah. I mean, this issue of a lot of times the law lets Native Americans or indigenous people have special rights. And oftentimes, that special right is exploited by traffickers. Animal investigators tell the story about how U. S. collectors of feathered artifacts ultimately spurred a huge trafficking ring in Brazil. And basically, that trafficking ring in Brazil met foreign demand by making grocery lists of animal parts and then hiring poachers to go ahead and fill them. And then they'd collect these parts and make these so-called genuine artifacts. And it still goes on today. And really, collectors of reptiles, of birds, of feathers, they always want more. They want it bigger, better and rarer. And they'll overlook the source in order to possess the object. FLATOW: A Tweet came in from TBowShop(ph), who writes, is there a botanical equivalent of crime forensics to go along with the human and animal? Mr. GODDARD: Well, there is ginseng. That certainly is something that agents like Sal would investigate and possibly send to us to identify, you know, is it a protected species or not. At some point, we may get into wood smuggling. The lumber industry coming out of South America, there is lot of different possibilities. FLATOW: Could there be anything in orchids? Smuggling orchids or something like that? Mr. GODDARD: I'll defer to Sal on that one. FLATOW: Sal? Mr. AMATO: Yeah. We have worked - successfully investigated and prosecuted some illegally traded orchids in the past. They do present challenges. Our lab isn't completely set up to deal with all the plant issues that may be out there. But we, I'm sure it's been mentioned, we try to, you know, increase the capability of what the lab can do for us and take on those types of issues. FLATOW: Jane(ph) in Corvallis, Oregon. Hi, Jane. JANE (Caller): Hi. Thank you for letting me call in. FLATOW: Go ahead. JANE: Well, I am director for Oregon Cougar Action Team. It's a brand new not-for-profit here, new organ. It's an educational foundation, whereas I go in to schools and give PowerPoint presentations telling people about cougar and how to coexist fear-free with them in order to teach people to deal with their differences, both as animals and humans, in a more constructive way. Currently, in Oregon, they are trying to reintroduce hound hunting with cougar. And in the process of this, I've seen some what I would consider unethical practices in order to create a false hysteria and a false concern that we have a cougar issue here in Oregon. In one of my presentations last year in Silverton, Oregon\u2026 FLATOW: Wait, Jane, I got to ask you, is there a question here? JANE: There is. FLATOW: I have to get\u2026 JANE: It's kind of hard to talk about the\u2026 FLATOW: We have to get to it because we're running out of time here. JANE: Okay. Well, I am concerned that there is a traffic issue of cougar parts here in Oregon as well as cubs that are being used to exploit an issue of having a cougar trauma issue. We've got a young cougar running around - running around Corvallis that appears to be planted here, domesticated, and unfamiliar with how to care for itself in the wilderness. At the same time, we have a potential of a House bill coming through\u2026 FLATOW: Jane, I'm going to have to cut off because I got to go to another call because I need a question related there. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Jason(ph) in Syracuse. Hi, Jason. JASON (Caller): Hi. FLATOW: Hi there. JASON: My question, I can't help but thinking about \"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\" when I hear this conversation, the movie. And I was wondering if you guys ever deal with cases that involve maybe missing animals, like, missing exotic animals as opposed to just dead animals? And I'll take my answer off the air. Thanks. FLATOW: Do you get called that, Sal, anytime? Mr. AMATO: Missing animals? No, I can't say that I've ever heard of a case like that. You know, occasionally, some of the animals that we do deal with are so rare, you know, the sphinx macaw that we dealt with not too long ago that - I'm going to misquote, it was one of only 12 left in the wild. So the Brazilian authorities were very interested in the whereabouts of that bird, and we ended up repatriating that bird to Brazil. So sometimes you can get involved in a case where, whether it's a missing animal or not, you know, it obviously means a great deal to the sustainability and continuation of that species. And we, you know, we got that bird back to Brazil, and hopefully a good outcome there. Mr. GODDARD: Ira, one thing that we're trying to do with the laboratory, hopefully to make Sal's job easier, is called stable isotopes. If we can get this worked out, we're going to be able to tell Sal and his agents where an animal was born, where it was raised, based on the stable isotopes that came up from the soils, into the grasses, into the food supply. FLATOW: Wow. That's quite interesting. Do you get involved in any species preservation at all? Mr. GODDARD: Us? FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. GODDARD: We tend to just work the evidence. We don't engage with the habitat other than just sort of violation of wildlife law. Mr. AMATO: We do get involved in protection of habitat or - you know, we look at our role in enforcing the Endangered Species Act. It, you know, goes a long way towards preservation of species and helps with those plans to recover endangered species. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's go Ed(ph) in Portland, Oregon. Hi, Ed. ED (Caller): Hi. How are you doing? FLATOW: Hi there. ED: In some jurisdictions, a criminalist is a sworn officer rather than a civilian employee of the police department. In a situation like that, wouldn't the criminalist have the authority to confront a suspect in a criminal situation? Mr. GODDARD: Crime scene investigators as opposed to - criminalist is a title for a scientist in the laboratory. Ideally, we don't have to be armed in the lab. Crime scene investigators often are armed for their own protection, not to make arrests, not to deliberately engage with the bad guy. Ideally, there - you got officers around to protect the crime scenes. And that's the way we work here in the Fish and Wildlife Service. If I were to go out to a scene, Sal and some of his agents would be there to keep things quiet and peaceful. FLATOW: Well, let me just remind everybody that this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, talking about crime scene investigation for animals, which tells me, Laurel, that this is still a really big business, big trafficking problem. Dr. NEME: It's a huge business. And that's because the animals are so profitable. And what's interesting is that it's not just the poaching but really the demand side that's important because some of these animals are worth more than cocaine, more than, you know, drugs. A woman just a couple of weeks ago in Los Angeles was arrested with a kilo, that's 2. 2 pounds, of bear bile with a street value of about $40,000. And that's more than cocaine, which is about 30,000. And rhino horn is worth even more, which about 50,000 per kilo. And what that's done is that's gotten almost everybody to get in on the game. So depending on the species, you have a lot of organized crime networks getting involved and using the same networks that they might use for drug trafficking, for wildlife trafficking. And in fact, again, a couple of weeks ago, there was a human trafficking case in Brazil, and that led over time to the wildlife - the biggest wildlife trafficking ring bust ever in Brazil, which was trafficking macaws. And there were over 100 people arrested for illegally smuggling $20 million worth of animals per year, and trafficking about half a million animals per year. FLATOW: Wow. Let me get a question in, if I can, from Alice(ph) in South Bend. Hi, Alice. Quickly, please. ALICE (Caller): Hi. I was just wondering, if was interested in to going to this field, what course of study should I take or schools that would be good? Mr. GODDARD: If you want to get into the science, just good basic biology, chemistry, get your bachelor's degree. Wildlife forensic science is basically learned on the job. Sal can address the investigator part. Mr. AMATO: Yeah. We, you know, we look for people that are grounded in biology and certainly have a passion for, you know, wildlife and conservation. You know, we do take people from schools that are, you know, studying criminal justice as well. So, really, you know, we need a kind of a mix of both, somebody who's got the law enforcement mentality but also has a passion for wildlife. So we're looking for a mix in our staffing. FLATOW: Do you have job openings? Mr. AMATO: Yes. We - just with turnover, we have to almost consistently, you know, keep hiring to keep up with our retirees. And we look to put a class - we, usually, we put a class on of about 24 agents every other year. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And the most important, the most - the biggest skill you need is what? Mr. AMATO: Well, you know, frankly, we are - we don't really hire entry-level. We're looking for journeyman level, investigators that come from other agencies or, you know, come from our own ranks as wildlife inspectors or refuge officers or state officers. So, we look for somebody that's normally had, you know, between three and five years experience doing this type of work. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So you can retrain them just to be another kind of specialist from what they used to be. Mr. AMATO: Exactly. FLATOW: But they need some investigation experience? Mr. AMATO: Right. FLATOW: All right. It's quite fascinating. I want to thank all of you for taking time to be with us today. Mr. GODDARD: Glad to. Mr. AMATO: Glad to be here. FLATOW: You're welcome. Dr. NEME: Thank you very much. FLATOW: Good luck on your book. Laurel Neme is author of the book \"Animal Investigators: How the World's First Wildlife Forensic Lab is Solving Crimes and Saving Endangered Species. \" And Ken Goddard is director of the National Fish and Wildlife Forensics Lab in Ashland, Oregon. And Sal Amato is special agent in charge of the Northeast region for the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. That's the Office of Law Enforcement in Hadley. And he's accepting resumes. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Have a great weekend. Thanks for being with us. Mr. AMATO: Take care. Mr. GODDARD: Thanks, Ira. FLATOW: You're welcome. Dr. NEME: Thank you.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow.  We've all seen those CSI detective shows. They're all over the place on TV. They usually involve some homo sapiens lying on the ground, or in a bed, or someplace in a pool of blood. But you know, there is a whole other world of CSI that you hardly ever get to see on TV, and that's wildlife CSI - crimes involving animals, where the victims have hooves or tusks or feathers, and the witnesses never talk, but they might crow.  And so for the rest of the hour, the world of illegal animal trafficking, where bear gallbladders, ounce for ounce, cost more than cocaine. Forensic teams fly to remote regions in Alaska to investigate beaches littered with beheaded walruses. Now that's a CSI show.  These crime scene scientists have to actually develop methods on the fly, like the protocol for a walrus autopsy; or the unique DNA signature in bear bile. Say that three times.  It's a world where undercover agents buy vials of crushed tiger bone or pounds of caviar to get in there tight with the criminals. And there's only one forensic lab in the whole world that handles this stuff, and the director of that lab is here to talk about it, and he's one of my two guests. Let me introduce them. Ken Goddard is the director of the National Fish and Wildlife Laboratory in Ashland, Oregon, Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Mr. KEN GODDARD (National Fish and Wildlife Service Forensics Laboratory): Thank you, Ira.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Laurel Neme is the author of the book \"Animal Investigators: How the World's First Wildlife Forensic Lab is Solving Crimes and Saving Endangered Species. \" Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Dr. LAUREL NEME (Author): Thank you.  FLATOW: Dr. Goddard, how'd you get involved in this?  Mr. GODDARD: First of all, I'm not a doctor. I got to a masters degree. I was running a police crime lab when I got the opportunity to set up a crime lab for wildlife. I'd been a homicide investigator, a crime-scene investigation, did all the homo-sapiens type of investigations, and this just seemed intriguing.  FLATOW: And Dr. Neme, you are a doctor.  Dr. NEME: I am a Ph. D. type.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: And what was your motivation for writing this book?  Dr. NEME: Well, I'd been working in the field for about 10 years, going back and forth to Africa, working on natural-resource management, and one day I was talking to this Tanzanian game warden about a 10-year-old case where poachers had scattered these tainted pumpkins around watering holes, and then the elephants would eat them and die.  And at first they didn't know what was happening to these elephants, why they were dying, if it was a new cause, you know, a new disease or whatnot, but all of them were missing their tusks. And it turned out that this game warden had done training at the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service Forensic Lab, and with the help of that lab and subsequence investigation, they discovered that poachers were, in fact, poisoning these pumpkins, and they did that so that they could slide out the tusks instead of hacking them out of the elephant.  And in the middle of our conversation, the phone rings. And when he hangs up, he tells me that they just found a bunch of hippos who'd been poisoned in the very same manner for their ivory teeth. And I realized two things, one that this poisoning for profit was not going to stop, and secondly that this lab was having an impact 10 years later in this hippo case because it was giving them a lot of clues to the method of the poachers, even though it wasn't directly involved. So that's when I started investigating the cases.  FLATOW: So is it actually possible to go to the crime scene there and use all the clues and figure out who the poachers are?  Dr. NEME: It is, it is, especially once you start knowing what to look for.  FLATOW: Uh-huh, and it's not the kind of stuff we're normally thinking about.  Dr. NEME: No because at first, they weren't looking at all at the pumpkins. They were just looking at the animals and thinking they had a new disease on their hand.  FLATOW: Dr. Goddard, what is the difference? What is the transition like from moving from human CSI to animal CSI?  Mr. GODDARD: There isn't a lot of difference. You know, all crime labs do basically the same thing. We examine evidence in a triangular fashion. We try to link suspect, victim and crime scene together. The real difference in our case is our victim is a non-human animal, and we have to figure out what it is first to determine what type of crime has been committed.  Lots of variations, you know: time of day, was it legal to hunt this animal, is this animal a hybrid, in which case it might be perfectly legal to kill it. What time of day was it killed in terms of hunting season? What kind of weapon? So things you don't run into in a normal homicide investigation.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number if you'd like to talk about the animal CSI. Give me an example of what a typical case would be like.  Mr. GODDARD: Oh, the typical case for us ranges from anything from a feather coming in to hundreds of samples of caviar for possible smuggling, poaching or just illegal commercialization; Asian medicinals coming in from China, Southeast Asia, containing perhaps rhino horn, tiger-bone potions; deer or elk, moose meat; wolf possibly killed by a rancher, possibly going after sheep; just dozens and dozens of variations on a theme.  FLATOW: It seems, Dr. Neme, that you must have had lots of cases, then, to choose from. How did you choose which ones to put in your book?  Dr. NEME: You're absolutely right. I had hundreds to choose from. And I actually started with the science and talking with Ken and others at the lab about what scientifically were the most interesting cases from their perspective. I also was trying to look for cases that featured different parts of the lab - so pathology, morphology, chemistry - and also cases that had different outcomes. Because really what's powerful about the science is that the science is neutral. And you analyze the evidence, and it doesn't really matter what the outcome is. The evidence is the evidence.  And I think that I wanted to show that by having - also selecting cases where the outcomes could be quite different.  FLATOW: Give me an example of your favorite case.  Dr. NEME: There was a case involving hundreds of headless walrus washing up on the beaches of northwest Alaska. And what's interesting is that the legal question here was not whether it was a protected species or not, or even who did it - to match a suspect to the actual killing - but rather if there was a pattern of illegal hunting.  And the law is such that the Marine Mammal Protection Act allows Native Alaskans to hunt walrus, provided they do so for subsistence and not in a wasteful manner. And taking just the tusks may or may not be illegal. You know, the walrus could be lost during a hunt, or perhaps it died naturally and then washed ashore, and then the tusks would be the only thing that could be salvaged.  So taking them wouldn't be illegal. Or else the weather might have turned while hunters were on the ice, and they took the quickest thing that they could so that the whole hunt wouldn't be lost, and that wouldn't be illegal, either. But here the lab was asked to see if someone shot the walrus, solely for their tusks and didn't attempt to retrieve anything else but that they could have - and that would've been a crime. And so the lab was called in, in essence, to discern the intent of the hunters.  FLATOW: And was there, like, a break in the case at some point that just helped you solve the case?  Dr. NEME: Well, it took years of investigation, going back and forth, and a lot of trial and error to figure out what you could tell from a walrus carcass. You know, they started by doing necropsies, which are animal autopsies, on the beaches, but just getting to the carcasses was tricky.  So the walrus had washed ashore over hundreds of remote miles of rocky beach, and they had to fly in, and under the best of circumstances, the beach landings were difficult. The surface would change from day to day. So you didn't know what to expect.  One day, it might have small undulations and the next what they call whoop-de-dos, which are two- to three-foot crests and troughs in the gravel, and as I tell in \"Animal Investigators,\" in the first year of the investigation, they were only able to examine six out of 61 dead walrus. Plus, the necropsies didn't provide the information they'd hoped. So they needed to find another way.  FLATOW: Ken, you were involved in that case, were you not?  Mr. GODDARD: Yes I was. It was probably one of the more interesting crime-scene investigations I'd done. One: because, as Laurel explained, it was difficult to get there to reach the walruses. The landings were interesting. We actually lost a plane. It crashed. Nobody got hurt, but we had to wade across an Arctic stream to get to our survival gear and crime-scene gear.  So this had a little extra excitement to the whole thing. Plus, the Native Americans were watching us offshore with scoped rifles, which (unintelligible) element.  CONAN: Wow, that makes you a little nervous. Yeah, did you in fact ever find out who was killing the walruses?  Mr. GODDARD: Well, we were able to show what had happened. The proposal was that the Native Americans had illegally taken them just for their heads. When they were questioned, they said no, it wasn't us. The Russian MIGs offshore were using the walruses for target practice, and they washed ashore all shot up and all decomposed, and therefore it wasn't a violation of the subsistence hunting just to take the ivory.  So we had to go in there and try to figure it out, and it turned out the neck bones were the clue. When the heads were taken off of the walruses - that's in fact what did happen on the ice flows. The Native Americans were using their hunting rifles to kill them, and they cut the heads off and pushed the carcasses overboard.  The neck bones were exposed to saltwater for about 30 days while they were down below, and it ultimately floated back up and washed ashore and baked in the sun for a couple of weeks until we showed up and cut them open.  FLATOW: Hmm. And did you confront the, as they say in the movie, the perpetrators?  Mr. GODDARD: Well, see, this is one of the issue of \"CSI\" that they really get wrong.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. GODDARD: And it's partly my fault. I've been an adviser to the show for a while but\u2026  FLATOW: Uh-huh.  Mr. GODDARD: \u2026we tell them that they get it wrong. CSIs don't confront. We don't interrogate. We don't chase after the suspects. That's pretty much the last person we ever want to see at a crime scene. We allow the agents to do that sort of thing.  FLATOW: And so, what was the outcome when the agents did it?  Mr. GODDARD: Well, they confronted the elders, the group. Ultimately, I guess, in fact, Ed and I did confront in the sense that we went up to the walrus commission meeting at Point Hope four years later and presented our findings to the walrus commission. And ultimately, as we walked our way through the process, they start nodding their heads and said, yes, okay, well, we knew that was what was happening but we didn't know if you guys could tell.  FLATOW: Hmm.  Mr. GODDARD: And to some extent, at least for a while, it resolved the situation.  FLATOW: I imagine your job must be much more difficult than regular human CSI people.  Mr. GODDARD: It's a - there's a lot of differences to it. I spent my first years out in the desert of San Bernardino, digging up bodies and running the grave through a sieve. So, it wasn't like I wasn't\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  Mr. GODDAR: \u2026used to that kind of thing. But the animal twists are far more fascinating.  FLATOW: And you can't ask the brother or relative, a sister or whatever, when did you last see that animal?  Mr. GODDAR: Yeah, that's a problem for the detectives, the investigator. Generally, they'll have stories, you know, that they'll either try to prove or disprove. And the CSIs will be collecting evidence and get it to a laboratory to help either verify or disprove the story. Well, in the wildlife violations, you have dead animals, and if they're alive they're not talking in a real sense.  FLATOW: At what point do you get called in on the case?  Mr. GODDARD: Well, generally, evidence is sent to us. It's fairly rare that we would go out to a crime scene mostly because there's relatively few of us. There's 24 scientists in our lab, and we're far more effective, you know, being here at the lab with our instrumentation, working the evidence than, you know, being gone for several days out in the field.  So, we put a lot of effort into training our agents, game wardens, and even - well, out in Africa, we were training African rangers on how to work animal crime scenes.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're talking about animal investigators on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Laurel Neme, who is the author of \"Animal Investigators: How the World's First Wildlife Forensics Lab Is Solving Crimes and Saving Endangered Species. \" Also, Ken Goddard, who is director of the National Fish and Wildlife Forensics Laboratory in Ashland, Oregon. How long has the lab in existence?  Mr. GODDARD: We started building the lab in 1986. We started hiring in '88, and worked our first case in 1989. So, about 20 years.  FLATOW: Huh. Interesting. Let's get some calls from our listeners. Ken in Kelso, Washington. Hi, Ken.  KEN (Caller): Hi there. Hi, Ken Goddard.  Mr. GODDARD: Hi, sir.  KEN: Ken, I'd like to find out if you could describe how DNA fits in to wildlife forensics and basically the differences in the techniques that are used and the results in human DNA analysis. And I'll take my call off the air. Thanks.  Mr. GODDARD: Sure. DNA is really one of the more powerful tools we have. Originally, we were using it to try to identify species. Now that we have some other techniques, hemoglobin analysis, we use DNA to individualize, to match, let's say, a gut pile at a kill site to a head on a wall, meat in a freezer, blood on the car, airplane clothing.  And we also use DNA techniques where there is no blood, I guess, to identify species. An example being caviar, where we have to examine caviar shipments to see if the type of sturgeon roe in the shipment matches the permit. So, we use - we have six scientists working DNA analysis in our laboratory, and they're kept very busy.  FLATOW: So, you use DNA in the caviar.  Mr. GODDARD: Sure, that's our way of distinguishing the 27 species of sturgeon and one of paddlefish.  FLATOW: Wow. I would never have thought about - that's why you sit there and I sit here.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. GODDARD: We didn't know about it either when we were first - it was first proposed to us.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Mr. GODDARD: We were told that CITES, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, was getting ready to list the sturgeon and were we ready to make the identifications? And we weren't. So, we had a pretty rapid research process on our hands.  FLATOW: Dr. Neme, what do you find most fascinating about this work?  Dr. NEME: Well, I think it goes - it's fascinating because of the CSI aspect, but it's also fascinating what it can do for wildlife trafficking and conservation more generally.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. NEME: And I think, you know, you take - one of the - you take DNA and one of the things that's interesting about DNA is that it can also identify when a animal is captive-bred versus wild-caught. And there's a loophole in the law that allows people to own and possess captive-bred animals like birds, pet birds or reptiles. And if you have the parents, you can figure out whether the offspring is captive-bred and, therefore, legal, whereas\u2026  FLATOW: Hmm.  Dr. NEME: \u2026it can be used to help prevent wild-caught species from getting into the legal market.  FLATOW: So you can trace back where the bird may have originated from?  Dr. NEME: Correct, if you have the parents. I think one of the issues with DNA is that it's very powerful, but you also need something to compare it to.  FLATOW: I see.  Dr. NEME: And for that, I think the lab needs a very robust collection of reference specimens and it depends on\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. NEME: \u2026what the species is as to whether it has that. Like, for instance, for reptiles, it's very difficult because the lab currently, its database has 100 amphibian and reptile species, but there are over 8,700 species of reptiles that it could possibly have. So that's one of the limitations.  FLATOW: Yeah. That's something - you got to get your library bigger.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. GODDARD: Laurel was actually explaining another CSI response we did where we went out and took blood from several hundred macaws. And it ended up to be a pretty bloody adventure on our part. We ended up deafened and pretty much torn apart by these birds. We were trying very hard not to hurt them, but they fought back.  FLATOW: I think some TV producer must be listening.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Stay with us. We have to take a short break. We'll come back and talk a lots more about the CSI with Ken Goddard and Laurel Neme, author of \"Animal Investigators. \" Also, bring on another guest who's - who'll talk - who is a special agent, so he'll tell us about some stories he has. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY at NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking with Daniel Fisher, professor of geological sciences and curator of the Museum of Paleontology, University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Also, Laurel Neme, author of the book \"Animal Investigations. \" And talking about the wildlife forensic lab, joining us now is Sal Amato, a special agent in charge of the Northeast region for the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement in Hadley, Massachusetts. Welcome to the show, Mr. Amato.  Mr. SAL AMATO (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement): Thank you. Good afternoon.  FLATOW: Good afternoon. I understand that you went undercover as a special agent a few years ago having to deal with abalone poaching. Is that right?  Mr. AMATO: Yes, actually. But my time when I was working abalone poachers was actually when I was working with the state of California. Prior to coming on with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, I was a game warden out in California. And I did some of my time with their special operations unit, went undercover, did some work with them on - in the central coast trying to tackle a problem that the state was having with abalone poachers.  FLATOW: Hah. So you had - what kind of experience do you need for that kind of work?  Mr. AMATO: Well, in a lot of ways, it's trial by fire. You learn on the job. Hopefully we did. In California, we had a cadre of some pretty senior officers that had some experience and could pass that on to the younger guys. But - and that's really how that type of thing goes. You're learning how to, you know, there is some, you know, formal training you can go to, but a lot of what you learn to be an effective covert officer is just on the job and trying to\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  Mr. AMATO: \u2026find creative ways to fit in.  FLATOW: Do you have to set up a sting like you do with people?  Mr. AMATO: It depends on what part of the trade you're trying to, you know, tackle, whether it's the actual poacher, you know, taking the animal or you're trying to tackle the, you know, the stores or the wholesalers that are moving, you know, causing the demand and moving the product. So, it really depends.  And, you know, frankly, some of the most successful operations tackle the whole trade from, you know, the people that are involved in the take to the people that are involved in the transportation, and then again\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  Mr. AMATO: \u2026the companies or people that are involved in causing the demands in the beginning.  FLATOW: You cover a lot of territory, the whole Northeast.  Mr. AMATO: I do. We have agents and wildlife inspectors spread throughout 13 states in the Northeast, and we're spread pretty thin. You know, we only have about 35 special agents to cover that area and less than that inspectors.  FLATOW: And what kind of cases would you have going on at the same time there?  Mr. AMATO: It's a unique part of our job is that you really never know what you're going to get involved in, especially when you throw in, you know, the largest wildlife park in the nation in New York. We can get involved in quite a bit with international trade, everything from ivory to, you know, rhino horns, some live reptile trade. Our investigators get involved in, you know, trying to protect critical habitat for endangered species in the Northeast.  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. AMATO: It really varies. We get involved in so much, and that's why this job is never dull because you never know what you're going to be dealing with.  FLATOW: We always hear about exotic birds escaping from JFK or something.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. AMATO: You know, we try to make sure that that doesn't happen. But exotic birds do come in and out of there quite a bit. Some of that is completely lawful if done with the right permits and under the right circumstances. But obviously, some of it comes in hair curlers and smuggled, and we try to address that and curb it to the best extent we can.  FLATOW: Also with me is Ken Goddard, director of the National Fish and Wildlife Forensic Lab, and Laurel Neme, who is author of the book \"Animal Investigators. \" Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Some interesting phone calls. Let's go to Carol(ph) in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Hi, Carol.  CAROL (Caller): Hi, Ira.  FLATOW: Hi there.  CAROL: In Indian country here, there's a huge black market in bald eagle feathers. A couple of years ago, NPR did a one-line story, and I never heard anything else about it, about a hiker in British Columbia who had found 40 dead remains of bald eagles there.  And when I mentioned it to one of the tribal people I know, he laughed and he said, well, come to a - come to any powwow and you can probably see where those feathers wound up. So, is it - what do you do? How do you penetrate something that has that cache of cultural purity?  FLATOW: Interesting question. Let me ask Sal. Do you have any suggestions for that?  Mr. AMATO: Well, that is a very complex and frankly controversial topic. You know, we are juggling the rights of Native Americans to practice their religion, and their religion may involve the use of migratory bird and eagle feathers.  Dr. NEME: Religion, huh?  Mr. AMATO: We're also balancing that - you know, that doesn't include the commercialization of those types of things. And when people get involved with the sale of them, we try to, you know, take on that challenge.  It is a challenge. It's one that we are - we actively work. You know, it's more prevalent in certain parts of the country where, you know, frankly these powwows and these - the Native American get-togethers are more prevalent than in the Northeast. But it is an issue. It's a complex issue for us, but it's one that we do try to take on.  FLATOW: Laurel, any comments on that?  Dr. NEME: Yeah. I mean, this issue of a lot of times the law lets Native Americans or indigenous people have special rights. And oftentimes, that special right is exploited by traffickers. Animal investigators tell the story about how U. S. collectors of feathered artifacts ultimately spurred a huge trafficking ring in Brazil. And basically, that trafficking ring in Brazil met foreign demand by making grocery lists of animal parts and then hiring poachers to go ahead and fill them.  And then they'd collect these parts and make these so-called genuine artifacts. And it still goes on today. And really, collectors of reptiles, of birds, of feathers, they always want more. They want it bigger, better and rarer. And they'll overlook the source in order to possess the object.  FLATOW: A Tweet came in from TBowShop(ph), who writes, is there a botanical equivalent of crime forensics to go along with the human and animal?  Mr. GODDARD: Well, there is ginseng. That certainly is something that agents like Sal would investigate and possibly send to us to identify, you know, is it a protected species or not. At some point, we may get into wood smuggling. The lumber industry coming out of South America, there is lot of different possibilities.  FLATOW: Could there be anything in orchids? Smuggling orchids or something like that?  Mr. GODDARD: I'll defer to Sal on that one.  FLATOW: Sal?  Mr. AMATO: Yeah. We have worked - successfully investigated and prosecuted some illegally traded orchids in the past. They do present challenges. Our lab isn't completely set up to deal with all the plant issues that may be out there. But we, I'm sure it's been mentioned, we try to, you know, increase the capability of what the lab can do for us and take on those types of issues.  FLATOW: Jane(ph) in Corvallis, Oregon. Hi, Jane.  JANE (Caller): Hi. Thank you for letting me call in.  FLATOW: Go ahead.  JANE: Well, I am director for Oregon Cougar Action Team. It's a brand new not-for-profit here, new organ. It's an educational foundation, whereas I go in to schools and give PowerPoint presentations telling people about cougar and how to coexist fear-free with them in order to teach people to deal with their differences, both as animals and humans, in a more constructive way.  Currently, in Oregon, they are trying to reintroduce hound hunting with cougar. And in the process of this, I've seen some what I would consider unethical practices in order to create a false hysteria and a false concern that we have a cougar issue here in Oregon. In one of my presentations last year in Silverton, Oregon\u2026  FLATOW: Wait, Jane, I got to ask you, is there a question here?  JANE: There is.  FLATOW: I have to get\u2026  JANE: It's kind of hard to talk about the\u2026  FLATOW: We have to get to it because we're running out of time here.  JANE: Okay. Well, I am concerned that there is a traffic issue of cougar parts here in Oregon as well as cubs that are being used to exploit an issue of having a cougar trauma issue. We've got a young cougar running around - running around Corvallis that appears to be planted here, domesticated, and unfamiliar with how to care for itself in the wilderness. At the same time, we have a potential of a House bill coming through\u2026  FLATOW: Jane, I'm going to have to cut off because I got to go to another call because I need a question related there. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Jason(ph) in Syracuse. Hi, Jason.  JASON (Caller): Hi.  FLATOW: Hi there.  JASON: My question, I can't help but thinking about \"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\" when I hear this conversation, the movie. And I was wondering if you guys ever deal with cases that involve maybe missing animals, like, missing exotic animals as opposed to just dead animals? And I'll take my answer off the air. Thanks.  FLATOW: Do you get called that, Sal, anytime?  Mr. AMATO: Missing animals? No, I can't say that I've ever heard of a case like that. You know, occasionally, some of the animals that we do deal with are so rare, you know, the sphinx macaw that we dealt with not too long ago that - I'm going to misquote, it was one of only 12 left in the wild. So the Brazilian authorities were very interested in the whereabouts of that bird, and we ended up repatriating that bird to Brazil.  So sometimes you can get involved in a case where, whether it's a missing animal or not, you know, it obviously means a great deal to the sustainability and continuation of that species. And we, you know, we got that bird back to Brazil, and hopefully a good outcome there.  Mr. GODDARD: Ira, one thing that we're trying to do with the laboratory, hopefully to make Sal's job easier, is called stable isotopes. If we can get this worked out, we're going to be able to tell Sal and his agents where an animal was born, where it was raised, based on the stable isotopes that came up from the soils, into the grasses, into the food supply.  FLATOW: Wow. That's quite interesting. Do you get involved in any species preservation at all?  Mr. GODDARD: Us?  FLATOW: Yeah.  Mr. GODDARD: We tend to just work the evidence. We don't engage with the habitat other than just sort of violation of wildlife law.  Mr. AMATO: We do get involved in protection of habitat or - you know, we look at our role in enforcing the Endangered Species Act. It, you know, goes a long way towards preservation of species and helps with those plans to recover endangered species.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's go Ed(ph) in Portland, Oregon. Hi, Ed.  ED (Caller): Hi. How are you doing?  FLATOW: Hi there.  ED: In some jurisdictions, a criminalist is a sworn officer rather than a civilian employee of the police department. In a situation like that, wouldn't the criminalist have the authority to confront a suspect in a criminal situation?  Mr. GODDARD: Crime scene investigators as opposed to - criminalist is a title for a scientist in the laboratory. Ideally, we don't have to be armed in the lab. Crime scene investigators often are armed for their own protection, not to make arrests, not to deliberately engage with the bad guy.  Ideally, there - you got officers around to protect the crime scenes. And that's the way we work here in the Fish and Wildlife Service. If I were to go out to a scene, Sal and some of his agents would be there to keep things quiet and peaceful.  FLATOW: Well, let me just remind everybody that this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, talking about crime scene investigation for animals, which tells me, Laurel, that this is still a really big business, big trafficking problem.  Dr. NEME: It's a huge business. And that's because the animals are so profitable. And what's interesting is that it's not just the poaching but really the demand side that's important because some of these animals are worth more than cocaine, more than, you know, drugs.  A woman just a couple of weeks ago in Los Angeles was arrested with a kilo, that's 2. 2 pounds, of bear bile with a street value of about $40,000. And that's more than cocaine, which is about 30,000. And rhino horn is worth even more, which about 50,000 per kilo.  And what that's done is that's gotten almost everybody to get in on the game. So depending on the species, you have a lot of organized crime networks getting involved and using the same networks that they might use for drug trafficking, for wildlife trafficking.  And in fact, again, a couple of weeks ago, there was a human trafficking case in Brazil, and that led over time to the wildlife - the biggest wildlife trafficking ring bust ever in Brazil, which was trafficking macaws. And there were over 100 people arrested for illegally smuggling $20 million worth of animals per year, and trafficking about half a million animals per year.  FLATOW: Wow. Let me get a question in, if I can, from Alice(ph) in South Bend. Hi, Alice. Quickly, please.  ALICE (Caller): Hi. I was just wondering, if was interested in to going to this field, what course of study should I take or schools that would be good?  Mr. GODDARD: If you want to get into the science, just good basic biology, chemistry, get your bachelor's degree. Wildlife forensic science is basically learned on the job. Sal can address the investigator part.  Mr. AMATO: Yeah. We, you know, we look for people that are grounded in biology and certainly have a passion for, you know, wildlife and conservation. You know, we do take people from schools that are, you know, studying criminal justice as well. So, really, you know, we need a kind of a mix of both, somebody who's got the law enforcement mentality but also has a passion for wildlife. So we're looking for a mix in our staffing.  FLATOW: Do you have job openings?  Mr. AMATO: Yes. We - just with turnover, we have to almost consistently, you know, keep hiring to keep up with our retirees. And we look to put a class - we, usually, we put a class on of about 24 agents every other year.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And the most important, the most - the biggest skill you need is what?  Mr. AMATO: Well, you know, frankly, we are - we don't really hire entry-level. We're looking for journeyman level, investigators that come from other agencies or, you know, come from our own ranks as wildlife inspectors or refuge officers or state officers. So, we look for somebody that's normally had, you know, between three and five years experience doing this type of work.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So you can retrain them just to be another kind of specialist from what they used to be.  Mr. AMATO: Exactly.  FLATOW: But they need some investigation experience?  Mr. AMATO: Right.  FLATOW: All right. It's quite fascinating. I want to thank all of you for taking time to be with us today.  Mr. GODDARD: Glad to.  Mr. AMATO: Glad to be here.  FLATOW: You're welcome.  Dr. NEME: Thank you very much.  FLATOW: Good luck on your book. Laurel Neme is author of the book \"Animal Investigators: How the World's First Wildlife Forensic Lab is Solving Crimes and Saving Endangered Species. \" And Ken Goddard is director of the National Fish and Wildlife Forensics Lab in Ashland, Oregon. And Sal Amato is special agent in charge of the Northeast region for the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. That's the Office of Law Enforcement in Hadley. And he's accepting resumes.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Have a great weekend. Thanks for being with us.  Mr. AMATO: Take care.  Mr. GODDARD: Thanks, Ira.  FLATOW: You're welcome.  Dr. NEME: Thank you.

I'm Ira Flatow. Picture this. About 40,000 years ago, a herd of mammoths drinks by a lakeside. One of them, a baby, walks too far in and she tumbles into the lake and panics. She inhales the muddy water, struggles and then drowns. Eventually her body drifts to a part of the lake that freezes into permafrost and there she stays frozen for tens of thousands of years. And two years ago, a Siberian reindeer herder sees something strange on a sandbar. And when he looks closer, he recognizes a creature that his tribe believes is a bad omen, an animal from the underworld. So he and a friend contact people from the nearest museum in St. Petersburg. Museum officials trek to Siberia and are amazed when they see her, the little mammoth, almost perfectly preserved, frozen in time, and they name her Lyuba, after the reindeer herder's wife. Well, today Lyuba is the cover girl for the most recent issue of National Geographic magazine. And one of the scientists who's exploring the secrets to be found in her preserved tissue stomach and other organs and her DNA, he is here to talk to us. We'll found out why he had to eat a draft horse - he had to eat a draft horse in the process. Our number 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK, and you can go to our Web site and Twitter us at SciFri if you'd like to submit questions. Let me introduce my guest. Daniel Fisher is professor of geological sciences and curator of the Museum of Paleontology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Professor DANIEL FISHER (University of Michigan): Thank you. Pleasure to be here. FLATOW: Where was the - where was the mammoth found? Prof. FISHER: She was found in sort of the North Western corner of Siberia, which is about where the European part of Russia meets the Asian part of Russia, just north of the Ural Mountains. FLATOW: And tell us about this nomadic reindeer herder and his family. Prof. FISHER: They are from a group of people known as the Nenets. They - many of them live now by fishing, but most of them live by herding reindeer. Probably, say, 400 or 500 years ago they would have been hunting reindeer. But 400 years ago they took up a slightly more domesticated version of that pursuit. FLATOW: And now how did this baby mammoth, how did Lyuba last so long in such good condition? Prof. FISHER: Well, part of the answer certainly is that she was frozen into the permafrost, this essentially permanently frozen soil sediment that makes up much of the ground surface at these high latitudes. This is well above the Artic Circle. And that's a stable, physical, chemical environment in which lots of kinds of things, tissues of plants, of animals are easily maintained over - over long, long periods of time. The oxygen, the bacterial processes that normally degrade organic tissue, are slowed down essentially to a complete pause under those circumstances. FLATOW: But she had been dug out. She must have started to decompose at some point there, no? Prof. FISHER: Well, we would think that. In fact, that was one of the big mysteries of working on this specimen. She had been, lets say, dug out the by the river that has naturally eroded from the river banks and then carried downstream probably in the spring flood of 2006 and at that point was deposited as the flood waters receded on this sandbar that flanked the river. And as we can reconstruct it, she lay there for almost a year, because she was found just before the next spring floods in May of 2007. So that means that she was laying by the river in the full 24 hour sun of the Siberian summer of 2006. And it was - it was completely mystifying to us how she escaped degradation during that time, either by bacterial decay or by scavengers. The answer to that seems to be that her body had undergone a sort of natural pickling process mediated by a certain group of bacteria that produced lactic acid within - within tissues. And these sort of soured her, pickled her, so that other bacteria and certainly mammalian or avian scavengers turned up their nose at her essentially and said, hmmm, I'll go for something more familiar. FLATOW: That's interesting. But I understand that in proving this theory, you had to experiment and eat a draft horse. Prof. FISHER: Yes, that's true, although the sequencing is a little different from that. The draft horse actually was part of an earlier series of experiments on storage of meat in ponds, something that the work that we did in North America actually led us to think that early humans - early Pleistocene humans in North America did when they hunted, killed and butchered mastodons and mammoths. The problem was essentially what do you do with the leftovers in that circumstance. And the answer was one way you can deal with them and one way that we have well documented at a couple of sites is to store large carcass parts in ponds. And they then undergo this bacterially mediated preservation process that keeps the meat really in very reasonable condition for - for months and months, sometimes over a year. Now, the - the connection with Lyuba was - was actually somewhat late to dawn on me. It was really only after we had thawed her out as part of the process of dissection and sort of surgical investigation that we did in St. Petersburg as one of the later stages of our analysis that I began to realize that there was a smell that was not - it was not unpleasant. It was not even particularly strong, but it was familiar and it gnawed at me for a while before I connected it with the earlier experience of eating pond-aged draft horse. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: So (unintelligible) you did prove that the pond was able to keep, to preserve the Lyuba, the same we preserve the draft horse. Prof. FISHER: Yes, the same process that has essentially put her tissues into a different state that made them much less likely to decompose\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Prof. FISHER: \u2026when she was finally eroded out. FLATOW: Well, what can you learn from her now? What's the gist of what you'd like to do? Prof. FISHER: Sure. There's a deal of, you know, individual nuggets of information on mammoth anatomy and biology that are really very interesting to consider. But there's also a bigger prize essentially that we've been able to grab hold of through our work on her, and that is that she's given us an opportunity to test some of the methods that we use for extracting biological information from fossil remains. These methods involve looking at tusks, sometimes also the chewing teeth, premolars, molars of an animal. The tusk and other teeth grow through addition of layers of material. And the structure and composition of these layers give it the evidence of things like diet, local climate, certainly the animal's nutritional condition. They give us lots of insight into the world that these animals inhabited. But all too - all too often we have only the tusk and we apply our methods and we get our information, but how are we going to check to see whether that information is - is really at the straight scoop. And what Lyuba gives us is an animal where we have our usual source of information, the tusks and the teeth, and for that matter the bones and so forth. But we also have the rest of her body, and that lets us see just how good a condition she was in. It gives us - for instance, on the subject of diet it gives us her intestinal contents. And we can then make a direct comparison between what the rest of Lyuba offers and what the information we get from her tusks. And yes indeed, the methods work. It means that we can apply these much more broadly with confidence gained from this sort of ground truth access. FLATOW: Now I'm sure that people are going to ask you, well, you must have gotten viable DNA out of Lyuba. Can't you grow us another mastodon from her? Dr. FISHER: We certainly have DNA from her. Viability is a slightly more ticklish issue. Actually, her DNA is much less fragmented than most ancient DNA. It's really - well, my colleague Hendrick Poinar at McMaster University, who did the work on her DNA, said that it was better preserved than any mammoth DNA he had worked with. So I think that she's a wonderful candidate for further advances in the study of the mammoth genome. However, at this point, as I'm sure you and most of your listeners know, there are a number of technical issues that currently stand in the way of any real cloning effort, and so while we're going to learn a lot about mammoth populations and mammoth biology and history from this. At the moment, we're not going to be raising our own mammoths. FLATOW: One last question in the minute or two we have left. Was there anything surprising about the anatomy since you had such a well-preserved specimen? Dr. FISHER: Sure. One of the biggest surprises was this very well-marked hump on the back of neck, which we realized early on was made of fat, but in the later stages of the work, we further realized that - at least we have very strong evidence that this is actually brown fat, which is a special tissue that's capable of inducing its own metabolic activity that generates heat. And so it's part of the thermal regulatory system of some mammals, and in this case it seems that it's likely that this was part of the temperature control system for young baby mammoths that allowed them to be born a little earlier than they might have been otherwise and get sort of more of a good running start through their first summer to be in good enough condition to survive their first Arctic winter. FLATOW: Very interesting, Dr. Fisher. I want to thank you for taking time to be with us today. Dr. FISHER: Oh sure. It's my pleasure. FLATOW: Good luck to you. Dr. FISHER: Thank you. FLATOW: Congratulations. Dr. FISHER: Oh, thank you very much. FLATOW: Daniel Fisher, professor of geological sciences and curator of the Museum of Paleontology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, talking about Lyuba, who's on the cover of National Geographic this month. We're going to take a break and switch gears. We're still going to talk about animals but about CSI detectives who - well, they're detectives for animals. I mean, it's not the kind of show you see on TV. Maybe there will be one after we talk about it. We're going talk about it, so stay with us. We'll be right back talking about CSI for animals, also the author of the book \"Animal Investigations. \" Laurel Neme will be here. So we'll be right back talking about that subject. So stay with us.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. Picture this. About 40,000 years ago, a herd of mammoths drinks by a lakeside. One of them, a baby, walks too far in and she tumbles into the lake and panics. She inhales the muddy water, struggles and then drowns. Eventually her body drifts to a part of the lake that freezes into permafrost and there she stays frozen for tens of thousands of years. And two years ago, a Siberian reindeer herder sees something strange on a sandbar. And when he looks closer, he recognizes a creature that his tribe believes is a bad omen, an animal from the underworld. So he and a friend contact people from the nearest museum in St. Petersburg.  Museum officials trek to Siberia and are amazed when they see her, the little mammoth, almost perfectly preserved, frozen in time, and they name her Lyuba, after the reindeer herder's wife. Well, today Lyuba is the cover girl for the most recent issue of National Geographic magazine. And one of the scientists who's exploring the secrets to be found in her preserved tissue stomach and other organs and her DNA, he is here to talk to us.  We'll found out why he had to eat a draft horse - he had to eat a draft horse in the process. Our number 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK, and you can go to our Web site and Twitter us at SciFri if you'd like to submit questions. Let me introduce my guest.

NPR's Joanne Silberner has this report on some of the things that are known and some that are not. JOANNE SILBERNER: One of the reasons people have found this virus so alarming is because initially it seemed to be killing a lot of people in Mexico. Then U. S. data started coming in. The illnesses here have been relatively mild. Some people thought maybe there were two different viruses, but lab tests suggest it's the same one. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases says there could be another explanation. Mexico may have had hundreds of thousands of infections, the U. S. far fewer, and the death rate may actually be the same. Mr. ANTHONY FAUCI (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases): So it's still a very open question as to whether there is a significant difference, and if so, what is the reason for that difference? SLBERNER: If there is a difference, it may be that the viruses actually are not identical, or there may be complicating factors in Mexico such as the presence of other microbes or poor nutrition or chronic lung problems. There is one thing that's known about the virus, how it came to be: a process called reassortment, where several viruses infect one animal and swap genetic parts. Arnold Monto is an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan. Mr. ARNOLD MONTO (University of Michigan): Now we think this probably happens a lot, but the virus typically is not fit enough to transmit, and what's happened here is that the virus has changed in one way or another and is by chance able to transmit from human to human. SILBERNER: And he says it's an especially usual reassortment. Mr. MONTO: Because it's got pieces from a lot of different species and from different regions of the world. SILBERNER: Genes from a bird, a human, and a pig, from Europe, Asia, and North America. Where the virus itself originated though is another mystery. The earliest known appearance was in Mexico, but it could have arrived from somewhere else. The question a lot of people want the answer for is can the new virus be stopped? A vaccine would help. U. S. scientists have already started the month-long process of making one, says Bruce Gellin, director of the government's National Vaccine Program Office. The next step is to grow lots of it in the lab. Mr. BRUCE GELLIN (National Vaccine Program Office): And how well it grows will be the most important factor of how much vaccine can be available in a given period of time. SILBERNER: Flu manufacturers deal with this production issue every year when they make vaccines against whatever flu virus happens to be circulating at the moment. Mr. GELLIN: Sometimes they grow well. Sometimes they don't grow so well, and that's still one of the things that's left to be seen. SILBERNER: One among others about the virus. Will it fade away on its own as viruses sometimes do? And if it doesn't, will it be more like the 1918 pandemic flu which killed tens of millions of people worldwide? Or will it have the much lower death rate of a seasonal flu? Joanne Silberner, NPR News.  STEVE INSKEEP, host:  Scientists are asking some fundamental questions about the swine flu virus.

It's a lesson learned from past outbreaks. Case in point: Surat, India, where 15 years ago, the plague killed 57 people. That city, in Northwestern India, saw about a third of its residents flee. Ron Barrett is a medical anthropologist at Emory University. He spent a lot of time investigating what happened in Surat. Mr. RON BARRETT (Medical Anthropologist, Emory University): People were leaving the city in large numbers. It was estimated that half a million people left within a two-week period of the reports, and this included about 78 percent of the medical personnel, who would be needed to really help the people with the disease and to contain the epidemic in its early stages. LYDEN: So, it must have been very disturbing that the medical professionals were fleeing the city. Mr. BARRETT: Indeed. I think - the people I spoke with who were there at the time said that it was very disconcerting that the majority of medical professionals had fled the city, as well. I think it really led to a greater sense of distrust and further exacerbated the panic, not to mention the fact that people who were sick would not have somebody to go to for treatment. LYDEN: I understand that some of the fears were spread by rumors that it was a terrorist attack. Would you tell me about that? Mr. BARRETT: Yeah. In the very early stages, you know, people didn't know that it was a plague. There were some suspicious cases coming into the hospital, and a rumor had started that this was a poisoning of the city's water supply by the Muslim minority community. This was completely false, but it really did add to the sense of accusation, fear and panic at the time. And so, initially, the population, people were not using the water supply. They weren't washing their hands, and there was a lot of tension between communities at a time in which the communities really needed to come together. LYDEN: It sounds like at every point, things were breaking down, people not using water, lots of fear and suspicion. How did that actually spread the disease? Mr. BARRETT: Well, what happens is the early stages of an infectious disease epidemic, you need reliable information to be more contagious than the disease itself, and you need the fear and stigma to be less contagious. In this case, the stigma was much more infectious than the disease itself. And with that kind of breakdown, you can't easily contain a disease, and you can't get the kind of information that you need in order to be able to understand what's actually going on. LYDEN: So, as a medical anthropologist, what lessons do you take away? What would be the bottom line? Mr. BARRETT: The bottom line is the importance of transparency in public health agencies and governments to provide reliable information and detailed information, and it really helps to prevent the panic. When there's a lack of information, rumors start to take over. And when you have rumors, then you have distrust. And when you have distrust, it's very difficult to get public cooperation for surveillance, for containment, and for having people come in to hospitals when they're sick.

I'm Terry Gross. Underneath the cow patties in the pasture and the monkey dung in the jungle, there's a miniature world of sex and violence. Dung beetles with fierce-looking horns are battling over female beetles, and my guest, Douglas Emlen, is studying them. He's an expert on the evolution and development of bizarre or extreme shapes in insects. He's particularly interested in insect weaponry. Dung beetles have what he's looking for. Lots of Emlen's work is in the lab, but he's also had some wild adventures collecting different families of dung beetles from around the world. Emlen is a professor of biology at the University of Montana. If you want to follow along, on our Web site there's a dung-beetle slide show and a video of two beetles battling. That's at freshair. npr. org. Doug Emlen, welcome to FRESH AIR. Now I think it's fair to say that dung beetles wouldn't be most people's first choice of an animal to study. So what is unique about the dung beetle's armor that makes you so interested in studying them? Mr. DOUGLAS EMLEN (Professor of Biology, University of Montana): There are a variety of things, and I guess I should first of all qualify that by saying they weren't my first choice of an organism, either. It's a hard thing to wake up in the morning and decide you're suddenly go out there and study dung beetles. I started out trying to study some of the big rhinoceros beetles as a graduate student, and the project failed pretty spectacularly, and it was a biologist named Bill Eberhardt(ph) that took me under his wing after that failed project and said no, no, no. You're looking at the wrong beetles. And he opened up this box, and it was full of all these little, tiny beetles that are the size of your pinky or even the size of an eraser on a new pencil. And he opens up the box, and it smells like horse manure, and I looked him, and I said those are dung beetles. There's no way I'm going to work on those things. And he laughed at me at the time and told me I was a fool, and basically explained that for all the kinds of biology that I wanted to understand, genetics and behavior and diversity, these things were perfect. And since that time, to come back full circle to your question, the dung beetles have turned out to be an amazing system to study, and they've taught us so much about biology in many ways. But you mentioned the weapons. The thing that first drew me to them is the spectacular diversity in their morphology. They have these incredible shapes, and most of the diversity in those shapes involves these weapons. And so for lack of a better analogy, these tiny, little insects - that again, as I said, are often the size of an eraser on a pencil, on a new pencil - these things are the insect equivalent of a bull elk or a male deer, and they have incredible weapons coming off of their bodies. And you look across the species, and there's variation among the species. Sometimes the horns comes from the back of the head, sometimes from the front of the head, sometimes from the thorax, which is equivalent to sort of between your shoulder blades. Sometimes they're branched, forked, curved, straight. There's just an incredible variety of forms. And I was interested as a biologist in how a little, tiny animal like that could strut around with these enormous weapons sticking off the side of their body and survive. GROSS: You know what? It's kind of amazing, and I mean, not only do they have these weapons, like, some of them are like antlers. Some of them are like a rhinoceros horn. Some of them are like lobster pincers. But they also have, like, hair. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. EMLEN: Many of the horns - you mean the beetles or the horns? GROSS: Well, the beetles, and yeah. Mr. EMLEN: They do, and some of the horns in some of the species tend to have hair. We see that more often in the rhinoceros beetles than in the dung beetles, per se, but very often the sides of these horns are adorned with thick rows of hairs, and it's really sort of embarrassingly unknown what those things do. There's a good chance that they are sensory structures so that when a male locks with another male, fighting, they can tell where the horns of the opponent male are because they're distending or pushing down all these fine hairs on the surface of the horn. But some people think that the hairs might actually have chemo-detectors. They may be good for smell or for releasing signals. We don't know. GROSS: I can tell you one thing for sure. They're not fashionable. (Soundbite of laughter) GROSS: They are really creepy looking. Mr. EMLEN: That's a matter of opinion. I disagree. I think they're fantastic. GROSS: Well, they are fantastic in a creepy kind of way. Let me ask you to describe one or two of the types of dung beetles that you find most fascinating in terms of their form and shape. Mr. EMLEN: Sure. So one of the species of dung beetle that we spent quite a bit of time studying is - has the species name Taurus, as in the bull, and it actually has a pair of long, curved horns that extend upwards and backwards from the head of male beetles. So it's a big, curled set of horns, and when the head is tucked back against the rest of the body, the horns sort of wrap in snugly around the equivalent of the shoulders or the thorax. But when these males are fighting, they pull their heads forward, and they've got quite an impressive pair of horns. And we've looked at these beetles in a variety of ways and looked at what they do with the horns and who has the horns and who doesn't have the horns and how the horns develop, and all kinds of questions coming from that basic oddity of their morphology - the fact that they've got these huge weapons. GROSS: You want to describe another one? Mr. EMLEN: Sure. So one of my favorite species, unfortunately it's not one that we've been able to study in numbers, but it's one of the most spectacular of these beetles, is a species that actually was illustrated in Darwin's book, his treatise in which he initially described the whole theoretical concept of sexual selection, the process of biology that myself and so many other biologists study. And in this beetle, the beetle is a brilliant, iridescent green color, turning sort of shimmering from a green to a yellow to a blue and in some angles even purple. So it has this beautiful sheen to it. And the males have a long, curved pair of horns that come up from the head that are much longer than the ones in the species I just described to you. And they have a branch in the middle of them with a tine that comes off and points inwards. And then at the very tips of the horns, it swells outwards into almost a little plate, so beautiful branched, curved horns coming off of this species. GROSS: So the purpose of these weapons, the horns and the pincers, are basically to fight off other guys for girls. Mr. EMLEN: Yup. GROSS: So, like, the male dung beetles fight each other over the available female beetles. Mr. EMLEN: They do, they do. GROSS: So does that mean - have you watched them fight? Mr. EMLEN: Oh yes, yes, many times. GROSS: Oh, describe what a fight looks like. Mr. EMLEN: It actually looks like pandemonium. It was not what we expected at all. So these are dung beetles, the ones that we're talking about right now, and so what happens in these cases are these beetles are very good at smelling their food source, and they follow these odor cues into the food. And when they find dung of the particular species that they feed on, they often have to deal with hundreds, and in some cases thousands of other individuals that are coming in and piling into that same place and competing to carve up and use that food resource. So what happens is the beetles go instantly underground. They go right beneath the food source, the dung pile, so to speak, and the females actually excavate these burrows in the ground, and the males guard the entrances to these burrows. And they have big teeth-like spines on their legs, and they lock themselves, they brace themselves against the tunnel walls and try to prevent rival males from getting into the tunnels where the females are. The females - these are amazing insects because they have elaborate parental-care behaviors. The females will take pieces of the dung down into the burrows and chew them up with their mouth parts and process them and pack them together into these sort of balls, these little sausages of buried dung underground. And then she'll excavate a chamber at the end of that and place an egg in there. And that's essentially the full food resource, like an allocate of food for each one of her offspring. And she'll do that, lay an egg and then close in the tunnel and then build another one of these balls and then close the tunnel. And we've watched these beetles do this. The females will make 50, 100 different trips down into the ground for every single one of these eggs that she lays. And during this time, the male is guarding that tunnel, keeping everybody else away and mating with the female absolutely as often as he possibly can. And other males come and challenge. And the fights take place inside these tunnels. And they scramble, and they push, and they pry, and they twist. And we tried forever to figure out how it is, exactly, that they use these horns because we wanted to know why would one species have a straight horn and another species have a curved horn and another species have a branched horn. And we were assuming that we'd be able to pick up intricacies in the nature of these fights that would tell us why one species had one shape or another, and we failed. The fights are just chaos. We filmed hundreds of them, and they're amazing things to watch, but there's nothing predictable or repeatable about them except the outcome. Somehow or other, bracing and twisting and prying and pushing and pulling and trying to get the other beetle out of the tunnel, somehow, at the end of the day, the male that has the longest horns and/or the largest body sizes typically is the one who wins. And the smaller males get pushed out of the tunnels and leave and go find another tunnel and try to push their way into that. GROSS: So they just use these horns to bash away at their competition? Mr. EMLEN: Yeah, I wouldn't call it bash. I would say they more use the horns to block the tunnel. You've got essentially a round or an egg-shaped animal blocking a tunnel, and they're very strong. So you have a rival pushing itself past, and it seems that the horns, regardless of what precise shape they take, seem to function like bars of a jail cell. They sort of block - they make it easier for a male inside the tunnel to block it so that another male can't push past. But it's not as simple as that because they don't sit still. They twist and push and pry. But they don't stab with them. They aren't able to puncture the armor of the rival males. So they don't actually get injured in this process, and they don't really bash each other either, but they definitely spar and twist, sort of strength contests, I suppose. But there's a twist to this story, too. GROSS: Yeah? Mr. EMLEN: Which is that the biggest males have the biggest weapons, and these are the ones that are usually the most successful at guarding that tunnel and at mating with the female inside the tunnel, but there are small males in these populations, too, and they don't produce the horns. And so these small males look much more similar to a female. They don't have the big antlers or the big weapons, and they don't fight over the tunnels, either. They have a sneak tactic, a satellite tactic. What'll happen is they'll work their way into a tunnel and try to stay there, but they get kicked out right away by bigger males. And instead of going from tunnel to tunnel to tunnel to keep trying, they stay after they get kicked out, and they dig their own tunnel right next to the main tunnel. And after they get sort of a centimeter or so down below the ground, they cut horizontally, and they can intercept the guarded tunnel beneath the guarding male. And sometimes they're able to sneak in, zoom down to the female, mate with the female and get out again before the guarding male has essentially figured out what's going on. So you've got big males with weapons fighting, and little, tiny sneak males without the weapons sneaking into these tunnels on the sly. GROSS: So the less macho dung beetles still find a way. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. EMLEN: They try. I don't think that they're as successful as the larger, dominant males, but yes, they definitely find a way. GROSS: Can you see the armor and the weapons with your naked eye? Mr. EMLEN: Yes, but I've had some practice. I think the first thing - if somebody were to go out and look for this in their backyard, which is the other fun thing about this system is that these beetles live in so many different habitats and so many places that you'd be pretty hard-pressed to live anywhere where you couldn't go into a pasture or into the backyard and turn over a cow-manure pile and look underneath it and find some of these beetles. They're that abundant and that widespread. So if you were to go out and look for these things yourself and tip over a cow pile and look at the dirt, maybe dig with a trowel into the first couple inches of the soil and turn it around, you'd find these beetles. They're often, in most habitats, certainly around most places in the U. S. - they would be on the order of half-a-centimeter to a centimeter long, and they're squat. The beetles that I'm talking about with the weapons walk like little tortoises. They sort of jerk their way along. And you can pick them up and see the horns with the naked eye. We often look at them under microscopes to take more precise measurements of these things, and we photograph them either using really good camera lenses, or sometimes scanning electron microscopes will take really good pictures of these things, as well. But you can definitely, for a lot of these beetles, pick them up out of the ground and look at them with a hand lens or with your naked eye and see these really cool weapons. GROSS: My guest is Doug Emlen, a biology professor at the University of Montana. We'll talk more about his work studying dung beetles after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (Soundbite of music) GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is biologist Doug Emlen, and we're talking about his work studying dung beetles. And he studies them because he's interesting in insects who have armor, and a lot of dung beetles have really fascinating armor, horns and antlers and so on. Now you've described these, like, you know, antler-like and branch-like weapons and armor and weapons that the dung beetles have, and they sound, like, really big compared to the size of the actual beetles. Aren't they kind of cumbersome to tote around? I mean, I know they need them to fight and to bar off the tunnels and prevent other males from getting in, but they also must really get in the way. Mr. EMLEN: They do, and so to try to give you a sense for how much they get in the way, the analogy I like to use is that for some of these beetles, it would equivalent to you producing another leg and wearing it around on your head for your entire adult life. GROSS: Wow. Mr. EMLEN: That's the best analogy I can give you because when you - if you try to estimate how big these things are, in some of these cases the horn, the weapons, can be 10, 15, 20 percent of the body weight of the animal. That's a fifth of the total weight of the animal is allocated to this one thing. And so it really is analogous to an extra leg on your head for your entire adult life, and it has to be costly. So we've used a variety of types of experiments to try to measure how costly it is, and we found, for example, if a male beetle puts a ton of resources into making a horn, it means that he has to stunt something else. There's not enough resources left, in a sense, and so in some of these beetles, if they have really big horns, they have really small eyes. We found that in beetles that have horns on the back of their head, their eyes were 30-percent smaller as a result of having allocated everything to the weapons. In another species, they actually trade off with the testes or with the wings. So there are costs associated with producing these big, bulky things. GROSS: So what do these dung beetles say about evolution? What do you feel like you've learned about evolution from studying them? Mr. EMLEN: Honestly I'd have to turn that on its head and say what haven't I learned about evolution from them. These beetles have taught us, and me in particular, an amazing amount of lessons, some good and some more frustrating. But the biggest question that I have been focusing on and that I think I've learned a ton from these beetles on has to do with the backdrop of animal diversity. It's very hard to be an evolutionary biologist and not look around you and become sort of increasingly aware of the differences among animals that are out there. There's so much variation in the ways things act, the way they look, and it is sort of amplified, in a way, in these beetles. The variation in shape, especially connected with these weapons, is truly stunning in this group of beetles. And so as a biologist, I'm obsessed with understanding where this diversity in form comes from. How did these big, gaudy structures arise, meaning what do the beetles use these for? How - you know, once we know how they're used in natural populations, we can ask questions like how did they evolve? Under what types of ecological or environmental circumstances are these weapons likely to evolve? And then that leads us to the next question of why don't all these beetles have the same weapons? What is it about them or about their history or the ecologies and behaviors of these animals in the past that has caused weapon evolution to go one way in some populations and a different way in other populations - and for it to go in enough different ways in enough different species that we end up with the truly thousands of types of shapes and forms and locations for these weapons on their bodies. And so there's sort of fundamental biological questions connected with animal diversity that we are tackling with these beetles. GROSS: Although we've been talking about dung beetles and the kind of weapons that they have, you also study the rhino beetle, which is a much larger beetle. Let me read something from Wikipedia, and you can tell me if this is all true. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. EMLEN: Okay. GROSS: Yeah, we looked it up. Mr. EMLEN: Good for you. GROSS: And it says that rhino beetles are among the largest of beetles. They are popular pets in Asia. They are clean, easy to maintain and safe to handle. Male beetles are used for gambling fights since they naturally compete for female beetles, with the winner knocking the other off a log. And they're also the strongest animals on the planet in relation to their own size. They can lift up to 850 times their own weight. All true? Mr. EMLEN: I believe so. The last statistic I don't have personal experience with, and I might argue that the dung beetles are actually stronger than the rhino beetles, but the rest of that is definitely true, and I'm actually holding a giant rhinoceros beetle in my hand right now. GROSS: Yikes. I wish I could see it. Mr. EMLEN: Crawling up my arm. GROSS: Oh gosh. You're in a studio in Montana, and I'm in a studio in Philadelphia. So we're not seeing each other, but I wish I could see that rhino beetle. Tell me what it looks like. Mr. EMLEN: I will describe it to you. This male is about, almost four inches long, and he's a rich\u2026 GROSS: Wow, it's big. Mr. EMLEN: \u2026brown, almost a purplish to brown to almost black color with a nice sheen to it and sort of golden hairs along the margins of his body, and the most striking feature of him, surprise, surprise, given what we've been talking about, is that on his head, he has an enormous horn. This is a big branch structure that actually looks surprisingly like a pitchfork that extends upwards from his head, and in the biggest of these males, that pitchfork, that weapon, can be almost as long as the rest of the body of these males. He also has another horn that's on the shoulder blades, the thorax, that comes up and curls a little bit forward and splits into two tips. But the horn that we're most excited about is this huge projection from the male's head that, you know, if I'm sitting here looking at the head and the eyes, the horn is probably 10 times the length of the male's head, and it comes up and splits into a Y, and then each of the tips of the Y split again so that you have these four points or tines at the T to this horn. GROSS: Wow. (Soundbite of laughter) GROSS: I just wish\u2026 Mr. EMLEN: That's the horn. The beetles are four inches long. GROSS: I just wish I were seeing it, wow. So\u2026 Mr. EMLEN: They prickle as they climb up your hands, same idea as with the dung beetles. They've got teeth or points on their legs that they use to brace themselves in contests, and spines on the legs that they do the same thing with, and when they grab you, they can prick you a little bit with the spines, but otherwise they're completely harmless. They feed, as adults, on rotting fruit. We keep them on apples, and basically sliced applies is what they'll quite happily feed on as adults. And they wouldn't be capable of biting you, even if you tried to get them to. And they are kept as pets, not here. This is a species that we import with permits from the United States Department of Agriculture and we have to keep contained. But in Asia, where these things are native, they're very common pets. In fact, I'm told that you can buy the larvae in vending machines, and you can get the diet for these things in grocery stores. And kids really do keep them as pets. They're fantastic pets, and they do fight. They put them on bamboo sticks and battle the males and, I believe, gamble on which of the males will win. I haven't actually done that firsthand, but I've seen plenty of photographs of kids doing that. GROSS: It sounds like the cockfighting of the insect world. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. EMLEN: I think it is. GROSS: Doug Emlen will be back in the second half of the show. He's a biology professor at the University of Montana. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (Soundbite of music) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Who knew that dung beetles living beneath animal manure could be so fascinating? Let's get back to our interview with Doug Emlen, a biology professor at the University of Montana, who's an expert on the evolution and development of bizarre or extreme shapes in insects. He's particularly interested in insect weaponry and dung beetles have what he's looking for. The males are armed with bizarre looking horns, which they use to fight over female beetles. If you want to see what we're talking about, go to our Web site freshair. npr. org where you'll find a dung beetle fight show and a video of two beetles fighting. One of the things that amaze me, I guess, particularly about the smaller dung beetles, is that there's just like invisible world of - this world, that - that you don't know - that at least I don't know - is out there in which, you know, insects are like waging war with weapons and armor and competing. Dr. EMLEN: And sneak tactics. GROSS: And sneak tactics, yeah - all like, you know, for the love of a good woman. (Soundbite of laughter) GROSS: You know, to mate with a female. So there's this whole world of like sex and violence, you know that's kind of invisible to us and is even happening underneath like cow manure. Dr. EMLEN: I love that fact about these beetles actually. That's one of my favorite things about them is that this whole story is unfolding in most people's backyard. So just to give you a feel that one genus of the dung beetles that we work on, so one sort of taxonomic grouping of these beetles, there are two thousands species already described. GROSS: Wow. Dr. EMLEN: Probably another thousand species waiting to be described. The center of diversity for that group of beetles is Africa. But they occur in all continents accept Antarctica. And they feed on just about any kind of dung you can imagine. I mean, pretty much if you can think of an animal that produces a decent respectable quantity of manure there almost certainly is a beetle in this particular genus somewhere that is specialized on feeding on it. So these battles really do happen everywhere, in every habitat I've ever seen. On every continent or country that I've ever been to. And it's the same basic story - the weapons are different. Sometimes they're on one part of the body, sometimes on another, sometimes they're branched, sometimes they're curved. But the story is basically the same. They dig these tunnels under the ground. It could be rabbit dung or deer dung, or elephant dung, or giraffe dung or cow manure but the beetles are still going to fly into the food source. They're still going to dig a tunnel into the ground underneath. The males are probably still going to fight over the entrance to that tunnel. I'll be willing to bet you there are small sneak males that are still going to try to get into that tunnel on the fly. And you have this whole interesting dynamic, rich, behavioral system, taking place underground in every one of these habitats, on every one of these types of food sources. GROSS: Tell us about one of your greatest adventures searching for dung beetles around the world. Dr. EMLEN: Sure. There actually are a number, you wouldn't think that collecting dung beetles would be that adventurous but the truth might surprise you. So we have taken dug out canoes into the lowland forests of Ecuador searching for beetles. And we've sloshed through flooded pastures with leeches and wallabies in Australia. But the most common source of sort of danger or adventure collecting beetles is actually bulls. And if you can imagine we spend a lot of time in cow pastures. Well there's a lot of bulls in these pastures. And I think I can say that I have been charged full out by bulls on five different continents now and treed by them on three. So we even had one time where I was charged by a cape buffalo in Africa. We had permits to collect beetles in the Serengeti. And they don't normally like you to get out of your vehicles in the Serengeti but in this case they were willing to help us to try to get the beetles. And we had armed guards standing on the roofs of the vehicles spotting for us to make sure that the cape buffalo didn't get too close. And we were out there diligently poking away and trying to find the beetles in the Serengeti and they were calling out the distances - 100 meters, 90 meters, 80 meters, 70, 50 run. And they would - and we would grab everything and leap back into the vehicle and get past there without getting charged by the cape buffalo, too close for comfort. But yeah, that was probably the most hair-raising opportunity to collect beetles. GROSS: Do the guards think you're kind of crazy risking - taking risks like this to collect dung beetles? Dr. EMLEN: They do. I have to say that's one of the pleasant side effects of this type of an occupation is that I often have to go out into places and introduce myself to complete strangers, to ask permission to collect on their land or in this case to ask the guards if they'd be willing to help us collect in the Serengeti. And they always want to sit down and talk to you about where you're from and what you do. And you meet some wonderful people that way but I think - I think more than a few of them thought we are a little bit nuts. GROSS: So you have traveled around the world collecting dung beetles. Have you ever been surrounded by more dung beetles than you cared to? Dr. EMLEN: Yes. And that would definitely have been in Africa. There is no place quite like Africa for dung beetles. And we'd heard about the numbers of beetles that you can encounter but I until I actually saw it first hand it was pretty hard to imagine. So it was actually the same trip in the Serengeti where we had the armed guards and we were trying not to get charged by the cape buffalo. We happened across elephant dung in the road, and I realize normal people don't do this, but we hopped out of the car and collected the elephant dung in a Tupperware bin and brought it back to the campground where we were staying that evening. And I remember with the bunch of the students we all had headlights on and we set out to the edge of camp and placed the elephant dung out on the ground to see what we could find. And I sat there with my clipboard, trying to take notes on the beetles that came in and the beetles started coming in faster and faster and faster. And pretty quickly it was impossible to see anything because there were all buzzing and circling around our headlights and then a couple of minutes later they were starting to pour out of the sky so fast that I couldn't even take notes on my clipboard because my clipboard was covered with literally an inch of solid beetles. They were going down our necks. They were in our hair. They were in our faces and finally by the end, this sounds like an exaggeration, but it's not, it was as if somebody stood over us with a bucket full of beetles and poured it steadily out on top. The beetles absolutely covered absolutely covered the elephant dung - tens, probably hundreds of thousands of them came within minutes and we were utterly overwhelmed. GROSS: So different dung beetles feed on different kinds of dung. Now I understand in Australia they actually had to import a certain kind of dung beetle because they needed it and there weren't any anymore or weren't enough. Dr. EMLEN: That's true. So Australia has an interesting and rich native fauna of dung beetles. So there's a number of native species that are there, many of which have really cool horns incidentally. But the problem that Australia had was that when they clear cut a lot of the forests to create space for cattle, which was an important part of the economic development in Australia, it turned out that all of the native dung beetle species were specialists of forests. And none of their native species would cross that barrier and sort of move from the woods out into the open. And from a beetle's perspective out in the open in the sun and a pasture is a very, very different environment then in the shade of a forest and so they had this problem of tons and tons of cattle and just obscene amounts of cow manure and no native beetles that were bearing it. And so the cow - I've seen photographs of pastures in Australia that are literally cow pat, to cow pat, to cow pat as far as the eye can see - just nonstop. And what happened was they started getting flies that were sort of pest flies that went ballistic in this food source and were driving everybody crazy. And so Australia did a really good job of researching this problem. They went to Africa and to Europe, and they researched dung beetle species and found species that only lived in pastures. And they had this test, I mean, they basically tried to only find species that would not go into the woods. They would stay only in the pastures. And they picked these species and they bred them in captivity and then they had to do all these sort of quarantine procedures to bring them into Australia. And then they bred them in captivity in Australia and they did controlled releases of these beetles. And it's taken - it's been a success. They now have a number of species that are very well established that bury the dung in pasture habitats. And because they went for that extra step of incorporating the biology of these beetles and finding species that didn't go into the woods that the introduced species have not, as far as I know, replaced or driven extinct any of the native species. GROSS: Now you have described how dung beetles live, you know, largely underneath dung patties but don't some dung beetles actually live on the butts of animals. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. EMLEN: Yes. So, again the dung beetles have diversified incredibly and part of that diversity has to do with specializing on different types of dung or different types of food. And there are beetles in the same genus - the same group that we talked about, the 2,000 species worldwide - there are species that have been described that are specialists for either koala dung or sloth dung. And in these cases, these are animals that move very slowly and they bury their dung. They'll climb down to the bottom of a tree and dig a horn and bury their dung underground. If you can be at the right place at the right time, that's fantastic. It's a great way to have your food, have it buried on top of you and have all your eggs develop without any competition because nobody else finds it. And so what these beetles do is they actually ride around on the animals and they have specialized hooks on their legs that help them cling to the fur and they cling basically near the rear end of these animals. And they ride with the koala or with the sloth and when these animals go to the bathroom they hop off, go lay their eggs and climb back on again and wait for the next time. So it is true. Dung beetles do some pretty amazing things. GROSS: My guest is Doug Emlen. He is the biology professor at the University of Montana. We'll talk more about his work studying dung beetles after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (Sounbite of music) GROSS: If you're just joining us my guest is Doug Emlen. And we're talking about his work as a biologist who studies dung beetles. And he studies dung beetles because they have bizarre forms, because they have armor, they have horns and antlers and\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) GROSS: \u2026all kinds of surprising things. But my impression of the beetles that you study based on the enlarged photos that I have seen is that they look really prehistoric because of the antlers and the armor and the pincers and the, you know, the horns - all the assorted weaponry. Are they prehistoric? Do they date back to the same era as the dinosaurs? Dr. EMLEN: They do. There's reasonably - well, so if you use the types of tools that I alluded to a little while ago to reconstruct the history of these beetles. There are a number of studies now that have come up with pretty solid dates for how old these groups of animals are. So the dung beetles that we talked about so far, we spent most of our time talking about the group of dung beetles that I said are 2,000 species in it, that genus or that group of beetles we think dates back about 40 million years. But that group of dung beetles is related to other dung beetles that date back further than that. And those beetles shared a common ancestor with the rhinoceros beetles, maybe a 150 million years ago. And so we definitely are talking about groups of these horned beetles that go back as far as the dinosaurs. And there is fairly compelling evidence that they were dung beetles back then in the sense that there are fossil coprolite, or scat, from dinosaurs that have burrows in them that resemble the burrows that we see made by present day dung beetles. So it's circumstantial evidence at the moment but the histories that we reconstruct using molecular evidence, or using the sequences of DNA, also suggests that these lineages of beetles go back that far. So yes, I'd be willing to bet that there were beetles digging around underneath the dung of Tyrannosaurus rex or many of the other dinosaurs, the ceratopsids is for example, which also have really cool weapons like triceratops and styracosaurus. I'll bet you there were dung beetles crawling around under there and I'll bet you that beetles had horns too. They probably did something not too different from what they do in people's backyards today - dug tunnels into the ground and fought over those tunnels with their weapons. GROSS: So you've studied these beetles and they're really fascinating. How tolerant are you of insects that we regard as pests? Like, if you have ants or cockroaches that you find in your home, are you going to be fascinated by them or do you - do you want to just get rid of them as soon as possible? Dr. EMLEN: Here is where I'm going to get in trouble with the pesticide industry. I actually would never spray for those things in my house because teaching entomology has taught me a great deal about the neurological and carcinogenic side effects of many of the things that we use to kill insects. So, the answer is I love just about all kinds of insects although cockroaches are an interesting one. Even most of the entomologists I knew don't like cockroaches, although they have amazing diversity in their parental care behavior. There's species where they carry the young around on their backs. There's species of cockroaches that have the equivalent of a pregnancy. They actually will nurse their young, their eggs inside their bodies until they hatch. So it's a long developmental period inside their bodies and then when they hatch they have glands on their body that they feed these young with, which is just like nursing in humans. So cockroaches do some interesting things. And no I don't kill cockroaches. There are a few types of spiders that I will squash with a paper towel and that's only because there's a chance that they have a necrotic bite, a dangerous bite, and we've got young kids and I don't take that chance. So if it looks like a hobo spider, I'll squash it. Otherwise everything else in our house lives. GROSS: So, let me ask you, you said that, you know, entomologists who study insects are more negative about cockroaches and other insects, so even entomologists don't like cockroaches. I certainly empathize\u2026 Dr. EMLEN: I'm going to get in trouble for saying that\u2026 GROSS: \u2026they have my full support in this. Dr. EMLEN: as I'm there are exceptions in everything. GROSS: \u2026but why do you think that even entomologists don't like cockroaches? Dr. EMLEN: I shouldn't have said that. I'm already going to regret it. But I knew - I know several entomologists that they have not liked cockroaches. For one thing many, many people are allergic to cockroaches. They have - basically cockroaches developing in your house or in a building, shed their cuticle, their skeleton and their skin as the molt as they grow. And they also have (unintelligible) or feces that they produce  and these have chemical residues on them that many, many people are allergic to. And, I mean, I hate to say this on record but you'd be hard pressed to find any building probably in this country that's not infested with cockroaches at some level or another. Certainly all public buildings, they're - it's impossible to keep these things completely gone. And what happens is then the shed pieces of cuticles and frass get picked up in the air duct systems of these buildings and dispersed around the buildings. And a lot of people suspect now that may be a major trigger for asthma, one of the causes of asthma because so many people are allergic to or sensitive to cockroaches. I can tell you an anecdotal story about that if you'd like\u2026 GROSS: Please. Dr. EMLEN: \u2026that is sort of - okay. It's peripheral to what we've been talking about but when I was an undergraduate, I was hugely influenced by a professor of mine, a biologist and entomologist named George Ichor(ph), one of the greatest entomologists I ever met. And I remember driving across the country with him when I was a college undergraduate. He was an advisor to me. I was doing research out at a place called The Rocky Mountain Lab in Colorado. And we had to keep going way out our way - this was in the late '80s, this is before there was a Starbucks on every corner and you can get really good coffee. And he was fiercely addicted to caffeine - to coffee. And we'd have to drive way off the interstate to go find good coffee in that day. I mean, we'd go 45 minutes off our route to go find a place that had whole bean fresh ground coffee. And I remember giving him a really hard time because we were wasting a lot of travel time trying to feed his addiction because he need a coffee every couple of hours. And he finally explained to me he had to drink only sort of whole bean fresh ground coffee. And it was because of cockroaches. There's a point to this story which is that he found out the hard way from teaching entomology year after year after year, handling cockroaches - people used cockroaches as the lab rat for entomology labs - he got really badly allergic to them. So, he couldn't even touch cockroaches without getting an allergic reaction. And because of that he couldn't drink pre-ground coffee. And it turned out when he looked into it that pre-ground, you know, your big bulk coffee that you buy in a tin, is all processed from these huge stock piles of coffee. These piles of coffee, they get infested with cockroaches and there's really nothing they can do to filter that out. So, it all gets ground up in the coffee\u2026 GROSS: Oh. Dr. EMLEN: \u2026and he was actually allergic to pre-ground coffee because of that sort of spin off from having handled them teaching entomology for all those years. GROSS: Oh I don't know what to say, thank you for that marvelous insight. Dr. EMLEN: You may not want to put that on the air. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. EMLEN: For better or worse. GROSS: Oh, that's really upsetting. Dr. EMLEN: That is a true story. That according to this professor and how he related to me and we wasted many, many hours trying to find basically fresh ground whole bean coffee so that he didn't have to have an allergic reaction to the pre-ground. GROSS: Is there any other evidence besides this one person that there's\u2026 Dr. EMLEN: Oh, there is. GROSS: Yeah. Dr. EMLEN: This isn't my forte but I looked into it a little bit because I tell that story in my entomology classes. Technically speaking, if I'm not mistaken, the FDA regulates the percent by dry weight of food stuffs like this that can be ground insect parts and make sure that it doesn't end up being too much of the total. GROSS: Thank you. Dr. EMLEN: And it's small, it's a trace amount. Chocolate incidentally is the other one that - if you think of these huge piles of beans, of cocoa beans, all piled up that then gets ground up in to something we all love and eat. GROSS: Glad I asked, okay. (Soundbite of laughter) GROSS: Well, Doug Emlen, thank you so much for talking with us about the beetles that you've been studying. Dr. EMLEN: Oh thank you. It's been my pleasure too. GROSS: Doug Emlen is a biology professor at the University of Montana. You can find a slideshow of dung beetles and video of two beetles in combat on our Web site freshair. npr. org where you can also download podcasts of our show. Coming up, a Detroit label that got started in the '60s, recorded soul music and wasn't Motown. Ed Ward tells the story of Westbound Records. This is FRESH AIR.  TERRY GROSS, host:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.  Underneath the cow patties in the pasture and the monkey dung in the jungle, there's a miniature world of sex and violence. Dung beetles with fierce-looking horns are battling over female beetles, and my guest, Douglas Emlen, is studying them.  He's an expert on the evolution and development of bizarre or extreme shapes in insects. He's particularly interested in insect weaponry. Dung beetles have what he's looking for.  Lots of Emlen's work is in the lab, but he's also had some wild adventures collecting different families of dung beetles from around the world. Emlen is a professor of biology at the University of Montana. If you want to follow along, on our Web site there's a dung-beetle slide show and a video of two beetles battling. That's at freshair. npr. org.  Doug Emlen, welcome to FRESH AIR. Now I think it's fair to say that dung beetles wouldn't be most people's first choice of an animal to study. So what is unique about the dung beetle's armor that makes you so interested in studying them?  Mr. DOUGLAS EMLEN (Professor of Biology, University of Montana): There are a variety of things, and I guess I should first of all qualify that by saying they weren't my first choice of an organism, either. It's a hard thing to wake up in the morning and decide you're suddenly go out there and study dung beetles.  I started out trying to study some of the big rhinoceros beetles as a graduate student, and the project failed pretty spectacularly, and it was a biologist named Bill Eberhardt(ph) that took me under his wing after that failed project and said no, no, no. You're looking at the wrong beetles.  And he opened up this box, and it was full of all these little, tiny beetles that are the size of your pinky or even the size of an eraser on a new pencil. And he opens up the box, and it smells like horse manure, and I looked him, and I said those are dung beetles. There's no way I'm going to work on those things.  And he laughed at me at the time and told me I was a fool, and basically explained that for all the kinds of biology that I wanted to understand, genetics and behavior and diversity, these things were perfect. And since that time, to come back full circle to your question, the dung beetles have turned out to be an amazing system to study, and they've taught us so much about biology in many ways.  But you mentioned the weapons. The thing that first drew me to them is the spectacular diversity in their morphology. They have these incredible shapes, and most of the diversity in those shapes involves these weapons. And so for lack of a better analogy, these tiny, little insects - that again, as I said, are often the size of an eraser on a pencil, on a new pencil - these things are the insect equivalent of a bull elk or a male deer, and they have incredible weapons coming off of their bodies.  And you look across the species, and there's variation among the species. Sometimes the horns comes from the back of the head, sometimes from the front of the head, sometimes from the thorax, which is equivalent to sort of between your shoulder blades. Sometimes they're branched, forked, curved, straight. There's just an incredible variety of forms.  And I was interested as a biologist in how a little, tiny animal like that could strut around with these enormous weapons sticking off the side of their body and survive.  GROSS: You know what? It's kind of amazing, and I mean, not only do they have these weapons, like, some of them are like antlers. Some of them are like a rhinoceros horn. Some of them are like lobster pincers. But they also have, like, hair.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. EMLEN: Many of the horns - you mean the beetles or the horns?  GROSS: Well, the beetles, and yeah.  Mr. EMLEN: They do, and some of the horns in some of the species tend to have hair. We see that more often in the rhinoceros beetles than in the dung beetles, per se, but very often the sides of these horns are adorned with thick rows of hairs, and it's really sort of embarrassingly unknown what those things do.  There's a good chance that they are sensory structures so that when a male locks with another male, fighting, they can tell where the horns of the opponent male are because they're distending or pushing down all these fine hairs on the surface of the horn.  But some people think that the hairs might actually have chemo-detectors. They may be good for smell or for releasing signals. We don't know.  GROSS: I can tell you one thing for sure. They're not fashionable.  (Soundbite of laughter)  GROSS: They are really creepy looking.  Mr. EMLEN: That's a matter of opinion. I disagree. I think they're fantastic.  GROSS: Well, they are fantastic in a creepy kind of way. Let me ask you to describe one or two of the types of dung beetles that you find most fascinating in terms of their form and shape.  Mr. EMLEN: Sure. So one of the species of dung beetle that we spent quite a bit of time studying is - has the species name Taurus, as in the bull, and it actually has a pair of long, curved horns that extend upwards and backwards from the head of male beetles.  So it's a big, curled set of horns, and when the head is tucked back against the rest of the body, the horns sort of wrap in snugly around the equivalent of the shoulders or the thorax. But when these males are fighting, they pull their heads forward, and they've got quite an impressive pair of horns.  And we've looked at these beetles in a variety of ways and looked at what they do with the horns and who has the horns and who doesn't have the horns and how the horns develop, and all kinds of questions coming from that basic oddity of their morphology - the fact that they've got these huge weapons.  GROSS: You want to describe another one?  Mr. EMLEN: Sure. So one of my favorite species, unfortunately it's not one that we've been able to study in numbers, but it's one of the most spectacular of these beetles, is a species that actually was illustrated in Darwin's book, his treatise in which he initially described the whole theoretical concept of sexual selection, the process of biology that myself and so many other biologists study.  And in this beetle, the beetle is a brilliant, iridescent green color, turning sort of shimmering from a green to a yellow to a blue and in some angles even purple. So it has this beautiful sheen to it. And the males have a long, curved pair of horns that come up from the head that are much longer than the ones in the species I just described to you. And they have a branch in the middle of them with a tine that comes off and points inwards. And then at the very tips of the horns, it swells outwards into almost a little plate, so beautiful branched, curved horns coming off of this species.  GROSS: So the purpose of these weapons, the horns and the pincers, are basically to fight off other guys for girls.  Mr. EMLEN: Yup.  GROSS: So, like, the male dung beetles fight each other over the available female beetles.  Mr. EMLEN: They do, they do.  GROSS: So does that mean - have you watched them fight?  Mr. EMLEN: Oh yes, yes, many times.  GROSS: Oh, describe what a fight looks like.  Mr. EMLEN: It actually looks like pandemonium. It was not what we expected at all. So these are dung beetles, the ones that we're talking about right now, and so what happens in these cases are these beetles are very good at smelling their food source, and they follow these odor cues into the food. And when they find dung of the particular species that they feed on, they often have to deal with hundreds, and in some cases thousands of other individuals that are coming in and piling into that same place and competing to carve up and use that food resource.  So what happens is the beetles go instantly underground. They go right beneath the food source, the dung pile, so to speak, and the females actually excavate these burrows in the ground, and the males guard the entrances to these burrows. And they have big teeth-like spines on their legs, and they lock themselves, they brace themselves against the tunnel walls and try to prevent rival males from getting into the tunnels where the females are.  The females - these are amazing insects because they have elaborate parental-care behaviors. The females will take pieces of the dung down into the burrows and chew them up with their mouth parts and process them and pack them together into these sort of balls, these little sausages of buried dung underground. And then she'll excavate a chamber at the end of that and place an egg in there. And that's essentially the full food resource, like an allocate of food for each one of her offspring. And she'll do that, lay an egg and then close in the tunnel and then build another one of these balls and then close the tunnel. And we've watched these beetles do this.  The females will make 50, 100 different trips down into the ground for every single one of these eggs that she lays. And during this time, the male is guarding that tunnel, keeping everybody else away and mating with the female absolutely as often as he possibly can. And other males come and challenge.  And the fights take place inside these tunnels. And they scramble, and they push, and they pry, and they twist. And we tried forever to figure out how it is, exactly, that they use these horns because we wanted to know why would one species have a straight horn and another species have a curved horn and another species have a branched horn.  And we were assuming that we'd be able to pick up intricacies in the nature of these fights that would tell us why one species had one shape or another, and we failed. The fights are just chaos. We filmed hundreds of them, and they're amazing things to watch, but there's nothing predictable or repeatable about them except the outcome.  Somehow or other, bracing and twisting and prying and pushing and pulling and trying to get the other beetle out of the tunnel, somehow, at the end of the day, the male that has the longest horns and/or the largest body sizes typically is the one who wins. And the smaller males get pushed out of the tunnels and leave and go find another tunnel and try to push their way into that.  GROSS: So they just use these horns to bash away at their competition?  Mr. EMLEN: Yeah, I wouldn't call it bash. I would say they more use the horns to block the tunnel. You've got essentially a round or an egg-shaped animal blocking a tunnel, and they're very strong. So you have a rival pushing itself past, and it seems that the horns, regardless of what precise shape they take, seem to function like bars of a jail cell. They sort of block - they make it easier for a male inside the tunnel to block it so that another male can't push past.  But it's not as simple as that because they don't sit still. They twist and push and pry. But they don't stab with them. They aren't able to puncture the armor of the rival males. So they don't actually get injured in this process, and they don't really bash each other either, but they definitely spar and twist, sort of strength contests, I suppose.  But there's a twist to this story, too.  GROSS: Yeah?  Mr. EMLEN: Which is that the biggest males have the biggest weapons, and these are the ones that are usually the most successful at guarding that tunnel and at mating with the female inside the tunnel, but there are small males in these populations, too, and they don't produce the horns.  And so these small males look much more similar to a female. They don't have the big antlers or the big weapons, and they don't fight over the tunnels, either. They have a sneak tactic, a satellite tactic. What'll happen is they'll work their way into a tunnel and try to stay there, but they get kicked out right away by bigger males. And instead of going from tunnel to tunnel to tunnel to keep trying, they stay after they get kicked out, and they dig their own tunnel right next to the main tunnel. And after they get sort of a centimeter or so down below the ground, they cut horizontally, and they can intercept the guarded tunnel beneath the guarding male. And sometimes they're able to sneak in, zoom down to the female, mate with the female and get out again before the guarding male has essentially figured out what's going on.  So you've got big males with weapons fighting, and little, tiny sneak males without the weapons sneaking into these tunnels on the sly.  GROSS: So the less macho dung beetles still find a way.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. EMLEN: They try. I don't think that they're as successful as the larger, dominant males, but yes, they definitely find a way.  GROSS: Can you see the armor and the weapons with your naked eye?  Mr. EMLEN: Yes, but I've had some practice. I think the first thing - if somebody were to go out and look for this in their backyard, which is the other fun thing about this system is that these beetles live in so many different habitats and so many places that you'd be pretty hard-pressed to live anywhere where you couldn't go into a pasture or into the backyard and turn over a cow-manure pile and look underneath it and find some of these beetles. They're that abundant and that widespread.  So if you were to go out and look for these things yourself and tip over a cow pile and look at the dirt, maybe dig with a trowel into the first couple inches of the soil and turn it around, you'd find these beetles. They're often, in most habitats, certainly around most places in the U. S. - they would be on the order of half-a-centimeter to a centimeter long, and they're squat.  The beetles that I'm talking about with the weapons walk like little tortoises. They sort of jerk their way along. And you can pick them up and see the horns with the naked eye.  We often look at them under microscopes to take more precise measurements of these things, and we photograph them either using really good camera lenses, or sometimes scanning electron microscopes will take really good pictures of these things, as well. But you can definitely, for a lot of these beetles, pick them up out of the ground and look at them with a hand lens or with your naked eye and see these really cool weapons.  GROSS: My guest is Doug Emlen, a biology professor at the University of Montana. We'll talk more about his work studying dung beetles after a break. This is FRESH AIR.  (Soundbite of music)  GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is biologist Doug Emlen, and we're talking about his work studying dung beetles. And he studies them because he's interesting in insects who have armor, and a lot of dung beetles have really fascinating armor, horns and antlers and so on.  Now you've described these, like, you know, antler-like and branch-like weapons and armor and weapons that the dung beetles have, and they sound, like, really big compared to the size of the actual beetles. Aren't they kind of cumbersome to tote around? I mean, I know they need them to fight and to bar off the tunnels and prevent other males from getting in, but they also must really get in the way.  Mr. EMLEN: They do, and so to try to give you a sense for how much they get in the way, the analogy I like to use is that for some of these beetles, it would equivalent to you producing another leg and wearing it around on your head for your entire adult life.  GROSS: Wow.  Mr. EMLEN: That's the best analogy I can give you because when you - if you try to estimate how big these things are, in some of these cases the horn, the weapons, can be 10, 15, 20 percent of the body weight of the animal. That's a fifth of the total weight of the animal is allocated to this one thing.  And so it really is analogous to an extra leg on your head for your entire adult life, and it has to be costly. So we've used a variety of types of experiments to try to measure how costly it is, and we found, for example, if a male beetle puts a ton of resources into making a horn, it means that he has to stunt something else.  There's not enough resources left, in a sense, and so in some of these beetles, if they have really big horns, they have really small eyes. We found that in beetles that have horns on the back of their head, their eyes were 30-percent smaller as a result of having allocated everything to the weapons.  In another species, they actually trade off with the testes or with the wings. So there are costs associated with producing these big, bulky things.  GROSS: So what do these dung beetles say about evolution? What do you feel like you've learned about evolution from studying them?  Mr. EMLEN: Honestly I'd have to turn that on its head and say what haven't I learned about evolution from them. These beetles have taught us, and me in particular, an amazing amount of lessons, some good and some more frustrating. But the biggest question that I have been focusing on and that I think I've learned a ton from these beetles on has to do with the backdrop of animal diversity.  It's very hard to be an evolutionary biologist and not look around you and become sort of increasingly aware of the differences among animals that are out there. There's so much variation in the ways things act, the way they look, and it is sort of amplified, in a way, in these beetles.  The variation in shape, especially connected with these weapons, is truly stunning in this group of beetles. And so as a biologist, I'm obsessed with understanding where this diversity in form comes from. How did these big, gaudy structures arise, meaning what do the beetles use these for? How - you know, once we know how they're used in natural populations, we can ask questions like how did they evolve? Under what types of ecological or environmental circumstances are these weapons likely to evolve?  And then that leads us to the next question of why don't all these beetles have the same weapons? What is it about them or about their history or the ecologies and behaviors of these animals in the past that has caused weapon evolution to go one way in some populations and a different way in other populations - and for it to go in enough different ways in enough different species that we end up with the truly thousands of types of shapes and forms and locations for these weapons on their bodies.  And so there's sort of fundamental biological questions connected with animal diversity that we are tackling with these beetles.  GROSS: Although we've been talking about dung beetles and the kind of weapons that they have, you also study the rhino beetle, which is a much larger beetle. Let me read something from Wikipedia, and you can tell me if this is all true.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. EMLEN: Okay.  GROSS: Yeah, we looked it up.  Mr. EMLEN: Good for you.  GROSS: And it says that rhino beetles are among the largest of beetles. They are popular pets in Asia. They are clean, easy to maintain and safe to handle. Male beetles are used for gambling fights since they naturally compete for female beetles, with the winner knocking the other off a log. And they're also the strongest animals on the planet in relation to their own size. They can lift up to 850 times their own weight. All true?  Mr. EMLEN: I believe so. The last statistic I don't have personal experience with, and I might argue that the dung beetles are actually stronger than the rhino beetles, but the rest of that is definitely true, and I'm actually holding a giant rhinoceros beetle in my hand right now.  GROSS: Yikes. I wish I could see it.  Mr. EMLEN: Crawling up my arm.  GROSS: Oh gosh. You're in a studio in Montana, and I'm in a studio in Philadelphia. So we're not seeing each other, but I wish I could see that rhino beetle. Tell me what it looks like.  Mr. EMLEN: I will describe it to you. This male is about, almost four inches long, and he's a rich\u2026  GROSS: Wow, it's big.  Mr. EMLEN: \u2026brown, almost a purplish to brown to almost black color with a nice sheen to it and sort of golden hairs along the margins of his body, and the most striking feature of him, surprise, surprise, given what we've been talking about, is that on his head, he has an enormous horn.  This is a big branch structure that actually looks surprisingly like a pitchfork that extends upwards from his head, and in the biggest of these males, that pitchfork, that weapon, can be almost as long as the rest of the body of these males.  He also has another horn that's on the shoulder blades, the thorax, that comes up and curls a little bit forward and splits into two tips. But the horn that we're most excited about is this huge projection from the male's head that, you know, if I'm sitting here looking at the head and the eyes, the horn is probably 10 times the length of the male's head, and it comes up and splits into a Y, and then each of the tips of the Y split again so that you have these four points or tines at the T to this horn.  GROSS: Wow.  (Soundbite of laughter)  GROSS: I just wish\u2026  Mr. EMLEN: That's the horn. The beetles are four inches long.  GROSS: I just wish I were seeing it, wow. So\u2026  Mr. EMLEN: They prickle as they climb up your hands, same idea as with the dung beetles. They've got teeth or points on their legs that they use to brace themselves in contests, and spines on the legs that they do the same thing with, and when they grab you, they can prick you a little bit with the spines, but otherwise they're completely harmless. They feed, as adults, on rotting fruit. We keep them on apples, and basically sliced applies is what they'll quite happily feed on as adults. And they wouldn't be capable of biting you, even if you tried to get them to.  And they are kept as pets, not here. This is a species that we import with permits from the United States Department of Agriculture and we have to keep contained. But in Asia, where these things are native, they're very common pets. In fact, I'm told that you can buy the larvae in vending machines, and you can get the diet for these things in grocery stores. And kids really do keep them as pets. They're fantastic pets, and they do fight.  They put them on bamboo sticks and battle the males and, I believe, gamble on which of the males will win. I haven't actually done that firsthand, but I've seen plenty of photographs of kids doing that.  GROSS: It sounds like the cockfighting of the insect world.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. EMLEN: I think it is.  GROSS: Doug Emlen will be back in the second half of the show. He's a biology professor at the University of Montana. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.  (Soundbite of music)  GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Who knew that dung beetles living beneath animal manure could be so fascinating? Let's get back to our interview with Doug Emlen, a biology professor at the University of Montana, who's an expert on the evolution and development of bizarre or extreme shapes in insects. He's particularly interested in insect weaponry and dung beetles have what he's looking for. The males are armed with bizarre looking horns, which they use to fight over female beetles.  If you want to see what we're talking about, go to our Web site freshair. npr. org where you'll find a dung beetle fight show and a video of two beetles fighting. One of the things that amaze me, I guess, particularly about the smaller dung beetles, is that there's just like invisible world of - this world, that - that you don't know - that at least I don't know - is out there in which, you know, insects are like waging war with weapons and armor and competing.  Dr. EMLEN: And sneak tactics.  GROSS: And sneak tactics, yeah - all like, you know, for the love of a good woman.  (Soundbite of laughter)  GROSS: You know, to mate with a female. So there's this whole world of like sex and violence, you know that's kind of invisible to us and is even happening underneath like cow manure.  Dr. EMLEN: I love that fact about these beetles actually. That's one of my favorite things about them is that this whole story is unfolding in most people's backyard. So just to give you a feel that one genus of the dung beetles that we work on, so one sort of taxonomic grouping of these beetles, there are two thousands species already described.  GROSS: Wow.  Dr. EMLEN: Probably another thousand species waiting to be described. The center of diversity for that group of beetles is Africa. But they occur in all continents accept Antarctica. And they feed on just about any kind of dung you can imagine. I mean, pretty much if you can think of an animal that produces a decent respectable quantity of manure there almost certainly is a beetle in this particular genus somewhere that is specialized on feeding on it. So these battles really do happen everywhere, in every habitat I've ever seen.  On every continent or country that I've ever been to. And it's the same basic story - the weapons are different. Sometimes they're on one part of the body, sometimes on another, sometimes they're branched, sometimes they're curved. But the story is basically the same. They dig these tunnels under the ground. It could be rabbit dung or deer dung, or elephant dung, or giraffe dung or cow manure but the beetles are still going to fly into the food source. They're still going to dig a tunnel into the ground underneath.  The males are probably still going to fight over the entrance to that tunnel. I'll be willing to bet you there are small sneak males that are still going to try to get into that tunnel on the fly. And you have this whole interesting dynamic, rich, behavioral system, taking place underground in every one of these habitats, on every one of these types of food sources.  GROSS: Tell us about one of your greatest adventures searching for dung beetles around the world.  Dr. EMLEN: Sure. There actually are a number, you wouldn't think that collecting dung beetles would be that adventurous but the truth might surprise you. So we have taken dug out canoes into the lowland forests of Ecuador searching for beetles. And we've sloshed through flooded pastures with leeches and wallabies in Australia. But the most common source of sort of danger or adventure collecting beetles is actually bulls. And if you can imagine we spend a lot of time in cow pastures. Well there's a lot of bulls in these pastures. And I think I can say that I have been charged full out by bulls on five different continents now and treed by them on three.  So we even had one time where I was charged by a cape buffalo in Africa. We had permits to collect beetles in the Serengeti. And they don't normally like you to get out of your vehicles in the Serengeti but in this case they were willing to help us to try to get the beetles. And we had armed guards standing on the roofs of the vehicles spotting for us to make sure that the cape buffalo didn't get too close. And we were out there diligently poking away and trying to find the beetles in the Serengeti and they were calling out the distances - 100 meters, 90 meters, 80 meters, 70, 50 run. And they would - and we would grab everything and leap back into the vehicle and get past there without getting charged by the cape buffalo, too close for comfort. But yeah, that was probably the most hair-raising opportunity to collect beetles.  GROSS: Do the guards think you're kind of crazy risking - taking risks like this to collect dung beetles?  Dr. EMLEN: They do. I have to say that's one of the pleasant side effects of this type of an occupation is that I often have to go out into places and introduce myself to complete strangers, to ask permission to collect on their land or in this case to ask the guards if they'd be willing to help us collect in the Serengeti. And they always want to sit down and talk to you about where you're from and what you do. And you meet some wonderful people that way but I think - I think more than a few of them thought we are a little bit nuts.  GROSS: So you have traveled around the world collecting dung beetles. Have you ever been surrounded by more dung beetles than you cared to?  Dr. EMLEN: Yes. And that would definitely have been in Africa. There is no place quite like Africa for dung beetles. And we'd heard about the numbers of beetles that you can encounter but I until I actually saw it first hand it was pretty hard to imagine. So it was actually the same trip in the Serengeti where we had the armed guards and we were trying not to get charged by the cape buffalo.  We happened across elephant dung in the road, and I realize normal people don't do this, but we hopped out of the car and collected the elephant dung in a Tupperware bin and brought it back to the campground where we were staying that evening. And I remember with the bunch of the students we all had headlights on and we set out to the edge of camp and placed the elephant dung out on the ground to see what we could find. And I sat there with my clipboard, trying to take notes on the beetles that came in and the beetles started coming in faster and faster and faster.  And pretty quickly it was impossible to see anything because there were all buzzing and circling around our headlights and then a couple of minutes later they were starting to pour out of the sky so fast that I couldn't even take notes on my clipboard because my clipboard was covered with literally an inch of solid beetles. They were going down our necks. They were in our hair. They were in our faces and finally by the end, this sounds like an exaggeration, but it's not, it was as if somebody stood over us with a bucket full of beetles and poured it steadily out on top.  The beetles absolutely covered absolutely covered the elephant dung - tens, probably hundreds of thousands of them came within minutes and we were utterly overwhelmed.  GROSS: So different dung beetles feed on different kinds of dung. Now I understand in Australia they actually had to import a certain kind of dung beetle because they needed it and there weren't any anymore or weren't enough.  Dr. EMLEN: That's true. So Australia has an interesting and rich native fauna of dung beetles. So there's a number of native species that are there, many of which have really cool horns incidentally. But the problem that Australia had was that when they clear cut a lot of the forests to create space for cattle, which was an important part of the economic development in Australia, it turned out that all of the native dung beetle species were specialists of forests.  And none of their native species would cross that barrier and sort of move from the woods out into the open. And from a beetle's perspective out in the open in the sun and a pasture is a very, very different environment then in the shade of a forest and so they had this problem of tons and tons of cattle and just obscene amounts of cow manure and no native beetles that were bearing it. And so the cow - I've seen photographs of pastures in Australia that are literally cow pat, to cow pat, to cow pat as far as the eye can see - just nonstop.  And what happened was they started getting flies that were sort of pest flies that went ballistic in this food source and were driving everybody crazy. And so Australia did a really good job of researching this problem. They went to Africa and to Europe, and they researched dung beetle species and found species that only lived in pastures. And they had this test, I mean, they basically tried to only find species that would not go into the woods. They would stay only in the pastures. And they picked these species and they bred them in captivity and then they had to do all these sort of quarantine procedures to bring them into Australia.  And then they bred them in captivity in Australia and they did controlled releases of these beetles. And it's taken - it's been a success. They now have a number of species that are very well established that bury the dung in pasture habitats. And because they went for that extra step of incorporating the biology of these beetles and finding species that didn't go into the woods that the introduced species have not, as far as I know, replaced or driven extinct any of the native species.  GROSS: Now you have described how dung beetles live, you know, largely underneath dung patties but don't some dung beetles actually live on the butts of animals.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. EMLEN: Yes. So, again the dung beetles have diversified incredibly and part of that diversity has to do with specializing on different types of dung or different types of food. And there are beetles in the same genus - the same group that we talked about, the 2,000 species worldwide - there are species that have been described that are specialists for either koala dung or sloth dung. And in these cases, these are animals that move very slowly and they bury their dung. They'll climb down to the bottom of a tree and dig a horn and bury their dung underground.  If you can be at the right place at the right time, that's fantastic. It's a great way to have your food, have it buried on top of you and have all your eggs develop without any competition because nobody else finds it. And so what these beetles do is they actually ride around on the animals and they have specialized hooks on their legs that help them cling to the fur and they cling basically near the rear end of these animals. And they ride with the koala or with the sloth and when these animals go to the bathroom they hop off, go lay their eggs and climb back on again and wait for the next time. So it is true. Dung beetles do some pretty amazing things.  GROSS: My guest is Doug Emlen. He is the biology professor at the University of Montana. We'll talk more about his work studying dung beetles after a break. This is FRESH AIR.  (Sounbite of music)  GROSS: If you're just joining us my guest is Doug Emlen. And we're talking about his work as a biologist who studies dung beetles. And he studies dung beetles because they have bizarre forms, because they have armor, they have horns and antlers and\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  GROSS: \u2026all kinds of surprising things. But my impression of the beetles that you study based on the enlarged photos that I have seen is that they look really prehistoric because of the antlers and the armor and the pincers and the, you know, the horns - all the assorted weaponry. Are they prehistoric? Do they date back to the same era as the dinosaurs?  Dr. EMLEN: They do. There's reasonably - well, so if you use the types of tools that I alluded to a little while ago to reconstruct the history of these beetles. There are a number of studies now that have come up with pretty solid dates for how old these groups of animals are. So the dung beetles that we talked about so far, we spent most of our time talking about the group of dung beetles that I said are 2,000 species in it, that genus or that group of beetles we think dates back about 40 million years.  But that group of dung beetles is related to other dung beetles that date back further than that. And those beetles shared a common ancestor with the rhinoceros beetles, maybe a 150 million years ago. And so we definitely are talking about groups of these horned beetles that go back as far as the dinosaurs. And there is fairly compelling evidence that they were dung beetles back then in the sense that there are fossil coprolite, or scat, from dinosaurs that have burrows in them that resemble the burrows that we see made by present day dung beetles.  So it's circumstantial evidence at the moment but the histories that we reconstruct using molecular evidence, or using the sequences of DNA, also suggests that these lineages of beetles go back that far. So yes, I'd be willing to bet that there were beetles digging around underneath the dung of Tyrannosaurus rex or many of the other dinosaurs, the ceratopsids is for example, which also have really cool weapons like triceratops and styracosaurus. I'll bet you there were dung beetles crawling around under there and I'll bet you that beetles had horns too.  They probably did something not too different from what they do in people's backyards today - dug tunnels into the ground and fought over those tunnels with their weapons.  GROSS: So you've studied these beetles and they're really fascinating. How tolerant are you of insects that we regard as pests? Like, if you have ants or cockroaches that you find in your home, are you going to be fascinated by them or do you - do you want to just get rid of them as soon as possible?  Dr. EMLEN: Here is where I'm going to get in trouble with the pesticide industry. I actually would never spray for those things in my house because teaching entomology has taught me a great deal about the neurological and carcinogenic side effects of many of the things that we use to kill insects. So, the answer is I love just about all kinds of insects although cockroaches are an interesting one. Even most of the entomologists I knew don't like cockroaches, although they have amazing diversity in their parental care behavior. There's species where they carry the young around on their backs.  There's species of cockroaches that have the equivalent of a pregnancy. They actually will nurse their young, their eggs inside their bodies until they hatch. So it's a long developmental period inside their bodies and then when they hatch they have glands on their body that they feed these young with, which is just like nursing in humans. So cockroaches do some interesting things. And no I don't kill cockroaches.  There are a few types of spiders that I will squash with a paper towel and that's only because there's a chance that they have a necrotic bite, a dangerous bite, and we've got young kids and I don't take that chance. So if it looks like a hobo spider, I'll squash it. Otherwise everything else in our house lives.  GROSS: So, let me ask you, you said that, you know, entomologists who study insects are more negative about cockroaches and other insects, so even entomologists don't like cockroaches. I certainly empathize\u2026  Dr. EMLEN: I'm going to get in trouble for saying that\u2026  GROSS: \u2026they have my full support in this.  Dr. EMLEN: as I'm there are exceptions in everything.  GROSS: \u2026but why do you think that even entomologists don't like cockroaches?  Dr. EMLEN: I shouldn't have said that. I'm already going to regret it. But I knew - I know several entomologists that they have not liked cockroaches. For one thing many, many people are allergic to cockroaches. They have - basically cockroaches developing in your house or in a building, shed their cuticle, their skeleton and their skin as the molt as they grow. And they also have (unintelligible) or feces that they produce  and these have chemical residues on them that many, many people are allergic to. And, I mean, I hate to say this on record but you'd be hard pressed to find any building probably in this country that's not infested with cockroaches at some level or another. Certainly all public buildings, they're - it's impossible to keep these things completely gone. And what happens is then the shed pieces of cuticles and frass get picked up in the air duct systems of these buildings and dispersed around the buildings.  And a lot of people suspect now that may be a major trigger for asthma, one of the causes of asthma because so many people are allergic to or sensitive to cockroaches. I can tell you an anecdotal story about that if you'd like\u2026  GROSS: Please.  Dr. EMLEN: \u2026that is sort of - okay. It's peripheral to what we've been talking about but when I was an undergraduate, I was hugely influenced by a professor of mine, a biologist and entomologist named George Ichor(ph), one of the greatest entomologists I ever met. And I remember driving across the country with him when I was a college undergraduate. He was an advisor to me. I was doing research out at a place called The Rocky Mountain Lab in Colorado. And we had to keep going way out our way - this was in the late '80s, this is before there was a Starbucks on every corner and you can get really good coffee.  And he was fiercely addicted to caffeine - to coffee. And we'd have to drive way off the interstate to go find good coffee in that day. I mean, we'd go 45 minutes off our route to go find a place that had whole bean fresh ground coffee. And I remember giving him a really hard time because we were wasting a lot of travel time trying to feed his addiction because he need a coffee every couple of hours. And he finally explained to me he had to drink only sort of whole bean fresh ground coffee. And it was because of cockroaches. There's a point to this story which is that he found out the hard way from teaching entomology year after year after year, handling cockroaches - people used cockroaches as the lab rat for entomology labs - he got really badly allergic to them. So, he couldn't even touch cockroaches without getting an allergic reaction. And because of that he couldn't drink pre-ground coffee. And it turned out when he looked into it that pre-ground, you know, your big bulk coffee that you buy in a tin, is all processed from these huge stock piles of coffee. These piles of coffee, they get infested with cockroaches and there's really nothing they can do to filter that out. So, it all gets ground up in the coffee\u2026  GROSS: Oh.  Dr. EMLEN: \u2026and he was actually allergic to pre-ground coffee because of that sort of spin off from having handled them teaching entomology for all those years.  GROSS: Oh I don't know what to say, thank you for that marvelous insight.  Dr. EMLEN: You may not want to put that on the air.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. EMLEN: For better or worse.  GROSS: Oh, that's really upsetting.  Dr. EMLEN: That is a true story. That according to this professor and how he related to me and we wasted many, many hours trying to find basically fresh ground whole bean coffee so that he didn't have to have an allergic reaction to the pre-ground.  GROSS: Is there any other evidence besides this one person that there's\u2026  Dr. EMLEN: Oh, there is.  GROSS: Yeah.  Dr. EMLEN: This isn't my forte but I looked into it a little bit because I tell that story in my entomology classes. Technically speaking, if I'm not mistaken, the FDA regulates the percent by dry weight of food stuffs like this that can be ground insect parts and make sure that it doesn't end up being too much of the total.  GROSS: Thank you.  Dr. EMLEN: And it's small, it's a trace amount. Chocolate incidentally is the other one that - if you think of these huge piles of beans, of cocoa beans, all piled up that then gets ground up in to something we all love and eat.  GROSS: Glad I asked, okay.  (Soundbite of laughter)  GROSS: Well, Doug Emlen, thank you so much for talking with us about the beetles that you've been studying.  Dr. EMLEN: Oh thank you. It's been my pleasure too.  GROSS: Doug Emlen is a biology professor at the University of Montana.

I'm Ira Flatow. Fifty years ago this week, C. P. Snow delivered a lecture that incited controversy among intellectual circles. Snow is both a scientist and a novelist, so he straddled two worlds. He described the polarization of scientists and literary types, a situation where one group neither talked or communicated with the other. It's what he called the two cultures. And here's a bit of the lecture that describes what he was talking about. Let me read it to you from the lecture itself. Literary intellectuals at one pole - at the other - scientists, and as the most representative, the physical scientists. Between the two, a gulf of mutual incomprehension, sometimes, particularly among the young, hostility and dislike. But most of all, lack of understanding. They have a curious distorted image of each other. Their attitudes are so different that even on the level of emotion, they can't find much common ground. Non-scientists tend to think of scientists as brash and boastful. They hear Mr. T. S. Eliot, who, just for illustrations, we can take as an archetypal figure saying that his attempts to revive verse drama that we can hope for very little. But that he would feel content if he and his coworkers could prepare the ground for a new kind of a Kyd or a new Greene. And it goes on and on and on to talk about this gulf. And, as I say, it's 50 years ago this week. That was his lecture there. And how much of that has changed? Am - what kind of gulf do we still have with intellectuals and scientists? And here to discuss that speech and the impact is Charles Seife. He is professor at New York University's Journalism Institute of - there at NYU. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Professor CHARLES SEIFE (New York University Journalism Institute): Thank you very much for having me. FLATOW: What is the history? Why did he decide to write this? And there must be a context this all happened. Prof. SEIFE: Yeah. It's - well, this is a subject that goes back to dawn of times, even before science existed. Back in Socratic times, there is a Socratic dialogue, where Socrates talks about the astronomer Thales as being so absorbed in finding out natural sciences, looking at the stars, that he can't see what's before him at his very feet. He falls into a pit and everyone laughs at him. So there's always been kind of philosophers laughing at these scientists who are caught up in getting their hands dirty - dirt. But about the time that Snow was lecturing, this was 1959, the Cold War was very, very hot. The hydrogen bombs had just been exploded and they were spewing fallout into the atmosphere. FLATOW: Right. Prof. SEIFE: Eisenhower was going to warn about the military-industrial complex and the scientific-industrial complex. And so there was this growing fear about what science was doing to society. And at the same time you had literary intellectuals who abstracted themselves. They said that these scientists were mere tools, mere makers of gadgets. And they had no real depth to them. So they saw the destruction that was being caused by science. And they felt that true beauty, true truth had to be found through literature, through poetry, T. S. Eliot. FLATOW: Philosophy. Prof. SEIFE: Yeah, through philosophy. FLATOW: Right. And so in steps C. P. Snow, who has straddled both sides, right? He's a novelist. He's a scientist. And what motivates him to take up this cause in trying to bridge the two, or at least explain the two? Prof. SEIFE: Well, he felt he was very comfortable with both worlds. But, in fact, he was not a very good novelist. And he was not a very good scientist. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. SEIFE: His scientific background, he was working in the Cavendish lab in the 1930s. And he tried to synthesize vitamin A and he failed. He actually had to retract the paper. And so he gave up science. He wound up working for the British government and doing a very good job at organizing science. But he himself, his scientific career was not very good. He was a popular novelist, but his novels really don't seem to have lived on. I have never read of a C. P. Snow novel. I don't think very many of the audience have. FLATOW: No, yeah. Prof. SEIFE: But he felt that he had seen this literary intellectual scorn of science. And he felt he wanted to address it because he felt that science was the way of the future, that he had this technophilic idea that science could bring peace and prosperity to Africa and to poor portions of the world. FLATOW: Yeah. He would solve hunger, world hunger, things like that. Prof. SEIFE: That's right. And so he felt that what was in the way was the fact that the British intellectuals were standing away from scientists, and they did not want to engage. And as a result, no one could bring science to the populous, to the public and make it work for a utopian earth. FLATOW: And he felt that if you really were a well-rounded, well-educated person, you should not only just be able to quote Shakespeare but you should be able to quote some of the laws of thermodynamics, right, if you really were well-educated? Prof. SEIFE: Absolutely. Absolutely. He noted - and I think that this is absolutely true, that someone who says, I don't - I've read Shakespeare is considered ignorant. But someone who doesn't know the second law of thermodynamics is not, even though this is fundamental to science. Even today, you get people - I guess, there was a host of \"The View\" who not so long ago expressed ignorance about whether the Earth was flat or not. FLATOW: Wow. Prof. SEIFE: And it was only slightly embarrassing. FLATOW: Well, 1-800-989-8255 is our number. 1-800-989-8255. Talking about C. P. Snow's \"Two Cultures\" lecture with Charles Seife. And there was a famous film on called the \"Private Universe. \" You may be familiar with this. It was movie, it was documentary, sort of a teaching tool made around 1990, I'm going to say, in which some scientists, some physicists, I think, took a camera, set up their video camera at the graduating class at Harvard, and just asked all 35 or so members and all - or anybody else they could pull in if they knew why it was hotter in the summer than it was in the wintertime. And only two or three out of the whole population - understood that it's not because the earth is closer to the sun. Prof. SEIFE: That's - it's true that, I mean, we're strikingly ignorant as a society about some very basic facts. The archetypal question that a parent can't answer is, why is the sky blue? FLATOW: Right, right. Prof. SEIFE: It isn't that hard. And to accept the fact that, okay, this is something that is imponderable, that I can't answer, that's beyond me, really, really appalled Snow and it appalls scientists today. FLATOW: Is the gap still here, do you think? Is it as wide, is it narrow, or a different kind of gap? Prof. SEIFE: I think it's still there. I think that scientists have a very difficult time popularizing, in part, because they do inhabit a separate culture in the anthropological sense. They speak a different language. They assume different things. They speak amongst themselves and don't quite understand non-scientists in the same way and vice versa. And I think that, occasionally, when you have a scientist straying outside of the culture trying to popularize he is scorned. Carl Sagan, in the '90s, was denied entrance to the National Academy of Sciences, and it was a heated floor debate. And apparently, one of the reasons given - that he was a great popularizer, he was a lightweight but he was spending all the time working on getting the public to understand and nothing on science, which was not true. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255. Kate(ph) in Binghamton, New York. Hi, Kate. KATE (Caller): Hi, Ira. How are you? FLATOW: Fine. How are you? KATE: Fabulous. I definitely understand what you mean between this rift between the scientific and the literary. I go to the university right now and my boyfriend is a Latin major, so we see this rift between our own studies at all times. But my question is, how are we going to bridge this gap? How are we going to bring science to the community? I know vessels like this show are great for that but how else are we going to bridge the gap between science and the literary aspects? FLATOW: Charles, got any suggestions? Prof. SEIFE: Well, I think this is a start. This is a great show. But, you know, there's always been popularizers. Michael Faraday, in the 1850s, was giving a set of public lectures to English common people, trying to explain cutting-edge physics. And it was very popular, but the rift remains. And you have wonderful books throughout the ages, both fiction and nonfiction, that attempt to get science and scientists to the public. And it inspires some, and yet the rift remains. I know a number of biologists who were inspired by Aerosmith. . . FLATOW: But you can - and maybe Kate, this is true of Binghamton but, you know, you can go through the best four-year college - in this private universe that was at Harvard. And people are proud that they spent four years in college and never took one science course, and they consider themselves to be educated people. KATE: Yes. I'm trying to force my boyfriend to take intro to cell and molecular biology next semester, since I major - excuse me, I minored in Latin. FLATOW: Why - that's the deal? Why not just a science for non-science majors course or something like that, you know, as a requirement to get a bachelor's degree? KATE: We do have a science course. We actually - you must take a lab of some kind here, whether it be rocks for jocks or astronomy. You have to take some kind of science here at Binghamton, which is great because it does expose people to some of these fundamental ideas, only if you're just skimming the surface. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. All right. Thanks for calling, Kate. KATE: Thanks. FLATOW: Good luck getting your boyfriend to take that course. (Soundbite of laughter) KATE: Thanks. FLATOW: Bye-bye. 1-800-989-8255. We do have, I guess, now more popular media. You have Neil Tyson on the \"Daily Show,\" things like that. Johnny Carson, for years brought astronomers on there. That's where Carl Sagan got his first start with the public. Prof. SEIFE: Yeah. And Carl Sagan's \"Cosmos\" inspired - I mean, if you speak to today's generation of astronomers, a whole bunch of them have been inspired by it. So, it does have an effect. But this cultural rift between science and I'd say, even non-science more than humanities, science is a different way of looking at the world. And it's hard to acquire - it's foreign in many ways. So, I think there's always going to be some difference between scientists and non-scientists. FLATOW: And I think we have another rift that was not as evident then, and I think it's a rift between science and religion. You know, that's become a much bigger gap, I think, than the science and intellectualism. Prof. SEIFE: Oh, absolutely. And it's - it doesn't need to be that way. FLATOW: Right. Prof. SEIFE: In fact, speaking of astronomy, the Vatican's ex-astronomer George Coyne is very, very pro-evolution. He is trying to explain to the public you can accept evolution and still believe in Christ, in his case. And so, the fact that science seems to be clashing with religion, it's getting worst since - I mean, since the Scopes Monkey trial in the 1920s. FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah. Prof. SEIFE: That is fairly - especially in American society, it's gotten worst over the years. FLATOW: It certainly has. David(ph) in Ann Arbor. Hi, David. DAVID (Caller): Hi. I just wanted to comment that the situation your guest describes isn't just true in science. I teach history. And study after study shows that Americans are incredibly ignorant of their history and of the history of other peoples and cultures. And your guest talking about Carl Sagan rang a bell with me. Stephen Ambrose, a historian with Ph. D. after his name, was ripped by academic historians because he was a popularizer, he wasn't a real historian. So I think that the trend goes beyond science. FLATOW: Okay. Good point. Any comment about that? Prof. SEIFE: I think that's absolutely true. Any field of deep knowledge, they kind of try to isolate themselves with their own language and their own ideas. And after a certain point it becomes almost anathema to try to break down those language barriers. FLATOW: And now that science is so specialized, the language is even more specialized. You can't tell somebody else what you do. Prof. SEIFE: Yeah. Biologists don't understand what physicists are writing about. Physicists don't understand what biologists are writing about. It's crazy sometimes. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let's see if we - go to the phones. And let me remind everybody that this is SCIENCE FRIDAY on NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow with Charles Seife of NYU. Let's see how many calls we can get it before we have to go. Let's go to Dane(ph) in Orleans, Mass. Hi, Dane. DANE (Caller): Orleans, Mass, yes. Hello. Yeah, as a prelude to my remark, I hated science in college and now I love it. I was a music major, but now I really love it. (Unintelligible)\u2026 FLATOW: What turned you around? DANE: Reading Fritjof Capra's \"The Tao of Physics. \" FLATOW: Wow. DANE: Yeah. FLATOW: You're dating yourself now. DANE: That's all right. That's fine with me. (Soundbite of laughter) DANE: I mean, I don't take too much stock in that book, but it really opened my eyes to physics and what it defines. But - and in ecology, I got, you know, in the environmental movement. But I want to say that I think popular songs contribute a lot to American scientifical literacy. FLATOW: Popular songs? DANE: Yes. FLATOW: In what way and why? DANE: Well, look at - let me give you an example. The Beach Boys have a beautiful song called \"Warmth of the Sun,\" right. But one line in it is, like my love for you, the - like the warmth of the sun my love for you will last forever. The sun's not going to last forever. Sun is going to burn out in five billion years. FLATOW: Well, you haven't got one romantic bone in your body. (Soundbite of laughter) DANE: Or catch a falling star and put it in your pocket. Come on. If a star ever fell, there'd be nothing left of the Earth, come on. FLATOW: Okay. We get your point. DANE: All right. FLATOW: Thanks for calling. A little bit extreme. No literary license there at all or - but maybe he has some sort of point that there aren't enough songs in popular culture. So if they paved paradise and put up a parking lot, you know? Prof. SEIFE: I think there's a They Might Be Giants' song saying that the sun is a ball of incandescent gas, which is pretty good. FLATOW: Yeah. Well, you know, there are - we do see though that science in popular culture does have a tendency to change things. I'm thinking about three-mile island and then the film - what was\u2026 Prof. SEIFE: \"China Syndrome. \" FLATOW: \"China Syndrome,\" things like that\u2026 Prof. SEIFE: Oh, yeah. Absolutely. FLATOW: \u2026that were influential. Prof. SEIFE: And Keanu Reeves as a quantum physicist solving our world's energy crisis with cold fusion. FLATOW: Cold fusion. Prof. SEIFE: Popular culture is very important in the way people perceive science. And of course, the mad scientist is the classic trope that - from 'Frankenstein\" on that movies love. FLATOW: And there's Al Gore, not to link him with the mad scientist, but his movie was seen by millions of people. Prof. SEIFE: And I don't know whether it's just a coincidence, but I think that that helped turned the tide of belief in global warming. FLATOW: Do you have any suggestions beside this show? I mean, in colleges, how colleges and universities might help out to cross this boundary? Prof. SEIFE: It's always a tough one. I think not only forcing students to take\u2026 FLATOW: Will that do anything, to force them, you know? Are they going to come away saying, well, I just have to take this course and not appreciate it? Prof. SEIFE: Well, at least my - for me, it seems that when you're forced to take courses that you don't necessarily want to take but it's assumed that to do that you have - to be a literate person, you have to take that, it opens your mind to it. And I was forced to take some classics courses\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Prof. SEIFE: \u2026and it opened my mind to what was going on in history and Greek democracy. So I think at least a little exposure can do a great deal of good. FLATOW: I think that's a good way to end - I think there should be some sort of science course that everybody has, whether they call it rocks for jocks, which I kind of like that one, or astronomy. But some introductory, so you see why at least scientists love what they're doing. Prof. SEIFE: Just as you're forced to read \"Shakespeare\" and the \"Bible. \" FLATOW: Yeah. There you go. Okay. A good way to end it, Charles. Thank you very much. Charles Seife is an author and professor at NYU's Journalism Institute.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow.  Fifty years ago this week, C. P. Snow delivered a lecture that incited controversy among intellectual circles. Snow is both a scientist and a novelist, so he straddled two worlds. He described the polarization of scientists and literary types, a situation where one group neither talked or communicated with the other. It's what he called the two cultures. And here's a bit of the lecture that describes what he was talking about. Let me read it to you from the lecture itself.  Literary intellectuals at one pole - at the other - scientists, and as the most representative, the physical scientists. Between the two, a gulf of mutual incomprehension, sometimes, particularly among the young, hostility and dislike. But most of all, lack of understanding. They have a curious distorted image of each other. Their attitudes are so different that even on the level of emotion, they can't find much common ground.  Non-scientists tend to think of scientists as brash and boastful. They hear Mr. T. S. Eliot, who, just for illustrations, we can take as an archetypal figure saying that his attempts to revive verse drama that we can hope for very little. But that he would feel content if he and his coworkers could prepare the ground for a new kind of a Kyd or a new Greene.  And it goes on and on and on to talk about this gulf. And, as I say, it's 50 years ago this week. That was his lecture there. And how much of that has changed? Am - what kind of gulf do we still have with intellectuals and scientists? And here to discuss that speech and the impact is Charles Seife. He is professor at New York University's Journalism Institute of - there at NYU. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Professor CHARLES SEIFE (New York University Journalism Institute): Thank you very much for having me.  FLATOW: What is the history? Why did he decide to write this? And there must be a context this all happened.  Prof. SEIFE: Yeah. It's - well, this is a subject that goes back to dawn of times, even before science existed. Back in Socratic times, there is a Socratic dialogue, where Socrates talks about the astronomer Thales as being so absorbed in finding out natural sciences, looking at the stars, that he can't see what's before him at his very feet. He falls into a pit and everyone laughs at him.  So there's always been kind of philosophers laughing at these scientists who are caught up in getting their hands dirty - dirt. But about the time that Snow was lecturing, this was 1959, the Cold War was very, very hot. The hydrogen bombs had just been exploded and they were spewing fallout into the atmosphere.  FLATOW: Right.  Prof. SEIFE: Eisenhower was going to warn about the military-industrial complex and the scientific-industrial complex. And so there was this growing fear about what science was doing to society. And at the same time you had literary intellectuals who abstracted themselves. They said that these scientists were mere tools, mere makers of gadgets. And they had no real depth to them.  So they saw the destruction that was being caused by science. And they felt that true beauty, true truth had to be found through literature, through poetry, T. S. Eliot.  FLATOW: Philosophy.  Prof. SEIFE: Yeah, through philosophy.  FLATOW: Right. And so in steps C. P. Snow, who has straddled both sides, right? He's a novelist. He's a scientist. And what motivates him to take up this cause in trying to bridge the two, or at least explain the two?  Prof. SEIFE: Well, he felt he was very comfortable with both worlds. But, in fact, he was not a very good novelist. And he was not a very good scientist.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Prof. SEIFE: His scientific background, he was working in the Cavendish lab in the 1930s. And he tried to synthesize vitamin A and he failed. He actually had to retract the paper. And so he gave up science. He wound up working for the British government and doing a very good job at organizing science. But he himself, his scientific career was not very good.  He was a popular novelist, but his novels really don't seem to have lived on. I have never read of a C. P. Snow novel. I don't think very many of the audience have.  FLATOW: No, yeah.  Prof. SEIFE: But he felt that he had seen this literary intellectual scorn of science. And he felt he wanted to address it because he felt that science was the way of the future, that he had this technophilic idea that science could bring peace and prosperity to Africa and to poor portions of the world.  FLATOW: Yeah. He would solve hunger, world hunger, things like that.  Prof. SEIFE: That's right. And so he felt that what was in the way was the fact that the British intellectuals were standing away from scientists, and they did not want to engage. And as a result, no one could bring science to the populous, to the public and make it work for a utopian earth.  FLATOW: And he felt that if you really were a well-rounded, well-educated person, you should not only just be able to quote Shakespeare but you should be able to quote some of the laws of thermodynamics, right, if you really were well-educated?  Prof. SEIFE: Absolutely. Absolutely. He noted - and I think that this is absolutely true, that someone who says, I don't - I've read Shakespeare is considered ignorant. But someone who doesn't know the second law of thermodynamics is not, even though this is fundamental to science. Even today, you get people - I guess, there was a host of \"The View\" who not so long ago expressed ignorance about whether the Earth was flat or not.  FLATOW: Wow.  Prof. SEIFE: And it was only slightly embarrassing.  FLATOW: Well, 1-800-989-8255 is our number. 1-800-989-8255. Talking about C. P. Snow's \"Two Cultures\" lecture with Charles Seife.  And there was a famous film on called the \"Private Universe. \" You may be familiar with this. It was movie, it was documentary, sort of a teaching tool made around 1990, I'm going to say, in which some scientists, some physicists, I think, took a camera, set up their video camera at the graduating class at Harvard, and just asked all 35 or so members and all - or anybody else they could pull in if they knew why it was hotter in the summer than it was in the wintertime. And only two or three out of the whole population - understood that it's not because the earth is closer to the sun.  Prof. SEIFE: That's - it's true that, I mean, we're strikingly ignorant as a society about some very basic facts. The archetypal question that a parent can't answer is, why is the sky blue?  FLATOW: Right, right.  Prof. SEIFE: It isn't that hard. And to accept the fact that, okay, this is something that is imponderable, that I can't answer, that's beyond me, really, really appalled Snow and it appalls scientists today.  FLATOW: Is the gap still here, do you think? Is it as wide, is it narrow, or a different kind of gap?  Prof. SEIFE: I think it's still there. I think that scientists have a very difficult time popularizing, in part, because they do inhabit a separate culture in the anthropological sense. They speak a different language. They assume different things. They speak amongst themselves and don't quite understand non-scientists in the same way and vice versa.  And I think that, occasionally, when you have a scientist straying outside of the culture trying to popularize he is scorned. Carl Sagan, in the '90s, was denied entrance to the National Academy of Sciences, and it was a heated floor debate. And apparently, one of the reasons given - that he was a great popularizer, he was a lightweight but he was spending all the time working on getting the public to understand and nothing on science, which was not true.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255. Kate(ph) in Binghamton, New York. Hi, Kate.  KATE (Caller): Hi, Ira. How are you?  FLATOW: Fine. How are you?  KATE: Fabulous. I definitely understand what you mean between this rift between the scientific and the literary. I go to the university right now and my boyfriend is a Latin major, so we see this rift between our own studies at all times.  But my question is, how are we going to bridge this gap? How are we going to bring science to the community? I know vessels like this show are great for that but how else are we going to bridge the gap between science and the literary aspects?  FLATOW: Charles, got any suggestions?  Prof. SEIFE: Well, I think this is a start. This is a great show. But, you know, there's always been popularizers. Michael Faraday, in the 1850s, was giving a set of public lectures to English common people, trying to explain cutting-edge physics. And it was very popular, but the rift remains.  And you have wonderful books throughout the ages, both fiction and nonfiction, that attempt to get science and scientists to the public. And it inspires some, and yet the rift remains. I know a number of biologists who were inspired by Aerosmith. . .  FLATOW: But you can - and maybe Kate, this is true of Binghamton but, you know, you can go through the best four-year college - in this private universe that was at Harvard. And people are proud that they spent four years in college and never took one science course, and they consider themselves to be educated people.  KATE: Yes. I'm trying to force my boyfriend to take intro to cell and molecular biology next semester, since I major - excuse me, I minored in Latin.  FLATOW: Why - that's the deal? Why not just a science for non-science majors course or something like that, you know, as a requirement to get a bachelor's degree?  KATE: We do have a science course. We actually - you must take a lab of some kind here, whether it be rocks for jocks or astronomy. You have to take some kind of science here at Binghamton, which is great because it does expose people to some of these fundamental ideas, only if you're just skimming the surface.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. All right. Thanks for calling, Kate.  KATE: Thanks.  FLATOW: Good luck getting your boyfriend to take that course.  (Soundbite of laughter)  KATE: Thanks.  FLATOW: Bye-bye. 1-800-989-8255. We do have, I guess, now more popular media. You have Neil Tyson on the \"Daily Show,\" things like that. Johnny Carson, for years brought astronomers on there. That's where Carl Sagan got his first start with the public.  Prof. SEIFE: Yeah. And Carl Sagan's \"Cosmos\" inspired - I mean, if you speak to today's generation of astronomers, a whole bunch of them have been inspired by it. So, it does have an effect.  But this cultural rift between science and I'd say, even non-science more than humanities, science is a different way of looking at the world. And it's hard to acquire - it's foreign in many ways. So, I think there's always going to be some difference between scientists and non-scientists.  FLATOW: And I think we have another rift that was not as evident then, and I think it's a rift between science and religion. You know, that's become a much bigger gap, I think, than the science and intellectualism.  Prof. SEIFE: Oh, absolutely. And it's - it doesn't need to be that way.  FLATOW: Right.  Prof. SEIFE: In fact, speaking of astronomy, the Vatican's ex-astronomer George Coyne is very, very pro-evolution. He is trying to explain to the public you can accept evolution and still believe in Christ, in his case. And so, the fact that science seems to be clashing with religion, it's getting worst since - I mean, since the Scopes Monkey trial in the 1920s.  FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah.  Prof. SEIFE: That is fairly - especially in American society, it's gotten worst over the years.  FLATOW: It certainly has. David(ph) in Ann Arbor. Hi, David.  DAVID (Caller): Hi. I just wanted to comment that the situation your guest describes isn't just true in science. I teach history. And study after study shows that Americans are incredibly ignorant of their history and of the history of other peoples and cultures. And your guest talking about Carl Sagan rang a bell with me. Stephen Ambrose, a historian with Ph. D. after his name, was ripped by academic historians because he was a popularizer, he wasn't a real historian. So I think that the trend goes beyond science.  FLATOW: Okay. Good point. Any comment about that?  Prof. SEIFE: I think that's absolutely true. Any field of deep knowledge, they kind of try to isolate themselves with their own language and their own ideas. And after a certain point it becomes almost anathema to try to break down those language barriers.  FLATOW: And now that science is so specialized, the language is even more specialized. You can't tell somebody else what you do.  Prof. SEIFE: Yeah. Biologists don't understand what physicists are writing about. Physicists don't understand what biologists are writing about. It's crazy sometimes.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let's see if we - go to the phones. And let me remind everybody that this is SCIENCE FRIDAY on NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow with Charles Seife of NYU. Let's see how many calls we can get it before we have to go. Let's go to Dane(ph) in Orleans, Mass. Hi, Dane.  DANE (Caller): Orleans, Mass, yes. Hello. Yeah, as a prelude to my remark, I hated science in college and now I love it. I was a music major, but now I really love it. (Unintelligible)\u2026  FLATOW: What turned you around?  DANE: Reading Fritjof Capra's \"The Tao of Physics. \"  FLATOW: Wow.  DANE: Yeah.  FLATOW: You're dating yourself now.  DANE: That's all right. That's fine with me.  (Soundbite of laughter)  DANE: I mean, I don't take too much stock in that book, but it really opened my eyes to physics and what it defines. But - and in ecology, I got, you know, in the environmental movement. But I want to say that I think popular songs contribute a lot to American scientifical literacy.  FLATOW: Popular songs?  DANE: Yes.  FLATOW: In what way and why?  DANE: Well, look at - let me give you an example. The Beach Boys have a beautiful song called \"Warmth of the Sun,\" right.

No literary license there at all or - but maybe he has some sort of point that there aren't enough songs in popular culture. So if they paved paradise and put up a parking lot, you know?  Prof. SEIFE: I think there's a They Might Be Giants' song saying that the sun is a ball of incandescent gas, which is pretty good.  FLATOW: Yeah. Well, you know, there are - we do see though that science in popular culture does have a tendency to change things. I'm thinking about three-mile island and then the film - what was\u2026  Prof. SEIFE: \"China Syndrome. \"  FLATOW: \"China Syndrome,\" things like that\u2026  Prof. SEIFE: Oh, yeah. Absolutely.  FLATOW: \u2026that were influential.  Prof. SEIFE: And Keanu Reeves as a quantum physicist solving our world's energy crisis with cold fusion.  FLATOW: Cold fusion.  Prof. SEIFE: Popular culture is very important in the way people perceive science. And of course, the mad scientist is the classic trope that - from 'Frankenstein\" on that movies love.  FLATOW: And there's Al Gore, not to link him with the mad scientist, but his movie was seen by millions of people.  Prof. SEIFE: And I don't know whether it's just a coincidence, but I think that that helped turned the tide of belief in global warming.  FLATOW: Do you have any suggestions beside this show?

I'm Scott Simon. Seventy-five years ago, a young explorer named Everett Ruess rode off alone into the Utah wilderness and was never heard from again. The mysterious disappearance of the 20-year-old artist and writer baffled thousands and inspired several books and a film. Now a team of geneticists and forensic anthropologists has finally put the mystery to rest. From member station KUER in Salt Lake City, Jenny Brundin reports. JENNY BRUNDIN: For decades, people captivated by a young man's mysterious disappearance in the Utah wilderness were consumed by one question. Mr. WL RUSHO (Author): Did he purposefully leave this world in some way, either vanish into the Navajo country or commit suicide? We don't know. BRUNDIN: WL Rusho, author of \"Everett Ruess: A Vagabond for Beauty,\" looked for answers in a large cardboard box full of Ruess's papers and letters. In one letter Ruess says he doubted he would ever go back to civilization. Unidentified Man: (Reading) The beauty of this country is becoming a part of me. I feel more detached from life and somehow gentler. I have good friends here, but no one understands why I'm here and what I do. I've gone too far alone. BRUNDIN: Ruess did try city life. He was raised in Los Angeles and moved to San Francisco during the Depression. He tried to make a living at his art - cutting wood block prints and writing poetry. But even as artists like Ansel Adams and Maynard Dixon reached out to him, Ruess turned his back on city life. He said it drained him and left him uninspired. Author W. L. Rusho said that contributed to the intrigue of the young artist. Mr. W. L. RUSHO (Author): I think we have built a mystique about Everett Ruess. It is a story of a person who is not enchanted with the world as he finds it, with the commercial world, and he wants to find his own way. Which is what a lot of young people want to do. BRUNDIN: Starting at age 16, Ruess, along with two mules, immersed himself in the beauty of the Southwest terrain. For four years he wrote, painted and sketched, enchanted by what he saw. In November, 1934, Ruess stocked up on supplies in the town of Escalante. He headed into the empty expanse of Davis Gulch, frequented only by sheepherders, cattle rustlers and outlaws. Ruess never came out of the desert. Filmmaker Diane Orr says clues were few. Ms. DIANE ORR (Filmmaker): The halter from the burro and they did find Nemo inscribed in a cave. BRUNDIN: Nemo was an alias Ruess took on later in life. Nemo, as in Latin for nobody, or some wondered was it a reference to Jules Verne's mysterious outcast, Captain Nemo. Search parties were sent out after the young artist. His mules were recovered, but no other traces were found. Theories on his disappearance flourished, ranging from random violence to noble suicide. Reah Jensen once attended a Mormon Church dance with Everett Ruess. Ms. REAH JENSEN: I just don't feel that he ever committed suicide. I don't think he had an actual death. I think something tragically happened to him. BRUNDIN: And she was right. Last year, the story took another turn when Navajo Denny Bellson learned a great family secret from his sister. Their grandfather said he'd witnessed a young Anglo boy with two mules being chased and murdered by three Ute Indians west of Bluff, Utah. Out of respect, their grandfather said, he buried the young man in a high crevasse. With his sister's directions, Bellson searched the site their grandfather had described. He found a saddle on a ledge, and nearby the crevasse with human bones in it. Mr. DENNY BELLSON: And I saw the top of the skull there, so I looked at it, and I looked around and I knew it was him. BRUNDIN: Bellson had never heard of Everett Ruess, but David Roberts, a contributing editor with National Geographic Adventure magazine, had, and he helped put the pieces together. It's laid out in detail in the magazine's current issue. First, reconstructed facial bones perfectly matched photos taken of Ruess. Then, Roberts says, Ruess's nephews and nieces donated saliva samples to compare with the victim's bone DNA. Mr. DAVID ROBERTS (National Geographic Adventure Magazine): And that proved absolutely critical in cracking the case. BRUNDIN: For those who have followed the mystery for decades, the news of the find was shocking. Author W. L. Rusho\u2026 Mr. RUSHO: To me, it's almost like the death of an old friend. I've had the image of Everett Ruess disappearing in the wilderness for so long that it's hard for me to adjust my thinking to realize that he's been found. BRUNDIN: But cracking the case has raised even more questions. Why was Ruess's body found 90 miles from where he was last seen, and how did he get there? Why was he killed? Was it a simple robbery? Meanwhile, the Ruess family plans to cremate Everett's bones and scatter them over the Pacific Ocean, just as his parents were after their deaths. For NPR News, I'm Jenny Brundin in Salt Lake City.

It's laid out in detail in the magazine's current issue.  First, reconstructed facial bones perfectly matched photos taken of Ruess. Then, Roberts says, Ruess's nephews and nieces donated saliva samples to compare with the victim's bone DNA.  Mr. DAVID ROBERTS (National Geographic Adventure Magazine): And that proved absolutely critical in cracking the case.  BRUNDIN: For those who have followed the mystery for decades, the news of the find was shocking. Author W. L. Rusho\u2026  Mr. RUSHO: To me, it's almost like the death of an old friend. I've had the image of Everett Ruess disappearing in the wilderness for so long that it's hard for me to adjust my thinking to realize that he's been found.  BRUNDIN: But cracking the case has raised even more questions. Why was Ruess's body found 90 miles from where he was last seen, and how did he get there? Why was he killed? Was it a simple robbery? Meanwhile, the Ruess family plans to cremate Everett's bones and scatter them over the Pacific Ocean, just as his parents were after their deaths.  For NPR News, I'm Jenny Brundin in Salt Lake City.  SIMON: And you can see how Everett Ruess's remains were verified by coming to our Web site, NPR. org. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2009 NPR.  All rights reserved.

S. Supreme Court. The decision barred people from suing the makers of high-tech medical devices, like implantable defibrillators, if the devices are approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Patient groups say the inability to sue when devices are defective essentially gives the makers a free ride. Here's NPR's Joanne Silberner. JOANNE SILBERNER: Legislation has been proposed in both the House and Senate that would give people back the right to sue medical device manufacturers in state courts. Earlier this week, the trade group for the device manufacturers, which opposes the legislation, brought people with real-life stories to Capitol Hill. One of them was Adam Hammond, a strapping 26-year-old who retired from the Army after a parachuting accident. Mr. ADAM HAMMOND: I had a small parachute malfunction that slammed me into the ground going in excess of 45 miles an hour. SILBERNER: He woke up after six weeks in a coma to find that he broken his back, tailbone, pelvis, right hip and femur. He was in enormous pain. Mr. HAMMOND: Oh, on a scale of one to 10, my pain was probably a 20. SILBERNER: Hammond was on methadone and handfuls of Vicodin and valium, but still couldn't walk more than a quarter of a mile. He was the first person to receive a new treatment for pain, an implanted device that scrambles the pain signals to the brain so that where he once was in agony, all he feels now is a slight tingling. Hammond doesn't want anything to get in the way of new devices, like his, coming on the market. He goes along with the Supreme Court ruling. If a product is FDA approved, that's good enough, and people shouldn't be able to sue. Brett Loper, of the medical device trade group AdvaMed, says letting people sue medical device manufacturers could shut down innovation. Mr. BRETT LOPER (AdvaMed): I think if you were to upset that innovation ecosystem, you could certainly have a situation where instead of pursuing the real breakthrough technologies, that you would instead find sort of simple singles and doubles, to use the baseball analogy, instead of swinging for the fences. SILBERNER: But Bridget Robb says consumers need protection beyond the FDA's seal of approval. Robb described her problems at a hearing held yesterday by a House of Representatives committee. Ms. BRIDGET ROBB: On Dec. 31, 2007, I suffered greatly and thought I was going to die because of a defective heart device implanted in my body. SILBERNER: She felt like a cannon was going off in her chest. The wire that led from an implanted defibrillator to her heart had broken and was firing erratically. The manufacturer, Medtronic, had recalled the device three months before, but only after receiving thousands of complaints over several years. After the hearing, Robb said she was testifying so what happened to her wouldn't happen to anyone else. Ms. ROBB: When companies know that there's something wrong with a product that they have made, there needs to be some sort of incentive to pull the product off the market, and not be able to continue to sell it just because it's FDA approved. SILBERNER: Robb was invited to the hearing by a co-author of the House legislation, New Jersey Democrat Frank Pallone. He says it's not right to keep people from suing for damages, and he's not worried about the medical device industry. Congressman FRANK PALLONE (Democrat, New Jersey): For so many years tort actions were brought in state courts, and the industry thrived. So I just don't buy it. I don't think that makes any logical sense. SILBERNER: The chances for Pallone's legislation and the matching bill in the Senate are up in the air. Joanne Silberner, NPR News, Washington. INSKEEP: Here's one idea lawmakers are considering to pay for an overhaul of health care: a 3-cent tax on soda - or depending on where you are in the country, pop - as well as drinks like Gatorade and alcohol. The idea came up at a Senate Finance Committee hearing yesterday. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that a soda tax could generate as much as $24 billion for the federal government in the next four years, which sounds like a lot until you remember that a health-care bill could cost up to $1. 5 trillion.

The people who gave the world pea soup have come up with a unique laboratory where diners' tastes, habits and moods are closely monitored while they chow down. Frank Browning went to the Netherlands to check out this unusual restaurant. FRANK BROWNING: For starters, it's called the Restaurant of the Future. Looks like any trendy, healthy food cafeteria. Soft lights, floor to ceiling windows, salad buffets, an enormous soup pot. Then you glance up at the ceiling and see some small maroon domes. Mr. PABLO KATZAKIS(ph) (Graduate Student, Wageningen University): At the beginning you realize that there are some cameras watching you, but I'm eating here for, let's say, almost a year now.

BROWNING: A black rubber scale at one of the cash registers unobtrusively weighs diners and all of their choices are recorded.

They also monitor how light, color, sound, presentation and eating alone or eating in groups affects diners. (Soundbite of footsteps) BROWNING: A few steps down the hall through thick gray doors is one of two monitoring centers dominated by computer screens that are fed by those maroon video eyes inside the restaurant. Mr. KOSTER: This is what we call Big Brother Room One. Only the scientists are allowed to come in.

Mr. KOSTER: If women eat with other women, they tend to indulge more than if men were present. Then women tend to take out more, let's say, the healthy foods. And that's all more, let's say, subconsciously, a way of expressing yourself to others. BROWNING: Men turn into cowboys when they're together, competing to see who can swallow the most. Restaurants have always been links both to science and the need to be seen, says Indiana University historian Rebecca Spang, who wrote about the birth of restaurants in 18th century France. Professor REBECCA SPANG (Historian, Indiana University): The first restaurants emerge in the context of not 21st century food science, but 18th century science of sensibility. And what a restaurant is is a place that one goes not to be nourished, because that's vulgar, but to be restored. You go out to be restored, and in doing so, you show everybody else who's there how exquisitely well-tuned your nerves are. You're not somebody who could just eat a big slab of beef. Instead you have to have the particular delicacies that will be restorative. BROWNING: Restaurant of the Future itself may resemble most any pleasant restorative eatery, but most of the hard research takes place in near clinical tasting labs, where outsiders are never invited. In this video touting the center's work, subjects are separated in test booths and asked to evaluate a series of sushi rolls. (Soundbite of video) Unidentified Woman: Please look at them. Which one do you like most? Also, why do you like it most - just the looks of it? And after that, taste the sushis and, also, think for yourself, what do you like? What don't you like? BROWNING: In another lab, participants sit on what looks like a large salon chair. They're fitted with tubes to the mouth and the nose. A recent project targeted low-fat milk, using a gustometer for taste and an olfactometer for aroma. Rene de Wijk directed the project. He's a psychologist. Dr. RENE DE WIJK (Psychologist): This gustometer device injected the low-fat milk into the mouth. On top of that, we presented a cream aroma in the nose. BROWNING: Guess what? Not only did the subjects say that the low-fat milk tasted like whole milk, but they even said it had the texture of whole milk. That test was undertaken for the dairy industry and has already changed how milk and low-fat dairy products are produced well beyond Holland. Much of the work at the Restaurant of the Future is on contract to private industry. Indeed, Wageningen University's key partner and sponsor is Sodexho, the world's second-largest food preparation company. And that distresses, at least somewhat, Rebecca Spang. Prof. SPANG: This is the kind of neuro-economic consumer psychology research that drives all of us, who are, shall I say, old-fashioned humanists, really, a bit mad. And - but it costs more. BROWNING: Spang calls it capitalism run wild.

Environmental Protection Agency testing has found that drywall made in China does contain sulfur and other chemicals not found in American wallboard. China was a popular source for drywall during the building boom after Hurricane Katrina when drywall supplies were scarce. NPR's Elizabeth Shogren reports. ELIZABETH SHOGREN: EPA officials say their tests aren't conclusive. The Consumer Product Safety Commission is heading the federal investigation, and it says it has no proof that the Chinese drywall harms people or appliances, nor do state health officials. One of the companies that sold the product says it ran tests and found no risk to people. But Chuck Stefan says he knows the problem is real. His construction company, Mitchell Homes, used Chinese sheetrock in at least 45 houses in Alabama and Florida. Mr. CHUCK STEFAN (Mitchell Homes): One home had such a severe drywall problem that we had to replace the refrigerator, the washer and the dryer because the wiring had corroded and ruined these appliances. SHOGREN: Stefan told a Senate hearing in Washington that the houses smell like rotten eggs, and air conditioning units need unusually frequent repairs. Mr. STEFAN: Once a year, you have to change the coils. It's a very thin copper, and it eats right through. Senator SHELDON WHITEHOUSE (Democrat, Rhode Island): Ordinarily, how often would you have to change the coils in a regular home? Mr. STEFAN: We have plenty of apartments after 20 years with the same coils still operating in the air handler. SHOGREN: Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse was questioning Stefan because he wants to make it easier for American consumers and businesses to hold foreign companies responsible for faulty products. Senators Bill Nelson from Florida and Mary Landrieu from Louisiana are asking their colleagues for $2 million in emergency funds to speed the federal investigation. Nelson says there's Chinese drywall in tens of thousands of homes in his state. Senator BILL NELSON (Democrat, Florida): We've had mamas and daddies having to vacate their homes because their pediatrician has told them I can't pinpoint the cause of this respiratory problem with the child, but you've got to get the child out of that environment. SHOGREN: Landrieu says her constituents are having nosebleeds, headaches and difficulty breathing in the homes they rebuilt after Hurricane Katrina destroyed their last ones. Senator MARY LANDRIEU (Democrat, Louisiana): Now, they have a home they can't live in. The entire home has to be now ripped out and new materials put in at extraordinary expense and inconvenience. SHOGREN: The senators say the Consumer Products Safety Commission has not moved swiftly enough to investigate the risks. But the agency's spokesman, Joe Martyak, says the agency's toxicologists have been moving as fast as they can to assess the threat. Mr. JOE MARTYAK (Spokesman, Consumer Products Safety Commission): We all want to have an answer yesterday, but this will take months.

SHOGREN: Stefan told a Senate hearing in Washington that the houses smell like rotten eggs, and air conditioning units need unusually frequent repairs.  Mr. STEFAN: Once a year, you have to change the coils. It's a very thin copper, and it eats right through.  Senator SHELDON WHITEHOUSE (Democrat, Rhode Island): Ordinarily, how often would you have to change the coils in a regular home?  Mr. STEFAN: We have plenty of apartments after 20 years with the same coils still operating in the air handler.  SHOGREN: Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse was questioning Stefan because he wants to make it easier for American consumers and businesses to hold foreign companies responsible for faulty products.  Senators Bill Nelson from Florida and Mary Landrieu from Louisiana are asking their colleagues for $2 million in emergency funds to speed the federal investigation. Nelson says there's Chinese drywall in tens of thousands of homes in his state.  Senator BILL NELSON (Democrat, Florida): We've had mamas and daddies having to vacate their homes because their pediatrician has told them I can't pinpoint the cause of this respiratory problem with the child, but you've got to get the child out of that environment.  SHOGREN: Landrieu says her constituents are having nosebleeds, headaches and difficulty breathing in the homes they rebuilt after Hurricane Katrina destroyed their last ones.  Senator MARY LANDRIEU (Democrat, Louisiana): Now, they have a home they can't live in. The entire home has to be now ripped out and new materials put in at extraordinary expense and inconvenience.  SHOGREN: The senators say the Consumer Products Safety Commission has not moved swiftly enough to investigate the risks. But the agency's spokesman, Joe Martyak, says the agency's toxicologists have been moving as fast as they can to assess the threat.  Mr. JOE MARTYAK (Spokesman, Consumer Products Safety Commission): We all want to have an answer yesterday, but this will take months.  SHOGREN: Martyak says the $2 million the senators have requested would bring answers faster.  Elizabeth Shogren, NPR News, Washington.

Cops have to figure out immediately that the person may not be able to understand or obey the officer. Every year there are tragedies, including something called suicide by cop. That's where people with psychoses attack officers or other people, leaving the officers little choice but to take deadly action. NPR's Joanne Silberner reports on the growing awareness of the problem and a possible solution. JOANNE SILBERNER: Darek Ardoin is a deputy with the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff's Office in Louisiana. He trains police officers to deal with people with mental illnesses, and he goes out on patrol himself. Last year, he found himself in a situation. Mr. DAREK ARDOIN (Deputy, Calcasieu Parish Sheriff's Office): A lady had called saying that someone was in her attic and was trying to get to her. SILBERNER: Her husband wouldn't go into her bedroom, clued Ardoin that it wasn't safe for him, either. He asked about weapons. The husband said she had a knife. Mr. ARDOIN: And so I asked, of course, well, would she have it with her now? And he said, well, she always has it with her. SILBERNER: Ardoin had his crisis intervention training to rely on. The idea is to give police an alternative to forcefully subduing someone and to protect themselves, too. Studies show trained officers are injured much less often on mental disturbance calls. Several hundred police departments across the country now offer the training, which was inspired by a Memphis police department program started in the last 1980s. Russell Laine, head of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, says intervention training is seen as having real value. Mr. RUSSELL LAINE (International Association of Chiefs of Police): If the person is bent on committing suicide and having the officer shoot him, sometimes there isn't anything the officer can do. But the officer has some degree of training, you know, he might be able to take some alternative actions and not have to shoot someone. SILBERNER: There are no national figures available on suicide by cop. When it happens, it's hard on officers. Ardoin has trained cops who have been involved in an incident. They sign up for training as help for their own post traumatic stress disorder. When Ardoin was dealing with the woman with the knife, he used lesson number one from his training: take your time. The woman was watching an episode of \"CSI\" on the TV in her bedroom. She was talking to the TV as if she was the victim in the show. He stopped at the door. He could see the knife. Mr. ARDOIN: It was laying next to her on the bed. She did not want her husband to take her to the hospital. It was difficult convincing her that I wasn't there to harm her, that I wasn't there to take her to jail. SILBERNER: For 20 minutes, he quietly reassured her, and finally, she agreed to go to the hospital. The situation can be scary for the person under investigation as well. Sandra Spencer is executive director of the National Federation of Families for Children's Mental Health. She has a son with bipolar disorder. When he was 12 and walking home from a friend's house, two police officers stopped him. Ms. SANDRA SPENCER (Executive Director, National Federation of Families for Children's Mental Health): Because he was afraid, didn't understand because of his mental health conditions. He was manic, because of his bipolar disorder he was, you know, he was shaken and he wasn't coherent. SILBERNER: She told him never to do anything suspicious when stopped by an officer. But her son couldn't process the instruction to keep his hands where they could see them. Ms. SPENCER: So my son reached in his pocket to get his cell phone and guns were drawn. SILBERNER: One cop realized that her son was agitated, not homicidal, and told the other cop to hold back. They managed to handcuff him and brought him home. The close call left Spencer determined to help other parents. Her group puts out guidelines, telling parents, for example, that if your kid has a breakdown and you call the police, don't fly out the door when they get there. They might assume you have the problem are coming out to attack them. Spencer thinks things are getting better, and a little more money is coming in. The Department of Justice is spending $10 million on training and related programs this year, up from six-and-a-half million dollars last year. Again, Police Chief Russell Laine. Mr. LAINE: I think they're getting better because people are aware that they're trying to get the proper training. They're looking at what's the best way that we can deal with this. They realize it's an issue. SILBERNER: Laine and many other law enforcement officials say what's needed next is better community psychiatric services so crises won't happen, or if they do, there's a place for officers to take people other than jail or the emergency room.

Maybe irrigation canals can run dry, leaving shrinking fields of barley to bake in the sun, as that happened with the Sumerians. Or, it could've been soil washing away after deforestation as appears to have happened for the Mayans. And in each case, the food supply dwindled and probably played a part in their downfall. But then again, that was really a long time ago, right? Couldn't we counter those problems today? We have all this technology, advanced agriculture techniques. We can drill deeper wells. We can plant genetically engineered crops that thrive in dry or salty places. Well, my next guest says that despite our modern advances, the problem - same problems that afflict those ancient civilizations, in concert now with climate change, could cripple us today. And if famine hits poor countries, it might threaten even the comfortable superpowers. The next great threat to our civilization, he says, is not from conventional or terrorist attack, but from a growing food shortage and a social and political upheaval that challenge us. Joining me now is Lester Brown, author of \"Plan B 3. 0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization. \" Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Dr. LESTER BROWN (Author, \"Plan B 3. 0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization\"): Ira, good to talk to you. FLATOW: We, you know, we were looking at our archives, you've been on this program for eight years back and forth. And you were so right in predicting about - way ahead of anybody else - about the problems that would be, you know, that the grains would cost the countries out there to make them. Dr. BROWN: Right. We've been - I've been doing for the last 30 years or so things like the State of the World reports at Worldwatch, and more recently, the Plan B series here at the Earth Policy Institute. And we always or frequently begin by saying, you know, if the environmental trends that we're facing in the world continue, eventually we're going to be in trouble. But it was not clear what form the trouble would take. And now, as I look at things, it seems to me that almost all these trends that we worry about affect the food prospect, and they affect it negatively. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. BROWN: Historically, as you noted, we've - soil erosion has been around for a long time. It's one of the environmental trends that goes back to the beginning of agriculture itself. But others like falling water tables are quite recent. We've had the pumping capacity to deplete aquifers basically only during the several decades since World War II. And what we're now beginning to see is falling water tables in more and more countries as our demand for water, and particularly irrigation water - and some 70 percent of all the water used in the world is for irrigation - we're beginning to see aquifers start to be depleted and wells going dry. The most sort of politically interesting example of this has come in Saudi Arabia. The Saudis, after the oil export embargo, after their oil export embargo in the mid-'70s, realized they were vulnerable to a counter-embargo of grain. So they began to scramble to see what they could do to increase their production. FLATOW: Lester, hang on with that thought because we have to go to a break. Dr. BROWN: Okay. FLATOW: I'll let you finish it instead of just interrupting you a little later. Dr. BROWN: Mm-hmm. FLATOW: So stay with us, Lester Brown and everyone else. Our number: 1-800-989-8255, if you want to talk to Lester Brown, author of \"Plan B 3. 0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization. \" We'll be back to take your questions, your Twitters, and everything else you'd like to ask. So stay with us. We'll be right back. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Lester Brown, author of \"Plan B 3. 0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization. \" He's also founder and president of the Earth Policy Institute in Washington. And we were talking about water shortages could - being the most significant environmental threat. And you were filling us on the history of Saudi Arabia and how they discovered that. Dr. BROWN: The Saudis began to look around to see how they could become less vulnerable to a grain export embargo. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. BROWN: Using their oil drilling technology, they discovered a fossil aquifer. A fossil aquifer is one that does not recharge. Just like oil, it was put down a long time ago in the - on a geological timescale. And so they started pumping that water. And for more than 20 years, they were self-sufficient in wheat. They had a very high support price as you can imagine pumping water from such a depth. But last year, they announced that their aquifer was largely depleted and that they were going to systematically phase out wheat production, reducing it one-eighth each year, until by 2016, they would effectively be out of the grain production business altogether. What was interesting about that was not the effect this will have on the world grain balance because they produce less than one-half of one percent of the world's wheat harvest, but because they are the first government that's been willing to publicly talk about their water resources - what's happening, how they're being depleted and what that's going to translate into. Other governments are facing difficult water problems, and among the large ones, India and China stand out. A World Bank study of India pointed out that 15 percent of India's people are now being fed with water from wells that are overpumping with - from wells that will be going dry one of these days. And that comes to about 180 million people being fed as a result of overpumping, which, by definition, is a short-term phenomenon. FLATOW: And how do these things translate to national security problems for us in this country? Dr. BROWN: Well, with China, I have done the same calculation the bank did for India and I get about 120 million Chinese being fed with - by overpumping. And at some point, these countries will have to come into the world market. And China, of course, is one of those. And the loss of their underground water resources as result of overpumping and depletion, and also the melting of the mountain glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau, these are the glaciers that feed the Yangtze and the old rivers during the dry season\u2026 FLATOW: So you have global warming exacerbating it. Dr. BROWN: Exactly. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. BROWN: So we have two water shortages sort of converging, one that's already very real, the other that's just getting underway. And so, there's a good chance that China will come into the world market in a big time for grain, in the same way that they have over the last decade or so for soybeans. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. BROWN: China now imports 37 million tons of soybeans a year. The second-ranking soybean importer is Japan, under five million tons. So, they - China totally dominates the world soybean market now. FLATOW: Isn't that good for us because we make a lot of these things that we should be able to sell? Dr. BROWN: It's good for us in the sense that it's so good for us we now have more land and soybeans in this country than we do in wheat, for example. But what happens when China comes into this market on a large scale for grain and begins to compete with us for our grain harvest, driving up our grain prices, it will not be such an attractive proposition. And historically, when we've been faced with a real competition for our grain harvest, as we were in the 1970s, we restricted exports in order to keep domestic prices - food prices from spiraling out of control. But it's difficult to do that with China because China is our banker now. I mean, every month, here in Washington, the Treasury Department auctions off securities to Treasury bonds and bills to finance our deficit. So, with China as our banker, we're facing an entirely new sort of geopolitics of food, whether - which means that whether like it or not\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. BROWN: \u2026we're going to be sharing our grain harvest with the Chinese. FLATOW: So they could say, well, no grain, no money. Dr. BROWN: That's it. They're holding a trillion dollars. If they started dumping those dollars on the world market, we would scramble for cover in a hurry. FLATOW: Wow - and you also write about, when talking about grain, that the -and you were first to talk about this years ago - there's the competition for fuel and food. Dr. BROWN: There's an intense competition now. This year, nearly one-fourth of the U. S. grain harvest will be going to ethanol distilleries. And this is coming at a time when the world is facing water shortages, when climate change is beginning to affect the food prospect. And I don't think most people realize that we now have this competition between people and cars for the U. S. grain supply. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. BROWN: And if we were to convert our entire grain harvest into fuel for cars, it would cover maybe 18 percent of our fuel needs. Or if you look at it in individual terms, the grain required to fill a 25-gallon SUV tank with ethanol will feed one person for a year. FLATOW: Wow. And so we're going to be facing a tough choice about whether we want to eat, or sell it to China or turn it into fuel. Dr. BROWN: The demand trends are sort of converging at this point in history in what John Beddington, who is the science adviser in the U. K. , just sort of described as a perfect storm. And so I think we're going to have to do some rethinking on the food front. And my guess is that the effect that we're having on the rest of the world, as it becomes more apparent, is going to lead to some changes in priority here. I mean, basically in an effort to reduce our oil insecurity, we've created unprecedented world food security. And if food prices keep rising - and they've subsided a bit now because of the economic downturn, but they're going to be rising again. And when they do, they could create enough political instability in low income countries around the world that it would become a serious security problem for us. FLATOW: Now, you point out some of those countries that have gone bankrupt, basically. Dr. BROWN: There are a number of failing states now and they, you know, it's Afghanistan, Pakistan, the first failing state with nuclear weapons, Somalia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti. There's a long list of countries now around the world. And we're beginning to see the kinds of problems that countries like that can create. Somalia, for example, has created enormous headache for countries trying to run ships through the Suez Canal, for example, in the Indian Ocean. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And it all starts with the basic stuffs of life like water and grain. Dr. BROWN: One of the things that governments expect of their people is personal security, and very close to that is food security. And if governments reach the point where they cannot provide food security, then they become somewhat irrelevant. And desperate people, hungry people or desperate people -and desperate people do desperate things. FLATOW: And what would be your suggestions then for action? Dr. BROWN: I think the first thing we should do is remove the subsidy that we now have for converting grain into ethanol. I mean, as a society, it's sort of ironic that as consumers, as taxpayers, we're subsidizing a rise in our food prices. I mean, what's wrong with that picture? These subsidies to convert grain into ethanol are driving up food prices, not only in this country but around the world. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And then what? Dr. BROWN: Well, that would be the first thing. And then the second thing would be to restructure our transportation system, because we also have the oil dependence problem. That's a security issue in its own right. And what I think we need to do, and what I think we're going to end up doing is basically electrifying our transportation system. And that means shifting rapidly to plug-in hybrid cars and all electric cars. I think that's going to move very fast. And the exciting thing about that is that when you use electricity from a wind farm, for example, to recharge your car at night, the fuel cost is less than a dollar for a gallon equivalent of gasoline. That is to say, the economics are really very appealing of being able to run our cars on electricity. FLATOW: The - well, in terms of electricity, the Obama administration seems to be pointing also toward making that electricity with nuclear power. Do you agree on that? Dr. BROWN: I don't think we're going to go very far down the nuclear road simply because it's so costly. You don't have to get beyond the economics to see that we have a problem with nuclear power. I mean, I would remind you that Wall Street has not financed a single nuclear power plant in 30 years. And there's a reason for that. FLATOW: They're sinking their money into solar and wind. Dr. BROWN: Exactly. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. BROWN: Big time. FLATOW: Big time. But is it fast enough? Dr. BROWN: And\u2026 FLATOW: Can it supply enough of the power for the whole country? Dr. BROWN: Oh, no question about that. Let me just point out that last year, coal power in this country increased by 1,400 megawatts, wind power increased by 8,200 megawatts. I mean, in a sense, the race is over, I think. Or if you look at it globally, if you want to use nuclear, last year 2008 nuclear power worldwide increased by maybe 1,000 megawatts. Worldwide wind energy increased by 27,000 megawatts. FLATOW: Yeah. We still have, half of our electricity does come from coal. Dr. BROWN: It does. FLATOW: How fast can that be replaced? Dr. BROWN: It depends on how serious we get about trying to stabilize climate. And I have a feeling that we're going to see things happening with rising temperature and ice melting, crop-withering heat waves, etcetera, etcetera, more destructive storms that are going to generate more and more pressure to accelerate the shift to renewable sources of energy, and to begin closing down coal-fired power plants. FLATOW: But other people might argue, you know, if we build nuclear - that's the fastest way in the largest scale that we can get us out of this. I mean, even folks who are considered, quote, unquote, \"green\" are saying nuclear is the way to go. Dr. BROWN: They probably haven't looked closely at the economics, but I would simply remind us that it typically takes eight or 10 years to build a nuclear power plant. FLATOW: Right. Dr. BROWN: Wind farms can go up in a year and often even less. And we have so much wind energy in this country. I mean, Department of Energy pointed out years ago that North Dakota, Kansas and Texas have enough harnessable wind energy to satisfy national electricity needs. And now with advanced design wind turbines, we can say that those three states alone, three out of 50, have enough harnessable wind energy to satisfy national energy needs. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. BROWN: So it's not a matter of supply. It's there. It's just a matter of harnessing it. FLATOW: Lester Brown, author of \"Plan B 3. 0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization\" on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Lester - oh, but can we build the infrastructure? Can we get the electrical lines out from those places where there's a lot of wind, where there's a lot of solar potential - in the southwest? Can we get the electricity out? Dr. BROWN: That's the challenge now, to build - what we really need is a national grid just to increase the efficiency of electricity use. I mean, we have situations in this country with jerry-built local grids that don't really integrate very well into a larger system. We need to do what Eisenhower did in the 1950s with the interstate highway system, where he began - up until then, we just had a patchwork of roads around the country. Interstates didn't exist as we know them today. And that's exactly what we need to do now with a grid, begin to build some major transmission lines around the country. It'll increase the efficiency of use. It'll also give us access to the, some of the cheapest electricity in the world. FLATOW: All right. Lester Brown, always a pleasure to talk to you. Dr. BROWN: Thank you very much, Ira. FLATOW: You always get us to thinking. Thank you for taking time to be with us today. Dr. BROWN: My pleasure.

So they began to scramble to see what they could do to increase their production.  FLATOW: Lester, hang on with that thought because we have to go to a break.  Dr. BROWN: Okay.  FLATOW: I'll let you finish it instead of just interrupting you a little later.  Dr. BROWN: Mm-hmm.  FLATOW: So stay with us, Lester Brown and everyone else. Our number: 1-800-989-8255, if you want to talk to Lester Brown, author of \"Plan B 3. 0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization. \" We'll be back to take your questions, your Twitters, and everything else you'd like to ask. So stay with us. We'll be right back.  I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Lester Brown, author of \"Plan B 3. 0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization. \" He's also founder and president of the Earth Policy Institute in Washington.  And we were talking about water shortages could - being the most significant environmental threat. And you were filling us on the history of Saudi Arabia and how they discovered that.  Dr. BROWN: The Saudis began to look around to see how they could become less vulnerable to a grain export embargo.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. BROWN: Using their oil drilling technology, they discovered a fossil aquifer. A fossil aquifer is one that does not recharge. Just like oil, it was put down a long time ago in the - on a geological timescale.  And so they started pumping that water. And for more than 20 years, they were self-sufficient in wheat. They had a very high support price as you can imagine pumping water from such a depth.  But last year, they announced that their aquifer was largely depleted and that they were going to systematically phase out wheat production, reducing it one-eighth each year, until by 2016, they would effectively be out of the grain production business altogether.  What was interesting about that was not the effect this will have on the world grain balance because they produce less than one-half of one percent of the world's wheat harvest, but because they are the first government that's been willing to publicly talk about their water resources - what's happening, how they're being depleted and what that's going to translate into.  Other governments are facing difficult water problems, and among the large ones, India and China stand out. A World Bank study of India pointed out that 15 percent of India's people are now being fed with water from wells that are overpumping with - from wells that will be going dry one of these days. And that comes to about 180 million people being fed as a result of overpumping, which, by definition, is a short-term phenomenon.  FLATOW: And how do these things translate to national security problems for us in this country?  Dr. BROWN: Well, with China, I have done the same calculation the bank did for India and I get about 120 million Chinese being fed with - by overpumping. And at some point, these countries will have to come into the world market. And China, of course, is one of those.  And the loss of their underground water resources as result of overpumping and depletion, and also the melting of the mountain glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau, these are the glaciers that feed the Yangtze and the old rivers during the dry season\u2026  FLATOW: So you have global warming exacerbating it.  Dr. BROWN: Exactly.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. BROWN: So we have two water shortages sort of converging, one that's already very real, the other that's just getting underway. And so, there's a good chance that China will come into the world market in a big time for grain, in the same way that they have over the last decade or so for soybeans.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. BROWN: China now imports 37 million tons of soybeans a year. The second-ranking soybean importer is Japan, under five million tons. So, they - China totally dominates the world soybean market now.  FLATOW: Isn't that good for us because we make a lot of these things that we should be able to sell?  Dr. BROWN: It's good for us in the sense that it's so good for us we now have more land and soybeans in this country than we do in wheat, for example. But what happens when China comes into this market on a large scale for grain and begins to compete with us for our grain harvest, driving up our grain prices, it will not be such an attractive proposition.  And historically, when we've been faced with a real competition for our grain harvest, as we were in the 1970s, we restricted exports in order to keep domestic prices - food prices from spiraling out of control.  But it's difficult to do that with China because China is our banker now. I mean, every month, here in Washington, the Treasury Department auctions off securities to Treasury bonds and bills to finance our deficit.  So, with China as our banker, we're facing an entirely new sort of geopolitics of food, whether - which means that whether like it or not\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. BROWN: \u2026we're going to be sharing our grain harvest with the Chinese.  FLATOW: So they could say, well, no grain, no money.  Dr. BROWN: That's it. They're holding a trillion dollars. If they started dumping those dollars on the world market, we would scramble for cover in a hurry.  FLATOW: Wow - and you also write about, when talking about grain, that the -and you were first to talk about this years ago - there's the competition for fuel and food.  Dr. BROWN: There's an intense competition now. This year, nearly one-fourth of the U. S. grain harvest will be going to ethanol distilleries. And this is coming at a time when the world is facing water shortages, when climate change is beginning to affect the food prospect. And I don't think most people realize that we now have this competition between people and cars for the U. S. grain supply.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. BROWN: And if we were to convert our entire grain harvest into fuel for cars, it would cover maybe 18 percent of our fuel needs. Or if you look at it in individual terms, the grain required to fill a 25-gallon SUV tank with ethanol will feed one person for a year.  FLATOW: Wow. And so we're going to be facing a tough choice about whether we want to eat, or sell it to China or turn it into fuel.  Dr. BROWN: The demand trends are sort of converging at this point in history in what John Beddington, who is the science adviser in the U. K. , just sort of described as a perfect storm.  And so I think we're going to have to do some rethinking on the food front. And my guess is that the effect that we're having on the rest of the world, as it becomes more apparent, is going to lead to some changes in priority here.  I mean, basically in an effort to reduce our oil insecurity, we've created unprecedented world food security. And if food prices keep rising - and they've subsided a bit now because of the economic downturn, but they're going to be rising again. And when they do, they could create enough political instability in low income countries around the world that it would become a serious security problem for us.  FLATOW: Now, you point out some of those countries that have gone bankrupt, basically.  Dr. BROWN: There are a number of failing states now and they, you know, it's Afghanistan, Pakistan, the first failing state with nuclear weapons, Somalia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti.  There's a long list of countries now around the world. And we're beginning to see the kinds of problems that countries like that can create. Somalia, for example, has created enormous headache for countries trying to run ships through the Suez Canal, for example, in the Indian Ocean.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And it all starts with the basic stuffs of life like water and grain.  Dr. BROWN: One of the things that governments expect of their people is personal security, and very close to that is food security. And if governments reach the point where they cannot provide food security, then they become somewhat irrelevant. And desperate people, hungry people or desperate people -and desperate people do desperate things.  FLATOW: And what would be your suggestions then for action?  Dr. BROWN: I think the first thing we should do is remove the subsidy that we now have for converting grain into ethanol. I mean, as a society, it's sort of ironic that as consumers, as taxpayers, we're subsidizing a rise in our food prices. I mean, what's wrong with that picture?  These subsidies to convert grain into ethanol are driving up food prices, not only in this country but around the world.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And then what?  Dr. BROWN: Well, that would be the first thing. And then the second thing would be to restructure our transportation system, because we also have the oil dependence problem. That's a security issue in its own right.  And what I think we need to do, and what I think we're going to end up doing is basically electrifying our transportation system. And that means shifting rapidly to plug-in hybrid cars and all electric cars. I think that's going to move very fast.  And the exciting thing about that is that when you use electricity from a wind farm, for example, to recharge your car at night, the fuel cost is less than a dollar for a gallon equivalent of gasoline. That is to say, the economics are really very appealing of being able to run our cars on electricity.  FLATOW: The - well, in terms of electricity, the Obama administration seems to be pointing also toward making that electricity with nuclear power. Do you agree on that?  Dr. BROWN: I don't think we're going to go very far down the nuclear road simply because it's so costly. You don't have to get beyond the economics to see that we have a problem with nuclear power.  I mean, I would remind you that Wall Street has not financed a single nuclear power plant in 30 years. And there's a reason for that.  FLATOW: They're sinking their money into solar and wind.  Dr. BROWN: Exactly.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. BROWN: Big time.  FLATOW: Big time. But is it fast enough?  Dr. BROWN: And\u2026  FLATOW: Can it supply enough of the power for the whole country?  Dr. BROWN: Oh, no question about that. Let me just point out that last year, coal power in this country increased by 1,400 megawatts, wind power increased by 8,200 megawatts.  I mean, in a sense, the race is over, I think. Or if you look at it globally, if you want to use nuclear, last year 2008 nuclear power worldwide increased by maybe 1,000 megawatts. Worldwide wind energy increased by 27,000 megawatts.  FLATOW: Yeah. We still have, half of our electricity does come from coal.  Dr. BROWN: It does.  FLATOW: How fast can that be replaced?  Dr. BROWN: It depends on how serious we get about trying to stabilize climate. And I have a feeling that we're going to see things happening with rising temperature and ice melting, crop-withering heat waves, etcetera, etcetera, more destructive storms that are going to generate more and more pressure to accelerate the shift to renewable sources of energy, and to begin closing down coal-fired power plants.  FLATOW: But other people might argue, you know, if we build nuclear - that's the fastest way in the largest scale that we can get us out of this. I mean, even folks who are considered, quote, unquote, \"green\" are saying nuclear is the way to go.  Dr. BROWN: They probably haven't looked closely at the economics, but I would simply remind us that it typically takes eight or 10 years to build a nuclear power plant.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. BROWN: Wind farms can go up in a year and often even less. And we have so much wind energy in this country. I mean, Department of Energy pointed out years ago that North Dakota, Kansas and Texas have enough harnessable wind energy to satisfy national electricity needs.  And now with advanced design wind turbines, we can say that those three states alone, three out of 50, have enough harnessable wind energy to satisfy national energy needs.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. BROWN: So it's not a matter of supply. It's there. It's just a matter of harnessing it.  FLATOW: Lester Brown, author of \"Plan B 3. 0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization\" on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Lester - oh, but can we build the infrastructure? Can we get the electrical lines out from those places where there's a lot of wind, where there's a lot of solar potential - in the southwest? Can we get the electricity out?  Dr. BROWN: That's the challenge now, to build - what we really need is a national grid just to increase the efficiency of electricity use. I mean, we have situations in this country with jerry-built local grids that don't really integrate very well into a larger system.  We need to do what Eisenhower did in the 1950s with the interstate highway system, where he began - up until then, we just had a patchwork of roads around the country. Interstates didn't exist as we know them today. And that's exactly what we need to do now with a grid, begin to build some major transmission lines around the country.  It'll increase the efficiency of use. It'll also give us access to the, some of the cheapest electricity in the world.  FLATOW: All right. Lester Brown, always a pleasure to talk to you.  Dr. BROWN: Thank you very much, Ira.  FLATOW: You always get us to thinking. Thank you for taking time to be with us today.  Dr. BROWN: My pleasure.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. As the school year comes to an end, teenagers go to graduation parties, proms, to the beach, and often bring along alcohol. Underage binge drinking is all too common, and each year, thousands of kids end up in emergency rooms with injuries related to alcohol. Parents understand their teens will be around drinking, so the question is how to talk to them about the dangers. We'll hear a number of approaches today and we want to hear from you. Parents: What works, what doesn't? Teens: Tell us your story. Phone us: 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. You can also join the conversation on the Web site. Go to npr. org and click on TALK OF THE NATION. Later in the program, we'll go to Arlington National Cemetery to hear President Obama's address today, and we want to know who you remember this Memorial Day. Send us an email: talk@npr. org, or leave your remembrance on our Web site. Go to npr. org and, again, click on TALK OF THE NATION. But first, teens and alcohol. Tara Parker-Pope joins us from her home in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where she writes about health, the New York Times Well blog. And her article, \"Using Science to Keep Teens Sober At The Prom\" appeared last week. Tara, nice to have you with us today. Ms. TARA PARKER-POPE (Health Writer, New York Times): Happy to be here. CONAN: And science is the best way to keep kids from drinking? Ms. PARKER-POPE: Well, I think it's one way to keep kids from drinking. I mean, no single intervention is going to help everybody all the time, but I do think we often underestimate our teenagers. And what teenagers really value is honesty and straight-talk. And, you know, the scientific organizations, the medical organizations really think that sort of straight talk about what alcohol does to your body and your brain will reach a certain number of kids if you do it the right way. CONAN: All right. Give us an example. Ms. PARKER-POPE: Well, you know, for instance, you know, talking to kids about the sort of chemistry about alcohol and how it affects their brain, you know there's some research that shows that it can really - a teenager's brain is different than an adult brain. It's still developing. And so alcohol has a different effect on a child's brain than an adult brain. And so if you explain that to a teen, explain to them that, you know, their memory maybe heavily affected and impaired by drinking alcohol, you know, that may actually get through to them. CONAN: So they're not even going to remember the prom if they drink too much. Ms. PARKER-POPE: Well, that is the message, that if you really want to have a good time and create good memories, don't drink because your memories can be erased. And, you know, there was a really powerful image on MTV's \"Real World\" a few years ago, where one of the girls had been drinking a lot and behaved kind of crazy, hit on one of the housemates. Well, she was so drunk that she was basically in a blackout and remembered nothing of it the next day. And it was a very powerful image that was discussed a lot on Web sites. You know, that scares a lot of teens. They don't really want to be that girl. And, you know, the problem is so many of us as parents tell our kids no. You just can't do it. Don't do it. I don't want you to do it. There'll be big trouble. That doesn't reach a teenager. You know, you got to find different ways to reach them and help them come to their own decision and their own conclusion. CONAN: There was one of the tips that you wrote about, which is essentially remind them that, well, drinking can lead to vomiting, which is gross. Ms. PARKER-POPE: Well, it is gross, and it will ruin your dress, you know, it'll ruin your tuxedo. It'll - you know, it's a very unpleasant, unattractive thing to do. You know, there was a lot of discussion about this with youths smoking. You know, if you tell a child, a teenager that smoking will kill them, that just does not connect with the way they view the world. They feel indestructible in their teenage years. But if you tell them it makes you really smell bad, it makes your teeth yellow, it makes you clothes smell, that has more of a - you know, that affects a teenager more, you know, what they're thinking about. Not every teen. I mean, there's a lot of skepticism, but nobody thinks that every strategy will work for every kid. But, you know, interesting, I wrote about this on my blog, and a lot of teenagers wrote in and said, well, I'm still a straight-A student and I drink all the time. But, you know, it's interesting, a lot of these kids are good kids. They are experimenting with alcohol. It's something that happens in the teenager years, but, you know, there's been data showing that teens who drink twice a week consistently, they score an average of 10 percent lower on short-term memory tests. And the way that translates is that a heavy drinker is more likely to get a B, whereas a none-drinker would get an A. I mean that's how that measures differently. And if you're - especially if you're reaching those kids who have high ambitions for college in their GPA, telling them that drinking is going to change their brain in a way that's going to hurt their grades, you're going to reach some of them that way. CONAN: Some. And again, no one approach is going to work with everybody. Ms. PARKER-POPE: You know, the goal here is to just try to keep a kid from drinking to excess where they hurt themselves and to keep them from getting behind the wheel or getting in a car with somebody else. I mean, we're just basically trying to help them survive their teenage years. And, you know, the tragedy of this is that every day, we hear stories. In my own life, just a few days ago, a friend of mine, somebody she works with whom I know, you know, his son was in a terrible car accident, wrapped around a tree, and he's got severe brain damage. And this is somebody that, you know, he's in my life. He's in, you know, he's near my life. I know another couple, their son died a few years ago the same way. This happens. I mean, this really does happen to kids. And I think any way you can try to reach them - I mean, it's an effort, and it may not work, but there's so much cynicism about, oh, this is a stupid idea. Teens are going to do what they're going to do. You know, I don't - again, I don't think we give teens enough credit sometimes. CONAN: And here's an email that we got from Eric. And he wrote: My parents had a well-stocked bar when I was a kid. Their rule was, if you want to try something, come and ask. They taught and demonstrated by lifestyle that drinking was no big deal when done responsibly. Most important, they taught that drinking was for celebration and never to ease a bad day. I did the same with my kids, and they had no great interest in getting soused for the sake of getting soused. If the taboo were lifted and kids taught how to handle liquor responsibly, wouldn't this cut down on the mystique and lead to less binge and excessive alcohol consumption? Ms. PARKER-POPE: You know, there is always this debate. You look in Europe, where alcohol rules are a little more lax, and you don't really see different rates of alcoholism. You don't see that kids are drinking less. So I know it's a good idea, and maybe in an individual family this might be a strategy. You know, in my house growing up, my parents did not drink at all. We never had alcohol in the house. I mean, that was how they set the example. My mother had alcoholism in her family, and it devastated her. She lost her older brother to liver disease related to alcohol. So that made a great impression on us as kids. And, you know, in writing this post and writing about it, the truth is I didn't touch alcohol at all during high school, and this has shocked a lot of people. You know, surveys which show that about 75 percent of kids have tried alcohol in high school, so maybe I was part of - I was, I guess, part of 25 percent. But that 75 percent is a bit inflated, because those are kids who've maybe tried it. It's the regular drinkers you're really worried about. Not the people who maybe experiment once or twice. But, you know, the reason I never drank in high school is because my parents kept really close track of me. I see these kids who are posting on my blog saying, oh, I get out - I go out every Friday and Saturday and get smashed. It would not have been possible in my household because my - I had a curfew. You know, there were limits to the car, and I would still be grounded today frankly if I had broken any of those rules. CONAN: Be grounded forever. Ms. PARKER-POPE: Absolutely. I got that a lot, grounded indefinitely. That was always the threat. And I think that parents have to kind of take some responsibility for this. Yes, kids are exposed - the problem is with this idea of experimenting in the home, you cannot bring your child's friends into the home and say okay, you're curious. You can drink and drink responsibly and I'll take care of you. You can't do that. It's against the law. CONAN: It is. Ms. PARKER-POPE: You'll get in a lot of trouble. So this is the dilemma with that kind of suggestion. It might work for some families, not for all. CONAN: 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. What works? What doesn't? And we'll talk with Martha, Martha with us from San Antonio. MARTHA: Yes. I had a son that was about 16 at the time when I studied to be a substance abuse counselor. And I brought home all kinds of these kinds of films and, you know, VCR's and all kinds of thing to - well, part of my studying. And I'd bring him in and said, well, I'm going to watch these things. Let's discuss these together and let's watch these together. And it wasn't just smoking or drinking or something. It was a whole thing, you know, substance abuse and the whole bit, which is wonderful. And we saw what it would do to, you know, to your body when you did these things and we'd talk about it, and I don't know. I never did much drinking, anyway. It just wasn't that\u2026 CONAN: Well, did that work for your 16-year-old? MARTHA: It worked with him. He has been just - he'll take a drink occasionally, you know, like our fiesta, which we have every year here, but he just, you know, it's just not a thing that's interesting. It's an occasional kind of thing, and I haven't had any problems with him at all. CONAN: Well, the together part might have been the central part there, Tara Parker-Pope. Ms. PARKER-POPE: Well, this is the other part of the mix. I mean, whatever risk behavior you're talking about, families that are very involved with their kids - whether it's smoking or sex or alcohol or drugs or even an eating disorder, you know, sitting down to the family dinner, you know, every night, expecting your kids to be there at a certain hour, being very invested in your child's life is a great predictor for helping him through these really difficult teenage years. You know, study after study has shown this. Now there are a lot of great parents who do these things and their kids still, you know, step off the path. So it's not to say that we're blaming parents when kids do this, but if you really want to lower the risk and minimize the risk, being very invested in your child's life is really the way to go. CONAN: Martha, thanks very much. MARTHA: You're welcome. CONAN: Bye-bye. Here's an email from William: The notion that any method, especially naive notions of being direct, warning about the scientific dangers or warning about the effects on their appearance will prevent teens from drinking is almost laughable. I myself am an 18-year-old who does not drink. I find myself in a minority of less than 10 percent of people my age. People do not drink because they're rebelling or because they don't understand the danger. Teens drink because they enjoy getting drunk. Almost all teenagers drink, and that will always be the case, as long as alcohol exists. That from Nashville, Tennessee. So at least William, a teenager, disagrees with you there. Ms. PARKER-POPE: It's very typical of the comment that I received on the blog this week, and I certainly understand that. But if we can - you know, maybe we're not going to eliminate drinking entirely, but can we reduce the number of episodes, the number of exposures? Can we at least convince our kids not to get in the car with somebody who's drinking or to not get behind the wheel? You know, can we convince them, you know, around exam time that heavy drinking is going to ruin their grades? You know, maybe we'll save a week or two of partying. I mean, it's really all about what you can, you know, accomplish, these small steps. You know, and to say that all kids drink, it's just not true. There are a lot of really - you know, I get really frustrated. I am a big fan of the American teenager. I think teens are really interesting. I think, you know, they have great ideas. They're thinking, you know, they're building relationships, they're forming habits. And we like to disparage teenagers in this country. I wrote a story a few months ago about teens and sex, and we have this idea that every kid out there is having sex, that there's this rampant teenage promiscuity, and it's just not true. You know, most teens are fairly cautious about this. In fact, today's\u2026 CONAN: Tara, we have to short break, so Tara, stay with us if you would. We're talking about the best approach when it comes to warning teens away from binge drinking. What works? What doesn't? Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Later in the hour, we want to know who you remember on this Memorial Day. We'd ask you to send us an email if you could. Send it to talk@npr. org, or you can leave your remembrance on our Web site. That's at npr. org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. We'll read some of them later in the program. Right now, we're talking about teens and drinking. Alcohol is the most common used and abused drug among young people in the United States, more than both tobacco and much more than illegal drugs. And as the summer months roll in, along with parties for graduation and the prom, parents wonder about the best way to get their teens to stay away from booze. We're talking with reporter Tara Parker-Pope, who writes about health issues on the New York Times Well blog, and she's been talking about a more scientific approach. We also want to hear from you parents. What works, what doesn't? 800-989-8255. The kids can also join the conversation. Give us a call, and you can also join the conversation at our Web site: npr. org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. And let's go to Sky(ph), Sky with us from San Antonio in Texas. SKY (Caller): Hi, Neal. Thanks for taking my call. CONAN: Go ahead, please. SKY: My son began drinking at the age of 14 and almost died celebrating his 18th birthday, and ended up - did die at the age of 30 from an alcohol-related accident. CONAN: Oh, I'm so sorry. SKY: Thank you. And what I have to say is that in my experience - I was a very young parent, and so I really didn't think ahead to dialogue with him until he was already deeply in that field. And what I would say to parents is start talking to your kids when they're like 11 or 12 years old. You need to talk to them before their friends start partying at 14 and 15. At one point in his late 20s, my son did enter and alcohol rehab program and learned about the differences that happen to a young brain, brain chemistry, brainwave function. And as he gained sobriety for a period of time, he saw that changing in himself, and it made a great impact, and he even said I wish I'd known this. So I think giving kids that kind of information and giving it to them before you think they need it is the suggestion I would have from my experience. CONAN: So that might have worked with your son? SKY: I think, you know, had I had that knowledge, had I given it to him - because, you know, there is a history. His father did have alcoholism, and had I thought about it when he was a preteen, I think that might have helped him. And as Tara said, you know, really riding herd on these kids, you know. The first time I saw him come home drunk, you know, if instead of just giving him a big lecture, I wish I would have grounded him indefinitely. (Soundbite of laughter) CONAN: Yeah, that might have worked, too, though some kids have a way of getting around that, too. But\u2026 SKY: Yeah, and he was one of those boys, but I really think for him, because he was very intellectual, he was very intelligent, and information meant a lot to him, had he had that information early in his life, it may have made a difference. So I would suggest that parents talk to them early and talk to them just very straight. CONAN: Sky, thank you so much for sharing that story. SKY: Thank you. Ms. PARKER-POPE: I think that's such a powerful story and such good advice, and I hope people hear it because people are really resistant to this message because they just think oh, it won't work. But it can't hurt, is the thing. And teens really are - one of the problems with teens and alcohol is that unlike adults, you know, they're more vulnerable to the memory problems, to the brain damage, to being impaired. But they handle alcohol in some ways better. They're less vulnerable to feeling tired, to getting hangovers, to begin wobbly, and then you throw in the fact that kids today are drinking these energy drinks, these high-caffeine energy drinks with alcohol that is sort of making them feel less drunk. So I think we need to explain to kids you may feel okay, but here's what's going on in your brain and this is why I'm begging you don't get behind the wheel and call me if you do get into this situation. I think that - I do believe you can reach teens - not every one, but I think it's fascinating that this young man did feel that message would have resonated with him as a teen. CONAN: Thanks again, Sky. SKY: Thank you. CONAN: Joining us now is Laurence Steinberg, who's on the phone from his home in Philadelphia. He is a professor of psychology at Temple University, the author of numerous books on adolescence, including \"The Ten Basic Principles of Good Parenting. \" And nice to have you back on the program with us today. Professor LAURENCE STEINBERG (Psychology, Temple University; Author, \"The Ten Basic Principles of Good Parenting\"): Good to be back. How are you? CONAN: And I just wondered if you've given any thought to this scientific approach, if you will, and whether you think it might actually deter some kids from drinking. Well, I think it's - you know, it's great to try to teach kids about themselves and certainly from the point of view of science education - brain development, but I'm very skeptical that this would have any impact at all on kids' behavior. And I say that, you know, based on what we know about the impact of all kinds of educational approaches on health-related behaviors among kids. We're very, very good at changing kids' knowledge. We're pretty good at changing their attitudes, and we're terrible at changing their behaviors through these kinds of interventions. And so although, you know, I agree with Tara that it's, you know in some senses, it couldn't hurt to try. The part that I worry about is leaving parents with the, you know, with this overly optimistic belief that they can talk to their kids about how alcohol is going to affect their prefrontal cortex and then send them out to the prom and think that their kids are going to be safe, you know, that doing that is going to be very effective. CONAN: What does work in your experience? Prof. STEINBERG: Well, what does work is, you know, the old sort of standbys of chaperoning kids carefully, making sure that they don't drive if they've been drinking, providing transportation for them on evenings when you think that there might be alcohol present, enforcing the law, getting together with other parents and agreeing that you're not going to let alcohol be served, you know, at pre-prom or post-prom parties. In other words, what does work is limited kids' access to the substances that can hurt them. CONAN: Limiting access, that's - some parents would say wait a minute, we need to trust our children. Otherwise, how are they going to learn to behave later in life? Prof. STEINBERG: Well, yeah. On the other hand, on an evening where you believe that in your community it's common for kids to go out and binge drink, get behind the wheel of a car, I think that this lesson, you know, is perhaps not best taught in that context. You know, as you were talking before, I pulled up on my computer some data from the most recent version of Monitoring the Future, which is a national survey of kids about drugs and alcohol. And, you know, 95 percent of high school seniors in this country say it's very easy to get alcohol. That's a big problem. CONAN: And that's in a country where largely, I think almost everywhere now, it's 21. Prof. STEINBERG: That's right. CONAN: Yeah. 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. And let's go to John, John with us from San Francisco. JOHN (Caller): Hi. That was a great - thank you for taking the call. That was a great moment to come in on, because I'm a parent of a 14-year-old, and we just had a pre-prom meeting with parents and the health teacher at our child's school. And there was scenarios put out there for discussion, and one of them was a kid comes home with a friend, and the friend is drunk, and your kid tells you, oh, he just went to bed, but don't tell his parents. What do you do? And it was a (unintelligible) to have a discussion about philosophy on how we deal with that whole trust issue, freedom issue and dealing with the serious matter of underage drinking. And it got pretty heated. There was a lot of parents who felt that they wouldn't tell to their friends parents and not break the trust between the child. And then my feeling was, well, it's not really fair to allow your child to put you in a position where you're then taking the trust of the parent. When a parent entrusts you - their kid under your care, I think there's an absolute responsibility to make sure that the parents of that child knows what's going on. And so, you know, I think it's really important that people realize it's more important to be a parent than a friend to your child and starting that discussion very early on, as the woman said earlier, 10, 11 years old, and being involved in your kids' lives because if you're waiting until the big moments, the big crisis moments happen, to get involved into your kids' lives, you're way too late. Your kid has no real connection or communication that can have any history and trust. And you need to instill that really early on and have dialogue about every little thing in their life all throughout their lives or else when you get to the point where these big-issue topics come up, you're not going to have that sort of history to be able to communicate and have an impact on. And the other thing is the - regarding access, I 100 percent agree. So many parents feel like, oh, well, if they come here after prom and they're allowed to drink here at my house, it will prevent them from going elsewhere. I think that's another irresponsible position to take to allow them to drink alcohol. First of all, it's against the law, and you're telling kids it's okay to break some laws when you think it's - you know, that you're more responsible than the laws are saying. And I think it's really just - and it's rampant. Here - I live in Northern California, and just this weekend, there was a 16-year-old boy who died in Oakland at a party, and I was just up the street. And it's a really tony neighborhood, and these parents left their kids, the house to them thinking, well, at least they're in my house. I don't have to be there to supervise. So what bad can go wrong? And sure enough, a 16-year-old boy died from alcohol poisoning, and there were actually 13-year-old kids there drinking. And now the son of the people who own the house, who is 18, is now looking at jail time for this. So it's a really serious issue that has been going on for decades, and I think people just underestimate the power of alcohol and the power of the peer pressure. And to think that, well, you know, if all the kids are doing it and if I allow my kid to do a little bit and I trust them that they'll trust - you know, that they'll use it wisely. And I think we just underestimate the maturity level of our kids - or overestimate the maturity of a young adult. CONAN: Tara Parker-Pope, the sole issue of trust and, well, being your child's parent, not your friend, you'll be grounded indefinitely. I'm sure that came up in responses to your blog post. Ms. PARKER-POPE: Yeah. I mean, I actually am a firm believer that you don't trust your kids. I mean, you're the parent and you're - they're teenagers and they have a teenage brain. And maybe the most important message of all of this is for the parents to understand that a teenage brain is still developing, and that there are really high stakes here. And maybe if parents were more aware of this, they would crack down more, because I do agree that it's very hard to change teen behavior. But we have done it. It's very hard to change anybody's behavior. But if you look at seatbelt laws and cell phone driving laws - and, you know, we're starting to make inroads in some of those areas. And certainly, we're not giving up on teens by saying, well, we're not going to keep you from texting in the car, so we're just not going to talk to you about it. We're going to keep talking to kids about texting in the car and hope that we make a dent. And I think the goal here is to make a dent and to reach some kids. You know, I was talking to a high school science teacher who was having this conversation with his students. And one of the students said, you know, nobody ever told me that alcohol would make me stupid, that alcohol would affect my grades. And for that particular student, it resonated. A lot of kids, it won't. But, again, it's what you can do - you know, again, this is, you know, this is the American Association for the Advancement of Science who's putting out this idea of teaching children about the science, the chemistry, the biology, the neuroscience of alcohol. And I think it's one piece of a very big puzzle. CONAN: John, thanks very much for the call. Appreciate it. JOHN: Thank you. CONAN: And Larry Steinberg, I wanted to - you would think that that story that he just told of the 16-year-old dying of alcohol poisoning, you show that clip from the newspaper - if there's anything such - still exists anyway - to kids and it would be - have persuasive effect, but I think Tara is right. It does not. Prof. STEINBERG: No, it doesn't. You know, in our lab at Temple, we've been studying something that I think is very relevant to this. And what we've been studying is the impact of peers on kid's judgment and decision making. And what we're finding in a variety of tasks is that when kids are by themselves, they engage in decision-making and risk-taking behavior that's not that different from adults. But you put them in the same exact task situation but you have their friends in the room with them, and it doubles the number of chances that they take, whereas doing the same thing for an adult has no impact whatsoever. And we've now been doing imaging studies, where we've been looking at what the neural underpinnings are of this peer influence effect that we're seeing in so many different ways. And what turns out is that it looks like the presence of friends activates a completely different system of brain circuitry in kids than it does in adults. And it activates brain systems that make individuals more sensation-seeking and reward-seeking and likely to engage in risk-taking behavior. So, the lesson here is that you can have a conversation with your teenager, and your teenager can be very, very reasonable and get it and understand the information. And as soon as you put that teenager in a group situation with her friends, she's a different person. CONAN: We're talking about teens and drinking. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And we're got that story from the Northern California papers, this in an email from Noel(ph). On Saturday night, a 16-year-old young man died of alcohol poisoning in our small tight-knit community. Fellow partiers found him passed out in the hallway. He was gone by midnight. And a family and a community was changed forever. He was, by all accounts, a premier athlete, a good student from a good family, living in one of the most solid, well-educated communities in the state. We parents know that drinking will happen, and what we need to do now is to educate our kids to know when and how to spot a potential overdose and to let them know that they can and should call the parent or a responsible adult immediately. And this - another email, this from Ruth: I was a single parent. When my sons were teens, I decided that one way to convince them that alcohol was serious stuff was to quit drinking myself while they were teens. I said, look it, I'll start drinking again when you are drinking age. So there was no alcohol in the house. I hosted the New Year's Eve party every year for my kids and their friends - no alcohol, lots of good food and fun. The biggest challenge was the parents who thought they were doing the right thing by providing the alcohol to the kids, theirs and others, at their home. And just a reminder from that other story, you can end up in serious legal difficulties by doing that. And parental role models - are parents role models in this regard, Larry Steinberg? Prof. STEINBERG: Oh, absolutely. You know, that - two of the biggest influences on kids' drinking are their parents and their friends. And parents can model abstinence. They can also model responsible drinking. But even still, I think we just don't want to be putting kids in situations where it's really easy for them to get their hands on alcohol, you know, and to get drunk. CONAN: I wonder, Tara Parker-Pope, what's been the most interesting response you've gotten from your blog post? Ms. PARKER-POPE: Well, I would say it's the occasional student who steps in and says, actually, you know, this does speak to me. And I've had a few students who - or adults who said, you know, I started drinking at 14, 15. I became an alcoholic. I'm with somebody who tried this with me. You know, you do hear that a lot. But it's really the negativity. It's the sense of giving up. And that really troubles me. And I've seen it. I started to talk in the earlier segment about, you know, we like to write off our teens. We like to say that boys are just after sex. And if you look at study after study, it shows that boys care about relationships and love just as much as girls do. You know, you have this image of teen girls gone wild. It's just not true. The - you know, by the time they're in college, the virginity rate among girls is about 25 percent. About half of teens have, you know, by the time they reach, I think, it's junior or senior year, they have not had sex. So there's a whole segment of our teenagers that are behaving well. And I think, you know, to give up and to throw up your hands and to say, well, you can't reach teens - you can't reach all the teens all the time, but you can reach them some of the time. I mean, I know that when I was in high school, I was at a party, and the boy who drove me to the party started drinking. And I called my mom and said, you know, you should come pick me up. He's drinking. And she said, okay, and there was no yelling and no trouble. You know, that was a message that had really, you know, been given to me, that I always had that phone call. And I think that you just need to hit teens from all sides. I think that this is about, well, teens get together and their brains act differently, you can model, as the doctor said, you can model good behavior, too. And hanging around with kids who don't drink is, you know, it protects kids. So encouraging those friendships and encouraging safe places for children to gather, all of those things make a difference. CONAN: Tara Parker-Pope, excuse me, thank you very much, Tara. Ms. PARKER-POPE: Thank you. CONAN: Tara Parker-Pope writes for the New York Times Well blog, and joined us from her home in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Also our thanks to Laurence Steinberg, a professor of psychology at Temple University, with us by phone today. Thank you so much. Prof. STEINBERG: Thank you. CONAN: And when we come back, we're going to listen to President Obama. We also want to hear who you would like to remember on this Memorial Day. Send us an email: talk@ npr. org. This is NPR News.  NEAL CONAN, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  As the school year comes to an end, teenagers go to graduation parties, proms, to the beach, and often bring along alcohol. Underage binge drinking is all too common, and each year, thousands of kids end up in emergency rooms with injuries related to alcohol. Parents understand their teens will be around drinking, so the question is how to talk to them about the dangers.  We'll hear a number of approaches today and we want to hear from you. Parents: What works, what doesn't? Teens: Tell us your story. Phone us: 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. You can also join the conversation on the Web site. Go to npr. org and click on TALK OF THE NATION.  Later in the program, we'll go to Arlington National Cemetery to hear President Obama's address today, and we want to know who you remember this Memorial Day. Send us an email: talk@npr. org, or leave your remembrance on our Web site. Go to npr. org and, again, click on TALK OF THE NATION.  But first, teens and alcohol. Tara Parker-Pope joins us from her home in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where she writes about health, the New York Times Well blog. And her article, \"Using Science to Keep Teens Sober At The Prom\" appeared last week.  Tara, nice to have you with us today.  Ms. TARA PARKER-POPE (Health Writer, New York Times): Happy to be here.  CONAN: And science is the best way to keep kids from drinking?  Ms. PARKER-POPE: Well, I think it's one way to keep kids from drinking. I mean, no single intervention is going to help everybody all the time, but I do think we often underestimate our teenagers. And what teenagers really value is honesty and straight-talk. And, you know, the scientific organizations, the medical organizations really think that sort of straight talk about what alcohol does to your body and your brain will reach a certain number of kids if you do it the right way.  CONAN: All right. Give us an example.  Ms. PARKER-POPE: Well, you know, for instance, you know, talking to kids about the sort of chemistry about alcohol and how it affects their brain, you know there's some research that shows that it can really - a teenager's brain is different than an adult brain. It's still developing. And so alcohol has a different effect on a child's brain than an adult brain. And so if you explain that to a teen, explain to them that, you know, their memory maybe heavily affected and impaired by drinking alcohol, you know, that may actually get through to them.  CONAN: So they're not even going to remember the prom if they drink too much.  Ms. PARKER-POPE: Well, that is the message, that if you really want to have a good time and create good memories, don't drink because your memories can be erased. And, you know, there was a really powerful image on MTV's \"Real World\" a few years ago, where one of the girls had been drinking a lot and behaved kind of crazy, hit on one of the housemates. Well, she was so drunk that she was basically in a blackout and remembered nothing of it the next day. And it was a very powerful image that was discussed a lot on Web sites.  You know, that scares a lot of teens. They don't really want to be that girl. And, you know, the problem is so many of us as parents tell our kids no. You just can't do it. Don't do it. I don't want you to do it. There'll be big trouble. That doesn't reach a teenager. You know, you got to find different ways to reach them and help them come to their own decision and their own conclusion.  CONAN: There was one of the tips that you wrote about, which is essentially remind them that, well, drinking can lead to vomiting, which is gross.  Ms. PARKER-POPE: Well, it is gross, and it will ruin your dress, you know, it'll ruin your tuxedo. It'll - you know, it's a very unpleasant, unattractive thing to do. You know, there was a lot of discussion about this with youths smoking. You know, if you tell a child, a teenager that smoking will kill them, that just does not connect with the way they view the world. They feel indestructible in their teenage years.  But if you tell them it makes you really smell bad, it makes your teeth yellow, it makes you clothes smell, that has more of a - you know, that affects a teenager more, you know, what they're thinking about. Not every teen. I mean, there's a lot of skepticism, but nobody thinks that every strategy will work for every kid. But, you know, interesting, I wrote about this on my blog, and a lot of teenagers wrote in and said, well, I'm still a straight-A student and I drink all the time.  But, you know, it's interesting, a lot of these kids are good kids. They are experimenting with alcohol. It's something that happens in the teenager years, but, you know, there's been data showing that teens who drink twice a week consistently, they score an average of 10 percent lower on short-term memory tests. And the way that translates is that a heavy drinker is more likely to get a B, whereas a none-drinker would get an A. I mean that's how that measures differently. And if you're - especially if you're reaching those kids who have high ambitions for college in their GPA, telling them that drinking is going to change their brain in a way that's going to hurt their grades, you're going to reach some of them that way.  CONAN: Some. And again, no one approach is going to work with everybody.  Ms. PARKER-POPE: You know, the goal here is to just try to keep a kid from drinking to excess where they hurt themselves and to keep them from getting behind the wheel or getting in a car with somebody else. I mean, we're just basically trying to help them survive their teenage years.  And, you know, the tragedy of this is that every day, we hear stories. In my own life, just a few days ago, a friend of mine, somebody she works with whom I know, you know, his son was in a terrible car accident, wrapped around a tree, and he's got severe brain damage. And this is somebody that, you know, he's in my life. He's in, you know, he's near my life. I know another couple, their son died a few years ago the same way. This happens. I mean, this really does happen to kids. And I think any way you can try to reach them - I mean, it's an effort, and it may not work, but there's so much cynicism about, oh, this is a stupid idea. Teens are going to do what they're going to do. You know, I don't - again, I don't think we give teens enough credit sometimes.  CONAN: And here's an email that we got from Eric. And he wrote: My parents had a well-stocked bar when I was a kid. Their rule was, if you want to try something, come and ask. They taught and demonstrated by lifestyle that drinking was no big deal when done responsibly. Most important, they taught that drinking was for celebration and never to ease a bad day. I did the same with my kids, and they had no great interest in getting soused for the sake of getting soused. If the taboo were lifted and kids taught how to handle liquor responsibly, wouldn't this cut down on the mystique and lead to less binge and excessive alcohol consumption?  Ms. PARKER-POPE: You know, there is always this debate. You look in Europe, where alcohol rules are a little more lax, and you don't really see different rates of alcoholism. You don't see that kids are drinking less. So I know it's a good idea, and maybe in an individual family this might be a strategy. You know, in my house growing up, my parents did not drink at all. We never had alcohol in the house. I mean, that was how they set the example. My mother had alcoholism in her family, and it devastated her. She lost her older brother to liver disease related to alcohol. So that made a great impression on us as kids. And, you know, in writing this post and writing about it, the truth is I didn't touch alcohol at all during high school, and this has shocked a lot of people.  You know, surveys which show that about 75 percent of kids have tried alcohol in high school, so maybe I was part of - I was, I guess, part of 25 percent. But that 75 percent is a bit inflated, because those are kids who've maybe tried it. It's the regular drinkers you're really worried about. Not the people who maybe experiment once or twice. But, you know, the reason I never drank in high school is because my parents kept really close track of me. I see these kids who are posting on my blog saying, oh, I get out - I go out every Friday and Saturday and get smashed. It would not have been possible in my household because my - I had a curfew. You know, there were limits to the car, and I would still be grounded today frankly if I had broken any of those rules.  CONAN: Be grounded forever.  Ms. PARKER-POPE: Absolutely. I got that a lot, grounded indefinitely. That was always the threat. And I think that parents have to kind of take some responsibility for this. Yes, kids are exposed - the problem is with this idea of experimenting in the home, you cannot bring your child's friends into the home and say okay, you're curious. You can drink and drink responsibly and I'll take care of you. You can't do that. It's against the law.  CONAN: It is.  Ms. PARKER-POPE: You'll get in a lot of trouble. So this is the dilemma with that kind of suggestion. It might work for some families, not for all.  CONAN: 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. What works? What doesn't? And we'll talk with Martha, Martha with us from San Antonio.  MARTHA: Yes. I had a son that was about 16 at the time when I studied to be a substance abuse counselor. And I brought home all kinds of these kinds of films and, you know, VCR's and all kinds of thing to - well, part of my studying. And I'd bring him in and said, well, I'm going to watch these things. Let's discuss these together and let's watch these together. And it wasn't just smoking or drinking or something. It was a whole thing, you know, substance abuse and the whole bit, which is wonderful. And we saw what it would do to, you know, to your body when you did these things and we'd talk about it, and I don't know. I never did much drinking, anyway. It just wasn't that\u2026  CONAN: Well, did that work for your 16-year-old?  MARTHA: It worked with him. He has been just - he'll take a drink occasionally, you know, like our fiesta, which we have every year here, but he just, you know, it's just not a thing that's interesting. It's an occasional kind of thing, and I haven't had any problems with him at all.  CONAN: Well, the together part might have been the central part there, Tara Parker-Pope.  Ms. PARKER-POPE: Well, this is the other part of the mix. I mean, whatever risk behavior you're talking about, families that are very involved with their kids - whether it's smoking or sex or alcohol or drugs or even an eating disorder, you know, sitting down to the family dinner, you know, every night, expecting your kids to be there at a certain hour, being very invested in your child's life is a great predictor for helping him through these really difficult teenage years. You know, study after study has shown this.  Now there are a lot of great parents who do these things and their kids still, you know, step off the path. So it's not to say that we're blaming parents when kids do this, but if you really want to lower the risk and minimize the risk, being very invested in your child's life is really the way to go.  CONAN: Martha, thanks very much.  MARTHA: You're welcome.  CONAN: Bye-bye. Here's an email from William: The notion that any method, especially naive notions of being direct, warning about the scientific dangers or warning about the effects on their appearance will prevent teens from drinking is almost laughable.  I myself am an 18-year-old who does not drink. I find myself in a minority of less than 10 percent of people my age. People do not drink because they're rebelling or because they don't understand the danger. Teens drink because they enjoy getting drunk.  Almost all teenagers drink, and that will always be the case, as long as alcohol exists. That from Nashville, Tennessee. So at least William, a teenager, disagrees with you there.  Ms. PARKER-POPE: It's very typical of the comment that I received on the blog this week, and I certainly understand that. But if we can - you know, maybe we're not going to eliminate drinking entirely, but can we reduce the number of episodes, the number of exposures? Can we at least convince our kids not to get in the car with somebody who's drinking or to not get behind the wheel?  You know, can we convince them, you know, around exam time that heavy drinking is going to ruin their grades? You know, maybe we'll save a week or two of partying. I mean, it's really all about what you can, you know, accomplish, these small steps. You know, and to say that all kids drink, it's just not true.  There are a lot of really - you know, I get really frustrated. I am a big fan of the American teenager. I think teens are really interesting. I think, you know, they have great ideas. They're thinking, you know, they're building relationships, they're forming habits. And we like to disparage teenagers in this country.  I wrote a story a few months ago about teens and sex, and we have this idea that every kid out there is having sex, that there's this rampant teenage promiscuity, and it's just not true. You know, most teens are fairly cautious about this. In fact, today's\u2026  CONAN: Tara, we have to short break, so Tara, stay with us if you would. We're talking about the best approach when it comes to warning teens away from binge drinking. What works? What doesn't? Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Later in the hour, we want to know who you remember on this Memorial Day. We'd ask you to send us an email if you could. Send it to talk@npr. org, or you can leave your remembrance on our Web site. That's at npr. org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. We'll read some of them later in the program.  Right now, we're talking about teens and drinking. Alcohol is the most common used and abused drug among young people in the United States, more than both tobacco and much more than illegal drugs. And as the summer months roll in, along with parties for graduation and the prom, parents wonder about the best way to get their teens to stay away from booze.  We're talking with reporter Tara Parker-Pope, who writes about health issues on the New York Times Well blog, and she's been talking about a more scientific approach.  We also want to hear from you parents. What works, what doesn't? 800-989-8255. The kids can also join the conversation. Give us a call, and you can also join the conversation at our Web site: npr. org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION.  And let's go to Sky(ph), Sky with us from San Antonio in Texas.  SKY (Caller): Hi, Neal. Thanks for taking my call.  CONAN: Go ahead, please.  SKY: My son began drinking at the age of 14 and almost died celebrating his 18th birthday, and ended up - did die at the age of 30 from an alcohol-related accident.  CONAN: Oh, I'm so sorry.  SKY: Thank you. And what I have to say is that in my experience - I was a very young parent, and so I really didn't think ahead to dialogue with him until he was already deeply in that field. And what I would say to parents is start talking to your kids when they're like 11 or 12 years old. You need to talk to them before their friends start partying at 14 and 15.  At one point in his late 20s, my son did enter and alcohol rehab program and learned about the differences that happen to a young brain, brain chemistry, brainwave function. And as he gained sobriety for a period of time, he saw that changing in himself, and it made a great impact, and he even said I wish I'd known this.  So I think giving kids that kind of information and giving it to them before you think they need it is the suggestion I would have from my experience.  CONAN: So that might have worked with your son?  SKY: I think, you know, had I had that knowledge, had I given it to him - because, you know, there is a history. His father did have alcoholism, and had I thought about it when he was a preteen, I think that might have helped him. And as Tara said, you know, really riding herd on these kids, you know.  The first time I saw him come home drunk, you know, if instead of just giving him a big lecture, I wish I would have grounded him indefinitely.  (Soundbite of laughter)  CONAN: Yeah, that might have worked, too, though some kids have a way of getting around that, too. But\u2026  SKY: Yeah, and he was one of those boys, but I really think for him, because he was very intellectual, he was very intelligent, and information meant a lot to him, had he had that information early in his life, it may have made a difference. So I would suggest that parents talk to them early and talk to them just very straight.  CONAN: Sky, thank you so much for sharing that story.  SKY: Thank you.  Ms. PARKER-POPE: I think that's such a powerful story and such good advice, and I hope people hear it because people are really resistant to this message because they just think oh, it won't work. But it can't hurt, is the thing. And teens really are - one of the problems with teens and alcohol is that unlike adults, you know, they're more vulnerable to the memory problems, to the brain damage, to being impaired. But they handle alcohol in some ways better.  They're less vulnerable to feeling tired, to getting hangovers, to begin wobbly, and then you throw in the fact that kids today are drinking these energy drinks, these high-caffeine energy drinks with alcohol that is sort of making them feel less drunk.  So I think we need to explain to kids you may feel okay, but here's what's going on in your brain and this is why I'm begging you don't get behind the wheel and call me if you do get into this situation.  I think that - I do believe you can reach teens - not every one, but I think it's fascinating that this young man did feel that message would have resonated with him as a teen.  CONAN: Thanks again, Sky.  SKY: Thank you.  CONAN: Joining us now is Laurence Steinberg, who's on the phone from his home in Philadelphia. He is a professor of psychology at Temple University, the author of numerous books on adolescence, including \"The Ten Basic Principles of Good Parenting. \" And nice to have you back on the program with us today.  Professor LAURENCE STEINBERG (Psychology, Temple University; Author, \"The Ten Basic Principles of Good Parenting\"): Good to be back. How are you?  CONAN: And I just wondered if you've given any thought to this scientific approach, if you will, and whether you think it might actually deter some kids from drinking.  Well, I think it's - you know, it's great to try to teach kids about themselves and certainly from the point of view of science education - brain development, but I'm very skeptical that this would have any impact at all on kids' behavior. And I say that, you know, based on what we know about the impact of all kinds of educational approaches on health-related behaviors among kids.  We're very, very good at changing kids' knowledge. We're pretty good at changing their attitudes, and we're terrible at changing their behaviors through these kinds of interventions. And so although, you know, I agree with Tara that it's, you know in some senses, it couldn't hurt to try. The part that I worry about is leaving parents with the, you know, with this overly optimistic belief that they can talk to their kids about how alcohol is going to affect their prefrontal cortex and then send them out to the prom and think that their kids are going to be safe, you know, that doing that is going to be very effective.  CONAN: What does work in your experience?  Prof. STEINBERG: Well, what does work is, you know, the old sort of standbys of chaperoning kids carefully, making sure that they don't drive if they've been drinking, providing transportation for them on evenings when you think that there might be alcohol present, enforcing the law, getting together with other parents and agreeing that you're not going to let alcohol be served, you know, at pre-prom or post-prom parties.  In other words, what does work is limited kids' access to the substances that can hurt them.  CONAN: Limiting access, that's - some parents would say wait a minute, we need to trust our children. Otherwise, how are they going to learn to behave later in life?  Prof. STEINBERG: Well, yeah. On the other hand, on an evening where you believe that in your community it's common for kids to go out and binge drink, get behind the wheel of a car, I think that this lesson, you know, is perhaps not best taught in that context.  You know, as you were talking before, I pulled up on my computer some data from the most recent version of Monitoring the Future, which is a national survey of kids about drugs and alcohol. And, you know, 95 percent of high school seniors in this country say it's very easy to get alcohol. That's a big problem.  CONAN: And that's in a country where largely, I think almost everywhere now, it's 21.  Prof. STEINBERG: That's right.  CONAN: Yeah. 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. And let's go to John, John with us from San Francisco.  JOHN (Caller): Hi. That was a great - thank you for taking the call. That was a great moment to come in on, because I'm a parent of a 14-year-old, and we just had a pre-prom meeting with parents and the health teacher at our child's school. And there was scenarios put out there for discussion, and one of them was a kid comes home with a friend, and the friend is drunk, and your kid tells you, oh, he just went to bed, but don't tell his parents. What do you do?  And it was a (unintelligible) to have a discussion about philosophy on how we deal with that whole trust issue, freedom issue and dealing with the serious matter of underage drinking. And it got pretty heated.  There was a lot of parents who felt that they wouldn't tell to their friends parents and not break the trust between the child. And then my feeling was, well, it's not really fair to allow your child to put you in a position where you're then taking the trust of the parent.  When a parent entrusts you - their kid under your care, I think there's an absolute responsibility to make sure that the parents of that child knows what's going on. And so, you know, I think it's really important that people realize it's more important to be a parent than a friend to your child and starting that discussion very early on, as the woman said earlier, 10, 11 years old, and being involved in your kids' lives because if you're waiting until the big moments, the big crisis moments happen, to get involved into your kids' lives, you're way too late.  Your kid has no real connection or communication that can have any history and trust. And you need to instill that really early on and have dialogue about every little thing in their life all throughout their lives or else when you get to the point where these big-issue topics come up, you're not going to have that sort of history to be able to communicate and have an impact on.  And the other thing is the - regarding access, I 100 percent agree. So many parents feel like, oh, well, if they come here after prom and they're allowed to drink here at my house, it will prevent them from going elsewhere. I think that's another irresponsible position to take to allow them to drink alcohol.  First of all, it's against the law, and you're telling kids it's okay to break some laws when you think it's - you know, that you're more responsible than the laws are saying. And I think it's really just - and it's rampant.  Here - I live in Northern California, and just this weekend, there was a 16-year-old boy who died in Oakland at a party, and I was just up the street. And it's a really tony neighborhood, and these parents left their kids, the house to them thinking, well, at least they're in my house. I don't have to be there to supervise. So what bad can go wrong? And sure enough, a 16-year-old boy died from alcohol poisoning, and there were actually 13-year-old kids there drinking. And now the son of the people who own the house, who is 18, is now looking at jail time for this.  So it's a really serious issue that has been going on for decades, and I think people just underestimate the power of alcohol and the power of the peer pressure. And to think that, well, you know, if all the kids are doing it and if I allow my kid to do a little bit and I trust them that they'll trust - you know, that they'll use it wisely. And I think we just underestimate the maturity level of our kids - or overestimate the maturity of a young adult.  CONAN: Tara Parker-Pope, the sole issue of trust and, well, being your child's parent, not your friend, you'll be grounded indefinitely. I'm sure that came up in responses to your blog post.  Ms. PARKER-POPE: Yeah. I mean, I actually am a firm believer that you don't trust your kids. I mean, you're the parent and you're - they're teenagers and they have a teenage brain. And maybe the most important message of all of this is for the parents to understand that a teenage brain is still developing, and that there are really high stakes here.  And maybe if parents were more aware of this, they would crack down more, because I do agree that it's very hard to change teen behavior. But we have done it.  It's very hard to change anybody's behavior. But if you look at seatbelt laws and cell phone driving laws - and, you know, we're starting to make inroads in some of those areas. And certainly, we're not giving up on teens by saying, well, we're not going to keep you from texting in the car, so we're just not going to talk to you about it.  We're going to keep talking to kids about texting in the car and hope that we make a dent. And I think the goal here is to make a dent and to reach some kids.  You know, I was talking to a high school science teacher who was having this conversation with his students. And one of the students said, you know, nobody ever told me that alcohol would make me stupid, that alcohol would affect my grades. And for that particular student, it resonated. A lot of kids, it won't.  But, again, it's what you can do - you know, again, this is, you know, this is the American Association for the Advancement of Science who's putting out this idea of teaching children about the science, the chemistry, the biology, the neuroscience of alcohol. And I think it's one piece of a very big puzzle.  CONAN: John, thanks very much for the call. Appreciate it.  JOHN: Thank you.  CONAN: And Larry Steinberg, I wanted to - you would think that that story that he just told of the 16-year-old dying of alcohol poisoning, you show that clip from the newspaper - if there's anything such - still exists anyway - to kids and it would be - have persuasive effect, but I think Tara is right. It does not.  Prof. STEINBERG: No, it doesn't. You know, in our lab at Temple, we've been studying something that I think is very relevant to this. And what we've been studying is the impact of peers on kid's judgment and decision making.  And what we're finding in a variety of tasks is that when kids are by themselves, they engage in decision-making and risk-taking behavior that's not that different from adults. But you put them in the same exact task situation but you have their friends in the room with them, and it doubles the number of chances that they take, whereas doing the same thing for an adult has no impact whatsoever.  And we've now been doing imaging studies, where we've been looking at what the neural underpinnings are of this peer influence effect that we're seeing in so many different ways.  And what turns out is that it looks like the presence of friends activates a completely different system of brain circuitry in kids than it does in adults. And it activates brain systems that make individuals more sensation-seeking and reward-seeking and likely to engage in risk-taking behavior.  So, the lesson here is that you can have a conversation with your teenager, and your teenager can be very, very reasonable and get it and understand the information. And as soon as you put that teenager in a group situation with her friends, she's a different person.  CONAN: We're talking about teens and drinking. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  And we're got that story from the Northern California papers, this in an email from Noel(ph). On Saturday night, a 16-year-old young man died of alcohol poisoning in our small tight-knit community. Fellow partiers found him passed out in the hallway. He was gone by midnight. And a family and a community was changed forever.  He was, by all accounts, a premier athlete, a good student from a good family, living in one of the most solid, well-educated communities in the state. We parents know that drinking will happen, and what we need to do now is to educate our kids to know when and how to spot a potential overdose and to let them know that they can and should call the parent or a responsible adult immediately.  And this - another email, this from Ruth: I was a single parent. When my sons were teens, I decided that one way to convince them that alcohol was serious stuff was to quit drinking myself while they were teens. I said, look it, I'll start drinking again when you are drinking age. So there was no alcohol in the house.  I hosted the New Year's Eve party every year for my kids and their friends - no alcohol, lots of good food and fun. The biggest challenge was the parents who thought they were doing the right thing by providing the alcohol to the kids, theirs and others, at their home.  And just a reminder from that other story, you can end up in serious legal difficulties by doing that. And parental role models - are parents role models in this regard, Larry Steinberg?  Prof. STEINBERG: Oh, absolutely. You know, that - two of the biggest influences on kids' drinking are their parents and their friends. And parents can model abstinence. They can also model responsible drinking.  But even still, I think we just don't want to be putting kids in situations where it's really easy for them to get their hands on alcohol, you know, and to get drunk.  CONAN: I wonder, Tara Parker-Pope, what's been the most interesting response you've gotten from your blog post?  Ms. PARKER-POPE: Well, I would say it's the occasional student who steps in and says, actually, you know, this does speak to me. And I've had a few students who - or adults who said, you know, I started drinking at 14, 15. I became an alcoholic. I'm with somebody who tried this with me. You know, you do hear that a lot.  But it's really the negativity. It's the sense of giving up. And that really troubles me. And I've seen it. I started to talk in the earlier segment about, you know, we like to write off our teens. We like to say that boys are just after sex. And if you look at study after study, it shows that boys care about relationships and love just as much as girls do.  You know, you have this image of teen girls gone wild. It's just not true. The - you know, by the time they're in college, the virginity rate among girls is about 25 percent. About half of teens have, you know, by the time they reach, I think, it's junior or senior year, they have not had sex.  So there's a whole segment of our teenagers that are behaving well. And I think, you know, to give up and to throw up your hands and to say, well, you can't reach teens - you can't reach all the teens all the time, but you can reach them some of the time.  I mean, I know that when I was in high school, I was at a party, and the boy who drove me to the party started drinking. And I called my mom and said, you know, you should come pick me up. He's drinking. And she said, okay, and there was no yelling and no trouble. You know, that was a message that had really, you know, been given to me, that I always had that phone call.  And I think that you just need to hit teens from all sides. I think that this is about, well, teens get together and their brains act differently, you can model, as the doctor said, you can model good behavior, too. And hanging around with kids who don't drink is, you know, it protects kids. So encouraging those friendships and encouraging safe places for children to gather, all of those things make a difference.  CONAN: Tara Parker-Pope, excuse me, thank you very much, Tara.  Ms. PARKER-POPE: Thank you.  CONAN: Tara Parker-Pope writes for the New York Times Well blog, and joined us from her home in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Also our thanks to Laurence Steinberg, a professor of psychology at Temple University, with us by phone today. Thank you so much.  Prof. STEINBERG: Thank you.  CONAN: And when we come back, we're going to listen to President Obama. We also want to hear who you would like to remember on this Memorial Day. Send us an email: talk@ npr. org.  This is NPR News.

They say it takes a village to raise a child, but maybe you just need a few moms in your corner. We visit with a diverse group of parents each week for their common sense and savvy parenting advice. Today, becoming a mother at a later age. According to the March of Dimes, one in five women has her first child after age 35, and some are giving birth much, much later. Elizabeth Adeney, a pregnant 66-year-old woman from Britain, has prompted widespread discussion and media coverage. She became pregnant following in-vitro fertilization treatments in the Ukraine. This story has reignited the debate over how old is too old for motherhood. For information and insight on the topic, we turn to Dr. Nancy Cheschier. She's a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. Dr. Cheschier focuses on high-risk pregnancies. Thanks so much for being with us, Dr. Cheschier. NANCY CHESCHIER: Thank you for having me. NEARY: Now as I understand it, women's fertility declines after the age of 35, but at what age does fertility end altogether? CHESCHIER: Most women would have a complete loss of fertility by 50. Certainly women who have premature menopause might lose that ability even earlier. And there are certainly women who have spontaneous pregnancies, in other words without in-vitro fertilization, even after 50, but that's extremely rare. NEARY: So the only way to get pregnant after menopause is through in-vitro fertilization. CHESCHIER: That's correct. NEARY: What are the risks associated with these kinds of pregnancies at a very late age? CHESCHIER: Well, there's a variety of different risks associated with them, and one of the first ones has to do with the health of the mother before she even gets pregnant. There's a much higher risk of high blood pressure in women who are in their 40s and 50s. So certainly women in those age groups considering pregnancy are going to be at higher risk of hypertension, diabetes. Breast cancer is one that I like to highlight in the discussion with women considering pregnancy over 40 because it would be important for someone, for instance, to get a mammogram before she got pregnant to make sure that we wouldn't be dealing with that once her pregnancy was progressing. Assuming that's okay, for the most part her medical condition should be fairly stable throughout the pregnancy. NEARY: And what about the risk to the fetus? CHESCHIER: The risk to the fetus is that one of the natural processes of aging is that our blood vessels and our blood supply, small blood vessels, for instance, in the base of the uterus where the placenta will implant, may not do what they're supposed to do in pregnancy. So you don't get a normal placenta developing, and women might and are at increased risk of developing a baby who is too small. So instead of being a healthy, seven-pound baby at its due date might only be three or four pounds, and those babies have distinct problems. NEARY: You know, this debate over how old a woman should be when she has children isn't new. And reproductive technology's been around for a long time. Why are we still asking some of these questions? Why are we still discussing this? Should we have made some decisions about the limits of reproductive technology by now? CHESCHIER: I don't think those are really ever going to be possible to be made in the abstract. You're dealing with individual people, and I don't know that that can be legislated or decisions made across the board for everybody. There are going to be exceptions to each rule that you make. NEARY: Are there any limits you would put on it with a patient, or would you always take it just on a case-by-case basis? CHESCHIER: I would always take it on a case-by-case basis. I would generally not recommend it after age 50. But you know, if someone was really committed to doing this and was a good candidate and came to me pre-conceptionally, I would put some very honest issues on the table with her. But if she chose to proceed and get in-vitro fertilization and then came to me as a high-risk OB doctor to take care of her, I would most certainly take care of her. NEARY: Dr. Nancy Cheschier is a maternal-fetal medicine specialist with a focus on high-risk pregnancy with the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. Thanks so much for being with us. CHESCHIER: Thank you. NEARY: Now I'd like to turn to two moms who had kids at a later age. Elena Fernandez is a public relations manager at IBM, and she had her first child at 39 and her second at 41. Iris Wilcox is a stay-at-home mom who had first child at 38 and her second at 44. Welcome to you both. ELENA FERNANDEZ: Thank you. IRIS WILCOX: Thank you. NEARY: So you both chose or decided to have children later in life but certainly not at the age of 66. Do you think that there's a point at which it is too old to have a child? Let's start with you first, Elena. FERNANDEZ: I think this is a very personal decision. Obviously this woman has made a choice that could be a physical risk to her but she's obviously thought through it. The notion of what constitutes a family I think has changed dramatically in the last 30 years, whether you're single or divorced, or in a traditional marriage relationship, or in a same-sex relationship. What matters is the web that you build around you to support that decision. And the web constitutes, of course, you know, financial decision and emotional decision as well as the physical and energy decision. NEARY: What do you think about the decision by this woman in Britain? Her decision seems to have sparked, renewed this debate over this question, having a baby at the age of 66? Do you think there's a point at which a woman should say, I'm just too old to do it? Iris? WILCOX: I'd certainly say that. You know, I obviously I can't get inside of her head. I have no idea what she's thinking, but at a certain point I question whether there's some selfishness there. You know, children, they come through us but we don't own them, they're not our property. And so to treat a child almost like a puppy or something to have and admire, you know, that goes away quickly I think when the reality of mothering comes in. Maybe she's old enough that she understands all of that. I don't know, but you know, at a certain point I question it. NEARY: What do you think about that, Elena, this idea that if a woman is too old that it's selfish to bring a child into the world at, let's say, the age of 66? FERNANDEZ: I don't. I worry about her physical health in going through this, but I certainly don't hear and I know she's also a divorced woman, I don't hear folks asking Larry King the same question about becoming a dad. How old is he, like in his early 70s now? And he's got young kids. I'm not sure I'm hearing that. And it sounds like this is a pretty serious decision on her end and she has the financial means, and she has apparently the web or the network to be able to raise a child. You know, good for her. I also think from a cultural point of view, growing up in, you know, in a Hispanic culture, I know a lot of grandmothers at the age of 66 raising a whole entire family on their own. So in terms of her ability to raise this child after she's made a concerted effort to put all her heart and soul into it, I applaud that. I think it's great. NEARY: When both of you decided to get pregnant or reached the point where you were in a position to get pregnant, did you worry about the health risks at all at any point, Elena? FERNANDEZ: I did. I actually had, both my pregnancies were high-risk. But I think that's more of a genetic kind of a situation where my sisters who had had children growing up in Puerto Rico much earlier in their 20s had similar situations and I was aware of that. But here in Boston I had the best care I could get and it was very well controlled and I felt I was in good hands. But I did worry about that a little bit. NEARY: What about you, Iris? Did you have any concern? You had your second child at 44. Was that harder than at the age of 38? WILCOX: I don't know if I'd say it was harder or not. I can tell you for me I looked at it from a spiritual perspective. I didn't have a lot of health concerns because I said, you know what, this is in God's hands. And whatever happens is something that he's going to take us through and that's pretty much where I left it. NEARY: You know, I should say at this point that I had my first child or I adopted my first child actually when I was in my mid-40s, so I have to count myself among the older parents out there. And I wondered how you both feel about whether your age is a help or a hindrance with your kids. Because there have been times where I can see it from both sides. I think when you're older when you have kids sometimes it seems like it's just the perfect age to be in your 40s. You're really not that old. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)NEARY: And you're really a little more mature than when you were young. How do you both feel about that, Elena? FERNANDEZ: Now the physical part of having a child was okay, we're done with that, we're moving into what's important which is raising kids. And as a divorced single mom I was - I relied a lot on, again, that web of support. It took me a while, even though I've always had tons of energy to focus on myself and realize the importance of, you know, exercise, eating well. That's critical. Moms tend to forget about, you know, themselves. And as you age you really have to focus on that aspect of your life even more. NEARY: What do you think about that, Iris? What's the good part about being the age you are and being a parent at this time? WILCOX: Hopefully being wiser. NEARY: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)WILCOX: I mean definitely there are things I know now that I didn't know when I was younger. And having a different perspective about what's important. I'm at home now with my kids but I worked a lot of years. And so, having been out in the workforce I know that I'm not missing anything by being home and so I'm able to focus on being home and not trying to climb a career ladder. Knowing that it's still possible when my kids are older and I decide I want to that I can go back into the workforce and I'll still be okay. But I definitely think better because I just know more. NEARY: Yeah. I also think that whole idea of sort of being satisfied with where you are, not yearning to be out at night, let's say, going to parties or something. Like, if you have a child when you're very young you always hear that, you know, that sometimes people who become parents at a very young age yearn for things that they might've missed because they were parents. That's one thing that doesn't happen if you're in your 40s. You're not sorry to sit home at night with your kids. . . (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)NEARY: I don't think. Right, Elena? FERNANDEZ: Well I think there - I hear you, but there is a, I mean you're talking to a single mom here so. NEARY: Right. Okay. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)FERNANDEZ: Even with married couples. I mean, I remember when I was married and, you know, I was always into, you know, relationship building skills. And even to this day, you know, the day I find somebody, I know that my kids that, you know, who are 10 and eight, you know, six, seven years from now it's starting already. They are going to want to have their own lives. So I think, you know, you don't want to be out partying every night, but as a couple if you're in a traditional relationship, you do want to have a date a week. You want to get away and have one day a week when you're building that relationship because if you're not happy you cannot make your kids happy. NEARY: What do you think, Iris? WILCOX: I think that's absolutely right. And I'm very blessed because I do have a husband who's very involved with the kids and gives me the support that I need. And I might say, too, and this is one of the things that makes me more comfortable about being an older mother, I have a younger husband, someone who's nine years my junior. So when I thought about maybe not being around as long as I'd like to be and still hoping to be, he'll be there for the kids. And so that's great. But we do take time for our relationship and we do have date nights. And we get away for long weekends. We have a vacation for the kids and a vacation for us because we want to keep our relationship where it needs to be. NEARY: Well do you worry about age at all, either one of you, that, you know, that you're not going to be around for your kids when they're older? FERNANDEZ: You know, I - the comment that Iris made about, you know, your younger husband, I think is great, but no one knows when you're going to go. And I grew up with a godmother who was very important in my life and at age 45 she had an aneurism and she died overnight. This happens all the time. So this is why I go back to, you have - there are a lot of things in life that you don't have control over. Yes I do worry about, you know, dying like I think almost everybody else. But I'm trying to live my life every single day the best I can and take care of myself. And that's why, you know, going back to the exercise, to the nutrition, to being a spiritual whole entire person so that you're happy and you can make them happy. I think that kind of sort of permeates throughout the rest of your life with the kids. And at the end of the day I have no control of when I'm going to go. NEARY: Do you worry about that, Iris? Do you think about that at all? WILCOX: Yes, I don't think, I don't spend a lot of time thinking about it. I don't dwell it. But when I think about somebody as old, that's not old old, but as old as 66 having a child. I think about my adult friends who have lost parents and I've had them say, you know, no matter how old you are, when you lose both of your parents you're an orphan. And so, of course, you're obviously much better equipped to deal with it if you're already an adult but it's difficult. Then I think of children who will be younger and losing parents. If you're going to do that, certainly you've got to have in place that support system. You know, that will that spells out exactly what's going to happen with the children, somebody who's already spending time with them that they will feel comfortable, you know, growing up with. So I think that's really important. NEARY: And the whole financial question is also kind of complicated. I wanted to ask you about that because I think what happens is and this is something that people may not think through entirely, but you know, right around the time your kids are getting ready to go to college is around the time that most people are thinking about retiring. I mean, a lot of sort of financial pressures can come together at the same time. Have, is this anything the two of you are thinking about and planning for? FERNANDEZ: I mean, I think that financial planning is absolutely critical, and when you're a single mom, to me it's top of the list. But my theory is, if I love what I do I hope God gives me the brain cells to continue to do this until, you know, I can't do it anymore or I'm not efficient at it. So retirement right now at age, what, 48, 49? I forgot my age, 49, is something I'm planning for but it's not something I'm really obsessed with. NEARY: Do you worry at all about the finances, Iris, or you got that taken care of? WILCOX: You know what, I have a husband who's an excellent money manager and he's doing a pretty good job of taking care of that. And because I'm at home now, my paychecks are few and far between. But I expect that at some point I'll be in the workforce and hopefully we will have planned and prepared well enough that that will just be gravy for them. But we do think about it and we are making plans to make sure that not when we're gone, but even while we're still here they'll be able to go out and make their mark on the world with a step up. NEARY: Do you ever worry that your kids are going to look at you and say, god you're a geezer mom? (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)NEARY: You're too old. WILCOX: No I don't. You know what, and this is another that and God has such a wonderful sense of humor. I'm blessed with good genes and usually, certainly when I meet people they have no idea how old I am. And because my husband happens to be younger I just - when they call his number I just go with him and nobody questions it. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)NEARY: How old are yours? WILCOX: Six and 12. So I took my kindergartener to school at 50. NEARY: Oh wow. Yeah. That's. . . WILCOX: (unintelligible). NEARY: Yes. WILCOX: For the kids, I mean they don't know. He couldn't care less. And like I said, I don't - people don't automatically recognize it. But it's just, it messes with your mind sometimes just to see the little 20-somethings who bring in their kids right along with you and you just watch that whole thing and it's just interesting. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)NEARY: What about you, Elena? FERNANDEZ: I think kids don't have a sense, although they already have started asking my age twenty thousand times, as long as I don't repeat it to the whole world. I think they, kids see their parents for what they are and I think age sometimes doesn't really matter. It's, you know, the spirit of that person. So a 66 year-old woman is still working, is very active, she's a leader, if she keeps it up I'm sure that that's going to be an embarrassment to the child. I think if she gives the child a lot of love and a spiritual framework and a financial and emotional and physical path to develop, I think she's going to be okay. NEARY: Elena Fernandez is a PR manager and the mother of two. She joined me from WGBH in Boston. And Iris Wilcox is a stay-at-home mom of two. And she joined me from WBEZ in Chicago. Ladies, it was great talking with you. FERNANDEZ: Thank you. WILCOX: Thank you. NEARY: And remember, at TELL ME MORE the conversation never ends. And we want to hear from you. In your opinion, what age is too old for a woman to have a baby? Are you a mother that waited to have a child at 40 or did you have children well into your 40s? Are you the child of an older mother? We'd like for you to tell us more about it. Please call our comment line at 202-842-3522. That's 202-842-3522. Remember to leave your name or you can go to our website, the TELL ME MORE page at NPR. org and blog it out. And that's our program for today. I'm Lynn Neary and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Let's talk more tomorrow. LYNN NEARY, Host:  I'm Lynn Neary filling in for Michel Martin, and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. They say it takes a village to raise a child, but maybe you just need a few moms in your corner. We visit with a diverse group of parents each week for their common sense and savvy parenting advice. Today, becoming a mother at a later age. According to the March of Dimes, one in five women has her first child after age 35, and some are giving birth much, much later. Elizabeth Adeney, a pregnant 66-year-old woman from Britain, has prompted widespread discussion and media coverage. She became pregnant following in-vitro fertilization treatments in the Ukraine. This story has reignited the debate over how old is too old for motherhood. For information and insight on the topic, we turn to Dr. Nancy Cheschier. She's a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. Dr. Cheschier focuses on high-risk pregnancies. Thanks so much for being with us, Dr. Cheschier. NANCY CHESCHIER: Thank you for having me. NEARY: Now as I understand it, women's fertility declines after the age of 35, but at what age does fertility end altogether? CHESCHIER: Most women would have a complete loss of fertility by 50. Certainly women who have premature menopause might lose that ability even earlier. And there are certainly women who have spontaneous pregnancies, in other words without in-vitro fertilization, even after 50, but that's extremely rare. NEARY: So the only way to get pregnant after menopause is through in-vitro fertilization. CHESCHIER: That's correct. NEARY: What are the risks associated with these kinds of pregnancies at a very late age? CHESCHIER: Well, there's a variety of different risks associated with them, and one of the first ones has to do with the health of the mother before she even gets pregnant. There's a much higher risk of high blood pressure in women who are in their 40s and 50s. So certainly women in those age groups considering pregnancy are going to be at higher risk of hypertension, diabetes. Breast cancer is one that I like to highlight in the discussion with women considering pregnancy over 40 because it would be important for someone, for instance, to get a mammogram before she got pregnant to make sure that we wouldn't be dealing with that once her pregnancy was progressing. Assuming that's okay, for the most part her medical condition should be fairly stable throughout the pregnancy. NEARY: And what about the risk to the fetus? CHESCHIER: The risk to the fetus is that one of the natural processes of aging is that our blood vessels and our blood supply, small blood vessels, for instance, in the base of the uterus where the placenta will implant, may not do what they're supposed to do in pregnancy. So you don't get a normal placenta developing, and women might and are at increased risk of developing a baby who is too small. So instead of being a healthy, seven-pound baby at its due date might only be three or four pounds, and those babies have distinct problems. NEARY: You know, this debate over how old a woman should be when she has children isn't new. And reproductive technology's been around for a long time. Why are we still asking some of these questions? Why are we still discussing this? Should we have made some decisions about the limits of reproductive technology by now? CHESCHIER: I don't think those are really ever going to be possible to be made in the abstract. You're dealing with individual people, and I don't know that that can be legislated or decisions made across the board for everybody. There are going to be exceptions to each rule that you make. NEARY: Are there any limits you would put on it with a patient, or would you always take it just on a case-by-case basis? CHESCHIER: I would always take it on a case-by-case basis. I would generally not recommend it after age 50. But you know, if someone was really committed to doing this and was a good candidate and came to me pre-conceptionally, I would put some very honest issues on the table with her. But if she chose to proceed and get in-vitro fertilization and then came to me as a high-risk OB doctor to take care of her, I would most certainly take care of her. NEARY: Dr. Nancy Cheschier is a maternal-fetal medicine specialist with a focus on high-risk pregnancy with the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. Thanks so much for being with us. CHESCHIER: Thank you. NEARY: Now I'd like to turn to two moms who had kids at a later age. Elena Fernandez is a public relations manager at IBM, and she had her first child at 39 and her second at 41. Iris Wilcox is a stay-at-home mom who had first child at 38 and her second at 44. Welcome to you both. ELENA FERNANDEZ: Thank you. IRIS WILCOX: Thank you. NEARY: So you both chose or decided to have children later in life but certainly not at the age of 66. Do you think that there's a point at which it is too old to have a child? Let's start with you first, Elena. FERNANDEZ: I think this is a very personal decision. Obviously this woman has made a choice that could be a physical risk to her but she's obviously thought through it. The notion of what constitutes a family I think has changed dramatically in the last 30 years, whether you're single or divorced, or in a traditional marriage relationship, or in a same-sex relationship. What matters is the web that you build around you to support that decision. And the web constitutes, of course, you know, financial decision and emotional decision as well as the physical and energy decision. NEARY: What do you think about the decision by this woman in Britain? Her decision seems to have sparked, renewed this debate over this question, having a baby at the age of 66? Do you think there's a point at which a woman should say, I'm just too old to do it? Iris? WILCOX: I'd certainly say that. You know, I obviously I can't get inside of her head. I have no idea what she's thinking, but at a certain point I question whether there's some selfishness there. You know, children, they come through us but we don't own them, they're not our property. And so to treat a child almost like a puppy or something to have and admire, you know, that goes away quickly I think when the reality of mothering comes in. Maybe she's old enough that she understands all of that. I don't know, but you know, at a certain point I question it. NEARY: What do you think about that, Elena, this idea that if a woman is too old that it's selfish to bring a child into the world at, let's say, the age of 66? FERNANDEZ: I don't. I worry about her physical health in going through this, but I certainly don't hear and I know she's also a divorced woman, I don't hear folks asking Larry King the same question about becoming a dad. How old is he, like in his early 70s now? And he's got young kids. I'm not sure I'm hearing that. And it sounds like this is a pretty serious decision on her end and she has the financial means, and she has apparently the web or the network to be able to raise a child. You know, good for her. I also think from a cultural point of view, growing up in, you know, in a Hispanic culture, I know a lot of grandmothers at the age of 66 raising a whole entire family on their own. So in terms of her ability to raise this child after she's made a concerted effort to put all her heart and soul into it, I applaud that. I think it's great. NEARY: When both of you decided to get pregnant or reached the point where you were in a position to get pregnant, did you worry about the health risks at all at any point, Elena? FERNANDEZ: I did. I actually had, both my pregnancies were high-risk. But I think that's more of a genetic kind of a situation where my sisters who had had children growing up in Puerto Rico much earlier in their 20s had similar situations and I was aware of that. But here in Boston I had the best care I could get and it was very well controlled and I felt I was in good hands. But I did worry about that a little bit. NEARY: What about you, Iris? Did you have any concern? You had your second child at 44. Was that harder than at the age of 38? WILCOX: I don't know if I'd say it was harder or not. I can tell you for me I looked at it from a spiritual perspective. I didn't have a lot of health concerns because I said, you know what, this is in God's hands. And whatever happens is something that he's going to take us through and that's pretty much where I left it. NEARY: You know, I should say at this point that I had my first child or I adopted my first child actually when I was in my mid-40s, so I have to count myself among the older parents out there. And I wondered how you both feel about whether your age is a help or a hindrance with your kids. Because there have been times where I can see it from both sides. I think when you're older when you have kids sometimes it seems like it's just the perfect age to be in your 40s. You're really not that old. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) NEARY: And you're really a little more mature than when you were young. How do you both feel about that, Elena? FERNANDEZ: Now the physical part of having a child was okay, we're done with that, we're moving into what's important which is raising kids. And as a divorced single mom I was - I relied a lot on, again, that web of support. It took me a while, even though I've always had tons of energy to focus on myself and realize the importance of, you know, exercise, eating well. That's critical. Moms tend to forget about, you know, themselves. And as you age you really have to focus on that aspect of your life even more. NEARY: What do you think about that, Iris? What's the good part about being the age you are and being a parent at this time? WILCOX: Hopefully being wiser. NEARY: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) WILCOX: I mean definitely there are things I know now that I didn't know when I was younger. And having a different perspective about what's important. I'm at home now with my kids but I worked a lot of years. And so, having been out in the workforce I know that I'm not missing anything by being home and so I'm able to focus on being home and not trying to climb a career ladder. Knowing that it's still possible when my kids are older and I decide I want to that I can go back into the workforce and I'll still be okay. But I definitely think better because I just know more. NEARY: Yeah. I also think that whole idea of sort of being satisfied with where you are, not yearning to be out at night, let's say, going to parties or something. Like, if you have a child when you're very young you always hear that, you know, that sometimes people who become parents at a very young age yearn for things that they might've missed because they were parents. That's one thing that doesn't happen if you're in your 40s. You're not sorry to sit home at night with your kids. . . (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) NEARY: I don't think. Right, Elena? FERNANDEZ: Well I think there - I hear you, but there is a, I mean you're talking to a single mom here so. NEARY: Right. Okay. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) FERNANDEZ: Even with married couples. I mean, I remember when I was married and, you know, I was always into, you know, relationship building skills. And even to this day, you know, the day I find somebody, I know that my kids that, you know, who are 10 and eight, you know, six, seven years from now it's starting already. They are going to want to have their own lives. So I think, you know, you don't want to be out partying every night, but as a couple if you're in a traditional relationship, you do want to have a date a week. You want to get away and have one day a week when you're building that relationship because if you're not happy you cannot make your kids happy. NEARY: What do you think, Iris? WILCOX: I think that's absolutely right. And I'm very blessed because I do have a husband who's very involved with the kids and gives me the support that I need. And I might say, too, and this is one of the things that makes me more comfortable about being an older mother, I have a younger husband, someone who's nine years my junior. So when I thought about maybe not being around as long as I'd like to be and still hoping to be, he'll be there for the kids. And so that's great. But we do take time for our relationship and we do have date nights. And we get away for long weekends. We have a vacation for the kids and a vacation for us because we want to keep our relationship where it needs to be. NEARY: Well do you worry about age at all, either one of you, that, you know, that you're not going to be around for your kids when they're older? FERNANDEZ: You know, I - the comment that Iris made about, you know, your younger husband, I think is great, but no one knows when you're going to go. And I grew up with a godmother who was very important in my life and at age 45 she had an aneurism and she died overnight. This happens all the time. So this is why I go back to, you have - there are a lot of things in life that you don't have control over. Yes I do worry about, you know, dying like I think almost everybody else. But I'm trying to live my life every single day the best I can and take care of myself. And that's why, you know, going back to the exercise, to the nutrition, to being a spiritual whole entire person so that you're happy and you can make them happy. I think that kind of sort of permeates throughout the rest of your life with the kids. And at the end of the day I have no control of when I'm going to go. NEARY: Do you worry about that, Iris? Do you think about that at all? WILCOX: Yes, I don't think, I don't spend a lot of time thinking about it. I don't dwell it. But when I think about somebody as old, that's not old old, but as old as 66 having a child. I think about my adult friends who have lost parents and I've had them say, you know, no matter how old you are, when you lose both of your parents you're an orphan. And so, of course, you're obviously much better equipped to deal with it if you're already an adult but it's difficult. Then I think of children who will be younger and losing parents. If you're going to do that, certainly you've got to have in place that support system. You know, that will that spells out exactly what's going to happen with the children, somebody who's already spending time with them that they will feel comfortable, you know, growing up with. So I think that's really important. NEARY: And the whole financial question is also kind of complicated. I wanted to ask you about that because I think what happens is and this is something that people may not think through entirely, but you know, right around the time your kids are getting ready to go to college is around the time that most people are thinking about retiring.

Millions of Americans take them every day, and accidental overdose deaths are on the rise. This morning, we'll visit a state facing a growing problem. Here's Scott Finn of West Virginia Public Broadcasting. SCOTT FINN: In the county courthouse in tiny Pineville, West Virginia, clerk Michael Goode flips through a fat folder of death certificates. Each one represents someone who died of an accidental drug overdose. Mr. MICHAEL GOODE (Clerk of the Court, Pineville, West Virginia): Fifty-eight years old with oxycodone, hydrocodone, alazopram. Thirty-three years old. . . FINN: Goode, who's also the town's only funeral director, says about 10 years ago, drug abusers began to crush and snort prescription painkillers for a heroin-like high. Some steal the prescription drugs or buy them on the street. In 2007, drug overdoses killed 18 people in Wyoming County, more than car accidents, homicide and suicide combined. Mr. GOODE: It's amazing the things that you see that, you know, that causes death of relatively young people that should be still a productive part of society for the next 20 years. If these people had died of the swine flu, we'd probably be making national headlines. FINN: West Virginia has the nation's worst overdose death rate, but it's become a national problem. The number of accidental drug overdoses in the U. S. has doubled, from about 11,000 in 1999 to more than 22,000 in 2005. Most of that increase is blamed on prescription painkillers. It's gotten so big that the Food and Drug Administration is taking action. FDA spokeswoman Judy Leon explains. Ms. JUDY LEON (Spokeswoman, Food and Drug Administration): These drugs will be required to have a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or what we call REMS, to ensure that the benefits of the drugs continue to outweigh the risks. FINN: In recent years, FDA officials added black box warnings to Fentanyl and methadone and sent educational letters to doctors. But officials now say their previous education efforts have largely failed. In this new REMS plan, the agency could require patients to submit to drug testing, or require a pill count, where patients must bring to their doctor unused pain medication. It also could require doctors to attend special training, or even limit those who can prescribe certain painkillers. And if the drug companies don't go along, the FDA could conceivably pull some of these painkillers off the market. Pain specialist J. K. Lilly says the news has sent shockwaves through his profession. Dr. J. K. LILLY (Pain Specialist): As far as I know, nobody expected it. The way it came out of nowhere, it was like a bomb out of the blue with a 60-day fuse. FINN: Lilly runs Appalachian Pain Clinic in Charleston. He's worried new restrictions may make life harder for legitimate pain patients. He says since many of the overdoses occur when the drug is used elicitly, it's the DEA - the Drug Enforcement Administration - not the FDA that should be taking the lead. Dr. LILLY: I mean, it's not uncommon to see people come in the hospital, overdosed with grandma's Xanax, my brother-in-law's hydrocodone and a couple of methadones from somebody that he bought off the street. Those people can get dead real quick. Every one of those drugs that they got were prescription drugs, but they were not provided for them. FINN: While pain doctors worry the FDA may go too far, relatives of overdose victims think the agency may not do enough. Some are calling for an outright ban on certain extended-release painkillers such oxycontin, the drug that is now so popular in Appalachia, it's earned the nickname hillbilly heroin.

NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: Now, a team of Japanese scientists says it has genetically altered monkeys and then bred them to produce even more monkeys with the extra gene. Hideyuki Okano of Keio University says his team used a virus to carry a gene for a green glowing protein into 80 marmoset embryos. Mr. HIDEYUKI OKANO (Keio University): When these embryos are returned to the uterus from the surrogate mother marmoset, the pregnancy was established. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Five babies were born. Four had the gene throughout their bodies, and when they reproduced, they passed the gene to the next generation. The glowing gene doesn't do anything. It just shows an added gene can be inherited, and that's important because researchers have never achieved this with monkeys before. Now, it should be easier to generate groups of monkeys with genes for diseases like Parkinson's.

Consider this: A human body contains 10 times as many bacterial cells as it does human cells. And as NPR's Richard Harris reports, it turns out the diversity of life on our skin is remarkable. RICHARD HARRIS: When you think of an ecosystem, you probably think of the savannah, or the ocean or the rich of life of a tropical rain forest. Well, Julia Segre, at the National Human Genome Research Institute, has been exploring an ecosystem much closer to home: our skin. Dr. JULIA SEGRE (National Human Genome Research Institute): We think of the skin as a desert, but within the desert of our dry skin, there are these streams - and those are the creases of our bodies. And then there are the oases, so places that are very moist and rich. That would be something like the underarm or the bellybutton. HARRIS: Segre and her colleagues sampled the bacterial wildlife from 20 different spots on the bodies of 10 volunteers. They found, like on our planet, there are astonishing differences from one place to the next. Dr. SEGRE: Of the human skin, we think of the inside of the nose as the rain forest. HARRIS: There, the researchers discovered a huge wealth of biological diversity. Oily parts of the skin, like next to the nose or behind the ear, are a host to a whole different ecosystem of microorganisms. And even dry spots turn out to harbor different mixes of organisms. Segre and her colleagues report the results in the current issue of Science magazine. She says this is fascinating stuff, but she says it's also potentially useful. Dr. SEGRE: We had always wondered why it is that skin diseases strike in one place or another. Eczema is always inside the elbow. Psoriasis is on the outside of the elbow. Those human cells are the same. HARRIS: It turns out the skin's the same, but the microbes that live inside the elbow and outside the elbow are quite different. Now, psoriasis and eczema are apparently not caused by bacteria, but they could be a reaction triggered by a change in the ecosystems of the germs on our skin. Dr. SEGRE: So when we think about what promotes health and also what causes disease, we have to consider that it could be the bacteria and the fungi and the other microorganisms that live together with us, that they could be out of balance. HARRIS: Now, considering that the field of microbiology is more than 100 years old, you'd think scientists would've discovered all this long ago. The problem is, 99 percent of skin germs don't grow in the laboratory, so scientists couldn't identify them. Now they can by fingerprinting their DNA, and that's opened up a whole new world. Martin Blaser at New York University sees enormous opportunity in this field. Dr. MARTIN BLASER (New York University): The first step is to do the kind of census that is done here. And then a further step is to begin to understand what are the interactions that our microbes are having with our own cells, first in health and then ultimately in disease. HARRIS: And the microbes are not just interacting with us, but also with one other. Dr. BLASER: If this is like other ecosystems, the microbes are both competing with one another and cooperating. HARRIS: And skin is just the start. The National Institutes of Health is now embarking on a follow-on to the Human Genome Project called the Human Microbiome Project. Julie Segre says we won't really understand human biology without a deeper appreciation for our fellow travelers. Dr. SEGRE: The human genome is really an amalgamation of the human cells and the bacterial cells. And it's time for us to turn attention to the other organisms that live together with our human cells. HARRIS: In fact, given the enormous variety of bacteria that Segre has cataloged with this latest census, it's likely that the bacteria in total have far more genes than we do. It'll be a challenge to decipher them all, but that's the goal. Richard Harris, NPR News.

Who - what is the real story? How did the telescope really come to be and was it even one person who thought it up? Here to answer some of those questions is my guest. He's Albert van Helden. He's a science historian, professor emeritus of Rice University. He's also professor emeritus of Utrecht University in the Netherlands where he's joining us over the phone. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Dr. ALBERT VAN HELDEN (Science historian): Hello. FLATOW: Hi, how are you? How are you this evening? Dr. VAN HELDEN: I'm fine. It's a pleasure to be here. FLATOW: Well, everybody we asked always says it's going to be Galileo. But they're always wrong, aren't they? Dr. VAN HELDEN: Yes, they are. But\u2026 FLATOW: How did all of this get started? Dr. VAN HELDEN: Well, we can understand why, I mean, it's Galileo really made it famous. But he didn't invent it. In fact, it's not at all clear if we can find the actual identity of the inventor or the person who claim to patent or privilege for it in 1608. We know that person. That's Hans Lipperhey. No S, by the way. Hans Lipperhey. FLATOW: And what was he doing at the time? Dr. VAN HELDEN: Oh, he was a spectacle maker in the city of Middelburg which is in the extreme southwest of the Netherlands. And he was sent with a letter of recommendation by the city fathers to The Hague, where the national government sat, the state's general. And he presented the instrument to Prince Maurice who was the military commander of the Dutch Armed Forces. And Prince Maurice referred him to the state's general. And he asked for a patent and they examined the instrument. They asked him to make some more of those instruments. He used better sorts(ph) of glass to make them binocular. And then, they paid him quite a bit of money, 900 guilders, and denied his patent. The reason for that is that the instrument was so easy to copy. He couldn't keep it secret. FLATOW: How good a telescope did he make in those days? Dr. VAN HELDEN: Well, he make - the one that he presented to Prince Maurice and then he made three more for the state's general. And that's all we know. FLATOW: So this was not envisioned originally as a tool for science, but for defense, military uses? Dr. VAN HELDEN: Well, yeah. But, of course, it wasn't all that useful in military purposes until rather later I think. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. VAN HELDEN: But, no. It was not - science was not part of it, although it's pretty obvious to direct it to the heavens. But these are three, four-powered spyglasses that don't really show very much in the heavens. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. But could you use them, let's say, out looking over the ocean? When did the telescope become useful for seeing ships out there? Dr. VAN HELDEN: Well, this particular instrument, at higher powers, has a very small field of view. And on the pitching deck of a ship, it's very difficult to see anything through it. Later on in the 17th century, you get sort of 10-powered spyglasses with a large field of view. And, you know, then they become common on ships on the ocean. FLATOW: What was the technical hurdle that they had to overcome to make a better telescope? Dr. VAN HELDEN: Now, the way the telescope came about is that spectacle lenses which had been around since 1300 became better and better. In the 16th century, lens makers began grinding them on both sides and polishing them on both sides, of course. And then the quality of those lenses became almost good enough for, you know, a telescope. But the shape of the convex lens is not accurate enough. And so, it was only right in the center that a little bit was truly spherical. And that little area sort of grew. And by 1608, with the best glass and top-of-the-line lens makers, you could actually have a convex lens of, say, three centimeters in diameter of which you had an area in the center of about one centimeter in diameter to which the image was perfect. But, of course, the rest - the light coming through the rest of the lens would screw everything up. FLATOW: Right. Dr. VAN HELDEN: And so, it's when someone - and that may very well have been Lipperhey, put an aperture ring - in other words, a cardboard ring with a little hole in the center of about one centimeter diameter - and then all of a sudden you got an enlarged image that was clear and in focus. And Lipperhey realized that and he said, hey, I've got something here. And he went to the government. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And they paid him to make more telescopes? Dr. VAN HELDEN: Yeah. They paid him enough money to buy a house, 900 guilders. FLATOW: Wow. So how did Galileo get into this picture? Dr. VAN HELDEN: Well, the news spread from The Hague, through diplomatic channels, because The Hague happened to be the scene of an international peace conference. And so everybody was sending the news home in a diplomatic pouch. There was also a newsletter published very quickly after Lipperhey's patent application. And that reached Venice probably in November 1608, where Galileo's friend, Paulo Sarpi, read it and alerted Galileo. But nothing much happened for a while because Sarpi, and of course Galileo as well, had been hearing so many rumors about the powerful magic mirrors and things like that that they thought that the news of a magic mirror from the court in Paris was the same news about a magic device coming from the courts in The Hague. So it took a while for them to get confirmation. And it's not really until the spring - well into the spring of 1609 - that Galileo got confirmation. He made his own by just simply going to a spectacle-maker's shop and playing with lenses. And then he realized that if he could improve that device, then it had a lot of promise for career opportunities. And, yeah, who knows what else? And so, he set out to make a more powerful instrument. And by August, he was presenting one to the Venetian Senate and so all the old gentlemen went up to the top of the Campanile di San Marco and looked out and was surprised that they could see a sail two hours before it was visible with the naked eye. So that has a strategic importance. FLATOW: So the military would like - so he impressed the government folks and they realized the military possibilities of this. And also, I guess, if you're a business person and you can see the cargo ships coming in earlier, you can get a jump up on the competition. Dr. VAN HELDEN: Absolutely. Buy the future to sell the future. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. VAN HELDEN: Absolutely. FLATOW: Things don't change, do they? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. VAN HELDEN: No. No, no. Not in trading cities like Venice and, you know\u2026 FLATOW: So he - but he decided that he could use it as an instrument to look at the heavens. Dr. VAN HELDEN: Right. And I imagine that he just, with every instrument, you know, he looked at the moon or, you know, turn it to the heavens. The fact is, he still couldn't see very much in the heavens because these instruments weren't that good when turned to bodies that - for their size, like planets and stars - are extremely bright. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. VAN HELDEN: For a body like the moon, they were better but the magnification was not enough. And so, Galileo kept improving the telescope. And by November, he had a telescope that magnified about 20 times and of good quality. It gave a high-quality image. And then he planned to do a research project observing the moon and drawing it and things like that. And that's what he did in the first half of December 1609. And then he made a further improvement so that he could actually see things about the planets and the stars. FLATOW: So he was grinding his own lenses, putting the telescope together himself. He wasn't sending it out to a shop anywhere. Dr. VAN HELDEN: No. He was very eclectic. What he need was large blanks. The larger the blank, you know, the larger the central surface you can grind and polish perfectly spherical. FLATOW: And there's actually a shopping list of items that Galileo wanted to buy, right? Dr. VAN HELDEN: Yes. Yes. FLATOW: What was on that list? Dr. VAN HELDEN: Well, an organ pipe that he wanted to use as a tube for a telescope. There was a Greek resin, in other words, pine resin that he used to glue a glass blank to a wooden tool so you can grind with it. There was discussion in that list several possibilities of the sort of forms that you would have to have or should they be used of stone or steel, he needed to ask that. He needs to buy a cannonball on which to grind concave lenses. And then he needed white sand, which is a very fine sand from a certain region in Italy. And Tripoli powder, which is still used today. FLATOW: Let me just interrupt to remind everybody that this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking with Albert van Helden. Sorry, Dr. van Helden. Go ahead. So did he have any extras on there that you usually find on the shopping list? Dr. VAN HELDEN: Well, in that shopping list was also a dress for his common-law wife. And so, no - yeah. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. VAN HELDEN: But we can infer from this that, yes, clearly, if there was any doubt, Galileo and perhaps his technician - because he employed a technician -you know, were grinding and polishing lenses. FLATOW: Did he make them only for himself? Dr. VAN HELDEN: Yes. Yes. He was shrewd enough. And especially, you know, when he started directing it at the moon and drawing it, you know, he realized that this is an important argument. And he was already, in December, beginning to write up his results. FLATOW: Who came up with the name, telescope? Dr. VAN HELDEN: Ah, a Greek gentleman who used it at a banquet that was held for Galileo in Rome in the spring of 1611 when he went for his triumphant victory to Rome. FLATOW: They named it - they held the banquet and someone suggested the name. Dr. VAN HELDEN: That's right. Well, somebody read a little oration and a poem and said, we ought to call this telescopium, hence the word telescope. FLATOW: If I wanted, in this year of astronomy, wanted to go out and build a replica. Is it possible to do that? Can you get the parts and get them all together? Is there a place to find those things? Dr. VAN HELDEN: Yes. Yes. And I think that the best place to go is the Web site of the Institute and Museum for the History of Science. It's imss. fi. it. FLATOW: Imss. fi. it. Dr. VAN HELDEN: Yes. FLATOW: And you can even learn how to build one yourself and get the\u2026 Dr. VAN HELDEN: Yeah, and you get references there. FLATOW: You get references there. I'm sure you'll enjoy retelling the story over and over again because it's a great story. Dr. VAN HELDEN: Oh, yeah. It's a great job. You know, they'd pay you for this. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: No, they pay you for this. Dr. VAN HELDEN: Absolutely. Absolutely. But not anymore. I'm retired. But, yes, it's a great profession. FLATOW: That's a great\u2026 Dr. VAN HELDEN: It takes you all over the place. FLATOW: And it keeps you looking up, doesn't it? Dr. VAN HELDEN: Yes. Yes. So, but it's Galileo who made the instrument famous. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. VAN HELDEN: And so his name gets attached to the instrument. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. VAN HELDEN: You know, I mean, he discovers the satellites of Jupiter in the first half of January 1610. And that's truly shocking. You know, these are entirely new planetary bodies, you know, since time immemorial. FLATOW: Yeah. And that gets\u2026 Dr. VAN HELDEN: And\u2026 FLATOW: And we know the story about how that gets him into a lot of trouble with the Vatican and so on and so forth. Dr. VAN HELDEN: That's right. Yeah. FLATOW: That's later. Well, I had to speed it up because we've ran out of time. How to get to (unintelligible) first. Dr. van Helden, thank you very much for taking the time. Dr. VAN HELDEN: Yes. (Unintelligible) telescope, isn't it? FLATOW: Yeah. That's right. Thanks for taking the time to be with us today. Dr. VAN HELDEN: Okay, my pleasure. FLATOW: You're welcome. And have a good weekend and happy anniversary to astronomy and the telescope. Dr. VAN HELDEN: Thank you. FLATOW: You're welcome.

But, of course, the rest - the light coming through the rest of the lens would screw everything up.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. VAN HELDEN: And so, it's when someone - and that may very well have been Lipperhey, put an aperture ring - in other words, a cardboard ring with a little hole in the center of about one centimeter diameter - and then all of a sudden you got an enlarged image that was clear and in focus. And Lipperhey realized that and he said, hey, I've got something here. And he went to the government.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And they paid him to make more telescopes?  Dr. VAN HELDEN: Yeah. They paid him enough money to buy a house, 900 guilders.  FLATOW: Wow. So how did Galileo get into this picture?  Dr. VAN HELDEN: Well, the news spread from The Hague, through diplomatic channels, because The Hague happened to be the scene of an international peace conference. And so everybody was sending the news home in a diplomatic pouch. There was also a newsletter published very quickly after Lipperhey's patent application. And that reached Venice probably in November 1608, where Galileo's friend, Paulo Sarpi, read it and alerted Galileo.  But nothing much happened for a while because Sarpi, and of course Galileo as well, had been hearing so many rumors about the powerful magic mirrors and things like that that they thought that the news of a magic mirror from the court in Paris was the same news about a magic device coming from the courts in The Hague. So it took a while for them to get confirmation. And it's not really until the spring - well into the spring of 1609 - that Galileo got confirmation. He made his own by just simply going to a spectacle-maker's shop and playing with lenses. And then he realized that if he could improve that device, then it had a lot of promise for career opportunities. And, yeah, who knows what else?  And so, he set out to make a more powerful instrument. And by August, he was presenting one to the Venetian Senate and so all the old gentlemen went up to the top of the Campanile di San Marco and looked out and was surprised that they could see a sail two hours before it was visible with the naked eye. So that has a strategic importance.  FLATOW: So the military would like - so he impressed the government folks and they realized the military possibilities of this. And also, I guess, if you're a business person and you can see the cargo ships coming in earlier, you can get a jump up on the competition.  Dr. VAN HELDEN: Absolutely. Buy the future to sell the future.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. VAN HELDEN: Absolutely.  FLATOW: Things don't change, do they?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. VAN HELDEN: No. No, no. Not in trading cities like Venice and, you know\u2026  FLATOW: So he - but he decided that he could use it as an instrument to look at the heavens.  Dr. VAN HELDEN: Right. And I imagine that he just, with every instrument, you know, he looked at the moon or, you know, turn it to the heavens. The fact is, he still couldn't see very much in the heavens because these instruments weren't that good when turned to bodies that - for their size, like planets and stars - are extremely bright.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. VAN HELDEN: For a body like the moon, they were better but the magnification was not enough. And so, Galileo kept improving the telescope. And by November, he had a telescope that magnified about 20 times and of good quality. It gave a high-quality image. And then he planned to do a research project observing the moon and drawing it and things like that. And that's what he did in the first half of December 1609. And then he made a further improvement so that he could actually see things about the planets and the stars.  FLATOW: So he was grinding his own lenses, putting the telescope together himself. He wasn't sending it out to a shop anywhere.  Dr. VAN HELDEN: No. He was very eclectic. What he need was large blanks. The larger the blank, you know, the larger the central surface you can grind and polish perfectly spherical.  FLATOW: And there's actually a shopping list of items that Galileo wanted to buy, right?  Dr. VAN HELDEN: Yes. Yes.  FLATOW: What was on that list?  Dr. VAN HELDEN: Well, an organ pipe that he wanted to use as a tube for a telescope. There was a Greek resin, in other words, pine resin that he used to glue a glass blank to a wooden tool so you can grind with it. There was discussion in that list several possibilities of the sort of forms that you would have to have or should they be used of stone or steel, he needed to ask that.  He needs to buy a cannonball on which to grind concave lenses. And then he needed white sand, which is a very fine sand from a certain region in Italy. And Tripoli powder, which is still used today.  FLATOW: Let me just interrupt to remind everybody that this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking with Albert van Helden.  Sorry, Dr. van Helden. Go ahead. So did he have any extras on there that you usually find on the shopping list?  Dr. VAN HELDEN: Well, in that shopping list was also a dress for his common-law wife. And so, no - yeah.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. VAN HELDEN: But we can infer from this that, yes, clearly, if there was any doubt, Galileo and perhaps his technician - because he employed a technician -you know, were grinding and polishing lenses.  FLATOW: Did he make them only for himself?  Dr. VAN HELDEN: Yes. Yes. He was shrewd enough. And especially, you know, when he started directing it at the moon and drawing it, you know, he realized that this is an important argument. And he was already, in December, beginning to write up his results.  FLATOW: Who came up with the name, telescope?  Dr. VAN HELDEN: Ah, a Greek gentleman who used it at a banquet that was held for Galileo in Rome in the spring of 1611 when he went for his triumphant victory to Rome.  FLATOW: They named it - they held the banquet and someone suggested the name.  Dr. VAN HELDEN: That's right. Well, somebody read a little oration and a poem and said, we ought to call this telescopium, hence the word telescope.  FLATOW: If I wanted, in this year of astronomy, wanted to go out and build a replica. Is it possible to do that? Can you get the parts and get them all together? Is there a place to find those things?  Dr. VAN HELDEN: Yes. Yes. And I think that the best place to go is the Web site of the Institute and Museum for the History of Science. It's imss. fi. it.  FLATOW: Imss. fi. it.  Dr. VAN HELDEN: Yes.  FLATOW: And you can even learn how to build one yourself and get the\u2026  Dr. VAN HELDEN: Yeah, and you get references there.  FLATOW: You get references there. I'm sure you'll enjoy retelling the story over and over again because it's a great story.  Dr. VAN HELDEN: Oh, yeah. It's a great job. You know, they'd pay you for this.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: No, they pay you for this.  Dr. VAN HELDEN: Absolutely. Absolutely. But not anymore. I'm retired. But, yes, it's a great profession.  FLATOW: That's a great\u2026  Dr. VAN HELDEN: It takes you all over the place.  FLATOW: And it keeps you looking up, doesn't it?  Dr. VAN HELDEN: Yes. Yes. So, but it's Galileo who made the instrument famous.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. VAN HELDEN: And so his name gets attached to the instrument.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. VAN HELDEN: You know, I mean, he discovers the satellites of Jupiter in the first half of January 1610. And that's truly shocking. You know, these are entirely new planetary bodies, you know, since time immemorial.  FLATOW: Yeah. And that gets\u2026  Dr. VAN HELDEN: And\u2026  FLATOW: And we know the story about how that gets him into a lot of trouble with the Vatican and so on and so forth.  Dr. VAN HELDEN: That's right. Yeah.  FLATOW: That's later. Well, I had to speed it up because we've ran out of time. How to get to (unintelligible) first. Dr. van Helden, thank you very much for taking the time.  Dr. VAN HELDEN: Yes. (Unintelligible) telescope, isn't it?  FLATOW: Yeah. That's right. Thanks for taking the time to be with us today.  Dr. VAN HELDEN: Okay, my pleasure.  FLATOW: You're welcome. And have a good weekend and happy anniversary to astronomy and the telescope.  Dr. VAN HELDEN: Thank you.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Albert van Helden is a science historian and professor emeritus of Rice University. And he's also professor emeritus of Utrecht University in Netherlands. That's about all the time we have.

I'm Ira Flatow, and joining me now is Danica McKellar. You may know her as an actress, but she's got a whole new life now, I think. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. DANICA McKELLAR (Author, \"Math Doesn't Suck: How to Survive Middle-School Math Without Losing Your Mind or Breaking a Nail\"): Yes. FLATOW: She's an author of two books, including \"Math Doesn't Suck\" and \"Kiss My Math,\" and maybe there's another one on the way, Danica. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Ms. McKELLAR: There is another one, (unintelligible) sound like babies. Yes, well thank you for having me. I'm thrilled to be here again. FLATOW: You're welcome. No, you know - I feel like we've helped you resurrect a whole new career as a spokesperson for math and girls. Ms. McKELLAR: Yes. Absolutely, absolutely. I think it is so important to give math some better PR because, boy, does it get a lot of bad PR out there. FLATOW: I'll say, if you want to talk to Danica, 1-800-989-8255 is our number. I have both your books, \"Kiss My Math\" and \"Math Doesn't Suck\" here, and I see it says national bestseller on it now. Ms. McKELLAR: Yes, in fact New York Times bestseller. FLATOW: Wow. Ms. McKELLAR: It's so exciting. When \"Math Doesn't Suck\" first came out a year and a half ago, it was not considered by the New York Times because they said it was a textbook. So it didn't fit into one of their categories, and happily, my publishers fought them on it and said wait a minute, how many textbooks do you know that look like Teen magazines? Does this look like a textbook to you? This is a young, you know, a young-adult, kids book. And they finally said all right, fine, and sure enough, as soon as \"Kiss My Math\" came out in August, they both shot up on the list. FLATOW: Are you working on another one now? Ms. McKELLAR: I am. FLATOW: Can you share some of that secret with us, what it's about? Ms. McKELLAR: Well, I don't have a title yet, but it is about algebra. FLATOW: Algebra. Ms. McKELLAR: So \"Math Doesn't Suck\" is for ages 10 to 12, and that's sort of pre-pre-algebra. It's fractions, proportions. \"Kiss My Math\" is pre-algebra, negative numbers, solving for X, exponents, things like that. And now I'm working on algebra. So it's kind of a trilogy in a way. FLATOW: That's right. Ms. McKELLAR: Yeah, and I just started writing it. It'll come out in the fall of 2010, so\u2026 FLATOW: Wow. Ms. McKELLAR: Yeah, or the summer of 2010 maybe. FLATOW: Well, that means we have at least one more visit from you\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. McKELLAR: That's right. FLATOW: \u2026in store. Is there something that kids and parents - what parents can do over the summer with their kids so that they stay interested in math, where they see it around them wherever they're living? Ms. McKELLAR: Yeah. And I suggest to parents that they start young. You know, when kids are just discovering the world around them, five, six, seven years old, show them math in real life. Just point it out when you go shopping. You notice that there's a unit price, and how many pounds are you getting, and then how much is the final price. Just noticing it, pointing it out. Once kids are actually in school really learning math and learning fractions and things, of course I suggest helping them because you need support. Math is a foreign language, and it can be very scary. I recommend my books, you know, for those ages, but also, you know, there are a lot of great Web sites out there, and just show them how math is used. Math is actually a part of our life. In fact, our economy is showing us right now how important math\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. McKELLAR: \u2026and numbers really are and how they have real-life consequences. FLATOW: That's right. Since you were here last, we've had a Wall Street meltdown. Ms. McKELLAR: I know. FLATOW: People were not paying attention to the math. Obviously. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. McKELLAR: Well the thing is, when you start off in middle school, and math is a foreign language, and it is scary, and you don't have the right support materials, and you avoid numbers at all costs, which a lot of people I know are like that. You know, they avoid it in college. I have a friend in college who wanted to be a doctor. She wanted to deliver babies. She figured out she had to take calculus to do that, and she got scared and dropped out. People avoid numbers. She didn't get to fulfill her dreams. And when you avoid numbers, as an adult you'll probably continue to avoid numbers, and then what happens? You get credit card statements you don't necessarily pay attention to because you're avoiding them, avoiding the details of that mortgage statement, you know, or the contract that's in front of you. And those things are really important, and they have very, very real consequences. FLATOW: How did you get this nouveau interest in math, or did you always have it since you were a kid? Ms. McKELLAR: When I was in middle school, I was terrified of math. I had that horrible feeling of dread. I just didn't want to have anything to do with it, and it made me feel bad about myself. That's something I think people have to realize that nobody likes to do something that makes them feel bad about themselves. That's part of why it's avoided because if you don't get it, if you don't have the right teacher or the right whatever, you just freeze up, and you don't want to face that. Who does? It's very human and very normal. So you know, that's a really important part, and for me, I got really lucky. I got some teachers in middle school\u2026 FLATOW: They're so important, aren't they, the best teachers? Ms. McKELLAR: Oh my goodness, they're so important. Teachers are like angels. They can be - they are the face of the subject, and if they use that well, if they become a friend, then that subject becomes friendly. If they're scary, then the subject's going to be scary. If they are, you know, if they're standoffish, then the kids aren't going to feel welcome to really learn. FLATOW: Did you have to persuade your publishers when you started doing this that you could write a book that girls would like? I mean, did they so now, who's going to read that? Give us something about being an actress or something you know about or whatever. Ms. McKELLAR: Well, it was after there was an article about me in the New York Times back in 2005, about how in between \"The Wonder Years\" and \"The West Wing,\" I had co-authored this research paper. And I had a couple of different literary agents call me and say we think that you've got some sort of interesting combination that could be a book. We don't know what it would be, we're not sure. Well, I had spoken in front of Congress back in 2000 about the importance of women in mathematics and the importance of giving math better PR, but it had never occurred to me to write books. But then when the agent said, you know, we think you should do this, they said: What would you want to do? Who would you want to target? And I said I know exactly who I want to target: middle-school girls. I've been researching this for years. I've been answering math questions on my Web sites for years, and I was completely primed and ready to go, and nobody could have convinced me to do any other kind of book. FLATOW: How can you get a recurring role in numbers for you? When do you get a math show? (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: If Phil Nye the Science Guy can get on there\u2026 Ms. McKELLAR: People ask me that all the time. FLATOW: I'll bet they do. Ms. McKELLAR: Yes, I'm sure it's inevitable at some point. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Let's see if we can get a phone call or two in here. 1-800-989-8255, if I can reach the buttons. They're not that easy. Let's go to Phil(ph) in New York. Hi, Phil. PHIL (Caller): Hi, good afternoon, Ira. Good afternoon, Danica. Ms. McKELLAR: Hey. PHIL: I've got a question, and it's very funny because everything I'm listening to - first of all, I can't tell you how much I applaud what you're doing. It is so, so important. Ms. McKELLAR: Oh thank you. PHIL: For both boys as well, but in particular girls, I think. So bravo to you. My question is this. My wife is a returning-back-to-college 40-something woman, and she's facing for her masters degree completion having - or pardon me, her calculus course, and she's really terrified. And my thinking is, without knowing actually, that in this day and age, there must be some means of her going to preparatory classes that are available outside the college tuition and so forth. Can you make any recommendations, or do you have a course of action that you think might be helpful for a 40-something woman returning back to school? Ms. McKELLAR: Well, how much review does she need? I mean, is she ready to jump into calculus, or does she need a review in algebra? PHIL: No, she's got all that underneath her. She's you know, gone up the regular curriculum, has done her algebra, done everything and done extremely well. She's gotten good grades. Ms. McKELLAR: I would say go online. FLATOW: There's a great book called \"Hurricane Calculus\" out there. I mean, I used to have trouble with calculus in college, too. I wish I had this book. Ms. McKELLAR: Oh really? I'll have to check it out. FLATOW: Get this for your wife called - we had the author on years ago, and he just, he explained it so well and so easy that, Phil, this is where I would start. PHIL: Oh wonderful, thank you so much. It sounds like a gem. That sounds great. FLATOW: You're welcome. With someone with a name-block like I do, for me to pull out the name \"Hurricane Calculus. \" (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. McKELLAR: That's awesome. FLATOW: It is awesome. But people - now that you're on, visiting, writing books, they must think you are the math authority, right? You get questions that you can't possibly answer. Ms. McKELLAR: Oh, I get - sometimes people will email me questions about differential calculus, which I actually never took a course in. I mean, I did some of it, but not really. FLATOW: You would enjoy calculus. Ms. McKELLAR: Oh, well I loved - you mean differential calculus? FLATOW: Yes, differential calculus. Ms. McKELLAR: Yeah, I know. I mean, I love multivariable calculus, I loved real analysis, all that stuff. FLATOW: Don't go there. I can't talk about that. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. McKELLAR: No, it's great, and you know, people have asked me, are you going to write a calculus book someday? FLATOW: Right, that was going to be one of my questions. Ms. McKELLAR: Yeah, my plan - I mean, I've hit the pre-algebra. Now I'm working on algebra. I will probably keep going as long as it stays an interest. You know, I get emails from kids saying, oh you're writing an algebra book because you got me through eighth grade pre-algebra, and now I need you. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. McKELLAR: I'm like I'm writing as fast as I can. FLATOW: I believe it. Let's go to Evan(ph) in St. Louis. Hi, Evan. EVAN (Caller): Hi, how are you? FLATOW: Hi there. EVAN: First, I wanted to say thanks to Danica for the books. I have daughters who are nine and 11, and both of your books are on the shelf at home, and they love them. So those are great. Ms. McKELLAR: Yay, oh wonderful, wonderful. EVAN: And I understand part of the motivation behind your books is getting girls interested and excited in mathematics. And I also wanted to know if you're familiar with the FIRST LEGO League? FLATOW: LEGOs? EVAN: Well it's actually - it's kids who are using a specific robotics kit from LEGO to build robots, program them and compete in competitions nationwide. Ms. McKELLAR: Oh, that's great. EVAN: And this isn't just girls. It's for girls and boys both. It's a similar age group, and I coached a team. This was - I stepped into it by happenstance last year, and I have to tell you it was an awesome experience. And I have to tell you that the team that I had, we were called the Tree Frog Team, and it was a fifth-grade, girls' robotics team last year, and there were, you know, some discussions about what they were doing with math at school, and there was an expression of boredom. I won't tell you exactly what\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) EVAN: Okay, but when they're using robots and programming them, we could spend two to three hours at a time, and they were highly motivated. Ms. McKELLAR: Absolutely. It's about making it playtime as much as possible, and that's actually something I do in the actual - which your daughters probably know - in the actual teaching of the math even inside the books. Even if you don't have a robot to play with in the moment, you know, when you're learning math topics, why not talk about things like popularity and shopping and opening and, you know, unwrapping a gift and wrapping it back up again, you know, for inverse operations? There's ways of making it feel like kindergarten. And to me, if you can make math feel like kindergarten. You know, you break that brain freeze that kids get when they look at the numbers. FLATOW: That's great. Is this part of Dean Kamen's FIRST robots? EVAN: Exactly. Right. The acronym stands For Inspiration of Research Science and Technology. The organization is getting - it's growing and it is - I would encourage all parents to look into it. Find a FIRST Lego League team. It's primarily for kids between the ages of, like, 9 and 14. Ms. McKELLAR: Oh, great. That's the age. EVAN: You know, a lot of things out there that's\u2026 Ms. McKELLAR: Yeah. Wonderful. EVAN: It's really a great thing. FLATOW: Thanks for calling, Evan. Take care. EVAN: You bet. Thanks. FLATOW: But 9 and 14, you say, that's the age where you got to get kids involved? Ms. McKELLAR: Yes, absolutely. That's where - that's when kids are deciding whether or not they're good at math. They're kind of deciding who they are at that age, you know, middle school. \"The Wonder Years\" was made about that time of life. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Ms. McKELLAR: That's - it's a very - it's a critical time when self-esteem has become an issue, you know? FLATOW: Right. Ms. McKELLAR: Kids go from being these little kids running around in a playground in the dirt, and now they're going, who am I? It's really important. And that's why these quizzes are so popular that I - that are in teen magazines, so I put them in the math books. Do you pick supportive friends? Are you a mathophobe? Take this quiz and find out. Because kids are wanting to know, especially girls, who am I? And then the quiz tells them, who are you? Take this quiz and find out. You can't get enough of that. FLATOW: Well, you know, your timing is perfect on this, because now that President Obama is in the White House, we're seeing Michelle Obama going around to schools talking to girls and boys saying, if you want to do like I am - like I did, you have - smart is good. Smart is cool. Ms. McKELLAR: Yes. Smart is sexy. Uh-huh. FLATOW: Smart is sexy. Ms. McKELLAR: Yep. Absolutely. Sexy in every interpretation of that word. FLATOW: And\u2026 Ms. McKELLAR: Absolutely. FLATOW: \u2026that's your message also. Ms. McKELLAR: Yes. The message is - that's why the books look more like teen magazines than math books, because I want to combine these two ideas - being smart and capable and being fabulous if you want to be. You know, owning your own business. What do you love? Do you love shoes? Open a shoe store, you know? But numbers are going to keep that - keep those doors open. And actually to - I wanted to finish answering the question about summer, about summer activities. FLATOW: Yes. Ms. McKELLAR: I think a really fun thing for kids to do, especially in today's economy, seeing how, you know, the numbers are important for businesses, is start a little business, whether it's selling lemonade or making baby clothes or doll clothes or buying things from a thrift shop and making them better and selling them, whatever it is, and keep track. FLATOW: Right. Ms. McKELLAR: Keep track of your expenses, keep track of your profits, keep track of who's buying your materials, you know, who's buying your product. Is it men? Is it women? What's the approximate age? And so that it doesn't feel like homework, because believe me, the last thing kids want to do over the summer is math homework. So if you want to keep the math going, don't give them homework. You know, make it fun, make it real world, and have it be about something that they're passionate about. FLATOW: And you just disguise it, as you say, study the math by doing the business. Talking with Danica McKellar, author of \"Kiss My Math\" and \"Math Doesn't Suck\" on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. 1-800-989-8255. Let's see if we can get a - gosh, I wish we had more time. Let's go to Faith(ph) in Tulsa. Hi, Faith. FAITH (Caller): Hi. FLATOW: Hi there. FAITH: I - thank you for taking my call. FLATOW: Go ahead. FAITH: I just wanted to thank Danica for her book. I loved math as a kid and through middle school, was always eager and loved math. And it wasn't until high school that I actually had some teachers who were - I became intimidated because of the teachers and turned off. I mean, I just appreciate you and this book because it has to - the teachers can be really - just a huge factor. And I just - I think I lost my love of math because of some (unintelligible). Ms. McKELLAR: And you know, in - I'm happy, thank you so much for thanking me. And I think that one thing that happens to girls and women is that because we are trained - let's face it - we are trained from a very young age to believe that math is not for us. If we're good at it, that's great. It's some sort of bonus. But it's not like - we're sort of like a sidecar. And because of that belief - and that's in us somewhere very deep from a very young age because society tells us that how we look is more important than what we think, et cetera, et cetera - that when women, when young women have a stumbling block in math like you did in high school, or at any age along the way, that for a lot of girls, that becomes validation of what they'd always suspected. I'm, you know, I've been a phony this whole time, well, I was good at it but, see, now I know, see, this confirms it. I'm - this is not - I know my place is not in mathematics. FLATOW: Hmm. FAITH: Right. Yeah. Ms. McKELLAR: And that's part of the reason why I\u2026 FAITH: It just - yeah. Ms. McKELLAR: Yeah. FAITH: It makes every stumbling block just a little bit more impactful. Ms. McKELLAR: And - right. And when guys hit stumbling blocks, it tends to be that they see it as an issue in the moment, and then they'll go on because they believe that's their place. FAITH: Exactly. Ms. McKELLAR: It's amazing, the psychology behind it, which is part of why I go so far with the girly stuff in my books, because I want to show them, you know what, this book is for you. This is your place. Your place is being smart and knowledgeable and good at math. FLATOW: And what you both agree on is that - is the need to have a good mentor, a good math teacher. Ms. McKELLAR: Yes. Oh yes. FLATOW: And, Faith, you say that that - your math teacher turned you off. FAITH: Yes. I - basically, I had three math teachers in a row, different grades, who basically the - there were some - there were a few guys in the classroom who just ruled the classroom and I wasn't - there was no room for me to ask questions or learn. I was always made fun of. FLATOW: Yeah. Ms. McKELLAR: Oh, that's so rough. FAITH: And so I was completely turned off. FLATOW: Well, it's too bad she came a few years too late for you, Faith. FAITH: Yeah. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Faith, thanks for\u2026 FAITH: But thank you. FLATOW: \u2026thanks for calling. And any final - we only have about a minute left -any final thoughts about where you're headed next and what you're going to do? Can we get you another TV show? Anything in the works here? Ms. McKELLAR: Well, I don't think that I can write a book while on a TV show. But, you know, I'm open to whatever comes my way. I'm a big believer in - that the universe would direct things. I just got married in March, actually. FLATOW: Oh, congratulations. Ms. McKELLAR: Thank you. FLATOW: Mazeltov, as we say in New York. Ms. McKELLAR: Thank you very much. FLATOW: That's terrific. Ms. McKELLAR: Yeah. So\u2026 FLATOW: That's going to take some time out of your life. Ms. McKELLAR: That took some time, planning that wedding, and then the wedding and then the honeymoon and all that. FLATOW: Right. Ms. McKELLAR: So, I'm a newlywed. And I'm writing the next book. FLATOW: The algebra book. Ms. McKELLAR: Yeah, the algebra book. I have a movie that I did called \"21 and a Wake-Up. \" It's on Vietnam nurses. That comes out, I think, this summer as an independent film. FLATOW: Wow. Ms. McKELLAR: So I'm keeping busy. FLATOW: Well, that's good. And we wish you the best of luck. And I don't know how we can get this higher on the best-seller list. Ms. McKELLAR: Oh, and I wanted to tell people, if they have any questions about the book\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Ms. McKELLAR: \u2026about math, anything, kissmymath. com and mathdoesntsuck. com, those emails do get forwarded to me, especially the kids' emails. Those get flagged. And I answer specific math questions when they get written there. FLATOW: And if you're writing an algebra book, do you want to hear anything about algebra from them especially? Ms. McKELLAR: Yes, I would love to. Yes, you know what, I'm writing the book right now. Send me your requests. FLATOW: It's - what's the address again? Ms. McKELLAR: Kissmymath. com. FLATOW: And there you have it. Danica, thank you. Ms. McKELLAR: Thank you so much. FLATOW: I'm speaking with Danica McKellar, working on a new algebra book, author of \"Kiss My Math\" and \"Math Doesn't Suck. \" Still in print, still moving up there. Ms. McKELLAR: Oh, yeah. FLATOW: Thanks a lot. Ms. McKELLAR: It's going great. Thank you. FLATOW: We're going to take a break and come back and talk about art and science with two artists who use science for inspiration, like Danica uses math for inspiration. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this break.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, and joining me now is Danica McKellar. You may know her as an actress, but she's got a whole new life now, I think.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. DANICA McKELLAR (Author, \"Math Doesn't Suck: How to Survive Middle-School Math Without Losing Your Mind or Breaking a Nail\"): Yes.  FLATOW: She's an author of two books, including \"Math Doesn't Suck\" and \"Kiss My Math,\" and maybe there's another one on the way, Danica. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Ms. McKELLAR: There is another one, (unintelligible) sound like babies. Yes, well thank you for having me. I'm thrilled to be here again.  FLATOW: You're welcome. No, you know - I feel like we've helped you resurrect a whole new career as a spokesperson for math and girls.  Ms. McKELLAR: Yes. Absolutely, absolutely. I think it is so important to give math some better PR because, boy, does it get a lot of bad PR out there.  FLATOW: I'll say, if you want to talk to Danica, 1-800-989-8255 is our number. I have both your books, \"Kiss My Math\" and \"Math Doesn't Suck\" here, and I see it says national bestseller on it now.  Ms. McKELLAR: Yes, in fact New York Times bestseller.  FLATOW: Wow.  Ms. McKELLAR: It's so exciting. When \"Math Doesn't Suck\" first came out a year and a half ago, it was not considered by the New York Times because they said it was a textbook. So it didn't fit into one of their categories, and happily, my publishers fought them on it and said wait a minute, how many textbooks do you know that look like Teen magazines? Does this look like a textbook to you? This is a young, you know, a young-adult, kids book. And they finally said all right, fine, and sure enough, as soon as \"Kiss My Math\" came out in August, they both shot up on the list.  FLATOW: Are you working on another one now?  Ms. McKELLAR: I am.  FLATOW: Can you share some of that secret with us, what it's about?  Ms. McKELLAR: Well, I don't have a title yet, but it is about algebra.  FLATOW: Algebra.  Ms. McKELLAR: So \"Math Doesn't Suck\" is for ages 10 to 12, and that's sort of pre-pre-algebra. It's fractions, proportions. \"Kiss My Math\" is pre-algebra, negative numbers, solving for X, exponents, things like that. And now I'm working on algebra. So it's kind of a trilogy in a way.  FLATOW: That's right.  Ms. McKELLAR: Yeah, and I just started writing it. It'll come out in the fall of 2010, so\u2026  FLATOW: Wow.  Ms. McKELLAR: Yeah, or the summer of 2010 maybe.  FLATOW: Well, that means we have at least one more visit from you\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. McKELLAR: That's right.  FLATOW: \u2026in store. Is there something that kids and parents - what parents can do over the summer with their kids so that they stay interested in math, where they see it around them wherever they're living?  Ms. McKELLAR: Yeah. And I suggest to parents that they start young. You know, when kids are just discovering the world around them, five, six, seven years old, show them math in real life. Just point it out when you go shopping. You notice that there's a unit price, and how many pounds are you getting, and then how much is the final price. Just noticing it, pointing it out.  Once kids are actually in school really learning math and learning fractions and things, of course I suggest helping them because you need support. Math is a foreign language, and it can be very scary. I recommend my books, you know, for those ages, but also, you know, there are a lot of great Web sites out there, and just show them how math is used.  Math is actually a part of our life. In fact, our economy is showing us right now how important math\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. McKELLAR: \u2026and numbers really are and how they have real-life consequences.  FLATOW: That's right. Since you were here last, we've had a Wall Street meltdown.  Ms. McKELLAR: I know.  FLATOW: People were not paying attention to the math. Obviously.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. McKELLAR: Well the thing is, when you start off in middle school, and math is a foreign language, and it is scary, and you don't have the right support materials, and you avoid numbers at all costs, which a lot of people I know are like that. You know, they avoid it in college.  I have a friend in college who wanted to be a doctor. She wanted to deliver babies. She figured out she had to take calculus to do that, and she got scared and dropped out. People avoid numbers. She didn't get to fulfill her dreams.  And when you avoid numbers, as an adult you'll probably continue to avoid numbers, and then what happens? You get credit card statements you don't necessarily pay attention to because you're avoiding them, avoiding the details of that mortgage statement, you know, or the contract that's in front of you. And those things are really important, and they have very, very real consequences.  FLATOW: How did you get this nouveau interest in math, or did you always have it since you were a kid?  Ms. McKELLAR: When I was in middle school, I was terrified of math. I had that horrible feeling of dread. I just didn't want to have anything to do with it, and it made me feel bad about myself. That's something I think people have to realize that nobody likes to do something that makes them feel bad about themselves. That's part of why it's avoided because if you don't get it, if you don't have the right teacher or the right whatever, you just freeze up, and you don't want to face that. Who does? It's very human and very normal.  So you know, that's a really important part, and for me, I got really lucky. I got some teachers in middle school\u2026  FLATOW: They're so important, aren't they, the best teachers?  Ms. McKELLAR: Oh my goodness, they're so important. Teachers are like angels. They can be - they are the face of the subject, and if they use that well, if they become a friend, then that subject becomes friendly. If they're scary, then the subject's going to be scary. If they are, you know, if they're standoffish, then the kids aren't going to feel welcome to really learn.  FLATOW: Did you have to persuade your publishers when you started doing this that you could write a book that girls would like? I mean, did they so now, who's going to read that? Give us something about being an actress or something you know about or whatever.  Ms. McKELLAR: Well, it was after there was an article about me in the New York Times back in 2005, about how in between \"The Wonder Years\" and \"The West Wing,\" I had co-authored this research paper. And I had a couple of different literary agents call me and say we think that you've got some sort of interesting combination that could be a book. We don't know what it would be, we're not sure.  Well, I had spoken in front of Congress back in 2000 about the importance of women in mathematics and the importance of giving math better PR, but it had never occurred to me to write books. But then when the agent said, you know, we think you should do this, they said: What would you want to do? Who would you want to target? And I said I know exactly who I want to target: middle-school girls. I've been researching this for years. I've been answering math questions on my Web sites for years, and I was completely primed and ready to go, and nobody could have convinced me to do any other kind of book.  FLATOW: How can you get a recurring role in numbers for you? When do you get a math show?  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: If Phil Nye the Science Guy can get on there\u2026  Ms. McKELLAR: People ask me that all the time.  FLATOW: I'll bet they do.  Ms. McKELLAR: Yes, I'm sure it's inevitable at some point.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Let's see if we can get a phone call or two in here. 1-800-989-8255, if I can reach the buttons. They're not that easy. Let's go to Phil(ph) in New York. Hi, Phil.  PHIL (Caller): Hi, good afternoon, Ira. Good afternoon, Danica.  Ms. McKELLAR: Hey.  PHIL: I've got a question, and it's very funny because everything I'm listening to - first of all, I can't tell you how much I applaud what you're doing. It is so, so important.  Ms. McKELLAR: Oh thank you.  PHIL: For both boys as well, but in particular girls, I think. So bravo to you. My question is this. My wife is a returning-back-to-college 40-something woman, and she's facing for her masters degree completion having - or pardon me, her calculus course, and she's really terrified. And my thinking is, without knowing actually, that in this day and age, there must be some means of her going to preparatory classes that are available outside the college tuition and so forth. Can you make any recommendations, or do you have a course of action that you think might be helpful for a 40-something woman returning back to school?  Ms. McKELLAR: Well, how much review does she need? I mean, is she ready to jump into calculus, or does she need a review in algebra?  PHIL: No, she's got all that underneath her. She's you know, gone up the regular curriculum, has done her algebra, done everything and done extremely well. She's gotten good grades.  Ms. McKELLAR: I would say go online.  FLATOW: There's a great book called \"Hurricane Calculus\" out there. I mean, I used to have trouble with calculus in college, too. I wish I had this book.  Ms. McKELLAR: Oh really? I'll have to check it out.  FLATOW: Get this for your wife called - we had the author on years ago, and he just, he explained it so well and so easy that, Phil, this is where I would start.  PHIL: Oh wonderful, thank you so much. It sounds like a gem. That sounds great.  FLATOW: You're welcome. With someone with a name-block like I do, for me to pull out the name \"Hurricane Calculus. \"  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. McKELLAR: That's awesome.  FLATOW: It is awesome. But people - now that you're on, visiting, writing books, they must think you are the math authority, right? You get questions that you can't possibly answer.  Ms. McKELLAR: Oh, I get - sometimes people will email me questions about differential calculus, which I actually never took a course in. I mean, I did some of it, but not really.  FLATOW: You would enjoy calculus.  Ms. McKELLAR: Oh, well I loved - you mean differential calculus?  FLATOW: Yes, differential calculus.  Ms. McKELLAR: Yeah, I know. I mean, I love multivariable calculus, I loved real analysis, all that stuff.  FLATOW: Don't go there. I can't talk about that.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. McKELLAR: No, it's great, and you know, people have asked me, are you going to write a calculus book someday?  FLATOW: Right, that was going to be one of my questions.  Ms. McKELLAR: Yeah, my plan - I mean, I've hit the pre-algebra. Now I'm working on algebra. I will probably keep going as long as it stays an interest. You know, I get emails from kids saying, oh you're writing an algebra book because you got me through eighth grade pre-algebra, and now I need you.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. McKELLAR: I'm like I'm writing as fast as I can.  FLATOW: I believe it. Let's go to Evan(ph) in St. Louis. Hi, Evan.  EVAN (Caller): Hi, how are you?  FLATOW: Hi there.  EVAN: First, I wanted to say thanks to Danica for the books. I have daughters who are nine and 11, and both of your books are on the shelf at home, and they love them. So those are great.  Ms. McKELLAR: Yay, oh wonderful, wonderful.  EVAN: And I understand part of the motivation behind your books is getting girls interested and excited in mathematics. And I also wanted to know if you're familiar with the FIRST LEGO League?  FLATOW: LEGOs?  EVAN: Well it's actually - it's kids who are using a specific robotics kit from LEGO to build robots, program them and compete in competitions nationwide.  Ms. McKELLAR: Oh, that's great.  EVAN: And this isn't just girls. It's for girls and boys both. It's a similar age group, and I coached a team. This was - I stepped into it by happenstance last year, and I have to tell you it was an awesome experience. And I have to tell you that the team that I had, we were called the Tree Frog Team, and it was a fifth-grade, girls' robotics team last year, and there were, you know, some discussions about what they were doing with math at school, and there was an expression of boredom. I won't tell you exactly what\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  EVAN: Okay, but when they're using robots and programming them, we could spend two to three hours at a time, and they were highly motivated.  Ms. McKELLAR: Absolutely. It's about making it playtime as much as possible, and that's actually something I do in the actual - which your daughters probably know - in the actual teaching of the math even inside the books. Even if you don't have a robot to play with in the moment, you know, when you're learning math topics, why not talk about things like popularity and shopping and opening and, you know, unwrapping a gift and wrapping it back up again, you know, for inverse operations?  There's ways of making it feel like kindergarten. And to me, if you can make math feel like kindergarten. You know, you break that brain freeze that kids get when they look at the numbers.  FLATOW: That's great. Is this part of Dean Kamen's FIRST robots?  EVAN: Exactly. Right. The acronym stands For Inspiration of Research Science and Technology. The organization is getting - it's growing and it is - I would encourage all parents to look into it. Find a FIRST Lego League team. It's primarily for kids between the ages of, like, 9 and 14.  Ms. McKELLAR: Oh, great. That's the age.  EVAN: You know, a lot of things out there that's\u2026  Ms. McKELLAR: Yeah. Wonderful.  EVAN: It's really a great thing.  FLATOW: Thanks for calling, Evan. Take care.  EVAN: You bet. Thanks.  FLATOW: But 9 and 14, you say, that's the age where you got to get kids involved?  Ms. McKELLAR: Yes, absolutely. That's where - that's when kids are deciding whether or not they're good at math. They're kind of deciding who they are at that age, you know, middle school. \"The Wonder Years\" was made about that time of life.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Ms. McKELLAR: That's - it's a very - it's a critical time when self-esteem has become an issue, you know?  FLATOW: Right.  Ms. McKELLAR: Kids go from being these little kids running around in a playground in the dirt, and now they're going, who am I? It's really important. And that's why these quizzes are so popular that I - that are in teen magazines, so I put them in the math books.  Do you pick supportive friends? Are you a mathophobe? Take this quiz and find out. Because kids are wanting to know, especially girls, who am I? And then the quiz tells them, who are you? Take this quiz and find out. You can't get enough of that.  FLATOW: Well, you know, your timing is perfect on this, because now that President Obama is in the White House, we're seeing Michelle Obama going around to schools talking to girls and boys saying, if you want to do like I am - like I did, you have - smart is good. Smart is cool.  Ms. McKELLAR: Yes. Smart is sexy. Uh-huh.  FLATOW: Smart is sexy.  Ms. McKELLAR: Yep. Absolutely. Sexy in every interpretation of that word.  FLATOW: And\u2026  Ms. McKELLAR: Absolutely.  FLATOW: \u2026that's your message also.  Ms. McKELLAR: Yes. The message is - that's why the books look more like teen magazines than math books, because I want to combine these two ideas - being smart and capable and being fabulous if you want to be.  You know, owning your own business. What do you love? Do you love shoes? Open a shoe store, you know? But numbers are going to keep that - keep those doors open. And actually to - I wanted to finish answering the question about summer, about summer activities.  FLATOW: Yes.  Ms. McKELLAR: I think a really fun thing for kids to do, especially in today's economy, seeing how, you know, the numbers are important for businesses, is start a little business, whether it's selling lemonade or making baby clothes or doll clothes or buying things from a thrift shop and making them better and selling them, whatever it is, and keep track.  FLATOW: Right.  Ms. McKELLAR: Keep track of your expenses, keep track of your profits, keep track of who's buying your materials, you know, who's buying your product. Is it men? Is it women? What's the approximate age? And so that it doesn't feel like homework, because believe me, the last thing kids want to do over the summer is math homework.  So if you want to keep the math going, don't give them homework. You know, make it fun, make it real world, and have it be about something that they're passionate about.  FLATOW: And you just disguise it, as you say, study the math by doing the business. Talking with Danica McKellar, author of \"Kiss My Math\" and \"Math Doesn't Suck\" on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  1-800-989-8255. Let's see if we can get a - gosh, I wish we had more time. Let's go to Faith(ph) in Tulsa. Hi, Faith.  FAITH (Caller): Hi.  FLATOW: Hi there.  FAITH: I - thank you for taking my call.  FLATOW: Go ahead.  FAITH: I just wanted to thank Danica for her book. I loved math as a kid and through middle school, was always eager and loved math. And it wasn't until high school that I actually had some teachers who were - I became intimidated because of the teachers and turned off.  I mean, I just appreciate you and this book because it has to - the teachers can be really - just a huge factor. And I just - I think I lost my love of math because of some (unintelligible).  Ms. McKELLAR: And you know, in - I'm happy, thank you so much for thanking me. And I think that one thing that happens to girls and women is that because we are trained - let's face it - we are trained from a very young age to believe that math is not for us. If we're good at it, that's great. It's some sort of bonus. But it's not like - we're sort of like a sidecar.  And because of that belief - and that's in us somewhere very deep from a very young age because society tells us that how we look is more important than what we think, et cetera, et cetera - that when women, when young women have a stumbling block in math like you did in high school, or at any age along the way, that for a lot of girls, that becomes validation of what they'd always suspected.  I'm, you know, I've been a phony this whole time, well, I was good at it but, see, now I know, see, this confirms it. I'm - this is not - I know my place is not in mathematics.  FLATOW: Hmm.  FAITH: Right. Yeah.  Ms. McKELLAR: And that's part of the reason why I\u2026  FAITH: It just - yeah.  Ms. McKELLAR: Yeah.  FAITH: It makes every stumbling block just a little bit more impactful.  Ms. McKELLAR: And - right. And when guys hit stumbling blocks, it tends to be that they see it as an issue in the moment, and then they'll go on because they believe that's their place.  FAITH: Exactly.  Ms. McKELLAR: It's amazing, the psychology behind it, which is part of why I go so far with the girly stuff in my books, because I want to show them, you know what, this book is for you. This is your place. Your place is being smart and knowledgeable and good at math.  FLATOW: And what you both agree on is that - is the need to have a good mentor, a good math teacher.  Ms. McKELLAR: Yes. Oh yes.  FLATOW: And, Faith, you say that that - your math teacher turned you off.  FAITH: Yes. I - basically, I had three math teachers in a row, different grades, who basically the - there were some - there were a few guys in the classroom who just ruled the classroom and I wasn't - there was no room for me to ask questions or learn. I was always made fun of.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Ms. McKELLAR: Oh, that's so rough.  FAITH: And so I was completely turned off.  FLATOW: Well, it's too bad she came a few years too late for you, Faith.  FAITH: Yeah.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Faith, thanks for\u2026  FAITH: But thank you.  FLATOW: \u2026thanks for calling. And any final - we only have about a minute left -any final thoughts about where you're headed next and what you're going to do? Can we get you another TV show? Anything in the works here?  Ms. McKELLAR: Well, I don't think that I can write a book while on a TV show. But, you know, I'm open to whatever comes my way. I'm a big believer in - that the universe would direct things. I just got married in March, actually.  FLATOW: Oh, congratulations.  Ms. McKELLAR: Thank you.  FLATOW: Mazeltov, as we say in New York.  Ms. McKELLAR: Thank you very much.  FLATOW: That's terrific.  Ms. McKELLAR: Yeah. So\u2026  FLATOW: That's going to take some time out of your life.  Ms. McKELLAR: That took some time, planning that wedding, and then the wedding and then the honeymoon and all that.  FLATOW: Right.  Ms. McKELLAR: So, I'm a newlywed. And I'm writing the next book.  FLATOW: The algebra book.  Ms. McKELLAR: Yeah, the algebra book. I have a movie that I did called \"21 and a Wake-Up. \" It's on Vietnam nurses. That comes out, I think, this summer as an independent film.  FLATOW: Wow.  Ms. McKELLAR: So I'm keeping busy.  FLATOW: Well, that's good. And we wish you the best of luck. And I don't know how we can get this higher on the best-seller list.  Ms. McKELLAR: Oh, and I wanted to tell people, if they have any questions about the book\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  Ms. McKELLAR: \u2026about math, anything, kissmymath. com and mathdoesntsuck. com, those emails do get forwarded to me, especially the kids' emails. Those get flagged. And I answer specific math questions when they get written there.  FLATOW: And if you're writing an algebra book, do you want to hear anything about algebra from them especially?  Ms. McKELLAR: Yes, I would love to. Yes, you know what, I'm writing the book right now. Send me your requests.  FLATOW: It's - what's the address again?  Ms. McKELLAR: Kissmymath. com.  FLATOW: And there you have it. Danica, thank you.  Ms. McKELLAR: Thank you so much.  FLATOW: I'm speaking with Danica McKellar, working on a new algebra book, author of \"Kiss My Math\" and \"Math Doesn't Suck. \" Still in print, still moving up there.  Ms. McKELLAR: Oh, yeah.

People start to die, a city panics and the media feeds the fear with sensational headlines. The H1N1 swine flu? No, it's 1929, and parrot fever has gripped the country. Historian Jill Lepore writes about the forgotten fever in the current issue of the New Yorker. And she joins us to walk us through the story. Welcome, Jill Lepore. Ms. JILL LEPORE (Historian): Thanks. LYDEN: All this started when a man named Simon Martin, who was secretary of the Chamber of Commerce in Annapolis, Maryland, bought a parrot in Baltimore for his wife 10 days before Christmas in 1929. What happened after that? Ms. LEPORE: Well, you can imagine it's sort of a difficult shopping season to begin with, in the wake of the greatest stock market crash in American history, and Christmas Day comes, and under the Christmas tree is a dead parrot. And Martin, as you say, is secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, is troubled and brings the dead parrot back to the pet store. The pet store owner offers a replacement, but very quickly, Martin's wife Lillian and his daughter and son-in-law become quite sick within a matter of days, quite dangerously sick. LYDEN: So then the Baltimore mayor alerts the governor. Ms. LEPORE: The mayor alerts the governor, and the Martin family doctor had read an article in the newspaper about something called parrot fever, and he knew that the Martins had just had this parrot and had it died, and he put two and two together and became convinced that these three people he was treating were suffering from psittacosis, which is the technical name for parrot fever. He sent a telegram to Washington, to the U. S. Public Health Service, asking for a serum to be shipped immediately, and there was no known treatment whatsoever for parrot fever. In a matter of hours, the sort of entire apparatus of the American public health system descended on Annapolis, where the patients were hospitalized. LYDEN: The U. S. Public Health Service runs the Hygienic Laboratory, and it gets involved. And the guy the government puts in charge of the investigation is a scientist named Charles Armstrong. What's his mission? Ms. LEPORE: He's charged with figuring out the extent of the outbreak and coming up with a way to contain it. He sets about investigating all the cases that are now popping up in Maryland. At the pet shop in Baltimore, where Simon Martin had bought his parrot, they'd sold 36 parrots for Christmas presents, and all those parrots have got to be tracked down. A number of them are sick. By now, just a matter of days into January, four employees at the pet shop in Baltimore are sick. And Armstrong decides that the way to gather information about this outbreak is to cable all the public health departments in every American state and in cities where they are now cropping up suspected cases. What he needs to do to solve the mystery is to spread the word. LYDEN: Which spreads the panic. Ms. LEPORE: Spreads the panic. So, within hours, literally within hours of January 6, which is when this team of people all descend on Annapolis to try to figure out what's wrong with Lillian Martin, the entire country is on the alert for parrot fever. LYDEN: Now, the remarkable thing about this is that even as parrots are being exhumed and newspapers are reporting on is a parrot sick, has it got puffy eyes, is it not, a week or so after this all begins, by January 15, it's over. The Chicago Daily Tribune reports: U. S. alarm over parrot fever not warranted. The Wall Street Journal mocks it. What's happened? Ms. LEPORE: Two things have happened. (Soundbite of laughter) One is the newspapers overstated the case in the first place and sold a lot of newspapers, doubtless, by blaring headlines that reported deaths that turned out to actually have been deaths due to pneumonia, for instance, reported death counts and issued postmortems where no autopsy had been conducted, and there was - the only reason to suspect parrot fever was that someone had actually owned a parrot or been near a parrot. The second thing that happened was there was just a pushback against the extremity of the story. So, it suddenly became a national joke. And when the story turned, it turned so fast, and it turned all at once everywhere. So, really within a matter of a day, newspapers that had been screaming headlines about, you know, you should be bringing your parrots to the zoo, you should be abandoning your parrots, you should be wringing your parrot's neck, if you've been with a parrot, you should take yourself to hospital, suddenly turn around and are telling parrot jokes. LYDEN: After everyone's decided there's nothing to worry about, then comes this awful development. The scientists and doctors who've been close to these infected birds start to die in February, and they die fast and one by one. And microbe-hunter Charles Armstrong from the Hygienic Laboratory is himself in hospital with a fever of 104. Ms. LEPORE: Armstrong had been working tirelessly, of course, both to identify the sick and to study the disease, to isolate the germ and to come up with a cure for it. And on the day that his laboratory assistant, his long-time assistant, Shorty Anderson, dies, Armstrong drags himself to the hospital. He's got a fever of 104 and looks - it looks very much as though he's going to die, as well. The director of the Hygienic Laboratory, George McCoy, who not only insists on taking over Armstrong's research on the disease itself, decides to do something that is not commonly done in 1930. And he takes the blood from a patient who has survived parrot fever and injects that blood into Armstrong's veins without any of the safeties that we would think about today of how you might clean blood. And Armstrong manages to survive. LYDEN: What happens then? The director of the Hygienic Laboratory, McCoy, throws himself into the action. Ms. LEPORE: People keep getting sick. A number of doctors in New York get sick, and nurses get sick in New York. They all end up surviving. But 11 of the 54 employees of the Hygienic Laboratory in Washington have gotten very, very ill, and McCoy decides the whole building just has to be evacuated. He goes by himself into the Hygienic Laboratory, down to these two basement rooms where Armstrong had been doing his research. He brings with him a bottle of chloroform. He kills every animal: the parrots, monkeys, pigeons, rats, that had been used in Armstrong's experiments. He seals all the windows up. He leaves the building. He calls in a fumigation squad, and they fill the building with cyanide. LYDEN: And then, I couldn't believe the ending, what Congress does two months later. Ms. LEPORE: The Hygienic Laboratory, which had been hoping for a long time to have a greater role and had been making the case to Congress for some while that it needed a broader mandate and more funding and indeed a new title. And just a couple of months after the end of the parrot fever panic, Congress grants the Hygienic Laboratory all those things, including a new name, the National Institute of Health. LYDEN: It's an incredible story. Ms. LEPORE: It's a great story, but - and I think it's a great cautionary tale about how easily confounded the public is about messages that are sent both from the scientific community and the public health community and from the media, and a kind of tangle of mutual dependence that those two communities are involved in. Scientists really need the media to promote scientific work so that scientists can get funding for their work, and their work is important. They should get funding for it. But the media doesn't really have enough expertise to evaluate the work of scientists, and what the media wants is a story that makes a good story. The parrot fever outbreak made a good story. The parrot fever jokes made good jokes. Neither of them actually bore much resemblance to the facts of the matter. LYDEN: Jill Lepore is chair of the History and Literature program at Harvard University. And she joined us on the line from Cambridge, Mass. Jill Lepore, thank you. Ms. LEPORE: Sure, thanks a lot. (Soundbite of music)  JACKI LYDEN, host:  A disease jumps from animals to humans; there's no cure. People start to die, a city panics and the media feeds the fear with sensational headlines. The H1N1 swine flu? No, it's 1929, and parrot fever has gripped the country.  Historian Jill Lepore writes about the forgotten fever in the current issue of the New Yorker. And she joins us to walk us through the story.  Welcome, Jill Lepore.  Ms. JILL LEPORE (Historian): Thanks.  LYDEN: All this started when a man named Simon Martin, who was secretary of the Chamber of Commerce in Annapolis, Maryland, bought a parrot in Baltimore for his wife 10 days before Christmas in 1929. What happened after that?  Ms. LEPORE: Well, you can imagine it's sort of a difficult shopping season to begin with, in the wake of the greatest stock market crash in American history, and Christmas Day comes, and under the Christmas tree is a dead parrot. And Martin, as you say, is secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, is troubled and brings the dead parrot back to the pet store. The pet store owner offers a replacement, but very quickly, Martin's wife Lillian and his daughter and son-in-law become quite sick within a matter of days, quite dangerously sick.  LYDEN: So then the Baltimore mayor alerts the governor.  Ms. LEPORE: The mayor alerts the governor, and the Martin family doctor had read an article in the newspaper about something called parrot fever, and he knew that the Martins had just had this parrot and had it died, and he put two and two together and became convinced that these three people he was treating were suffering from psittacosis, which is the technical name for parrot fever.  He sent a telegram to Washington, to the U. S. Public Health Service, asking for a serum to be shipped immediately, and there was no known treatment whatsoever for parrot fever. In a matter of hours, the sort of entire apparatus of the American public health system descended on Annapolis, where the patients were hospitalized.  LYDEN: The U. S. Public Health Service runs the Hygienic Laboratory, and it gets involved. And the guy the government puts in charge of the investigation is a scientist named Charles Armstrong. What's his mission?  Ms. LEPORE: He's charged with figuring out the extent of the outbreak and coming up with a way to contain it. He sets about investigating all the cases that are now popping up in Maryland. At the pet shop in Baltimore, where Simon Martin had bought his parrot, they'd sold 36 parrots for Christmas presents, and all those parrots have got to be tracked down. A number of them are sick.  By now, just a matter of days into January, four employees at the pet shop in Baltimore are sick. And Armstrong decides that the way to gather information about this outbreak is to cable all the public health departments in every American state and in cities where they are now cropping up suspected cases. What he needs to do to solve the mystery is to spread the word.  LYDEN: Which spreads the panic.  Ms. LEPORE: Spreads the panic. So, within hours, literally within hours of January 6, which is when this team of people all descend on Annapolis to try to figure out what's wrong with Lillian Martin, the entire country is on the alert for parrot fever.  LYDEN: Now, the remarkable thing about this is that even as parrots are being exhumed and newspapers are reporting on is a parrot sick, has it got puffy eyes, is it not, a week or so after this all begins, by January 15, it's over.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: I'm Robert Siegel. And this next story is about something very pleasant: tickling babies. Once an infant is a few months old, you hear something like this if you go kitchy-kitchy-koo. (Soundbite of baby laughing) SIEGEL: But if the baby being tickled is a gorilla or a chimpanzee, you'll hear something a little different. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on some new research into the origins of laughter. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: Marina Davila Ross is a researcher at the University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom. She recently went around to zoos in Europe and recorded the sounds that apes made as they were tickled by their caretakers. One of her videos shows a man tickling the big feet of a hairy gorilla. The gorilla makes these rumbling, breathy sounds and squirms around. It looks like he's cracking up and loving it. (Soundbite of tickled gorilla) Ms. MARINA DAVILA ROSS (Researcher, University of Portsmouth): And that was absolutely fascinating, you know, how the relationship was between caretakers and the apes and how they responded to the caretakers when they were tickled. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She didn't just record gorillas, she recorded bonobos being tickled. (Soundbite of tickled bonobo) Orangutans. (Soundbite of tickled orangutan) And chimps. (Soundbite of tickled chimpanzee) All of these great apes share a common ancestor with humans, but are their tickle-induced sounds really related to this? (Soundbite of baby laughing) Ms. DAVILA ROSS: Now, how can one really know that this is laughter? GREENFIELDBOYCE: To try to find out, Davila Ross took her recordings to the lab of Michael Owren of Georgia State University who has studied the acoustics of human laughter. He says humans tend to go ha-ha-ha, while chimps' so-called laughter is more like panting. (Soundbite of tickled chimpanzee) Almost like they're just exerting themselves. Professor MICHAEL OWREN (Psychology and Neuroscience, Georgia State University): I was reluctant to think of the chimpanzee pant-like vocalizations as being laughter, and I did not necessarily believe that there was a common origin between those sounds and human laughter. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But then, the researchers analyzed various acoustic features in the recordings of tickled apes - things like how many sounds were made in a burst, whether sounds were made on the exhale or the inhale or both and how the vocal chords vibrated. And here's what they found. Owren says there's a revealing pattern of similarities and differences between these five related species. He says it seems likely that the origins of laughter go back at least to their last common ancestor, 10 to 16 million years ago. That ancestor had a primordial, laughter-like sound and specific features of this sound then got exaggerated or changed over evolutionary time as different apes emerged. Prof. OWREN: All these sounds do seem to have a common origin, evolutionarily speaking, and I am now comfortable calling them all laughter. GREENFIELDBOYCE: All of them? Prof. OWREN: All of them. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says this raises a question. If these sounds are all laughter, what made humans develop our distinctive ha-ha-ha instead of something more like the panting of a chimp? Prof. OWREN: If human laughter has evolved in a somewhat different direction, then why did it do that? And why these features in particular? GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says understanding that could help us learn more about the function of human laughter. After all, we don't just laugh when we're tickled. The results are reported in the journal Current Biology. Robert Provine is a neuroscientist at the University of Maryland who studies laughter. He thinks the roots of laughter might go even further back. He'd like to see more studies like this one that compare different animals' playful sounds. Professor ROBERT PROVINE (Psychology; Neuroscientist, University of Maryland): I think that it's about time we get out there, start tickling the dogs and the cats and the pigs, the rats, as well as the chimpanzees. I think we'll learn a lot about what we have in common, as well as our differences. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says dogs pant in a certain way when they're having fun, and rats chirp, but lots of other animals haven't been studied. Prof. PROVINE: What about whales? You know, do whales have some form of laughter? People really haven't looked into this. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In general, he says, laughter hasn't gotten a lot of attention from scientists. He says it's such an everyday thing that it basically goes unnoticed. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block.

I'm Ira Flatow. Just east of San Francisco Bay, the world's most powerful laser sits in a quiet suburb just waiting to be switched on. This is a project that has been decades in the making, and this is a really big laser. It was built with one purpose in mind, to blast, for just billionths of a second, a target the size of a pea filled with hydrogen with 500-trillion watts of power. The hope is to recreate the extreme pressures and temperatures that you find inside stars, like our sun, where hydrogen atoms fuse together to make helium and give off loads of energy in the nuclear fusion process. But not all scientists are optimistic or even cautiously optimistic that the lab is capable of creating this star fusion on Earth. Every year, it seems, fusion energy is just 30 years away, and I remember visiting an experimental laser-fusion device called Shiva about 30 years ago, in 1978, at the same laboratory. That was dismantled a little bit later, and then it was upgraded to another one called Nova, and so on and so on, and these experiments have been going on for years. So we're going to talk about this new effort today. Our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK, and as always, you can go to our Web site at sciencefriday. com, and you can Twitter us @scifri. Let me introduce my guest. Ed Moses is the principal associate director at the National Ignition Facility and the Photon Science Directorate at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab in Livermore, California. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Dr. EDWARD MOSES (Principal Associate Director, National Ignition Facility; Photon Science Directorate, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory): How are you doing, Ira? It's good to be here. FLATOW: Thank you. I remember those old projects from years ago. What makes you think you're going to get to home base this time? Dr. MOSES: Well, those old projects were actually all groundbreaking projects in both fusion and laser technology, and while there were some ideas that they could reach fusion at that time, basically there was a major study by the National Academy of Sciences in the early 1990s where it was decided that there was enough knowledge about the scale of a laser facility that had to be built in order to get fusion in the laboratory, and that was how the NIF facility or the National Ignition Facility, the laser you've been talking about, was sized. And now it is built, and it is operational. So it's not ready to be operational, it's actually operating right now. It's meeting all the specifications it needs, as far as we know, to get fusion. We have the kind of targets we need, and we'll be doing experiments over the next year to 18 months to see how this all works out. FLATOW: You actually have almost 200 laser beams, right, that converge on one little pea-sized pellet. Dr. MOSES: Right. It's kind of an interesting thing. We have 192, to be exact. So it's quite a large building, but because photons, or the little particles of light that we're driving together, do not mind being very close together, in fact they'll get infinitesimally close together, you can create very high energy density, and when you do that, you can bring these targets, you know literally, from near-absolute zero in temperature up to hundreds of millions of degrees in billionths of a second. And when you do that, you get conditions that exist like the conditions that exist in the center of the sun or other stars, and if that is true, which we think it will be, they should fuse together, and we'll have that e=mc2 energy. We'll turn mass into energy like Einstein told us, and we should have more energy out than we put in. That's kind of an interesting promise. FLATOW: Past break-even point. Dr. MOSES: Yes, past break-even, and this is scientific break-even, of course. FLATOW: As a difference as compared to what? Dr. MOSES: Okay, scientific break-even means we put - we get more energy out than the laser energy we put into the target, but it's not quite, in this case, the amount of get more energy out than we put into the plug that runs the laser. That'll be the next step. FLATOW: And when do you think you'll achieve this scientific break-even point? Dr. MOSES: Well, our goal is right now, and we're in the process of doing this, to start experiments this summer and fall and be ready to do implosion experiments - remember this is not an explosive process. It's an implosion process. We drive things together to be very high density. In fact, when it lights off, it'll be smaller than the diameter of your hair. Hopefully next summer, so a year from now. FLATOW: And what do you have to do between now and then? Dr. MOSES: Okay, well there's a couple of - as you said, there's a couple of physics issues, now that we have all the tools in place, that we're going to explore, and you know, one is when you put this much energy into this environment, it makes it, you know, very hot, like millions of degrees in literally the first two or three billionths of a second. Now you have a lot of very hot matter, which is called the plasma, in the target, and that could start steering beams or things like that, and we have to work through those issues. That's why we have an ultraviolet laser that will pierce through that. And then once we do that, the next question is, the big step is, when you compress this target from the size of a pea, as you said, to the diameter of a hair, how does it all come together nicely, roundly, smoothly so that it will get the pressures and temperature conditions to get thermonuclear burn. FLATOW: I think a lot of people are going to say if they're heating this thing up to hundreds of millions of degrees, then why aren't you melting the whole facility down? Dr. MOSES: Well, because it's - first of all, because it's so small, right, that even though, you know, the temperature is extremely hot, the amount of energy in it compared to the facility is really relatively small. So there's no fear of actually doing any damage to anything. And the other thing that's nice about fusion, it actually just burns out, right. So it doesn't - our goal is to get it to burn not for a millionth or a billionth, but a few trillionths of a second. Then the fuel is consumed, and it stops. So you don't have to worry about runaway or anything like that. FLATOW: Let's talk about a theoretical nuclear fusion reactor. Would that, then, be a series of these little explosions, one after another, sort of on a conveyer belt, or how would you draw the energy off continuously like we would do in the fission reactor? Dr. MOSES: Yeah, I think the way - the way I think about it is the way I think about, you know, an engine in a car, right. An engine in a car, it looks like it's continuous on one level, but we know it's just a bunch of cylinders and spark plugs going off, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, you know, a few hundred to a few thousand revolutions per minute. That's what we would do with the laser. What we'd do is we'd fire targets in literally sort of like on a blow gun, you know, these small little targets, as you said, the size of a pea, and we hit them with a laser when they're in the center of the target, and the energy would come out, and we would collect that energy and then finally turn it into electricity. And the way you do that is kind of traditional. You know, you absorb the energy in some hot salts and run it over some water, make it, make steam, turn to turbine, turbine makes electricity, put it on the line, you plug in. So from where you're sitting, it'll look totally transparent as to how that energy was made, but when you go outside, no carbon, no pollution, no climate warming, none of those other issues that come with many other types of energy. FLATOW: Is this totally paid for by government research? Dr. MOSES: Yes, this is a U. S. government project. It's in the Department of Energy. FLATOW: Assuming that this does - you're able to achieve ignition and go on to do scientific work with it, how much would you have to ramp it up to make\u2026 Dr. MOSES: Well actually, this is what's very interesting about this facility. You know, we're going to be in a single-shot mode, which means we'll do a - you know, we can fire the laser with the targets every few hours, but what's great about this kind of fusion energy that even if you did it 10 times a second, or 600 rpm, every single shot is independent. So we'll be ramping it up over the next couple years to learn how to make it more efficient and more energy capable, and when we do, we'll be able to then work simultaneously on these higher - what we call repetition-rate systems - so that you could get energy online. FLATOW: So you're saying that we - I'll have to stop making that joke that fusion is always 30 years away next year. Dr. MOSES: Well actually, you know, that has been the statement, I don't know if it's a joke or not, but that people do use that as a joke, that fusion is 30 years away no matter what year you ask, but here we are right now, hopefully in the next two, three years at the outside, hopefully we will have demonstrated that it has happened. And I think when it does happen, it could be a very important time for us because, you know, when we look at ourselves as a country, as members of international society, we do need ways to get carbon-free energy, number one, and also, if you think about this, what are we using for fuel? We're using the hydrogen and water. There's a lot of it. You know, it has no carbon in it, it's not geopolitical. If you can make this all work, it changes the way you think about a lot of things, and that's always been the goal of the fusion process. It is the power of the sun, right? We would build the miniature sun on Earth, very miniature, and we'd be running them at a high rep rate to make power to run our society in a very clean way, and hopefully world societies. FLATOW: Could you also do experiments to recreate what goes on out in the universe, like supernova, things like that? Dr. MOSES: Yeah, actually you can. I mean, you know, right now, astronomy is an observational science. What we do is look at our beautiful satellites, whether Earth-based or space-based, as things that happened, literally, you know, thousands of years ago or millions of years ago, even billions of years ago as we stare out at the cosmos. What if you could take those conditions, very miniature versions (unintelligible) of course, and create them in the laboratory at the National Ignition Facility, and actually schedule them so you could have a star or a supernova or a Jovian supergiant planet, or these new super-terrestrials that are being found as we look for planets out there in the galaxy? What if you could do that right here? We think we can, and scientists from all over the world are proposing experiments to do these kind of - to create these kinds of conditions right here in this laboratory. It's very exciting. CONAN: Let me ask you, while I've got about a minute left. What is your biggest hurdle yet to overcome now? Dr. MOSES: Well, I think the biggest hurdle right now is, you know, just putting all of the equipment together, now that it's operational, in these experimental configurations and really getting good data out of it so that we can understand the phenomenology that we're looking at, react appropriately to it and do the experiments that we have to do in order to get, you know, gain, which is more energy out than we put in, which has been what we've been striving for, for the last 30 years. FLATOW: There you go. Ed Moses, thank you for taking time to be with us today. Dr. MOSES: Thank you so much. FLATOW: Good luck to you. Ed Moses, principal associate director at the National Ignition Facility and the Photon Science Directorate at Lawrence Livermore. That's out there in Livermore, California. We're going to take a break and come back and talk about nuclear fission, which powers our nuclear power plants. So what's the future of nuclear power? Does nuclear power have a place next to solar and wind? Why are folks who believe in green technology supporting nuclear power? We'll get into a debate and a discussion and your questions. Stay with us. We'll be right back. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow.  Just east of San Francisco Bay, the world's most powerful laser sits in a quiet suburb just waiting to be switched on. This is a project that has been decades in the making, and this is a really big laser.  It was built with one purpose in mind, to blast, for just billionths of a second, a target the size of a pea filled with hydrogen with 500-trillion watts of power. The hope is to recreate the extreme pressures and temperatures that you find inside stars, like our sun, where hydrogen atoms fuse together to make helium and give off loads of energy in the nuclear fusion process.  But not all scientists are optimistic or even cautiously optimistic that the lab is capable of creating this star fusion on Earth. Every year, it seems, fusion energy is just 30 years away, and I remember visiting an experimental laser-fusion device called Shiva about 30 years ago, in 1978, at the same laboratory. That was dismantled a little bit later, and then it was upgraded to another one called Nova, and so on and so on, and these experiments have been going on for years.  So we're going to talk about this new effort today. Our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK, and as always, you can go to our Web site at sciencefriday. com, and you can Twitter us @scifri.  Let me introduce my guest. Ed Moses is the principal associate director at the National Ignition Facility and the Photon Science Directorate at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab in Livermore, California. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Dr. EDWARD MOSES (Principal Associate Director, National Ignition Facility; Photon Science Directorate, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory): How are you doing, Ira? It's good to be here.  FLATOW: Thank you. I remember those old projects from years ago. What makes you think you're going to get to home base this time?  Dr. MOSES: Well, those old projects were actually all groundbreaking projects in both fusion and laser technology, and while there were some ideas that they could reach fusion at that time, basically there was a major study by the National Academy of Sciences in the early 1990s where it was decided that there was enough knowledge about the scale of a laser facility that had to be built in order to get fusion in the laboratory, and that was how the NIF facility or the National Ignition Facility, the laser you've been talking about, was sized.  And now it is built, and it is operational. So it's not ready to be operational, it's actually operating right now. It's meeting all the specifications it needs, as far as we know, to get fusion. We have the kind of targets we need, and we'll be doing experiments over the next year to 18 months to see how this all works out.  FLATOW: You actually have almost 200 laser beams, right, that converge on one little pea-sized pellet.  Dr. MOSES: Right. It's kind of an interesting thing. We have 192, to be exact. So it's quite a large building, but because photons, or the little particles of light that we're driving together, do not mind being very close together, in fact they'll get infinitesimally close together, you can create very high energy density, and when you do that, you can bring these targets, you know literally, from near-absolute zero in temperature up to hundreds of millions of degrees in billionths of a second.  And when you do that, you get conditions that exist like the conditions that exist in the center of the sun or other stars, and if that is true, which we think it will be, they should fuse together, and we'll have that e=mc2 energy. We'll turn mass into energy like Einstein told us, and we should have more energy out than we put in. That's kind of an interesting promise.  FLATOW: Past break-even point.  Dr. MOSES: Yes, past break-even, and this is scientific break-even, of course.  FLATOW: As a difference as compared to what?  Dr. MOSES: Okay, scientific break-even means we put - we get more energy out than the laser energy we put into the target, but it's not quite, in this case, the amount of get more energy out than we put into the plug that runs the laser. That'll be the next step.  FLATOW: And when do you think you'll achieve this scientific break-even point?  Dr. MOSES: Well, our goal is right now, and we're in the process of doing this, to start experiments this summer and fall and be ready to do implosion experiments - remember this is not an explosive process. It's an implosion process. We drive things together to be very high density. In fact, when it lights off, it'll be smaller than the diameter of your hair. Hopefully next summer, so a year from now.  FLATOW: And what do you have to do between now and then?  Dr. MOSES: Okay, well there's a couple of - as you said, there's a couple of physics issues, now that we have all the tools in place, that we're going to explore, and you know, one is when you put this much energy into this environment, it makes it, you know, very hot, like millions of degrees in literally the first two or three billionths of a second.  Now you have a lot of very hot matter, which is called the plasma, in the target, and that could start steering beams or things like that, and we have to work through those issues. That's why we have an ultraviolet laser that will pierce through that. And then once we do that, the next question is, the big step is, when you compress this target from the size of a pea, as you said, to the diameter of a hair, how does it all come together nicely, roundly, smoothly so that it will get the pressures and temperature conditions to get thermonuclear burn.  FLATOW: I think a lot of people are going to say if they're heating this thing up to hundreds of millions of degrees, then why aren't you melting the whole facility down?  Dr. MOSES: Well, because it's - first of all, because it's so small, right, that even though, you know, the temperature is extremely hot, the amount of energy in it compared to the facility is really relatively small. So there's no fear of actually doing any damage to anything.  And the other thing that's nice about fusion, it actually just burns out, right. So it doesn't - our goal is to get it to burn not for a millionth or a billionth, but a few trillionths of a second. Then the fuel is consumed, and it stops. So you don't have to worry about runaway or anything like that.  FLATOW: Let's talk about a theoretical nuclear fusion reactor. Would that, then, be a series of these little explosions, one after another, sort of on a conveyer belt, or how would you draw the energy off continuously like we would do in the fission reactor?  Dr. MOSES: Yeah, I think the way - the way I think about it is the way I think about, you know, an engine in a car, right. An engine in a car, it looks like it's continuous on one level, but we know it's just a bunch of cylinders and spark plugs going off, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, you know, a few hundred to a few thousand revolutions per minute.  That's what we would do with the laser. What we'd do is we'd fire targets in literally sort of like on a blow gun, you know, these small little targets, as you said, the size of a pea, and we hit them with a laser when they're in the center of the target, and the energy would come out, and we would collect that energy and then finally turn it into electricity.  And the way you do that is kind of traditional. You know, you absorb the energy in some hot salts and run it over some water, make it, make steam, turn to turbine, turbine makes electricity, put it on the line, you plug in. So from where you're sitting, it'll look totally transparent as to how that energy was made, but when you go outside, no carbon, no pollution, no climate warming, none of those other issues that come with many other types of energy.  FLATOW: Is this totally paid for by government research?  Dr. MOSES: Yes, this is a U. S. government project. It's in the Department of Energy.  FLATOW: Assuming that this does - you're able to achieve ignition and go on to do scientific work with it, how much would you have to ramp it up to make\u2026  Dr. MOSES: Well actually, this is what's very interesting about this facility. You know, we're going to be in a single-shot mode, which means we'll do a - you know, we can fire the laser with the targets every few hours, but what's great about this kind of fusion energy that even if you did it 10 times a second, or 600 rpm, every single shot is independent.  So we'll be ramping it up over the next couple years to learn how to make it more efficient and more energy capable, and when we do, we'll be able to then work simultaneously on these higher - what we call repetition-rate systems - so that you could get energy online.  FLATOW: So you're saying that we - I'll have to stop making that joke that fusion is always 30 years away next year.  Dr. MOSES: Well actually, you know, that has been the statement, I don't know if it's a joke or not, but that people do use that as a joke, that fusion is 30 years away no matter what year you ask, but here we are right now, hopefully in the next two, three years at the outside, hopefully we will have demonstrated that it has happened.  And I think when it does happen, it could be a very important time for us because, you know, when we look at ourselves as a country, as members of international society, we do need ways to get carbon-free energy, number one, and also, if you think about this, what are we using for fuel?

I'm Ira Flatow. About a month ago, we had on, you might remember, John Holdren, President Obama's science advisor, came on the show to talk about some of the science priorities for the new administration, and during that conversation, we talked about what he thought of investing in nuclear power and building new generating facilities, and here's what he said. Mr. JOHN HOLDREN (Presidential Science Advisor): Well I think first of all, yes we should be investing in nuclear energy. We should be investing in approaches to addressing the difficulties that have prevented us from expanding nuclear energy to a greater extent up until now. We should be doing research that is addressed at making nuclear energy more cost-effective. We should be doing research to address the problem of how we manage the radioactive waste. We should be doing more research to reduce the linkages between nuclear energy and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. I do think that if we could get an expanded contribution from nuclear energy, it would be a tremendous help in addressing the climate change challenge. FLATOW: That was John Holdren, President Obama's science advisor, talking about how he sees the future of nuclear energy and nuclear power, all about if we should, if we could, we should do these things, all these ifs and shoulds, but that also is sort of what some environmentalists have been saying now, too, a big break from the era of protest marches and chants of no nukes, a change of heart that comes at a time with a possibly more serious threat of climate change. So for the rest of the hour, we're going to talk about the pros and cons of embracing nuclear power once again here in the U. S. and some of the technical hurdles, what technologies are out there, what kinds of new reactors might we see out there, some of the economic challenges in the industry, that the industry is facing today. Where - other ideas. Where will they store the waste? What happened to Yucca Mountain? The administration has sort of taken that off the table. Do new reactor designs make a nuclear power plant safer and more efficient than the old ones, or what about the pricing? Are these new power plants just going to be going up and up and up in price and pricing themselves out of the market? So if you'd like to talk about the future of nuclear energy, our number is 1-800-989-8255. Also you can tweet us @scifri, @-S-C-I-F-R-I, and also in Second Life, you can find us in Second Life at Science Friday island. Let me now introduce my guests. Thomas Cochran is the director of the nuclear program at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington and the Wade Greene Chair for Nuclear Policy there. He joins us from NPR's Washington bureau. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Dr. THOMAS COCHRAN (Nuclear Physicist Senior Scientist, Nuclear Program; Wade Greene Chair for Nuclear Policy, Natural Resources Defense Council): Thank you. FLATOW: You're welcome. Ernest Moniz is the former undersecretary for the Department of Energy. He's also professor of physics and engineering systems and director of the Energy Initiative at MIT in Cambridge. He joins us over the phone. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Moniz. Dr. ERNEST MONIZ (Former Undersecretary, Department of Energy; Director, Professor of Physics and Engineering Systems, Energy Initiative, Massachusetts Institute of Technology): Thank you, Ira, it's a pleasure. FLATOW: Stewart Brand is the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog. He's also president of the Long Now Foundation and co-founder of the Global Business Network in Sausalito, California. He joins us today by phone. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Mr. STEWART BRAND (President, Long Now Foundation; Co-founder, Global Business Network): Greetings to you. FLATOW: Let me ask you, let me react, get your reactions to the clip that I played there from John Holdren. Dr. Moniz, from what Holdren was saying, it sounds like we need more and more and more research into all these things, and we have no real solutions on the table right now. Would that be a fair assessment? Dr. MONIZ: Well, I think I would be a bit cautious on the statement of no solutions, but John Holdren, I think, was right on in talking about the significant challenge we face in addressing climate-change risks, and I would agree with him that we will need multiple technologies that avoid carbon emissions, and I think nuclear power will almost certainly have to be one of those, along with renewables in particular and perhaps carbon sequestration, if we are to achieve stringent, low CO2 emissions goals. FLATOW: Is it your view, and I'll ask all of you, gentlemen, is it your views that nuclear energy, nuclear power plants, are an end unto themselves, or are they just stopgap measures to combat global warming until other renewable, maybe greener, energy sources, perhaps even fusion that we were talking about before, comes online? Dr. MONIZ: Well, I think it's - it would be presumptuous to talk about what will be the technology mix, you know, many decades down the road. The fact is that if we are going to be serious about the kinds of greenhouse gas targets we talk about, we need to get our ship, the ship being the energy business, turning right now. And over the next two to three decades, I certainly believe that nuclear power, as I said, must be a part of that mix with the other technologies. 2050 and beyond, well, we can all hope for major breakthroughs. FLATOW: Stewart Brand, did you always believe in nuclear energy? Mr. BRAND: No, I flipped on it, and I can say a little bit about that, but to your question about whether nuclear is stopgap, I think it's - that's unknown. It's unknown because one, it's already pretty good. Twenty percent of the U. S. energy comes from nuclear, 16 percent of the world gets it from there. And we'll talk about the various ways it looks to be getting better. The question is, what do you do for base load power, for power that's always on? And so far, solar and wind can't do that. Until we get a way to really do storage, those guys are going to be a partial solution at best. If we get solar coming down from space, where it's always on, then it's base load power, but it's really expensive to get there unless we start mining asteroids, which could happen. So it looks to me like we're stuck with nuclear as the best no-to-low carbon source of base load power for some decades to come. FLATOW: Tom, do you agree we're stuck with nuclear? Dr. COCHRAN: Well, I don't think you framed the debate properly. The issue is not whether one is for or against nuclear power. The issue at hand is whether one is for additional federal subsidies to construct new nuclear plants in the United States, and you find a situation where all of the major environmental organizations, their highest priority is federal legislation that will cap carbon emissions, and this happens to be the single policy that would do the nuclear industry the most good because it would change the underlying economic comparison between nuclear and fossil fuels. So the real issue here, again, is whether we should be using federal money to subsidize the construction of new nuclear plants, or should we use the more economically efficient way to attack the climate mitigation, and that is to cap carbon and let these various technologies compete. And nuclear's problem is, with regard to new plants, they're uneconomical today, and the unit cost is so large that the energy generating companies and utilities cannot readily, privately finance them, and so\u2026 FLATOW: What are the\u2026 Dr. COCHRAN: So those companies that are interested in nuclear are coming to the federal government to get the government to pay a substantial part of the cost of a new plant and to subsidize the risk associated with financing, through loan guarantees. Mr. BRAND: That seems like a kind of a way-around-the-horn argument. I mean, it's like saying we disapprove of France getting 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear because, you know, they didn't do it in exactly the same market way we do, and should we ask them to shut down their plants because they did it wrong? Dr. COCHRAN: That's not the issue. Nuclear is here. We have 104 plants operating in the United States. They operate very efficiently, at over 90 percent capacity factor. There are 435 plants worldwide. There's something like 44 plants under construction worldwide. Nuclear is part of the mix. That is not the issue, at least from a federal policy standpoint. The issue, at least in this town, in Washington, D. C. , is whether the federal government ought to be subsidizing the construction of new nuclear power plants, rather than fixing the climate issue through a cap and trade legislation, such as the Waxman-Markey Bill, and then let nuclear compete. Dr. MONIZ: If I could add to that, Ira. FLATOW: Sure. Dr. MONIZ: First of all, I certainly agree with Tom that what we would really like to see, assuming, of course, CO2 is our focus, I might add that we do have other policy objectives, as well, such as energy security, etcetera, but let's just stay with CO2. Then there's no question that a real legislated cap on CO2 would be the most effective approach and the most effective policy, and the marketplace should indeed sort out the options. However, the reality is while we see encouraging progress today with, for example, the Waxman-Markey Bill, certainly, President Obama's strong support for climate legislation, I don't think anyone seriously believes that we are going to be at a place where our legislation has a clean, serious cap on CO2 for quite some years. We don't have time to waste to demonstrate the options for the marketplace, let's say 10 years from now. In that context, we have had supported federal incentives not only for nuclear but for all carbon-free technologies. We are not, for example, seriously pursuing and demonstrating carbon sequestration. We do have a number of incentives. . . Mr. BRAND: Think it will work, either way? Dr. MONIZ: I think it will work at some level. Whether or not it can be a long pole of the tent, I think remains very, very open. We are supporting, particularly, the introduction of wind and solar. And with nuclear, we have untested licensing procedures, we have new evolutionary plants. What we advocated and is - and what is in law, in fact, in 2005, is for so-called first mover plants. One can argue whether that's five or 10 plants, we believe there is a public good in support for having the industry move out and build a relatively small number of plants so that they and we and investors can all understand what the new generation of nuclear plant built in the United States will cost, how will the licensing go, how it would operate, and then let the marketplace decide as the carbon legislation is put in place. FLATOW: What about the problem about the Yucca Mountain situation where the - waste storage of the waste - the nuclear waste here. Have we now decided that it's best to keep them at the nuclear sites rather than to create a central repository like at Yucca Mountain? Mr. BRAND: They're pretty safe there. The dry cast storage, you know, these things are out back of the parking lot. They've been there for a number of years. It was the interim solution while Yucca kept being argued about, apparently indefinitely. And we're realizing that the interim solution is a pretty good one. FLATOW: Tom, do you agree? Mr. COCHRAN: Well, it's an interim solution. You can safely store the spent nuclear fuel in dry cast at the reactor sites as long as the utilities and energy companies are there to manage the cast. They don't represent a significant risk in my judgment. There is a long-term problem, though, in that this spent fuel has a toxicity that will last for tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years. . . Mr. BRAND: But it goes down fast. Mr. COCHRAN: . . . long beyond the lifetime of the social institutions that we're living under today. And so, we have, as a society, an obligation to move this material into safe storage. It's an intergenerational risk problem. We have intergenerational risk associated with other energy technologies. This happens to be the one with - most prevalent with nuclear technology. So I think we can safely store the spent fuel at the sites. We should get on with identifying new geologic repository alternatives so that we can move this material underground as soon as possible. FLATOW: All right. Let me just - I need to interrupt and tell everybody that this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Mr. BRAND: I have a question for Tom. FLATOW: Go ahead. Mr. BRAND: What do you think of the WIPP, the site, the underground salt area in New Mexico where we've been putting nuclear waste for 10 years now? And should that be, maybe, what we do instead of Yucca Mountain? Mr. COCHRAN: Well, I would say salt deposit near the WIPP facility should be one of the candidates, should - that we should examine in this second round effort to identify suitable repository sites. The WIPP site itself, you're going to run into political problems in trying to change the license of that particular site. But. . . Mr. BRAND: Well, the licenses for military waste now is just - all you have to do is add civilian waste. Mr. COCHRAN: Well, it's not quite that simple. But the salt deposit is a reasonable alternative that ought to be considered for the next repository. Dr. MONIZ: Could I add, Ira, that first of all, I think it's important to reinforce the point, which I think Tom and Stewart have both agreed upon, and I do as well, that is in effect. We have no - there's no technical, no science or technical reason that drives us to precipitous action in managing the spent fuel. Dry cast storage can be carried on, I would say, at least for a century scale, in fact, if one chooses to do so relatively economically. However, even there, I would just at least voice a preference for not having the spent fuel distributed at 80 some sites, but to at least consolidate that under federal control at a small number of up sites for what is called interim storage. I prefer to call it managed storage. And one reason is, I think Tom began to allude to this. For one thing, we have a number of shutdown reactors. We like to move it away. Secondly, and I'm quite aware of this, given my service at the Department of Energy in 1998, the government does have a responsibility to begin moving the fuel and is in fact accruing financial liabilities. I would rather see the spent fuel moved to a few locations under federal control. For the longer term, the allusion to alternative geologies is perfectly correct. And salt is certainly one possible attractive medium. But I might add, we don't pay enough attention to the fact that there are rather successful repository programs going on, for example, in Scandinavia, in Sweden with granite, in France with clay. There are a variety of geologies that look very, very attractive. I will be honest. I don't think volcanic tuff is the most attractive. . . (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Right. Dr. MONIZ: . . . of geologies. So we have options and we should just - we should take our time to do it and move forward. FLATOW: All right. We have to take our time to have a break now. So I'll ask you all to sit tight. We're going to take a short break and come back and talk lots more about the future of nuclear energy and nuclear power. We'll talk a little bit about, maybe, what new reactors might look like and how much it will cost. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this break. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about the future of nuclear power here in the U. S. with my guests, Thomas Cochran, director of the nuclear program at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington. Ernest Moniz, who is former undersecretary for the Department of Energy. Stewart Brand, founder of the Whole Earth catalog and also president of the Long Now Foundation and co-founder of the Global Business Network in Sausalito. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Professor Moniz, I'm looking at a report called \"The Update of the MIT 2003 Future of Nuclear Power,\" a report that you helped write. And one of the striking things about the report, it talks about the escalating cost of nuclear power, how the cost since that report in 2003 for overnight, what are called overnight costs, have doubled in those, what, five years or some - since the original. Is nuclear power - could it not survive, as Tom Cochran seems to be intimating, if it were not subsidized? Dr. MONIZ: Well, first of all, we should stress as the table in our report shows, that of course, the cost for everything has gone up dramatically in those six years. Similarly, the capital cost for coal nearly doubled, or for gas, it nearly doubled. So that's just a broad phenomenon. Mr. BRAND: Also (unintelligible), I would assume. Dr. MONIZ: It does impact nuclear more strongly in the sense that it is the most capital intensive of the options. So here, a major issue is the nature of the financing for any of these plants. And what our table shows is that the levelized cost of electricity for nuclear, coal or gas, all, any of the options, of those three options, frankly are very, very comparable if they all have comparable financing. This does go back to the issue, the little debate we had with Tom, in terms of the incentives for all of these technologies, but nuclear in particular, in the near term. We need to establish the costs of building these plants in order to provide some confidence to the investment sector. That for example. . . FLATOW: Right. Dr. MONIZ: . . . the investment can be made with, let say, no more risk than that for, let say, a new coal plant or a new other kind of plant. FLATOW: And what would the life expectancy of these plants be? Dr. MONIZ: Well, nuclear plants today are now more than half of the - or no, roughly half of the plants have now been licensed for 60 years. So I think one should assume that a new nuclear plant would also be 60 years, possibly even longer. FLATOW: The reason I ask is because I was at - not too long ago, at an MIT symposium on nuclear energy with experts there who were saying that there - if we were to build all these nuclear power plants, and let's use 1,000 that you use in your report, there's not enough uranium in the world to last 100 years to supply the uranium for these plants. Dr. MONIZ: I. . . FLATOW: Would you agree with that? Dr. MONIZ: No, not at all, and our report said so. Since our original report, in six years, the estimates of uranium availability have, if anything, grown dramatically, we believe that\u2026 FLATOW: But there has been no\u2026 Dr. MONIZ: . . . uranium resources is not a constraint for this century. FLATOW: But there's no - you also say there that no such program has been initiated to actually take a census of how much uranium there is. Dr. MONIZ: Correct. We've advocated a very systematic program supported by DOE to do that. But as we get in data from various companies, mining companies, and as we make the usual kinds of extrapolations for natural resources at a reasonable cost, the amount that is now acknowledged in the international database would support just about a growth to, let's say, 1,000 reactors and lifetime supply for those reactors. Frankly, in my gut, I think there would be many, many more if the demand - much more if the demand were there. Mr. COCHRAN: Ira\u2026 FLATOW: Well, let me. . . Mr. BRAND: There's (unintelligible) discovery going on for uranium now. . . Mr. COCHRAN: Well, I'm not sure I'm connected anymore\u2026 FLATOW: Tom, you're there. Are you there, Tom Cochran? Mr. COCHRAN: Ira. . . FLATOW: Yes, go ahead. Mr. COCHRAN: One thing, most nuclear engineers forget or don't realize is that the rate of - as uranium is mined, the efficiency of extraction outpaces the depletion of the resource. This is true of virtually every major mineral. Dr. MONIZ: That's a nice way to put it. Mr. COCHRAN: Therefore, as the demand goes up, the price in constant dollars, corrected for inflation, will stay flat or go down. And you can look at the history of minerals and see that. And so, you should not anticipate that the prices of uranium, over the long haul, there'll be price fluctuations due to short-term market imperfections. But over the long haul, the prices will stay flat or come down. Similarly, uranium enrichment, there's large room for improving the efficiency of enriching uranium, the enrichment work. And so the price of enrichment will not go up substantially in constant dollars. And therefore, fuel costs for nuclear power plants are not anticipated to increase over the long haul. The real issue is the capital costs of the new plants. And if we could come back to that issue, the issue today is whether the federal government ought to be providing these additional subsidies. Now, Ernie mentioned the need for first mover plants in the 2005 Energy Policy Act that was about several billion dollars worth of subsidies to build a few new nuclear plants. There are actually plants that will probably be built in the southeast, such as in Florida or South Carolina or Georgia, that are in regulated utilities. And the public utility commissions have given these utilities permission to get the return - the cost of construction in the rate base while the plants are being constructed. So we don't even need federal dollars in - to build these new plants and to meet the concerns that Ernie Moniz has. We can find out what these costs and what the financial impacts of the\u2026 FLATOW: Tom, why are you so concerned about federal underwriting? (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. COCHRAN: Well, what - I just really, in my gut, object to having people in states that don't use nuclear power plants or - be taxed so that people in other states can use their money to pay for their electricity. You have a situation you've created under the 2005 Energy Act where we are about - if we subsidize the construction of the Calvert Cliffs three plant in Maryland, that plant, it was 50 percent owned by Electricite de France, which is - the major stockholder is the French government. So we're about to tax people in Montana, Colorado and so forth to subsidize the French government so Electricite de France can get a toehold into the electricity market in Maryland and sell electricity to people here in Washington D. C. and Baltimore at below what the cost would be otherwise, and thereby encourage people not to do things like use energy more efficiently and so forth. Mr. BRAND: Are you tracking a new microreactor (unintelligible). reactors? Mr. COCHRAN: The proper way to deal with the climate issue is to cap the carbon emissions and let these technologies compete. Nuclear's had $100 billion more with the subsidies over its lifetime. It's a 50-year-old mature industry, and we shouldn't have the federal government continue to subsidize it just because the nuclear industry has effective lobbyists on K Street. FLATOW: All right, Tom, let me interrupt. Stewart Brand, you were going to ask about these microreactors? Mr. BRAND: Yeah. Tom, I wonder if you're tracking on and Professor Moniz. Microreactor designs are coming out fast. These are down 25-megawatt, 35-megawatt, 50-megawatt level. They cost about $1 million a megawatt. They are quick to build. They're - they look like a whole different animal than the big 1. 2, 1. 6 gigawatt reactors. Is that your view? FLATOW: Dr. Moniz? Mr. COCHRAN: Certainly, the Russians are taking what's in effect submarine reactors or reactors for icebreakers. And are putting them on a barge and are going to try to provide power to remote regions with these small reactors. Whether these small reactors are - would be competitive in the United States is a whole different issue. I sort of doubt it. The trend has been, over the years, to build larger and larger and larger reactors to try to benefit from some economies of scale. And I just think it's unlikely that going back to a very small reactor would be economical in the United States. Mr. BRAND: But their company (unintelligible)\u2026 Mr. COCHRAN: But let them have it, you know? Mr. BRAND: \u2026(unintelligible) orders already. Mr. COCHRAN: If people want to risk their money and try to license one of these and sell it, go for it. FLATOW: What was that, Stewart? Mr. BRAND: Just to gather the - one of the companies, Hyperion, in New Mexico working with the Los Alamos design, they claim they have a bunch of firm orders. So they're getting traffic. FLATOW: In the few minutes, we're having left - we have left, Dr. Moniz, what are the - what would newer reactors look like - be different than the ones we have now? Dr. MONIZ: Well, first of all, I think that the light water reactor that is the, you know, the backbone of the global nuclear feat today will remain a very, very important technology throughout this century, frankly. However, I think on the horizon, potentially, are high temperature gas reactors, which could be very interesting. We have some historical experience with that, didn't go very well, although the problems were not with the reactor per se, to be honest. These are attractive reactors in the sense that they are more efficient, they operate at higher temperature. And indeed, they might even have uses other than electricity using high quality heat. But the real issue right now is we need to - there is a federal program moving forward to try to demonstrate a modern high temperature gas reactor. These, by the way, are also - they're not microreactors, but they typically would have a scale in the 100 to 300 megawatts versus the thousand or 1,400 megawatts of light water reactors. And at that scale, they may have an interesting niche in the power market. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. We're talking about (unintelligible) reactors\u2026 Mr. BRAND: \u2026(unintelligible) and generating hydrogen and stuff like that with that temperature range. FLATOW: Hang on. Hang on. Hang on, Stewart. I got to give a station break. We're talking about SCIENCE FRIDAY - we're talking about nuclear reactors on SCIENCE FRIDAY at this hour from NPR News. Okay. I've got - just about one minute or so left. Are we all talking that these reactors will be safer or as safe, or safer than the ones we have today? No one has argued - or is worrying about the safety of these, correct? Mr. BRAND: Correct. Dr. MONIZ: Well, the - I mean, by observation, at least, in the last years, we've had extraordinary performance from the fleet. We have had glitches. There was a problem in Ohio plant. It was caught in time, but it was a glaring problem.  But overall, these plants have operated -more than 90 percent of the time, they've operated well. The net - the high temperature gas reactors I just alluded to, have some additional attractions in terms of what are called passive safety features. So I would say the safety rating of reactors has gone up by about a factor of 10 over the last several decades. FLATOW: Tom Cochran, you agree? Mr. COCHRAN: Well, the most important factor affecting the safety of a nuclear plant is the safety culture at the plant. FLATOW: The people. Mr. COCHRAN: The safety culture at U. S. plants has improved over the years, but overseas there's still countries where the safety culture is poor or, in the case of China, untested. And so, since most of the reactors that will be operating over the next 30 years are reactors that are currently operating, I think you should look at - toward foreign reactors in terms of the risk associated with a catastrophic nuclear accident or meltdown. FLATOW: All right, gentlemen, I ran out of time. We will pick this up again because it is - it's going to be an evolving issue. I'm\u2026 Mr. BRAND: No kidding. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Yeah. Glad you took time to be with us today. Stewart Brand is founder of the Whole Earth catalog and president of the Long Now Foundation and co-founder of the Global Business Network. Ernest Moniz, former undersecretary for the Department of Energy, professor of physics and engineering systems and director of the Energy Initiative at MIT. Thomas Cochran, director of the nuclear program at the NRDC in Washington. Thank you, gentlemen, for taking time to be with us today. Dr. MONIZ: Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: You're welcome. Have a good weekend.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow.  About a month ago, we had on, you might remember, John Holdren, President Obama's science advisor, came on the show to talk about some of the science priorities for the new administration, and during that conversation, we talked about what he thought of investing in nuclear power and building new generating facilities, and here's what he said.  Mr. JOHN HOLDREN (Presidential Science Advisor): Well I think first of all, yes we should be investing in nuclear energy. We should be investing in approaches to addressing the difficulties that have prevented us from expanding nuclear energy to a greater extent up until now. We should be doing research that is addressed at making nuclear energy more cost-effective. We should be doing research to address the problem of how we manage the radioactive waste. We should be doing more research to reduce the linkages between nuclear energy and the proliferation of nuclear weapons.  I do think that if we could get an expanded contribution from nuclear energy, it would be a tremendous help in addressing the climate change challenge.  FLATOW: That was John Holdren, President Obama's science advisor, talking about how he sees the future of nuclear energy and nuclear power, all about if we should, if we could, we should do these things, all these ifs and shoulds, but that also is sort of what some environmentalists have been saying now, too, a big break from the era of protest marches and chants of no nukes, a change of heart that comes at a time with a possibly more serious threat of climate change.  So for the rest of the hour, we're going to talk about the pros and cons of embracing nuclear power once again here in the U. S. and some of the technical hurdles, what technologies are out there, what kinds of new reactors might we see out there, some of the economic challenges in the industry, that the industry is facing today.  Where - other ideas. Where will they store the waste? What happened to Yucca Mountain? The administration has sort of taken that off the table. Do new reactor designs make a nuclear power plant safer and more efficient than the old ones, or what about the pricing? Are these new power plants just going to be going up and up and up in price and pricing themselves out of the market?  So if you'd like to talk about the future of nuclear energy, our number is 1-800-989-8255. Also you can tweet us @scifri, @-S-C-I-F-R-I, and also in Second Life, you can find us in Second Life at Science Friday island.  Let me now introduce my guests. Thomas Cochran is the director of the nuclear program at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington and the Wade Greene Chair for Nuclear Policy there. He joins us from NPR's Washington bureau. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Dr. THOMAS COCHRAN (Nuclear Physicist Senior Scientist, Nuclear Program; Wade Greene Chair for Nuclear Policy, Natural Resources Defense Council): Thank you.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Ernest Moniz is the former undersecretary for the Department of Energy. He's also professor of physics and engineering systems and director of the Energy Initiative at MIT in Cambridge. He joins us over the phone. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Moniz.  Dr. ERNEST MONIZ (Former Undersecretary, Department of Energy; Director, Professor of Physics and Engineering Systems, Energy Initiative, Massachusetts Institute of Technology): Thank you, Ira, it's a pleasure.  FLATOW: Stewart Brand is the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog. He's also president of the Long Now Foundation and co-founder of the Global Business Network in Sausalito, California. He joins us today by phone. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Mr. STEWART BRAND (President, Long Now Foundation; Co-founder, Global Business Network): Greetings to you.  FLATOW: Let me ask you, let me react, get your reactions to the clip that I played there from John Holdren. Dr. Moniz, from what Holdren was saying, it sounds like we need more and more and more research into all these things, and we have no real solutions on the table right now. Would that be a fair assessment?  Dr. MONIZ: Well, I think I would be a bit cautious on the statement of no solutions, but John Holdren, I think, was right on in talking about the significant challenge we face in addressing climate-change risks, and I would agree with him that we will need multiple technologies that avoid carbon emissions, and I think nuclear power will almost certainly have to be one of those, along with renewables in particular and perhaps carbon sequestration, if we are to achieve stringent, low CO2 emissions goals.  FLATOW: Is it your view, and I'll ask all of you, gentlemen, is it your views that nuclear energy, nuclear power plants, are an end unto themselves, or are they just stopgap measures to combat global warming until other renewable, maybe greener, energy sources, perhaps even fusion that we were talking about before, comes online?  Dr. MONIZ: Well, I think it's - it would be presumptuous to talk about what will be the technology mix, you know, many decades down the road. The fact is that if we are going to be serious about the kinds of greenhouse gas targets we talk about, we need to get our ship, the ship being the energy business, turning right now.  And over the next two to three decades, I certainly believe that nuclear power, as I said, must be a part of that mix with the other technologies. 2050 and beyond, well, we can all hope for major breakthroughs.  FLATOW: Stewart Brand, did you always believe in nuclear energy?  Mr. BRAND: No, I flipped on it, and I can say a little bit about that, but to your question about whether nuclear is stopgap, I think it's - that's unknown. It's unknown because one, it's already pretty good. Twenty percent of the U. S. energy comes from nuclear, 16 percent of the world gets it from there. And we'll talk about the various ways it looks to be getting better.  The question is, what do you do for base load power, for power that's always on? And so far, solar and wind can't do that. Until we get a way to really do storage, those guys are going to be a partial solution at best.  If we get solar coming down from space, where it's always on, then it's base load power, but it's really expensive to get there unless we start mining asteroids, which could happen.  So it looks to me like we're stuck with nuclear as the best no-to-low carbon source of base load power for some decades to come.  FLATOW: Tom, do you agree we're stuck with nuclear?  Dr. COCHRAN: Well, I don't think you framed the debate properly. The issue is not whether one is for or against nuclear power. The issue at hand is whether one is for additional federal subsidies to construct new nuclear plants in the United States, and you find a situation where all of the major environmental organizations, their highest priority is federal legislation that will cap carbon emissions, and this happens to be the single policy that would do the nuclear industry the most good because it would change the underlying economic comparison between nuclear and fossil fuels.  So the real issue here, again, is whether we should be using federal money to subsidize the construction of new nuclear plants, or should we use the more economically efficient way to attack the climate mitigation, and that is to cap carbon and let these various technologies compete. And nuclear's problem is, with regard to new plants, they're uneconomical today, and the unit cost is so large that the energy generating companies and utilities cannot readily, privately finance them, and so\u2026  FLATOW: What are the\u2026  Dr. COCHRAN: So those companies that are interested in nuclear are coming to the federal government to get the government to pay a substantial part of the cost of a new plant and to subsidize the risk associated with financing, through loan guarantees.  Mr. BRAND: That seems like a kind of a way-around-the-horn argument. I mean, it's like saying we disapprove of France getting 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear because, you know, they didn't do it in exactly the same market way we do, and should we ask them to shut down their plants because they did it wrong?  Dr. COCHRAN: That's not the issue. Nuclear is here. We have 104 plants operating in the United States. They operate very efficiently, at over 90 percent capacity factor. There are 435 plants worldwide. There's something like 44 plants under construction worldwide. Nuclear is part of the mix.  That is not the issue, at least from a federal policy standpoint. The issue, at least in this town, in Washington, D. C. , is whether the federal government ought to be subsidizing the construction of new nuclear power plants, rather than fixing the climate issue through a cap and trade legislation, such as the Waxman-Markey Bill, and then let nuclear compete.  Dr. MONIZ: If I could add to that, Ira.  FLATOW: Sure.  Dr. MONIZ: First of all, I certainly agree with Tom that what we would really like to see, assuming, of course, CO2 is our focus, I might add that we do have other policy objectives, as well, such as energy security, etcetera, but let's just stay with CO2.  Then there's no question that a real legislated cap on CO2 would be the most effective approach and the most effective policy, and the marketplace should indeed sort out the options. However, the reality is while we see encouraging progress today with, for example, the Waxman-Markey Bill, certainly, President Obama's strong support for climate legislation, I don't think anyone seriously believes that we are going to be at a place where our legislation has a clean, serious cap on CO2 for quite some years.  We don't have time to waste to demonstrate the options for the marketplace, let's say 10 years from now. In that context, we have had supported federal incentives not only for nuclear but for all carbon-free technologies. We are not, for example, seriously pursuing and demonstrating carbon sequestration. We do have a number of incentives. . .  Mr. BRAND: Think it will work, either way?  Dr. MONIZ: I think it will work at some level. Whether or not it can be a long pole of the tent, I think remains very, very open. We are supporting, particularly, the introduction of wind and solar. And with nuclear, we have untested licensing procedures, we have new evolutionary plants. What we advocated and is - and what is in law, in fact, in 2005, is for so-called first mover plants.  One can argue whether that's five or 10 plants, we believe there is a public good in support for having the industry move out and build a relatively small number of plants so that they and we and investors can all understand what the new generation of nuclear plant built in the United States will cost, how will the licensing go, how it would operate, and then let the marketplace decide as the carbon legislation is put in place.  FLATOW: What about the problem about the Yucca Mountain situation where the - waste storage of the waste - the nuclear waste here. Have we now decided that it's best to keep them at the nuclear sites rather than to create a central repository like at Yucca Mountain?  Mr. BRAND: They're pretty safe there. The dry cast storage, you know, these things are out back of the parking lot. They've been there for a number of years. It was the interim solution while Yucca kept being argued about, apparently indefinitely. And we're realizing that the interim solution is a pretty good one.  FLATOW: Tom, do you agree?  Mr. COCHRAN: Well, it's an interim solution. You can safely store the spent nuclear fuel in dry cast at the reactor sites as long as the utilities and energy companies are there to manage the cast. They don't represent a significant risk in my judgment.  There is a long-term problem, though, in that this spent fuel has a toxicity that will last for tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years. . .  Mr. BRAND: But it goes down fast.  Mr. COCHRAN: . . . long beyond the lifetime of the social institutions that we're living under today. And so, we have, as a society, an obligation to move this material into safe storage.  It's an intergenerational risk problem. We have intergenerational risk associated with other energy technologies. This happens to be the one with - most prevalent with nuclear technology. So I think we can safely store the spent fuel at the sites. We should get on with identifying new geologic repository alternatives so that we can move this material underground as soon as possible.  FLATOW: All right. Let me just - I need to interrupt and tell everybody that this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  Mr. BRAND: I have a question for Tom.  FLATOW: Go ahead.  Mr. BRAND: What do you think of the WIPP, the site, the underground salt area in New Mexico where we've been putting nuclear waste for 10 years now? And should that be, maybe, what we do instead of Yucca Mountain?  Mr. COCHRAN: Well, I would say salt deposit near the WIPP facility should be one of the candidates, should - that we should examine in this second round effort to identify suitable repository sites. The WIPP site itself, you're going to run into political problems in trying to change the license of that particular site. But. . .  Mr. BRAND: Well, the licenses for military waste now is just - all you have to do is add civilian waste.  Mr. COCHRAN: Well, it's not quite that simple. But the salt deposit is a reasonable alternative that ought to be considered for the next repository.  Dr. MONIZ: Could I add, Ira, that first of all, I think it's important to reinforce the point, which I think Tom and Stewart have both agreed upon, and I do as well, that is in effect.  We have no - there's no technical, no science or technical reason that drives us to precipitous action in managing the spent fuel. Dry cast storage can be carried on, I would say, at least for a century scale, in fact, if one chooses to do so relatively economically.  However, even there, I would just at least voice a preference for not having the spent fuel distributed at 80 some sites, but to at least consolidate that under federal control at a small number of up sites for what is called interim storage. I prefer to call it managed storage.  And one reason is, I think Tom began to allude to this. For one thing, we have a number of shutdown reactors. We like to move it away. Secondly, and I'm quite aware of this, given my service at the Department of Energy in 1998, the government does have a responsibility to begin moving the fuel and is in fact accruing financial liabilities. I would rather see the spent fuel moved to a few locations under federal control.  For the longer term, the allusion to alternative geologies is perfectly correct. And salt is certainly one possible attractive medium. But I might add, we don't pay enough attention to the fact that there are rather successful repository programs going on, for example, in Scandinavia, in Sweden with granite, in France with clay. There are a variety of geologies that look very, very attractive. I will be honest. I don't think volcanic tuff is the most attractive. . .  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. MONIZ: . . . of geologies. So we have options and we should just - we should take our time to do it and move forward.  FLATOW: All right. We have to take our time to have a break now. So I'll ask you all to sit tight. We're going to take a short break and come back and talk lots more about the future of nuclear energy and nuclear power. We'll talk a little bit about, maybe, what new reactors might look like and how much it will cost. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this break.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking this hour about the future of nuclear power here in the U. S. with my guests, Thomas Cochran, director of the nuclear program at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington. Ernest Moniz, who is former undersecretary for the Department of Energy. Stewart Brand, founder of the Whole Earth catalog and also president of the Long Now Foundation and co-founder of the Global Business Network in Sausalito.  Our number, 1-800-989-8255.  Professor Moniz, I'm looking at a report called \"The Update of the MIT 2003 Future of Nuclear Power,\" a report that you helped write. And one of the striking things about the report, it talks about the escalating cost of nuclear power, how the cost since that report in 2003 for overnight, what are called overnight costs, have doubled in those, what, five years or some - since the original. Is nuclear power - could it not survive, as Tom Cochran seems to be intimating, if it were not subsidized?  Dr. MONIZ: Well, first of all, we should stress as the table in our report shows, that of course, the cost for everything has gone up dramatically in those six years. Similarly, the capital cost for coal nearly doubled, or for gas, it nearly doubled. So that's just a broad phenomenon.  Mr. BRAND: Also (unintelligible), I would assume.  Dr. MONIZ: It does impact nuclear more strongly in the sense that it is the most capital intensive of the options. So here, a major issue is the nature of the financing for any of these plants. And what our table shows is that the levelized cost of electricity for nuclear, coal or gas, all, any of the options, of those three options, frankly are very, very comparable if they all have comparable financing.  This does go back to the issue, the little debate we had with Tom, in terms of the incentives for all of these technologies, but nuclear in particular, in the near term. We need to establish the costs of building these plants in order to provide some confidence to the investment sector. That for example. . .  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. MONIZ: . . . the investment can be made with, let say, no more risk than that for, let say, a new coal plant or a new other kind of plant.  FLATOW: And what would the life expectancy of these plants be?  Dr. MONIZ: Well, nuclear plants today are now more than half of the - or no, roughly half of the plants have now been licensed for 60 years. So I think one should assume that a new nuclear plant would also be 60 years, possibly even longer.  FLATOW: The reason I ask is because I was at - not too long ago, at an MIT symposium on nuclear energy with experts there who were saying that there - if we were to build all these nuclear power plants, and let's use 1,000 that you use in your report, there's not enough uranium in the world to last 100 years to supply the uranium for these plants.  Dr. MONIZ: I. . .  FLATOW: Would you agree with that?  Dr. MONIZ: No, not at all, and our report said so. Since our original report, in six years, the estimates of uranium availability have, if anything, grown dramatically, we believe that\u2026  FLATOW: But there has been no\u2026  Dr. MONIZ: . . . uranium resources is not a constraint for this century.  FLATOW: But there's no - you also say there that no such program has been initiated to actually take a census of how much uranium there is.  Dr. MONIZ: Correct. We've advocated a very systematic program supported by DOE to do that. But as we get in data from various companies, mining companies, and as we make the usual kinds of extrapolations for natural resources at a reasonable cost, the amount that is now acknowledged in the international database would support just about a growth to, let's say, 1,000 reactors and lifetime supply for those reactors. Frankly, in my gut, I think there would be many, many more if the demand - much more if the demand were there.  Mr. COCHRAN: Ira\u2026  FLATOW: Well, let me. . .  Mr. BRAND: There's (unintelligible) discovery going on for uranium now. . .  Mr. COCHRAN: Well, I'm not sure I'm connected anymore\u2026  FLATOW: Tom, you're there. Are you there, Tom Cochran?  Mr. COCHRAN: Ira. . .  FLATOW: Yes, go ahead.  Mr. COCHRAN: One thing, most nuclear engineers forget or don't realize is that the rate of - as uranium is mined, the efficiency of extraction outpaces the depletion of the resource. This is true of virtually every major mineral.  Dr. MONIZ: That's a nice way to put it.  Mr. COCHRAN: Therefore, as the demand goes up, the price in constant dollars, corrected for inflation, will stay flat or go down. And you can look at the history of minerals and see that. And so, you should not anticipate that the prices of uranium, over the long haul, there'll be price fluctuations due to short-term market imperfections. But over the long haul, the prices will stay flat or come down.  Similarly, uranium enrichment, there's large room for improving the efficiency of enriching uranium, the enrichment work. And so the price of enrichment will not go up substantially in constant dollars. And therefore, fuel costs for nuclear power plants are not anticipated to increase over the long haul. The real issue is the capital costs of the new plants. And if we could come back to that issue, the issue today is whether the federal government ought to be providing these additional subsidies.  Now, Ernie mentioned the need for first mover plants in the 2005 Energy Policy Act that was about several billion dollars worth of subsidies to build a few new nuclear plants. There are actually plants that will probably be built in the southeast, such as in Florida or South Carolina or Georgia, that are in regulated utilities. And the public utility commissions have given these utilities permission to get the return - the cost of construction in the rate base while the plants are being constructed.  So we don't even need federal dollars in - to build these new plants and to meet the concerns that Ernie Moniz has. We can find out what these costs and what the financial impacts of the\u2026  FLATOW: Tom, why are you so concerned about federal underwriting?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. COCHRAN: Well, what - I just really, in my gut, object to having people in states that don't use nuclear power plants or - be taxed so that people in other states can use their money to pay for their electricity. You have a situation you've created under the 2005 Energy Act where we are about - if we subsidize the construction of the Calvert Cliffs three plant in Maryland, that plant, it was 50 percent owned by Electricite de France, which is - the major stockholder is the French government.  So we're about to tax people in Montana, Colorado and so forth to subsidize the French government so Electricite de France can get a toehold into the electricity market in Maryland and sell electricity to people here in Washington D. C. and Baltimore at below what the cost would be otherwise, and thereby encourage people not to do things like use energy more efficiently and so forth.  Mr. BRAND: Are you tracking a new microreactor (unintelligible). reactors?  Mr. COCHRAN: The proper way to deal with the climate issue is to cap the carbon emissions and let these technologies compete. Nuclear's had $100 billion more with the subsidies over its lifetime. It's a 50-year-old mature industry, and we shouldn't have the federal government continue to subsidize it just because the nuclear industry has effective lobbyists on K Street.  FLATOW: All right, Tom, let me interrupt. Stewart Brand, you were going to ask about these microreactors?  Mr. BRAND: Yeah. Tom, I wonder if you're tracking on and Professor Moniz. Microreactor designs are coming out fast. These are down 25-megawatt, 35-megawatt, 50-megawatt level. They cost about $1 million a megawatt. They are quick to build. They're - they look like a whole different animal than the big 1. 2, 1. 6 gigawatt reactors. Is that your view?  FLATOW: Dr. Moniz?  Mr. COCHRAN: Certainly, the Russians are taking what's in effect submarine reactors or reactors for icebreakers. And are putting them on a barge and are going to try to provide power to remote regions with these small reactors. Whether these small reactors are - would be competitive in the United States is a whole different issue.  I sort of doubt it. The trend has been, over the years, to build larger and larger and larger reactors to try to benefit from some economies of scale. And I just think it's unlikely that going back to a very small reactor would be economical in the United States.  Mr. BRAND: But their company (unintelligible)\u2026  Mr. COCHRAN: But let them have it, you know?  Mr. BRAND: \u2026(unintelligible) orders already.  Mr. COCHRAN: If people want to risk their money and try to license one of these and sell it, go for it.  FLATOW: What was that, Stewart?  Mr. BRAND: Just to gather the - one of the companies, Hyperion, in New Mexico working with the Los Alamos design, they claim they have a bunch of firm orders. So they're getting traffic.  FLATOW: In the few minutes, we're having left - we have left, Dr. Moniz, what are the - what would newer reactors look like - be different than the ones we have now?  Dr. MONIZ: Well, first of all, I think that the light water reactor that is the, you know, the backbone of the global nuclear feat today will remain a very, very important technology throughout this century, frankly. However, I think on the horizon, potentially, are high temperature gas reactors, which could be very interesting. We have some historical experience with that, didn't go very well, although the problems were not with the reactor per se, to be honest.  These are attractive reactors in the sense that they are more efficient, they operate at higher temperature. And indeed, they might even have uses other than electricity using high quality heat.  But the real issue right now is we need to - there is a federal program moving forward to try to demonstrate a modern high temperature gas reactor. These, by the way, are also - they're not microreactors, but they typically would have a scale in the 100 to 300 megawatts versus the thousand or 1,400 megawatts of light water reactors. And at that scale, they may have an interesting niche in the power market.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. We're talking about (unintelligible) reactors\u2026  Mr. BRAND: \u2026(unintelligible) and generating hydrogen and stuff like that with that temperature range.  FLATOW: Hang on. Hang on. Hang on, Stewart. I got to give a station break. We're talking about SCIENCE FRIDAY - we're talking about nuclear reactors on SCIENCE FRIDAY at this hour from NPR News.  Okay. I've got - just about one minute or so left. Are we all talking that these reactors will be safer or as safe, or safer than the ones we have today? No one has argued - or is worrying about the safety of these, correct?  Mr. BRAND: Correct.  Dr. MONIZ: Well, the - I mean, by observation, at least, in the last years, we've had extraordinary performance from the fleet. We have had glitches. There was a problem in Ohio plant. It was caught in time, but it was a glaring problem.  But overall, these plants have operated -more than 90 percent of the time, they've operated well.  The net - the high temperature gas reactors I just alluded to, have some additional attractions in terms of what are called passive safety features. So I would say the safety rating of reactors has gone up by about a factor of 10 over the last several decades.  FLATOW: Tom Cochran, you agree?  Mr. COCHRAN: Well, the most important factor affecting the safety of a nuclear plant is the safety culture at the plant.  FLATOW: The people.  Mr. COCHRAN: The safety culture at U. S. plants has improved over the years, but overseas there's still countries where the safety culture is poor or, in the case of China, untested. And so, since most of the reactors that will be operating over the next 30 years are reactors that are currently operating, I think you should look at - toward foreign reactors in terms of the risk associated with a catastrophic nuclear accident or meltdown.  FLATOW: All right, gentlemen, I ran out of time. We will pick this up again because it is - it's going to be an evolving issue. I'm\u2026  Mr. BRAND: No kidding.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Yeah. Glad you took time to be with us today.

I'm Terry Gross. More than any other part of our body, the face defines our identity. It expresses emotion and has the gateways to taste, sight, smell and hearing. I guess that's why the idea of a facial transplant still seems so shocking. In late 2008, my guest, Dr. Maria Siemionow, led the team at Cleveland Clinic that performed the first near-total face transplant in the U. S. The patient was Connie Culp. Her husband had shot her in the face with a shotgun. The transplant was performed four years after the hospital's institutional review board announced that it considered a face transplant to be both ethical and possible. Dr. Siemionow grew up in Poland and first came to the U. S. for a fellowship in hand surgery at the Institute for Hand and Microsurgery in Louisville, Kentucky. She's now Cleveland Clinic's director of plastic surgery research and the head of microsurgery training. She's written a new memoir called \"Face to Face. \" Dr. Siemionow, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's talk about some of the reasons a facial transplant is so complicated, and let's start with one of the reasons why you have to do a facial transplant in the first place, as opposed to just taking skin grafts from the person's body. I was amazed reading your book that there's so much facial tissue that you wouldn't have enough skin to graft on your body. Just give us a sense of the amount of tissue that's involved in a facial transplant. Dr. MARIA SIEMIONOW (Author, \"Face to Face: My Quest to Perform the First Full Face Transplant\"): Yes. When you want to cover a face with one perfect sheath of the skin, you really do not have enough of skin in your body which is pliable, which has the same texture, the same color and also has a vascular supply, meaning that it's really having a normal life, like tissue in your other parts of the body. And for this reason, quite often you can see that the patients who are victims of the burn and trauma injuries have a kind of a patchwork of skin of different colors on their face, because some of the grafts taken from your own body are taken from different parts of the body. So you can have a piece of the skin taken from the thigh. You can have a piece of the skin taken from your back or from your buttocks. So as an effect, it gives an artificial, not natural, look on the face. GROSS: Now in the book, you talk about the complexity of motion that's allowed by the muscles and tissues of the face. Can you just give us a very brief tour of the face so that we can follow along on our own faces as we listen? And that'll also give us a sense of how complex a procedure a facial transplant is. Dr. SIEMIONOW: Well, if you go from the front of your face, starting with the forehead, and then like you are washing, actually, your face every morning, you can feel exactly that you go through the surfaces which are totally plain, like a forehead. Then you go to your eyelids, which are a little hollow, where your eyes are covered. Then you go over nose, which is again raised and has its own prominence. Then you go down to your lips, which have a very different type of prominence and different texture, and then you go down to your chin, which is again, a little more prominent and standing out. Then imagine the patients who are now missing at least one component, such as nose. So when they wash their face in the morning, they are just not only going through the hollow of their ears or the hollow of their eyes, but then they have a hollow where we all have a prominence, such as nose, and that's what is probably very disturbing on daily basis because quite often for some of the patients who do not have nose, they even cannot take a shower in the morning because the water will not allow them to take a shower. It would go down to the throat. GROSS: One of the things you have to do in a face transplant is remove the face from the body of the donor. So what are you removing when you remove their face? Obviously the skin, but what else besides the skin are you taking? Dr. SIEMIONOW: This will very much depend on the patient who is the recipient of the transplant, and this will vary from patient to patient, depending on what kind of trauma they have which caused them to be disfigured and have this functional disability. In the situation of our patient, we were removing not only the coverage, which is the facial skin, but also the three-dimensional functional units, including bones, the bones of the nose, the lower eyelids, the upper bones of the upper jaw, also sinuses, hard palate, as well as upper lip. So as you can imagine, it is a very, very complex, 80 percent of face of the donor was removed in order to cover the very deep defect of our patient. GROSS: So, was the donor's face removed in one piece, or did you have, like, several different sections and pieces? Dr. SIEMIONOW: No, that was in one piece, and we have prepared as a team to this type of live transplantation by a series of what we call mock transplantations in anatomy lab, where as a team, we're meeting on weekends, and we were mimicking the transplant which we would perform on our patient. And this was based on a three-dimensional CT scan of our patient's defect. So we knew exactly what we are doing. As a team of eight surgeons, we were working almost the same as on the day of surgery, a real transplant. We were working in anatomy on two operating tables and were just creating the defect on one potential patient and then transferring the transplant from another anatomy lab cadaver. So this was a very long preparation to the surgery. So we haven't done it just without thinking about every detail, anatomical detail - what kind of arteries, what kind of veins, what kind of nerves we need, also about complexity of the bones and to be sure, as you rightly ask, that they have to be taken in one piece which is intact. GROSS: So I'd like you to describe the face of the facial transplant recipient, who was a victim of a gunshot wound. She was shot in the face by her husband. So what was her face by the time you were doing the face transplant? And I should back up and say, I think you or another team of surgeons had performed several facial reconstruction - reconstructive surgeries, but it still wasn't sufficient to give her a real face. Dr. SIEMIONOW: Yes, she was missing major functions - of possibility of breathing through the nose, because she did not have a nose. She was lacking an upper lip, and she was also missing lower eyelids, and most of her skin was either scarred or damaged on about 80 percent of her face. So what we have to replace was the entire nose, with nasal passages, sinuses, also upper lip, lower eyelids and the hard palate, which was missing. GROSS: And since she only had a hole where her nose was, she was breathing through a surgically created hole in her trachea. Dr. SIEMIONOW: Yes, she wore a tracheotomy tube. So she was breathing through the tube. GROSS: So did you have to find a donor whose facial proportions kind of matched the recipient's facial proportions so that the eyelids would fall in the right place, and the nose would fall proportionately in the right place? Dr. SIEMIONOW: This really - if would be looking into the matching, could be difficult. We were really lucky that the donor was really matching our patient's features. So that was light complexion of the skin, similar width and length of the skeleton, as well as the fact of course that she was a female because that's very important that the donor can be matched for the gender and for the complexion of the skin and for the race. So this was the first donor which signed - donor family signed consent for the donation of the face, and really amazingly, I must say, we were so lucky that we couldn't believe that the difference in the color of our patient's, for example, forehead, and her own chin, which was left, was exactly matching the color of the donor. So even today, it's very difficult, except that there is a little bit of scar tissue, which is not very visible, to recognize which color is coming from the donor, which part of the face is hers. GROSS: Well, the transplant surgery took over 20 hours. One of the things you had to do was take the blood vessels from the donor's face and attach them to blood vessels in the recipient's body. You're working in this world of microsurgery. Would you give us some sense of what it takes to attach the small blood vessels of one face to another? Dr. SIEMIONOW: Well, if you think about, for example, the fact that artery under magnification of the microscope has a hollow appearance, which is a little flat because of the fact that there's no blood flowing through it when you do that, and it's white. It's kind of without appearance of blood in it. So it looks really like spaghetti which got flattened out, and then you are just connecting this spaghetti from one end to another end, and you are trying to reconstruct the hollow structure and three-dimensional structure of this artery, and once you are done, and you are actually using very small sutures. The needle is small, the thread is very small, and if you compare them, for example, the thread is about 40 microns in diameter, which reminds the size of the human hair. So you can imagine that you are putting the stitches with something as thin as a human hair, under magnification of 20 times, and you are just looking through the loupes, and you are concentrated on what you do, and after, for example, 40, 50 minutes of reconstructing this spaghetti to the hollow element, which at some point becomes pink when you take the clamps off, and you see that the blood is going through this new reconstructed artery, and it's actually not leaking, and it's starting to pulsate, and you almost hear in your ears, boom, boom, boom, boom, and you know it's working. GROSS: In order to get a facial transplant, you have to take immune-suppressive drugs for the rest of your life unless something better comes along, but otherwise your body will reject this transplant. So what are the long-term effects of taking immune-suppressive drugs, I mean, in addition to leaving you vulnerable to a lot of disease? Do they shorten your life? Are they likely to wipe years off your life? Dr. SIEMIONOW: Potentially. The difference between the transplant patients of the solid organs and our patient of what is known as composite grafts, and faces an example of composite graft, is the fact that these are usually healthy patients. So to start with, they do not have, like renal failure for the kidney transplant patients, which are usually very sick patients. But the side effects are the same, and that's a very important question, Terry, because we have presented to our patient all the risks and benefits, and we have outlined what may happen. We have presented the risk of developing diabetes, of potential kidney failure in years to come, but we are hoping with a healthy patient to start, with our protocol of minimal immuno-suppression, trying to wean off patient from immuno-suppression, we at least will be able to help her to go through many years without major side effects. But these are really significant factors to consider when you present to the patient the risk and benefits of face transplantation. GROSS: My guest is Dr. Maria Siemionow. In late 2008, she led the team that performed the first near-total face transplant in the U. S. She's the director of plastic surgery research and head of the microsurgical training unit at the Cleveland Clinic's Department of Plastic Surgery. She's written a new book called \"Face to Face: My Quest to Perform the First Full Face Transplant. \" We'll take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (Soundbite of music) GROSS: My guest is Dr. Maria Siemionow, and she led the team that performed the first face transplant in the United States. This was in December of 2008, and she's at the Cleveland Clinic where she's the director of plastic surgery research. How was Connie Culp chosen to be the first recipient in America of a facial transplant? Dr. SIEMIONOW: Well, she was fulfilling many of the requirements as per our institutional review board, IRB protocol, which the first one was that from the very beginning, were considering as potential candidates only patients who have exhausted all potential convention means of reconstruction. The second was that the patient has to be psychologically stable, and she was evaluated and was found to be in good spirits and very eager to go through the procedure. The third was also ethical evaluation, that the patient was evaluated by our ethics experts to understand that she would be a first patient, and it bears a lot of ethical issues as well as the fact that she is a research patient, and understanding what does it mean that she's a research subject - meaning that we cannot tell her exactly will be the outcome because not many patients like that were done worldwide, that she would be, in a way, example for others to follow up how her face transplant over time will be doing, how she will be doing as a patient, how she will be integrated into society. The next important part was to find out the social and family support, who will be supporting her - not only before transplant but also after transplant, and all these things were prerequisites of considering her as a potential candidate. GROSS: How is Connie Culp now? She was the first recipient of a facial transplant. You led the team that performed the surgery. So what does her face look like now? Dr. SIEMIONOW: Well, her face looks like a normal human face, which is very important. You know, she has a beautiful nose, actually. She has a little, maybe too much, on the sides of her skin, and that was taken purposely, and we will remove the part on the side of just only her skin, which was used also for biopsies to monitor her rejection. But really, if you think and you see her on the street, and you don't know her just from the media and recognize her as a face transplant patient, then she's now going back to her grocery stores in her community. She was walking her dog. She's exercising. She's just back to her normal life. GROSS: And does she look anything like the donor looked? Is Connie's face similar to her donor's face? Dr. SIEMIONOW: No it's not, and this is a good question because quite often, the question was posed, you know, how much of the donor look, and how much of the recipient look will the face transplant patient have, and since we are adjusting the bones, and we are adjusting the width and depth to her own skeleton, she still has her own face reconstructed. And I would say of course you can, on the computer models, when colleagues and ourselves were evaluating the potential of how the recipient will look like a donor and vice versa. And also in anatomy lab we were just doing kind of mock cadaver studies, looking at the different sizes of skeletons, we found that most of the simulated transplants look as kind of a mixture between themselves and the donor. GROSS: How often do you see Connie Culp now? Dr. SIEMIONOW: Well, we are at this point seeing her even on a weekly basis right now. And as long as she will be doing fine - in the beginning, we are a little more careful in evaluating her more often, but we are for the first year thinking about just having a monthly schedule. So if everything goes well, and there are no signs of kind of a rejection or suspicion, which we have not so far seen, once-a-month visit for not only myself but team members, as well as psychology, psychiatry, social worker and having her blood drawn and looking at all possible needed during the follow-up visits of, for example, functional re-education, physical therapy. So that will be a checklist of things which we want to be sure we are pretty closely monitoring. GROSS: I wonder if you see faces differently than you used to now that you've done a face transplant. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. SIEMIONOW: Probably I do, and you know, sometimes I look at all these beauty shows, you know, and shows where they are showing like a total makeover - not that I look at them every day - but this is something which I always wonder if people are not really exaggerating with changes of quite often beautiful faces, even what is now like more beautiful because you need a little bigger lips, or you need a little, you know, more narrow nose or something like that - I think we should be happy with what we are if we have just normal-looking human faces. GROSS: Dr. Siemionow, thank you so much for talking with us. Dr. SIEMIONOW: Well thank you. It was a great pleasure. Thank you for invitation.

So you can imagine that you are putting the stitches with something as thin as a human hair, under magnification of 20 times, and you are just looking through the loupes, and you are concentrated on what you do, and after, for example, 40, 50 minutes of reconstructing this spaghetti to the hollow element, which at some point becomes pink when you take the clamps off, and you see that the blood is going through this new reconstructed artery, and it's actually not leaking, and it's starting to pulsate, and you almost hear in your ears, boom, boom, boom, boom, and you know it's working.  GROSS: In order to get a facial transplant, you have to take immune-suppressive drugs for the rest of your life unless something better comes along, but otherwise your body will reject this transplant. So what are the long-term effects of taking immune-suppressive drugs, I mean, in addition to leaving you vulnerable to a lot of disease? Do they shorten your life? Are they likely to wipe years off your life?  Dr. SIEMIONOW: Potentially. The difference between the transplant patients of the solid organs and our patient of what is known as composite grafts, and faces an example of composite graft, is the fact that these are usually healthy patients.  So to start with, they do not have, like renal failure for the kidney transplant patients, which are usually very sick patients. But the side effects are the same, and that's a very important question, Terry, because we have presented to our patient all the risks and benefits, and we have outlined what may happen.  We have presented the risk of developing diabetes, of potential kidney failure in years to come, but we are hoping with a healthy patient to start, with our protocol of minimal immuno-suppression, trying to wean off patient from immuno-suppression, we at least will be able to help her to go through many years without major side effects. But these are really significant factors to consider when you present to the patient the risk and benefits of face transplantation.  GROSS: My guest is Dr. Maria Siemionow. In late 2008, she led the team that performed the first near-total face transplant in the U. S. She's the director of plastic surgery research and head of the microsurgical training unit at the Cleveland Clinic's Department of Plastic Surgery. She's written a new book called \"Face to Face: My Quest to Perform the First Full Face Transplant. \" We'll take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.  (Soundbite of music)  GROSS: My guest is Dr. Maria Siemionow, and she led the team that performed the first face transplant in the United States. This was in December of 2008, and she's at the Cleveland Clinic where she's the director of plastic surgery research.  How was Connie Culp chosen to be the first recipient in America of a facial transplant?  Dr. SIEMIONOW: Well, she was fulfilling many of the requirements as per our institutional review board, IRB protocol, which the first one was that from the very beginning, were considering as potential candidates only patients who have exhausted all potential convention means of reconstruction.  The second was that the patient has to be psychologically stable, and she was evaluated and was found to be in good spirits and very eager to go through the procedure.  The third was also ethical evaluation, that the patient was evaluated by our ethics experts to understand that she would be a first patient, and it bears a lot of ethical issues as well as the fact that she is a research patient, and understanding what does it mean that she's a research subject - meaning that we cannot tell her exactly will be the outcome because not many patients like that were done worldwide, that she would be, in a way, example for others to follow up how her face transplant over time will be doing, how she will be doing as a patient, how she will be integrated into society.  The next important part was to find out the social and family support, who will be supporting her - not only before transplant but also after transplant, and all these things were prerequisites of considering her as a potential candidate.  GROSS: How is Connie Culp now? She was the first recipient of a facial transplant. You led the team that performed the surgery. So what does her face look like now?  Dr. SIEMIONOW: Well, her face looks like a normal human face, which is very important. You know, she has a beautiful nose, actually. She has a little, maybe too much, on the sides of her skin, and that was taken purposely, and we will remove the part on the side of just only her skin, which was used also for biopsies to monitor her rejection.  But really, if you think and you see her on the street, and you don't know her just from the media and recognize her as a face transplant patient, then she's now going back to her grocery stores in her community. She was walking her dog. She's exercising. She's just back to her normal life.  GROSS: And does she look anything like the donor looked? Is Connie's face similar to her donor's face?  Dr. SIEMIONOW: No it's not, and this is a good question because quite often, the question was posed, you know, how much of the donor look, and how much of the recipient look will the face transplant patient have, and since we are adjusting the bones, and we are adjusting the width and depth to her own skeleton, she still has her own face reconstructed.  And I would say of course you can, on the computer models, when colleagues and ourselves were evaluating the potential of how the recipient will look like a donor and vice versa. And also in anatomy lab we were just doing kind of mock cadaver studies, looking at the different sizes of skeletons, we found that most of the simulated transplants look as kind of a mixture between themselves and the donor.  GROSS: How often do you see Connie Culp now?  Dr. SIEMIONOW: Well, we are at this point seeing her even on a weekly basis right now. And as long as she will be doing fine - in the beginning, we are a little more careful in evaluating her more often, but we are for the first year thinking about just having a monthly schedule.  So if everything goes well, and there are no signs of kind of a rejection or suspicion, which we have not so far seen, once-a-month visit for not only myself but team members, as well as psychology, psychiatry, social worker and having her blood drawn and looking at all possible needed during the follow-up visits of, for example, functional re-education, physical therapy. So that will be a checklist of things which we want to be sure we are pretty closely monitoring.  GROSS: I wonder if you see faces differently than you used to now that you've done a face transplant.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. SIEMIONOW: Probably I do, and you know, sometimes I look at all these beauty shows, you know, and shows where they are showing like a total makeover - not that I look at them every day - but this is something which I always wonder if people are not really exaggerating with changes of quite often beautiful faces, even what is now like more beautiful because you need a little bigger lips, or you need a little, you know, more narrow nose or something like that - I think we should be happy with what we are if we have just normal-looking human faces.  GROSS: Dr. Siemionow, thank you so much for talking with us.  Dr. SIEMIONOW: Well thank you. It was a great pleasure. Thank you for invitation.  GROSS: Dr. Maria Siemionow has written a new memoir called \"Face to Face. \" She's Cleveland Clinic's director of plastic surgery research and the head of microsurgery training.

Drum roll, please. (Soundbite of drum roll, cymbal crash) INSKEEP: Thank you very much. A computer professional in Norway has discovered a new Mersenne prime - what you and I might call a prime number. This discovery brings joy to prime number fans worldwide and brings a special satisfaction to NPR's Joe Palca. He'll tell you why. JOE PALCA: For those of you for whom basic math is a distant memory, we begin with a reminder. Primes are numbers that are divisible by only one and themselves. So, two is prime. So is three, five, seven and so on. 2003 was a prime year. So will be 2011. Mersenne primes have been called the jewels of number theory. They are a special class of prime, and they have a particular formula. I will now tell you the formula. And let me warn you: Only trained professionals should attempt to give mathematical formulas over the radio. Here goes. It is two raised to the nth power minus one, where n is itself a prime number and the result is prime. Ancient Greek mathematicians were the first to describe Mersenne primes. So far, only 46 have been discovered - or now, I should say 47, because there's a new one, and it's a whopper: nearly 13 million digits long. It was found as part of the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search, or GIMPS. GIMPS involves tens of thousands of computers churning away, looking for new Mersenne primes. Mathematician Chris Caldwell of the University of Tennessee Martin says finding Mersenne primes takes a lot of computing power. Professor CHRIS CALDWELL (Math, University of Tennessee Martin): Not only do you have to multiply a 13-million-digit number times a 13-million-digit number, you have to do that about 13 million times. That just takes a tremendous amount of computation. PALCA: When I first reported on the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search last April 10th, I exhorted NPR listeners to download the software and join the effort. The new Mersenne prime was discovered by someone who was already a prime hunter. Odd Magnar Strindmo from Melhus, Norway, has been part of GIMPS since it began in 1996. Now, finding a new Mersenne prime is exciting all by itself, but it's especially exciting because of a bet I made with George Woltman. He's the man who runs the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search. I bet the next one would be found before 2012, helped along by all those NPR listeners who I hoped would download the program. Woltman emailed me, saying he felt a little silly losing the bet so soon. But I have a confession to make: I meant the next largest Mersenne prime. The 47th Mersenne prime is actually 141,125 digits smaller than one that was discovered last year. So, I won on a technicality, and I'm willing to carry on the bet until the largest one is found. After all, we didn't bet any money, so I can afford to be magnanimous. Joe Palca, NPR News.

I'm Michele Norris. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Now a talk with the new commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Margaret Hamburg. Dr. Hamburg was health commissioner of New York City and most recently a senior scientist at the nonprofit Nuclear Threat Initiative. She takes over a federal agency that is widely described as demoralized. It's been faulted for missing a contaminated pet food ingredient from China and salmonella in peanut butter from Georgia, for approving some drugs too slowly, others too fast - an agency that's now being given new authority to regulate tobacco. Thank you very much for joining us. And with that agenda we can truly say thanks for finding some time to talk with us. Dr. MARGARET HAMBURG (Commissioner, Food and Drug Administration): Well, I'm very pleased to be here. Thank you. SIEGEL: Tobacco first, you're going to soon be regulating a toxic but still popular consumer good. How do you control it and reduce its use without creating a huge black market and illicit tobacco products? Dr. HAMBURG: Well, as you know, tobacco products represent a huge threat to the health of the public both in this country and around the world. And so we are delighted to have this opportunity to begin regulating this product. It's going to take the form of oversight of manufacturing and ability to really regulate critical ingredients that go into the production of tobacco. We're going to be working on issues of more appropriate labeling of tobacco products and, importantly, marketing of tobacco products and educating the public about the threats to health. SIEGEL: But as you said, it is a global product. Would you assume that the FDA will be restraining, say, U. S. tobacco manufacturers from exporting? Dr. HAMBURG: Well, our mandate is really to address what's in this new legislation in terms of regulation of tobacco products. As part of our work as a public health agency, as well as - as a regulatory agency, we are going to be working with international partners to reduce the burden of disease and death caused by tobacco products and actually just met earlier this morning with the director general at the World Health Organization, where we talked about a range of common concerns. Tobacco was one of those issues, along with H1N1, and pandemic flu and a number of other important issues. SIEGEL: In the case of the pet food ingredient from China that was sickening pets in U. S. , people said the FDA should be much more active in China, inspecting there, in the places where FDA-regulated foods and drugs originate. How many people does the FDA have in China? How many people should it have in China? Dr. HAMBURG: Well, let me just step back because I want to say that one of my priorities coming into this new role as FDA commissioner is to really move the agency into the 21st century and, importantly, including globalization. We are responsible for regulating products that come from hundreds of thousands of producers all around the globe. China is a major country where we have a presence now and we intend to use that as a platform to expand our activities working with the Chinese government, working with industries within China and, you know, I expect that when we talk in the future I'll be able to tell you a lot more about what we're doing. SIEGEL: I've read so many allusions to demoralization at the FDA. Is that something palpable to you? I mean, do you find it when you go to work right now? Dr. HAMBURG: Certainly there have been problems and there are morale issues. There is a sense of having been struggling against some considerable odds in terms of lack of resources and other concerns. But there's enormous excitement and enthusiasm, I think, to really roll up sleeves and address the critical challenges before us, both the new opportunities that tobacco regulation offers to FDA to really improve health in this country, also, the opportunities to strengthen food safety and extend our reach in that domain and the opportunities to leverage the advances in science and technology for new medical products. SIEGEL: But, well, you know, I understand that tobacco presents a great new opportunity. It's an odd mission to say you've been strapped, you've been underfunded, understaffed in doing the existing jobs, here, take on a huge new national public concern - do that one, too. Dr. HAMBURG: Well, you know, it is taking on a huge new challenge, but it is something that will make a real difference in the lives of Americans. And that is a huge motivator and the legislation was structured in such a way as to provide the resources that we'll need to do that job. SIEGEL: Well, Commissioner Margaret Hamburg of the Food and Drug Administration, thank you very much for talking with us. Dr. HAMBURG: Thank you.

I'm Robert Siegel. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. Ever since February, we've been following Sylvia Martinez for some close-up insight into how the recession is changing people's lives. Martinez was a human resources manager in Virginia, but she lost her job eight months ago. The last time we heard from her, she was in crisis. SIEGEL: In one day, she had been passed over for a new job, and there was a fire in her apartment building. Martinez was stuck in a motel, and she said she had little money left. She was continuing her job search throughout the night from the motel's business center, and a couple of weeks ago, one of those businesses called her and asked her to come in for an interview. Martinez agreed to let NPR's Alix Spiegel go with her. ALIX SPIEGEL: For the last eight months, Sylvia Martinez has worn the wardrobe of the unemployed. Every morning, she's paired bulky sweat pants with shapeless T-shirts and declared herself dressed. But not this day. Ms. SYLVIA MARTINEZ (Former Human Resources Manager): I had a reason to get out of bed today. I had a reason to put on a skirt and put on shoes, and I just hope that I'll be able to do this every day. SPIEGEL: All morning long, Martinez had been telling herself not to get carried away. She's had high hopes before, particularly with the last interview that didn't pan out. But considered her conversation with the hiring manager earlier in the week, it was just really hard to contain her excitement. Ms. MARTINEZ: We had a really good conversation on the phone. It was really positive. And she just sounded just as eager as I was to meet with me as I was to meet with her. So\u2026 SPIEGEL: This optimism was new to Martinez. It's safe to say that losing her job had been demoralizing - so demoralizing that Sylvia ended up doing something she never imagined she'd do: desperate one night, she swallowed a handful of pills. But recently, says Martinez, things seemed to be turning around. She'd gone on anti-depressants, and the pills lifted her mood and thankfully helped her, finally, to sleep. Ms. MARTINEZ: Though sleeping has gotten better for me. But last night was just a little hard, just because I kept thinking about the interview and what not to do. SPIEGEL: What not to do. This is a topic, Martinez says, she's spent a long time thinking about, and it's easy to summarize her conclusions. Ms. MARTINEZ: I don't want to seem desperate. I know that the last interview, I know that I seemed desperate. And although I am, by all means, but I don't want to seem that way. I don't want to come across to them that way. SPIEGEL: There is, though, one problem with this strategy. Sylvia's been desperate for so long, it's hard for her to remember what it feels like not to be desperate. It's incredibly ironic, she tells me. For 10 years, her job was to hire people. But now it's hard for her to remember anything about her former life, including how to behave in an interview. Ms. MARTINEZ: So yesterday, I found myself calling someone that I used to work with at the last company I worked for and, you know, just telling them, what was it that I asked you? You know, how was I? Just because I had forgotten that. SPIEGEL: After this reconnaissance mission, Sylvia says she came up with a mental checklist of things not to say. She was not going to explain, as she had in her last interview, that if they gave her a penny more than unemployment, she would gladly take the job, or talk in any way about the financial difficulties that woke her every morning at three. In fact, she says, she was not even going to mention being unemployed - even privately, to herself. Ms. MARTINEZ: I'm not even going to think about being unemployed at this point. SPIEGEL: You're blocking it out of your mind. Ms. MARTINEZ: I have to. I have to. (Soundbite of birds chirping) (Soundbite of car door opening, closing) SPIEGEL: It was with this stern optimism that Sylvia climbed into her Saturn Vue and set off for her interview. Okay, so this place is about 40 minutes away? Or\u2026 Ms. MARTINEZ: About 40. Yeah. SPIEGEL: Once she hit I-95, Sylvia seemed to relax. For her last job, Sylvia drove this road every morning. But unlike the rest of the commuters stuck in traffic in Northern Virginia, Sylvia actually liked it. It was her time by herself, she says, and now she's back in her element. She is someone with somewhere to go. But as we get closer, this ease wears off. Ms. MARTINEZ: I'm getting a little anxious now. I just hope that I say the right things. Oh, goodness, goodness, goodness, goodness, goodness, goodness. SPIEGEL: Sylvia finally pulls into an office park and parks in front of a building. She's 15 minutes early, so she sits silently for a while with her hands on the steering wheel. Ms. MARTINEZ: Now it's just a matter of just going in there. So wish me luck. (Soundbite of car door closing) SPIEGEL: Sylvia disappears into the building, a rectangle of brick and tinted glass. Thirty minutes later, she appears again. (Soundbite of car door opening) Ms. MARTINEZ: Hi. SPIEGEL: Hi. How did it go? Ms. MARTINEZ: It went well. SPIEGEL: As soon as she got into the car, it was clear from Sylvia's face that the interview hadn't gone as planned. It turns out that the job isn't just about being an office manager and hiring officer. Ms. MARTINEZ: I think they're looking for someone who has really strong accounting experience, which I don't. I did accounting in between bookkeepers, but accounting is not one of my strengths. As soon as they said strong accounting, I was like, oh\u2026 SPIEGEL: Sylvia says she was honest with them about her limitations, and the mood in the room cooled. They didn't even have a conversation about salary. Sitting in the car, her thoughts turned to her children: two 19-year-old twin girls and a son. Ms. MARTINEZ: I've always told my children how a college education is necessary. And they couldn't go in January because I was unemployed, and I have to get a job now so they can at least start going in August. How can I take that from them? I can't. I can't. SPIEGEL: Sylvia says she won't share the details of her interview with her children, and that probably, they won't even ask. Ms. MARTINEZ: Chances are that they'll just ask: How did it go? And I'll say fine, and I'll just leave it at that. SPIEGEL: They won't ask more? Ms. MARTINEZ: I don't think they will, just because the last interview was such a disappointment, for all of us, that I don't think they will. SPIEGEL: The unemployment rate is now around 9. 4 percent. Three hundred and forty-five thousand people lost their jobs in May. It was the highest rate in 26 years, but many news headlines emphasize the good news: The rate of job losses was slowing. Things were looking up. Sylvia wasn't aware of this silver lining. She says that recently, she's been mostly avoiding the news. Ms. MARTINEZ: I just read somewhere that - I forgot what company. It's a really big company, that they're about to lay off 5,000 people. That means there's 5,000 more people that are going to be in the same situation I'm in. That's horrible. SPIEGEL: She says she knows too well exactly what those people will go through. And Sylvia's own list of worries continues to grow. She has to reapply for unemployment at the end of June, and says that money for anti-depressants is running out. Alix Spiegel, NPR News, Washington.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  From NPR News, it's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel.  MICHELE NORRIS, host:  And I'm Michele Norris.  Ever since February, we've been following Sylvia Martinez for some close-up insight into how the recession is changing people's lives. Martinez was a human resources manager in Virginia, but she lost her job eight months ago. The last time we heard from her, she was in crisis.  SIEGEL: In one day, she had been passed over for a new job, and there was a fire in her apartment building. Martinez was stuck in a motel, and she said she had little money left. She was continuing her job search throughout the night from the motel's business center, and a couple of weeks ago, one of those businesses called her and asked her to come in for an interview. Martinez agreed to let NPR's Alix Spiegel go with her.  ALIX SPIEGEL: For the last eight months, Sylvia Martinez has worn the wardrobe of the unemployed. Every morning, she's paired bulky sweat pants with shapeless T-shirts and declared herself dressed. But not this day.  Ms. SYLVIA MARTINEZ (Former Human Resources Manager): I had a reason to get out of bed today. I had a reason to put on a skirt and put on shoes, and I just hope that I'll be able to do this every day.  SPIEGEL: All morning long, Martinez had been telling herself not to get carried away. She's had high hopes before, particularly with the last interview that didn't pan out. But considered her conversation with the hiring manager earlier in the week, it was just really hard to contain her excitement.  Ms. MARTINEZ: We had a really good conversation on the phone. It was really positive. And she just sounded just as eager as I was to meet with me as I was to meet with her. So\u2026  SPIEGEL: This optimism was new to Martinez. It's safe to say that losing her job had been demoralizing - so demoralizing that Sylvia ended up doing something she never imagined she'd do: desperate one night, she swallowed a handful of pills. But recently, says Martinez, things seemed to be turning around. She'd gone on anti-depressants, and the pills lifted her mood and thankfully helped her, finally, to sleep.  Ms. MARTINEZ: Though sleeping has gotten better for me. But last night was just a little hard, just because I kept thinking about the interview and what not to do.  SPIEGEL: What not to do. This is a topic, Martinez says, she's spent a long time thinking about, and it's easy to summarize her conclusions.  Ms. MARTINEZ: I don't want to seem desperate. I know that the last interview, I know that I seemed desperate. And although I am, by all means, but I don't want to seem that way. I don't want to come across to them that way.  SPIEGEL: There is, though, one problem with this strategy. Sylvia's been desperate for so long, it's hard for her to remember what it feels like not to be desperate. It's incredibly ironic, she tells me. For 10 years, her job was to hire people. But now it's hard for her to remember anything about her former life, including how to behave in an interview.  Ms. MARTINEZ: So yesterday, I found myself calling someone that I used to work with at the last company I worked for and, you know, just telling them, what was it that I asked you? You know, how was I? Just because I had forgotten that.  SPIEGEL: After this reconnaissance mission, Sylvia says she came up with a mental checklist of things not to say. She was not going to explain, as she had in her last interview, that if they gave her a penny more than unemployment, she would gladly take the job, or talk in any way about the financial difficulties that woke her every morning at three. In fact, she says, she was not even going to mention being unemployed - even privately, to herself.  Ms. MARTINEZ: I'm not even going to think about being unemployed at this point.  SPIEGEL: You're blocking it out of your mind.  Ms. MARTINEZ: I have to. I have to.  (Soundbite of birds chirping)  (Soundbite of car door opening, closing)  SPIEGEL: It was with this stern optimism that Sylvia climbed into her Saturn Vue and set off for her interview.  Okay, so this place is about 40 minutes away? Or\u2026  Ms. MARTINEZ: About 40. Yeah.  SPIEGEL: Once she hit I-95, Sylvia seemed to relax. For her last job, Sylvia drove this road every morning. But unlike the rest of the commuters stuck in traffic in Northern Virginia, Sylvia actually liked it. It was her time by herself, she says, and now she's back in her element. She is someone with somewhere to go. But as we get closer, this ease wears off.  Ms. MARTINEZ: I'm getting a little anxious now. I just hope that I say the right things.

The instruments are flutes made of vulture bone and mammoth tusks. They were found in caves in southwestern Germany, and they date back to the time when modern human beings, who looked like us, were first venturing into Europe. NPR's Richard Harris has our story. RICHARD HARRIS: Scientists have little doubt that music is so basic to human nature that it goes back to our earliest days as a species. It's hard not to make music, when you think about it. Professor NICHOLAS CONARD (Archeologist, Tubingen University): Clap your hands. Tap your foot, dance, whistle, sing. There, I mean, you know, endless kinds of music you can make just with your body. HARRIS: But Nicolas Conard is an archaeologist, so he is looking for hard evidence of early music. He and his colleagues now report in Nature a spectacular discovery: four flutes, buried in Ice Age garbage heaps in the caves of Germany. They date back 35,000 to 40,000 years, making them the oldest undisputed musical instruments. One of the flutes is made of a vulture wing bone about nine inches long. A replica sounds like this. (Soundbite of flute) HARRIS: Other flutes were made out of mammoth tusks. The early musicians clearly had leisure time not only to play but to make instruments. Prof. CONARD: You know, really quite a surprise that flutes would be made out of massive mammoth ivory, which is a material that's very hard to work, and not just bird bones, which are hollow and sort of, you know, ideal for making flutes. HARRIS: Conard, at the University of Tubingen in Germany, suspects the ivory flutes were favored because they produced a deeper, richer tone. He says archaeologists have found similar ivory flutes in more recent cave deposits and have figured out what it took to make them. First, a tube of ivory needs to be whittled from the larger tusk and then split in half. Prof. CONARD: Then you have to hollow it out, get the exact form, smooth out the inside and the outside, cut the ends to length and perfectly cut the finger holes, and even if you can do all that, then you've got the problem of how to get the two halves together. HARRIS: The ancient craftsmen cut delicate notches in order to get the halves to fit just so. Prof. CONARD: Then you have to seal it with birch pitch or some kind of sealant or glue, and then you can play it. HARRIS: In order to figure out what one of those ancient flutes actually sounded like, a colleague of Conard's made a replica out of vulture bone. Prof. CONARD: The first recording I heard was an absolutely horrendous version of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" that sounded something like a more awful version of Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock. HARRIS: Alas, Conard wouldn't share that recording with NPR. Instead, Conard made available the more demure recording. (Soundbite of flute) HARRIS: Now this ancient flute was found very close to another famous artifact Conard recently unearthed from these caves: a carved figure of a female with exaggerated sexual characteristics, a Venus figurine. Mr. CONARD: It's certainly plausible that the people who carved and used the flute also carved and used the Venus figurine. Again, we can't say for sure, but they could easily go together. HARRIS: What anthropologists can say without doubt is early modern humans who were venturing into Europe during the last Ice Age were expressing themselves artistically. Ian Tattersall at the American Museum of Natural History says just think of the cave paintings from around this time. Mr. IAN TATTERSALL (Paleoanthropologist; Curator, American Museum of Natural History): We know that these early humans had the kind of creativity that we have. And now we know for sure that this creativity from the very earliest time includes music. HARRIS: Music and art reveal that human beings are using abstractions and symbols: hallmarks of humanity. Mr. TATTERSALL: It gives us imagination. It gives us the ability to create new possibilities and new worlds.

I'm Ira Flatow. My next guest, underwater explorer Robert Ballard. He has probably passed more time on the bottom of the ocean than most of us have probably spent swimming in it. His work day, a typical work day, may include a two-and-a-half hour commute each way to the ocean bottom in a cramped submersible, but what he's found down there in five decades of exploration has changed the way we look at the oceans and our planet. Think of the things that he has discovered. You know, he's discovered those hydrothermal vents, the super-heated hot springs on the ocean floor, the creatures living there that - they certainly rival any mariners' tales of monsters or mermaids. You've got those 10 feet long tube worms, football-sized clams with blood red bodies. He's found all kinds of stuff down there, all in the darkness, where no one thought any living thing could survive. But he's also made great scientific discoveries, as he has. He's also an underwater archaeologist, and in 1985, Dr. Ballard found the wreck of the Titanic, which is probably the thing he's most famous for, but probably not the biggest scientific advance that he's done. He's also - soon after that he found a Nazi warship, and lately he's been doing other underwater excavations, looking for evidence of ancient civilizations underwater in the Americas, searching for Byzantine merchant ships in the Black Sea. Where's he going next? What's left to find? What kind of new technology is he using? Well, for the rest of the hour we're going to be talking about those expeditions with our modern-day Captain Nemo. Robert Ballard is president of the Institute for Exploration. He's explorer-in-residence for the National Geographic Society. He's also the director of the Center for Ocean Exploration and Archaeological Oceanography at the University of Rhode Island, and he joins us from Waterford, Connecticut. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Ballard. Dr. ROBERT BALLARD (President, Institute for Exploration; Explorer-in-residence, National Geographic Society; Director, Center for Ocean Exploration and Archaeological Oceanography, University of Rhode Island): Oh, it's a pleasure to be back. It's been a while. FLATOW: I think I used up 40 minutes just saying what you've done. Dr. BALLARD: Well, there's a lot left to be done, fortunately. FLATOW: Do you think of yourself as like a modern-day Captain Nemo? Dr. BALLARD: Well, I hope so. I mean, that was my dream as a little kid, and it's been my driving engine for years and years. \"20,000 Leagues,\" as you remember, was not down to the bottom of the ocean, it was driving along the bottom of the ocean in a submarine, looking out of that big window, and that's what I'm doing. So I think I might have pulled it off. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: When did you first - how young were you? When did you first discover that this was your career, this was what you wanted to do? Dr. BALLARD: Oh, very early. When I grew up in San Diego, I was a little kid, and I lived by the ocean, and that was my play yard, and back then, the parents simply said, you know, get home before it's dark, and I would spend the day in the tidal pool. So I had to learn the tides, and I remember the movie \"Robinson Crusoe,\" and I wanted to see those footprints of Friday in the sand. So I just began extremely early, and then I got a big break when I was in high school. I got a - in fact, it was 50 years ago this month, and on my first oceanographic expedition at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography. I had a scholarship there with the - by the National Science Foundation, and we went out, and we got in a huge storm. We got hit by a rogue wave, and we got rescued by the Coast Guard, and I was 17 and so, you know, too young to realize I was supposed to die, and it was just an incredible experience, and I became hooked on going out to sea on expeditions, and in the 50 years since, I've done about 125, 130, and we're getting ready to do it again next month when we head into the Black Sea in the Mediterranean on our own ship, the first time I've ever had my own ship, and guess what its name is? Naturally, we've named it the Nautilus. FLATOW: Wow, are we going to see a TV series on cable with you in it? Dr. BALLARD: Absolutely. National Geographic Television and National Geographic Channel are producing, and it's going to take us about two-and-a-half years to produce a series called \"Oceanus,\" and it's going to be about exploration of the world's oceans, it's\u2026 FLATOW: Whoop, did we lose you? I think we lost Dr. Ballard. We'll get him back. 1-800-989-8255 was our number. We'll get him back on the phone or on our magical lines that\u2026 Dr. BALLARD: \u2026on planet Earth. FLATOW: Without a beat. Can you hear me, Dr. Ballard, okay? Dr. BALLARD: I certainly can. FLATOW: Okay, that's good. Tell us about that - tell us about this adventure that you're about to go on. What are you going to be looking for? What's it involve? Dr. BALLARD: Well, these two ships will both be going on their maiden voyage this year, the Okeanos in the Pacific Ocean, and the Nautilus will be in the Aegean, and then my favorite spot right now is the Black Sea, and what's really wonderful about these ships is because they're going where no one has gone before, and we don't know what we're going to find, we've had to come up with a whole new paradigm that we call telepresence, a way of bringing experts to the scene of a discovery minutes after it's taken place, and so for the last 28 years, actually it was 28 years ago, we published this dream in National Geographic magazine. FLATOW: We have a copy right here, actually. Dr. BALLARD: Absolutely. FLATOW: We do. We have it right here. Dr. BALLARD: Yeah, December, 1981 issue, and the idea behind that is that you have these ships out exploring, but they're connected by high bandwidth satellite from the bottom of the ocean to a new center. It's a new building. We just dedicated it at the Graduate School of Oceanography at URI. It's called the Inner Space Center, and it's sort of like Houston is to outer space, we have for inner space, and we are operating our vehicle 24 hours a day, and what they see is being beamed back to this Inner Space Center. And then from there, using this new, wonderful Internet2, this new high-bandwidth Internet that's sweeping the country right now, we're connecting all of the oceanographic institutions to the Inner Space Center so that we can actually bring a scientist aboard the ship, take him down to the bottom of the ocean in a matter of seconds. CONAN: So you've named this inner space as opposed to outer space, right? Dr. BALLARD: Absolutely. It is inner space. It's the largest living volume on the planet. It's the world's oceans. CONAN: Is that a challenge to NASA? Are you poking them a little bit? Dr. BALLARD: Absolutely. I mean, I love NASA. My father was an aerospace engineer and worked for North American Aviation. They built the Apollo spaceships, and so I was brought up on the space program, but I love outer space, and I love the fact they're studying the heavens, and I hope to go there someday, but right now I'm on Earth. And I want to know about the planet that I'm living on, and we have better maps of Mars than our own planet. So I'm interested in exploring Earth. CONAN: So when you have - let's talk about this telepresence. So if somebody finds something, and it goes back to the hub, can you wake somebody up, say hey look, we found something, you know? Dr. BALLARD: That's the idea. We're going to run it sort of like the way a hospital runs the emergency room. You know, a hospital has no idea what an ambulance is going to bring in Sunday morning at 2:00 a. m. , so they have what's called the doctors on call. They have physicians that can respond to a hospital within 20 minutes if they're needed. So we're setting up this 20 minute response by connecting the oceanographic institutions, which can move at the speed of light through the Internet2. We're building remote consoles so that we can literally call someone up. Imagine, call them up 2:00 a. m. Sunday morning, wake them up. They'll be very angry at that moment, but then we'll tell them we made a discovery and that they're on call, and they won't be angry. Imagine they're laying in bed. They'll take their laptop. They'll pop it open. They're naturally wireless in their homes, and we will then patch the phone to the pilot who's navigating this underwater vehicle in 20,000 feet of water thousands of miles away, and they'll talk to the pilot and take over the con and then make a decision. They'll decide, you know, if they - if we discovered something that wasn't that important. You know, they'll say take an aspirin and call me in the morning, but if it's really important, they'll jump out of bed, they'll get in their car, and they have to be within 20 minutes of one of these remote consoles, and while they're in their car they're going to be calling their friends and their graduate students, because they need to take over the ship for the next couple days. So they'll need five or six other scientists, and then they'll all run to their consoles, and they'll all be patched in, and then they'll all take over. It's really cool. FLATOW: And so what area will you be looking at, and what will you be looking for? Dr. BALLARD: Well, in the Pacific, we had a big get-together at National Geographic - who have been really helpful in all of this. We had a workshop, working with NOAA, and we brought in experts that have passion for the Pacific. About 40 different groups of scientists submitted white papers and said, you know, if you're ever in the Pacific, and you want to discover something, go here, and so we got this map of the Pacific, and it's got boxes all over it, and then what we're going to do is we're going to move around from box to box, but then we're going to wander along the way. We call it the box-and-stick strategy. I think most of the exciting discoveries will be done between boxes, as we're navigating our way from A to B, and so we have that plan. They're now developing a schedule for the Okeanos, and it'll begin really in earnest in May. Most of what's going on right now are sea trials. FLATOW: But the Pacific is a big spot. Dr. BALLARD: A third of the Earth. FLATOW: Well, so which part of the Pacific do you look in? Dr. BALLARD: Well, they're in Seattle right now, and they're going to work their way across. They're going to work their way to the Indian Ocean, I mean, to the - excuse me. They're going to start in Seattle. They're going to work towards the Hawaiian Islands. They're going to explore that entire seamount chain. Then they're going to end up - by May of next year they'll be in Indonesia, in the Western regions of the Pacific, and then they'll work their way back. While they're doing that, our ship the Nautilus, will start its campaign actually next month. We're doing a program for National Geographic on the Battle of Gallipoli in the Dardanelles and then we're going to come down the Sea of Marmara. It's a very fascinating body of water. If you know your geography, if you up though the Aegean and you go though the Dardanelles and that's where the Helspont is, where the Persian armies crossed on their way to battle the Greeks. This is also where the Germans and the Turks fought the British in the Battle of Gallipoli in World War I. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. BALLARD: And there's all sorts of warships that were sunk there. And there's a particular British submarine they'd like us to find called E-20(ph) and it's in the Sea of Marmara, which is a sea between the Aegean and the Black Sea. And it's anoxic like the Black Sea and it's also the same body of water that Jason and the Argonauts traversed in search for the Golden Fleece. So, we know that it's had maritime trade for thousands and thousands of years and we hope to find perfectly preserved ancient shipwrecks while we're looking for this U-20 submarine. So, that's the first mission. Then we're going to come down the Aegean coast to an area called Yalikavak Bodrum in the eastern Aegean. And we last year found several ships from the time of Imperial Rome. We're going to be going back and imaging those and continuing our search. And then we're going to double back up through the Bosphorus and go into the Black Sea in early September, working with the Ukrainian Academy of Science. We're working off of the Crimea, which is - there used to be ancient Greek colonies there. One in particular called (unintelligible). And just off of that ancient Greek colony the bottom of the ocean plunges down to 6000 feet. And the water there is poisonous, it's completely anoxic. It's the largest reservoir of hydrogen sulfide on Earth and there we expect to find the most perfectly preserved ancient shipwrecks in the world. FLATOW: Because there's no oxygen there. Dr. BALLARD: Exactly. There's no one to eat anything. In fact, we have already found a beautifully preserved Byzantine shipwreck on the other side of the Black Sea, off the Turkish coast at a place called Sinope. And we found in 15,000 feet of water, we came in with our robots and there was a ship's mast with rigging on it. And we dropped down 40 feet and there was this ancient ship perfectly preserved. FLATOW: Do you raise these ships, go and bring these up? Dr. BALLARD: Well, it has been done. I mean, certainly in typical marine archeological programs they try to recover everything. That's not our strategy. Our strategy is actually to build underwater museums in place. And about - not only around the ship off Turkey but we also found a Byzantine shipwreck off the Crimea and we're building underwater museums. And the reason for that is very simple. A lot of these ships had a lot of the same thing. They're sort of bulk carriers, like stopping a truck on the I-95 and it's got a thousand of these things and a thousand of those things. We really don't want all of that stuff. We just need a representative sample. So, what we're doing is we're actually storing everything down there because it's happy down there. It's equilibrated and we don't want to go through the expensive process of conservation and preservation. And then have to take care of these objects for in perpetuity, which is a long time. As\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: I get it. Dr. BALLARD: As Yogi Berra would say. So\u2026 FLATOW: Let me just remind everybody that this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Bob Ballard about his explorations. So, you leave this stuff down there. You know - I know how you feel about the Titanic and I've been seeing more exhibits about things being brought up and shown around the country. Dr. BALLARD: Right. FLATOW: And that does upset you, doesn't it? Dr. BALLARD: Well, for a number of reasons. One, it's - the primary motivation of this is making money. So, I mean this is not being done for, you know, for like a research program. They're down there to make money. And we've had these kinds of people since they built the pyramids. So, this is something that society has dealt with for a long, long time. My saddest moment was when I went into the pyramids of Egypt and everything was gone. Already go to the - I think the Belgium marble should be back in Athens. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. BALLARD: That's where they belong or the Rosetta Stone. And so, it's sort of like taking belt buckles off the Arizona. I think that that's just something you don't do, it's - you don't go to Gettysburg with a shovel. I think there are certain sites, I'm not saying you preserve everything, but certain sites that deserve to be preserved. And now with the technology of Telepresence, we can take you there. We did, with National Geographic a few years ago, we did a live broadcast from the deck of the Titanic. And what - some day you're going to actually wire the Titanic and it's going to be a place you visit electronically. Because Telepresence technology that we're sort of pioneering is really the beginning of electronic travel. You're going to have in your home certainly within the next 10 years a room, and we used to call it the den, and when you turn on the room the walls will come on. And you'll sit, probably spherical, so it isn't square-like walls but you'll be in a spherical room and you'll rent a robot from Hertz and you'll go for a drive in the Serengeti and spend the afternoon driving around. And it'll be very inexpensive compared to flying to the Serengeti. What's really neat about these installation of remote cameras, we've been doing it in the National Marine Sanctuaries, particularly Monterrey. We went in and installed underwater cameras on cables so they could ride through the sanctuary. And what we found was when we were installing the cameras, everyone ran away. But as soon as we left, all the creatures came back out, went up and poked their noses into the cameras. And we were able to see things that drivers wouldn't see. And, you know, this is something you can do in Yellowstone Park. You can, you know, go wire up Yellowstone. They've already got the ring rode in there. And you'll be able to see creatures that would normally run away like the packs of wolves. So, Telepresence is really going to change our lives. We're going to do more and more from home. I think what's wonderful about Telepresence, because it's impacting on my personal life, is it's reinventing the family. You're able to spend much, much more time at home. Even in my business of exploration, I'm spending now more time at home than anytime in my life. And I'm exploring more than anytime in my life. So, it's a really a plus, plus. FLATOW: Talking with Robert Ballard about his explorations, about Telepresence. We have to take a short break, we'll come back, take more of your questions. Our number 1-800-989-8255. Also, you can Tweet us. We like your Tweets at SciFri, @scifri. Send in those questions. We'll be finishing up the hour with Dr. Ballard. So, stay with us. We'll be right back. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow and this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. FLATOW: You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about exploring the depths of our oceans and the seas with my guest Robert Ballard, president of the Institute for Exploration. He is explorer-in-residence for the National Geographic Society and director of the -Center for Ocean Exploration and Archeological Oceanography at the University of Rhode Island. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Dave(ph) in Tallahassee. Hi Dave. DAVE (Caller): Hello. FLATOW: Hi there. DAVE: Dr. Ballard you worked with my mother on the Black Sea shipwreck. The surname is Dr. Sheryl Ward(ph). DR. BALLARD: Oh of course, yes I did. (Soundbite of laughter) DAVE: We've met a couple of times, too. I just wanted to say it's a lot of your work and her work that inspired me to be a mechanical engineer. I went to Johns Hopkins where I worked with Louis Whitcomb. Mr. BALLARD: Yeah, a neat guy. He worked a lot with us at Woods Hole when I was there years ago. DAVE: Well, what I was wondering was, sort of the inspiration that you gave to me, I was wondering if you have any ideas where you could, you know, get more of the public involved in maritime exploration and things like that. Because it seems like it's sort of a hush-hush topic in the world. Mr. BALLARD: Well, what's really neat about this new inner space center at the University of Rhode Island is that we now, thanks to National Geographic and funding from NOAA and the state of Rhode Island, we're building a complete television production studio. And with that we're able to then broadcast live our discoveries to schools and organizations all across the country. We have two programs, as you know, the Jason Project, which is a distant learning program for middle school kids at National Geographic. And then we also have another one at the Sea Research Foundation called Immersion Presents. And we do a lot of informal broadcasting to kids at risk, boys and girls clubs and museums and aquariums all across the country. And so, through exploration we want to use the excitement of exploration and discovery to motivate young people, particularly kids in middle school, because that's where the battle for a scientist and an engineer is won or lost, to get them turned on by exploration and then maybe turned on to take those extra classes that are maybe a little tougher than the other ones. FLATOW: Thanks Dave, for calling. Have a good weekend. DAVE: Thanks a lot, Ira. FLATOW: You're welcome. In your early career, you were doing all these scientific pursuits - you would go down to the hydrothermal vents, the underwater earthquakes and the sea mounts. And then in the '80s, you began searching for sunken ships. What made you decide to shift gears at that time? Mr. BALLARD: Well, you know, in many professions you progress up the chain of command. FLATOW: Hmm. Mr. BALLARD: I, for example, was a naval officer for 30 years. And you start out as an Ensign and you move up the ranks. And everyone wants to be an Admiral someday. And I actually refused promotion above a Commander because I knew that if you got above a Commander, you got out of the battle. And\u2026 FLATOW: Hmm. Mr. BALLARD: I wanted to stay in the game. FLATOW: Right. Mr. BALLARD: And in academia, I always stayed within the research game. I didn't want to become a chairman of a department or a dean because then again you leave the battlefield. And so, I've always try to stay in the game but I wanted to be energized by it. And I sort of tried to re-invent myself about every 10 or 15 years to take on a whole new genre so that I would be excited by it and motivated by something new but still stay in the field of exploration. And fortunately, when I went to University of California at Santa Barbara I had a quadruple major in math, physics, chemistry and geology. So, I have a broad based background. And I feel comfortable in a lot of different things and I certainly feel comfortable working with engineers. And most recently I began working with social scientists because I always actually loved history as a kid. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. BALLARD: \u2026thinking that my passion for history would be just something that would, you know, fall by the way side as I went into the physical sciences and got my doctorate in oceanography. But through this re-invention and through the creation of this new field, which is very exciting new endeavor, archaeological oceanography, which is taking oceanographers, engineers and social scientists and going into the deep oceans where we think there's probably more history in the deep sea\u2026 FLATOW: Hmm. Mr. BALLARD: \u2026than all the museums of the world combined. And we're only now opening those doors to those museums. And so, that's very exciting and that's why I changed my course\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah\u2026 Mr. BALLARD: \u2026just stay alive and young. FLATOW: Would it be possible to actually find fossils that may be millions of years old, buried under water? Mr. BALLARD: Oh, definitely. FLATOW: Yeah? Mr. BALLARD: In fact, the issue you have to deal with is at depth below about 3000 feet, you pass below what's called the calcium carbonate compensation depth. And the water in the deep sea is under saturated in calcium carbonate, which is mostly, you know, what bones are made of. For example, on the Titanic and on the Bismarck, those ships are below the calcium carbonate compensation depth. So once the critters eat their flesh and expose the bones, the bones dissolve. Now, in the Black Sea, because there's no critters to eat, the bones should not be exposed. So you should have perfectly mummified fossils. You should actually have perfectly mummified ancient mariners in the Black Sea. And we expect someday, as we're excavating these ships, to actually come across crewmembers who will look like they're asleep. We've seen, for example, dolphins down there that have died a natural death and they're on the bottom, and they look like they're asleep. And so they're not only fossilized, they're perfectly preserved. Now, a million - you know, to get a fossil, though, you know, you're talking about millions and millions of years. I actually have a meeting coming up next week with Paul Sereno, who's another explore-in-residence for the National Geographic Society. And he's interested in me finding completely fossilized dinosaur bones that were lost on a ship. And there, they're not calcium carbonate. There, they've been replaced, in most cases, by silica. And silica will be preserved. So, yes, you should be able to find fossils that are no longer calcium carbonate-based fossils, but silica-based fossils. FLATOW: I was at a meeting recently of archeologists, people actually studying hominids. And there's the one scientist that was talking about his theory, and this has been - this theory's around for a while, that some hominids may have made their way, apes may have made their way to live on the seashore of Africa, in Eastern Africa, and that we - you know, the problem is you can never find the fossils of these people or these - not people. Dr. BALLARD: Well, if they've been truly fossilized\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. BALLARD: \u2026where you've replace the calcium carbonate with silica, for example, then yes, the fossil should be there. And, in fact, if you go down off of Miami - and I've been diving down there. There's a place called Miami Terrace. And there, everything has been fossilized by phosphates. And you can find fossils down there, and we have. So we have found fossils under the ocean. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Jessica in Boston. Hi, Jessica. JESSICA (Caller): Hi. How are you? Thank you for taking my call. FLATOW: You're welcome. JESSICA: Well, first, I want to thank you, Dr. Ballard, for all that you do. I think you've done a phenomenal work, and I've followed you for many years. Dr. BALLARD: Well, thank you. JESSICA: I have two daughters now, and I'm hoping that - to get them interested into, you know, oceanography as a whole. And I was wondering, I seem to remember you speaking about possibility of colonization of the ocean or doing some sort of floating something where people can be on the ocean. Is that something that I recalled or\u2026 Dr. BALLARD: No, you're right. Because, as you know, 72 percent of the earth is oceans. JESSICA: Yes. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. BALLARD: And we only live on 18 percent of the planet, (unintelligible). JESSICA: Yeah. Dr. BALLARD: Because we don't live at the polar regions. We don't live in extreme desert regions. So if you really look at where people are living, that's a pretty small percentage of the planet. So naturally, the ocean is an obvious possibility, particularly as our population continues to rise, and particularly as sea level rises, we're going to have more of it underwater. So what we're adopting is that - is called a spar buoy concept. In fact, the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla, California built years ago, a boat called FLIP. And it's a really cool boat. And it was developed by the Office of Naval Research to do a acoustical work. And the reason for that is it looks like a big cigar, a big, long telephone pole. And then it's about 300-some-odd feet long. And it's towed out to sea, and then if floods tanks and it flips and it goes vertical. And like an iceberg, most of it's underwater. But the part that's above water is very stable. And oceans cannot really excite it. As waves go by, you know, a big wave, a 30-foot wave, for example, would only make it move about three feet. And, in fact, oil companies are now using that spar buoy concept for their offshore platforms. They've taken a bunch of these buoys and put them all together, and they built a platform out of them. So it's very possible that we can build individual homes. I'd love to have a condominium that was offshore, and it's best on the West Coast, because you'd need about 300 feet of water for this to work. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. BALLARD: And you need - West Coast, it goes deep fast. And I've always thought, since I grew up in California, that it would be wonderful to have one of these off of Catalina or off of Los Angeles, look back at the skylight, but then have the privacy. And then take these 300-foot-long houses and actually grow aquaculture on the side. You can do all sorts of thermal exchanges for air conditioning. You can rotate it systematically so it's always seen - solar panels are always seeing the sun. One of these days, you know, when I get present project out of my hair and into the hands of the next generation, I would like in my final - my wife's not so sure if she wants to live on it. But I got her to agreed at least vacation on it once in a while. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Well, Bob, you know, oceans are rising, right? I mean\u2026 Dr. BALARD: Absolutely. FLATOW: \u2026we need to be ready for - have more kinds of ideas like this. Because even in the United States\u2026 Dr. BALLARD: Well, you know\u2026 FLATOW: \u2026isn't the water - we're going to be rising over the next century? Dr. BALLARD: Well, it's going to be rising for a long, long time because all the ice is actually going to melt, unfortunately. It's going to not melt. Everything is going to melt. And sea level's going to rise. But even if it doesn't rise, there's just so much real estate that's inhabitable. And you, know, you can build these in such a way that, you know, your bedroom is underwater, like it's a giant aquarium underwater, and you can then be up on the top. And I like say, you can control it so you're always in the shade on one side. It's - I've actually done designs. I did a program with Alan Alda on the \"American Experience. \" And they actually - on PBS. And they actually created a beautiful model of my ship, and it's sort of cool. So if you want to learn more about it\u2026 FLATOW: There you go. Dr. BALLARD: \u2026look up Alan Alda's program \"American Experience. \" FLATOW: I just want to interrupt with a little news bulletin from the NPR News desk. Alaska Governor Sarah Palin announced that she'll step down. She's resigning later this month, and she's handing all the reigns over to lieutenant governor. The lieutenant governor - we'll hear more about that in ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, following SCIENCE FRIDAY. So you'll want to stay tuned for that. So where do you go now immediately, Bob? What's your next - you have the boat\u2026 Dr. BALLARD: Well, right now? FLATOW: \u2026you have the boat going out, you have two boats. You have one that I'm near, with the Nautilus. You have the other one going to the Pacific? Dr. BALLARD: That's right. Well, I'm taking - in fact, in the studio, here -I'm looking at him right now - is my son, Benjamin. And he's 15 years old. And he's been waiting and waiting and waiting. And I told him when he could first talk, and he said, dad, I want to go on one of your expeditions. And I said, Ben, you can't go till you're 15. Well, he's 15. And so, he's going to be Jason Argonaut on our expedition. And he's going on a Nautilus with me in August on the maiden voyage out of the Bosporus into the Sea of Marmara and down to the Gallipoli. So that's my next expedition. We'll be in the Aegean, and then we're going to end it up in the Black Sea. So I'm right now getting ready to go to Block Island so we can - we always go there as a family, and we love to live off the sea. And so we're going to do a lot of fishing and clamming and just enjoying New England. Finally, the sun actually comes out\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. BALLARD: \u2026once in a while this year. June was the most dreary June I've ever seen in my life. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: I know. I mean, Connecticut's right next door. We're talking with - I'm talking with Bob Ballard this hour on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I know that - just in the couple of minutes I have left, tell me what's it like to have to be your own salesperson, right? You're an entrepreneur. You've spent your whole life\u2026 Dr. BALLARD: Yeah. FLATOW: \u2026having to sell your ideas and then get them\u2026 Dr. BALLARD: Yeah, but then you get to live them. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. BALLARD: I think that comes with the turf. If you really want to be free, you're going to be alone. I mean, freedom is - most people said they want to be free, but real freedom is, you wake up and it's a blank sheet of paper. And most people would like to have it written. And I love the freedom. I love dreaming up things. And fortunately, I have great sponsors like National Geographic, like the Navy, like NOAA, who bet on my horse over the years. And I just enjoy doing things that have never been done before. I enjoy the freedom of an explorer to literally go where no one has gone before. I'm confident that the Nautilus and the Okianis(ph) explorer are going to make incredible discoveries. How can we fail? Most of my really important discoveries were done by accident. The discovery of hydrothermal vents, black smokers, et cetera, all were found while looking for something else. And when I think about how many wonderful discoveries we've made and then realized how little real estate we made them in, the potential for discovery on our planet is amazing. What's hard is to convince sponsors. See, most sponsors want to know what you're going to discover and when. Well, those are sponsors I talked to very much because they don't understand. I can't tell you what I'm going to discover or when I'm going to discover it, but I can show you an incredible track record of making discoveries. And if you'll just bet on our horse, I'll bet you we're going to make discoveries. And so that's what we're off - the next year, to me, is going to be the year of ocean discovery because we finally, actually have ships that are dedicated to the process of exploring. FLATOW: You don't have to borrow someone else's ship? Dr. BALLARD: Nope. We got our own now. FLATOW: Don't have to beg, borrow and steal. You have the resources. Dr. BALLARD: We have the resources. And Congress has been very generous in this last go-around. The House and Senate were extremely generous in increasing - we hope. We have to go through conference between the House and Senate. And then President Obama has to sign it. But I think we have a group of people now in charge that actually get the - get it. They understand the importance of science and they understand the importance of exploration. And so I'm very optimistic, because I believe many of our discoveries are going to have commercial impact upon our country. There's vast resources that have yet to be discovered. The Easter Bunny didn't put them just on the land part. There's vast resources to be discovered, living and non-living resources, pharmaceuticals, on the list goes. So I'm confident that this process of discovery that we're just beginning will not only lead to great science and big discoveries and motivate kids to want to be explorers, but actually impact on the economy of our country. FLATOW: Well, we wish great luck to you, Robert Ballard\u2026 Dr. BALLARD: Thank you. FLATOW: \u2026in those - and we hope that we can be part of your discoveries, you'll come back and talk to us when you discover something new. Dr. BALLARD: Well, stay tuned. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. BALLARD: The game has just begun, 'cause my best stuff is in front of me, not behind me. FLATOW: The best is yet to come. All right. Thank you very much. Bob Ballard is the president of the Institute for Exploration and explore-in-residence for the National Geographic Society, also director of the Center for Ocean Exploration and Archeological Oceanography at the University of Rhode Island. Happy holiday to you, Bob. Dr. BALLARD: Thank you, sir. FLATOW: Good luck to you. That's about all the time we have for our program today.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. My next guest, underwater explorer Robert Ballard. He has probably passed more time on the bottom of the ocean than most of us have probably spent swimming in it.  His work day, a typical work day, may include a two-and-a-half hour commute each way to the ocean bottom in a cramped submersible, but what he's found down there in five decades of exploration has changed the way we look at the oceans and our planet.  Think of the things that he has discovered. You know, he's discovered those hydrothermal vents, the super-heated hot springs on the ocean floor, the creatures living there that - they certainly rival any mariners' tales of monsters or mermaids.  You've got those 10 feet long tube worms, football-sized clams with blood red bodies. He's found all kinds of stuff down there, all in the darkness, where no one thought any living thing could survive.  But he's also made great scientific discoveries, as he has. He's also an underwater archaeologist, and in 1985, Dr. Ballard found the wreck of the Titanic, which is probably the thing he's most famous for, but probably not the biggest scientific advance that he's done.  He's also - soon after that he found a Nazi warship, and lately he's been doing other underwater excavations, looking for evidence of ancient civilizations underwater in the Americas, searching for Byzantine merchant ships in the Black Sea.  Where's he going next? What's left to find? What kind of new technology is he using? Well, for the rest of the hour we're going to be talking about those expeditions with our modern-day Captain Nemo.  Robert Ballard is president of the Institute for Exploration. He's explorer-in-residence for the National Geographic Society. He's also the director of the Center for Ocean Exploration and Archaeological Oceanography at the University of Rhode Island, and he joins us from Waterford, Connecticut. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Ballard.  Dr. ROBERT BALLARD (President, Institute for Exploration; Explorer-in-residence, National Geographic Society; Director, Center for Ocean Exploration and Archaeological Oceanography, University of Rhode Island): Oh, it's a pleasure to be back. It's been a while.  FLATOW: I think I used up 40 minutes just saying what you've done.  Dr. BALLARD: Well, there's a lot left to be done, fortunately.  FLATOW: Do you think of yourself as like a modern-day Captain Nemo?  Dr. BALLARD: Well, I hope so. I mean, that was my dream as a little kid, and it's been my driving engine for years and years. \"20,000 Leagues,\" as you remember, was not down to the bottom of the ocean, it was driving along the bottom of the ocean in a submarine, looking out of that big window, and that's what I'm doing. So I think I might have pulled it off.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: When did you first - how young were you? When did you first discover that this was your career, this was what you wanted to do?  Dr. BALLARD: Oh, very early. When I grew up in San Diego, I was a little kid, and I lived by the ocean, and that was my play yard, and back then, the parents simply said, you know, get home before it's dark, and I would spend the day in the tidal pool. So I had to learn the tides, and I remember the movie \"Robinson Crusoe,\" and I wanted to see those footprints of Friday in the sand.  So I just began extremely early, and then I got a big break when I was in high school. I got a - in fact, it was 50 years ago this month, and on my first oceanographic expedition at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography. I had a scholarship there with the - by the National Science Foundation, and we went out, and we got in a huge storm.  We got hit by a rogue wave, and we got rescued by the Coast Guard, and I was 17 and so, you know, too young to realize I was supposed to die, and it was just an incredible experience, and I became hooked on going out to sea on expeditions, and in the 50 years since, I've done about 125, 130, and we're getting ready to do it again next month when we head into the Black Sea in the Mediterranean on our own ship, the first time I've ever had my own ship, and guess what its name is? Naturally, we've named it the Nautilus.  FLATOW: Wow, are we going to see a TV series on cable with you in it?  Dr. BALLARD: Absolutely. National Geographic Television and National Geographic Channel are producing, and it's going to take us about two-and-a-half years to produce a series called \"Oceanus,\" and it's going to be about exploration of the world's oceans, it's\u2026  FLATOW: Whoop, did we lose you? I think we lost Dr. Ballard. We'll get him back. 1-800-989-8255 was our number. We'll get him back on the phone or on our magical lines that\u2026  Dr. BALLARD: \u2026on planet Earth.  FLATOW: Without a beat. Can you hear me, Dr. Ballard, okay?  Dr. BALLARD: I certainly can.  FLATOW: Okay, that's good. Tell us about that - tell us about this adventure that you're about to go on. What are you going to be looking for? What's it involve?  Dr. BALLARD: Well, these two ships will both be going on their maiden voyage this year, the Okeanos in the Pacific Ocean, and the Nautilus will be in the Aegean, and then my favorite spot right now is the Black Sea, and what's really wonderful about these ships is because they're going where no one has gone before, and we don't know what we're going to find, we've had to come up with a whole new paradigm that we call telepresence, a way of bringing experts to the scene of a discovery minutes after it's taken place, and so for the last 28 years, actually it was 28 years ago, we published this dream in National Geographic magazine.  FLATOW: We have a copy right here, actually.  Dr. BALLARD: Absolutely.  FLATOW: We do. We have it right here.  Dr. BALLARD: Yeah, December, 1981 issue, and the idea behind that is that you have these ships out exploring, but they're connected by high bandwidth satellite from the bottom of the ocean to a new center. It's a new building. We just dedicated it at the Graduate School of Oceanography at URI. It's called the Inner Space Center, and it's sort of like Houston is to outer space, we have for inner space, and we are operating our vehicle 24 hours a day, and what they see is being beamed back to this Inner Space Center.  And then from there, using this new, wonderful Internet2, this new high-bandwidth Internet that's sweeping the country right now, we're connecting all of the oceanographic institutions to the Inner Space Center so that we can actually bring a scientist aboard the ship, take him down to the bottom of the ocean in a matter of seconds.  CONAN: So you've named this inner space as opposed to outer space, right?  Dr. BALLARD: Absolutely. It is inner space. It's the largest living volume on the planet. It's the world's oceans.  CONAN: Is that a challenge to NASA? Are you poking them a little bit?  Dr. BALLARD: Absolutely. I mean, I love NASA. My father was an aerospace engineer and worked for North American Aviation. They built the Apollo spaceships, and so I was brought up on the space program, but I love outer space, and I love the fact they're studying the heavens, and I hope to go there someday, but right now I'm on Earth. And I want to know about the planet that I'm living on, and we have better maps of Mars than our own planet. So I'm interested in exploring Earth.  CONAN: So when you have - let's talk about this telepresence. So if somebody finds something, and it goes back to the hub, can you wake somebody up, say hey look, we found something, you know?  Dr. BALLARD: That's the idea. We're going to run it sort of like the way a hospital runs the emergency room. You know, a hospital has no idea what an ambulance is going to bring in Sunday morning at 2:00 a. m. , so they have what's called the doctors on call.  They have physicians that can respond to a hospital within 20 minutes if they're needed. So we're setting up this 20 minute response by connecting the oceanographic institutions, which can move at the speed of light through the Internet2. We're building remote consoles so that we can literally call someone up. Imagine, call them up 2:00 a. m. Sunday morning, wake them up. They'll be very angry at that moment, but then we'll tell them we made a discovery and that they're on call, and they won't be angry.  Imagine they're laying in bed. They'll take their laptop. They'll pop it open. They're naturally wireless in their homes, and we will then patch the phone to the pilot who's navigating this underwater vehicle in 20,000 feet of water thousands of miles away, and they'll talk to the pilot and take over the con and then make a decision.  They'll decide, you know, if they - if we discovered something that wasn't that important. You know, they'll say take an aspirin and call me in the morning, but if it's really important, they'll jump out of bed, they'll get in their car, and they have to be within 20 minutes of one of these remote consoles, and while they're in their car they're going to be calling their friends and their graduate students, because they need to take over the ship for the next couple days.  So they'll need five or six other scientists, and then they'll all run to their consoles, and they'll all be patched in, and then they'll all take over. It's really cool.  FLATOW: And so what area will you be looking at, and what will you be looking for?  Dr. BALLARD: Well, in the Pacific, we had a big get-together at National Geographic - who have been really helpful in all of this. We had a workshop, working with NOAA, and we brought in experts that have passion for the Pacific.  About 40 different groups of scientists submitted white papers and said, you know, if you're ever in the Pacific, and you want to discover something, go here, and so we got this map of the Pacific, and it's got boxes all over it, and then what we're going to do is we're going to move around from box to box, but then we're going to wander along the way.  We call it the box-and-stick strategy. I think most of the exciting discoveries will be done between boxes, as we're navigating our way from A to B, and so we have that plan. They're now developing a schedule for the Okeanos, and it'll begin really in earnest in May. Most of what's going on right now are sea trials.  FLATOW: But the Pacific is a big spot.  Dr. BALLARD: A third of the Earth.  FLATOW: Well, so which part of the Pacific do you look in?  Dr. BALLARD: Well, they're in Seattle right now, and they're going to work their way across. They're going to work their way to the Indian Ocean, I mean, to the - excuse me. They're going to start in Seattle. They're going to work towards the Hawaiian Islands. They're going to explore that entire seamount chain. Then they're going to end up - by May of next year they'll be in Indonesia, in the Western regions of the Pacific, and then they'll work their way back. While they're doing that, our ship the Nautilus, will start its campaign actually next month. We're doing a program for National Geographic on the Battle of Gallipoli in the Dardanelles and then we're going to come down the Sea of Marmara. It's a very fascinating body of water. If you know your geography, if you up though the Aegean and you go though the Dardanelles and that's where the Helspont is, where the Persian armies crossed on their way to battle the Greeks. This is also where the Germans and the Turks fought the British in the Battle of Gallipoli in World War I.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. BALLARD: And there's all sorts of warships that were sunk there. And there's a particular British submarine they'd like us to find called E-20(ph) and it's in the Sea of Marmara, which is a sea between the Aegean and the Black Sea. And it's anoxic like the Black Sea and it's also the same body of water that Jason and the Argonauts traversed in search for the Golden Fleece. So, we know that it's had maritime trade for thousands and thousands of years and we hope to find perfectly preserved ancient shipwrecks while we're looking for this U-20 submarine. So, that's the first mission.  Then we're going to come down the Aegean coast to an area called Yalikavak Bodrum in the eastern Aegean. And we last year found several ships from the time of Imperial Rome. We're going to be going back and imaging those and continuing our search. And then we're going to double back up through the Bosphorus and go into the Black Sea in early September, working with the Ukrainian Academy of Science. We're working off of the Crimea, which is - there used to be ancient Greek colonies there. One in particular called (unintelligible). And just off of that ancient Greek colony the bottom of the ocean plunges down to 6000 feet.  And the water there is poisonous, it's completely anoxic. It's the largest reservoir of hydrogen sulfide on Earth and there we expect to find the most perfectly preserved ancient shipwrecks in the world.  FLATOW: Because there's no oxygen there.  Dr. BALLARD: Exactly. There's no one to eat anything. In fact, we have already found a beautifully preserved Byzantine shipwreck on the other side of the Black Sea, off the Turkish coast at a place called Sinope. And we found in 15,000 feet of water, we came in with our robots and there was a ship's mast with rigging on it. And we dropped down 40 feet and there was this ancient ship perfectly preserved.  FLATOW: Do you raise these ships, go and bring these up?  Dr. BALLARD: Well, it has been done. I mean, certainly in typical marine archeological programs they try to recover everything. That's not our strategy. Our strategy is actually to build underwater museums in place. And about - not only around the ship off Turkey but we also found a Byzantine shipwreck off the Crimea and we're building underwater museums. And the reason for that is very simple. A lot of these ships had a lot of the same thing. They're sort of bulk carriers, like stopping a truck on the I-95 and it's got a thousand of these things and a thousand of those things. We really don't want all of that stuff.  We just need a representative sample. So, what we're doing is we're actually storing everything down there because it's happy down there. It's equilibrated and we don't want to go through the expensive process of conservation and preservation. And then have to take care of these objects for in perpetuity, which is a long time. As\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: I get it.  Dr. BALLARD: As Yogi Berra would say. So\u2026  FLATOW: Let me just remind everybody that this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Bob Ballard about his explorations. So, you leave this stuff down there. You know - I know how you feel about the Titanic and I've been seeing more exhibits about things being brought up and shown around the country.  Dr. BALLARD: Right.  FLATOW: And that does upset you, doesn't it?  Dr. BALLARD: Well, for a number of reasons. One, it's - the primary motivation of this is making money. So, I mean this is not being done for, you know, for like a research program. They're down there to make money. And we've had these kinds of people since they built the pyramids. So, this is something that society has dealt with for a long, long time. My saddest moment was when I went into the pyramids of Egypt and everything was gone. Already go to the - I think the Belgium marble should be back in Athens.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. BALLARD: That's where they belong or the Rosetta Stone. And so, it's sort of like taking belt buckles off the Arizona. I think that that's just something you don't do, it's - you don't go to Gettysburg with a shovel. I think there are certain sites, I'm not saying you preserve everything, but certain sites that deserve to be preserved. And now with the technology of Telepresence, we can take you there. We did, with National Geographic a few years ago, we did a live broadcast from the deck of the Titanic.  And what - some day you're going to actually wire the Titanic and it's going to be a place you visit electronically. Because Telepresence technology that we're sort of pioneering is really the beginning of electronic travel. You're going to have in your home certainly within the next 10 years a room, and we used to call it the den, and when you turn on the room the walls will come on. And you'll sit, probably spherical, so it isn't square-like walls but you'll be in a spherical room and you'll rent a robot from Hertz and you'll go for a drive in the Serengeti and spend the afternoon driving around.  And it'll be very inexpensive compared to flying to the Serengeti. What's really neat about these installation of remote cameras, we've been doing it in the National Marine Sanctuaries, particularly Monterrey. We went in and installed underwater cameras on cables so they could ride through the sanctuary. And what we found was when we were installing the cameras, everyone ran away. But as soon as we left, all the creatures came back out, went up and poked their noses into the cameras.  And we were able to see things that drivers wouldn't see. And, you know, this is something you can do in Yellowstone Park. You can, you know, go wire up Yellowstone. They've already got the ring rode in there. And you'll be able to see creatures that would normally run away like the packs of wolves. So, Telepresence is really going to change our lives. We're going to do more and more from home. I think what's wonderful about Telepresence, because it's impacting on my personal life, is it's reinventing the family. You're able to spend much, much more time at home. Even in my business of exploration, I'm spending now more time at home than anytime in my life. And I'm exploring more than anytime in my life. So, it's a really a plus, plus.  FLATOW: Talking with Robert Ballard about his explorations, about Telepresence. We have to take a short break, we'll come back, take more of your questions. Our number 1-800-989-8255. Also, you can Tweet us. We like your Tweets at SciFri, @scifri. Send in those questions. We'll be finishing up the hour with Dr. Ballard. So, stay with us. We'll be right back.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow and this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  FLATOW: You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about exploring the depths of our oceans and the seas with my guest Robert Ballard, president of the Institute for Exploration. He is explorer-in-residence for the National Geographic Society and director of the -Center for Ocean Exploration and Archeological Oceanography at the University of Rhode Island. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Dave(ph) in Tallahassee. Hi Dave.  DAVE (Caller): Hello.  FLATOW: Hi there.  DAVE: Dr. Ballard you worked with my mother on the Black Sea shipwreck. The surname is Dr. Sheryl Ward(ph).  DR. BALLARD: Oh of course, yes I did.  (Soundbite of laughter)  DAVE: We've met a couple of times, too. I just wanted to say it's a lot of your work and her work that inspired me to be a mechanical engineer. I went to Johns Hopkins where I worked with Louis Whitcomb.  Mr. BALLARD: Yeah, a neat guy. He worked a lot with us at Woods Hole when I was there years ago.  DAVE: Well, what I was wondering was, sort of the inspiration that you gave to me, I was wondering if you have any ideas where you could, you know, get more of the public involved in maritime exploration and things like that. Because it seems like it's sort of a hush-hush topic in the world.  Mr. BALLARD: Well, what's really neat about this new inner space center at the University of Rhode Island is that we now, thanks to National Geographic and funding from NOAA and the state of Rhode Island, we're building a complete television production studio. And with that we're able to then broadcast live our discoveries to schools and organizations all across the country. We have two programs, as you know, the Jason Project, which is a distant learning program for middle school kids at National Geographic. And then we also have another one at the Sea Research Foundation called Immersion Presents.  And we do a lot of informal broadcasting to kids at risk, boys and girls clubs and museums and aquariums all across the country. And so, through exploration we want to use the excitement of exploration and discovery to motivate young people, particularly kids in middle school, because that's where the battle for a scientist and an engineer is won or lost, to get them turned on by exploration and then maybe turned on to take those extra classes that are maybe a little tougher than the other ones.  FLATOW: Thanks Dave, for calling. Have a good weekend.  DAVE: Thanks a lot, Ira.  FLATOW: You're welcome. In your early career, you were doing all these scientific pursuits - you would go down to the hydrothermal vents, the underwater earthquakes and the sea mounts. And then in the '80s, you began searching for sunken ships. What made you decide to shift gears at that time?  Mr. BALLARD: Well, you know, in many professions you progress up the chain of command.  FLATOW: Hmm.  Mr. BALLARD: I, for example, was a naval officer for 30 years. And you start out as an Ensign and you move up the ranks. And everyone wants to be an Admiral someday. And I actually refused promotion above a Commander because I knew that if you got above a Commander, you got out of the battle. And\u2026  FLATOW: Hmm.  Mr. BALLARD: I wanted to stay in the game.  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. BALLARD: And in academia, I always stayed within the research game. I didn't want to become a chairman of a department or a dean because then again you leave the battlefield. And so, I've always try to stay in the game but I wanted to be energized by it. And I sort of tried to re-invent myself about every 10 or 15 years to take on a whole new genre so that I would be excited by it and motivated by something new but still stay in the field of exploration.  And fortunately, when I went to University of California at Santa Barbara I had a quadruple major in math, physics, chemistry and geology. So, I have a broad based background. And I feel comfortable in a lot of different things and I certainly feel comfortable working with engineers. And most recently I began working with social scientists because I always actually loved history as a kid.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Mr. BALLARD: \u2026thinking that my passion for history would be just something that would, you know, fall by the way side as I went into the physical sciences and got my doctorate in oceanography. But through this re-invention and through the creation of this new field, which is very exciting new endeavor, archaeological oceanography, which is taking oceanographers, engineers and social scientists and going into the deep oceans where we think there's probably more history in the deep sea\u2026  FLATOW: Hmm.  Mr. BALLARD: \u2026than all the museums of the world combined. And we're only now opening those doors to those museums. And so, that's very exciting and that's why I changed my course\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah\u2026  Mr. BALLARD: \u2026just stay alive and young.  FLATOW: Would it be possible to actually find fossils that may be millions of years old, buried under water?  Mr. BALLARD: Oh, definitely.  FLATOW: Yeah?  Mr. BALLARD: In fact, the issue you have to deal with is at depth below about 3000 feet, you pass below what's called the calcium carbonate compensation depth. And the water in the deep sea is under saturated in calcium carbonate, which is mostly, you know, what bones are made of. For example, on the Titanic and on the Bismarck, those ships are below the calcium carbonate compensation depth. So once the critters eat their flesh and expose the bones, the bones dissolve.  Now, in the Black Sea, because there's no critters to eat, the bones should not be exposed. So you should have perfectly mummified fossils. You should actually have perfectly mummified ancient mariners in the Black Sea. And we expect someday, as we're excavating these ships, to actually come across crewmembers who will look like they're asleep.  We've seen, for example, dolphins down there that have died a natural death and they're on the bottom, and they look like they're asleep. And so they're not only fossilized, they're perfectly preserved.  Now, a million - you know, to get a fossil, though, you know, you're talking about millions and millions of years. I actually have a meeting coming up next week with Paul Sereno, who's another explore-in-residence for the National Geographic Society. And he's interested in me finding completely fossilized dinosaur bones that were lost on a ship.  And there, they're not calcium carbonate. There, they've been replaced, in most cases, by silica. And silica will be preserved. So, yes, you should be able to find fossils that are no longer calcium carbonate-based fossils, but silica-based fossils.  FLATOW: I was at a meeting recently of archeologists, people actually studying hominids. And there's the one scientist that was talking about his theory, and this has been - this theory's around for a while, that some hominids may have made their way, apes may have made their way to live on the seashore of Africa, in Eastern Africa, and that we - you know, the problem is you can never find the fossils of these people or these - not people.  Dr. BALLARD: Well, if they've been truly fossilized\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. BALLARD: \u2026where you've replace the calcium carbonate with silica, for example, then yes, the fossil should be there.  And, in fact, if you go down off of Miami - and I've been diving down there. There's a place called Miami Terrace. And there, everything has been fossilized by phosphates. And you can find fossils down there, and we have. So we have found fossils under the ocean.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Jessica in Boston. Hi, Jessica.  JESSICA (Caller): Hi. How are you? Thank you for taking my call.  FLATOW: You're welcome.  JESSICA: Well, first, I want to thank you, Dr. Ballard, for all that you do. I think you've done a phenomenal work, and I've followed you for many years.  Dr. BALLARD: Well, thank you.  JESSICA: I have two daughters now, and I'm hoping that - to get them interested into, you know, oceanography as a whole. And I was wondering, I seem to remember you speaking about possibility of colonization of the ocean or doing some sort of floating something where people can be on the ocean. Is that something that I recalled or\u2026  Dr. BALLARD: No, you're right. Because, as you know, 72 percent of the earth is oceans.  JESSICA: Yes.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. BALLARD: And we only live on 18 percent of the planet, (unintelligible).  JESSICA: Yeah.  Dr. BALLARD: Because we don't live at the polar regions. We don't live in extreme desert regions. So if you really look at where people are living, that's a pretty small percentage of the planet. So naturally, the ocean is an obvious possibility, particularly as our population continues to rise, and particularly as sea level rises, we're going to have more of it underwater.  So what we're adopting is that - is called a spar buoy concept. In fact, the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla, California built years ago, a boat called FLIP. And it's a really cool boat. And it was developed by the Office of Naval Research to do a acoustical work. And the reason for that is it looks like a big cigar, a big, long telephone pole. And then it's about 300-some-odd feet long. And it's towed out to sea, and then if floods tanks and it flips and it goes vertical.  And like an iceberg, most of it's underwater. But the part that's above water is very stable. And oceans cannot really excite it. As waves go by, you know, a big wave, a 30-foot wave, for example, would only make it move about three feet.  And, in fact, oil companies are now using that spar buoy concept for their offshore platforms. They've taken a bunch of these buoys and put them all together, and they built a platform out of them.  So it's very possible that we can build individual homes. I'd love to have a condominium that was offshore, and it's best on the West Coast, because you'd need about 300 feet of water for this to work.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. BALLARD: And you need - West Coast, it goes deep fast. And I've always thought, since I grew up in California, that it would be wonderful to have one of these off of Catalina or off of Los Angeles, look back at the skylight, but then have the privacy. And then take these 300-foot-long houses and actually grow aquaculture on the side. You can do all sorts of thermal exchanges for air conditioning. You can rotate it systematically so it's always seen - solar panels are always seeing the sun.  One of these days, you know, when I get present project out of my hair and into the hands of the next generation, I would like in my final - my wife's not so sure if she wants to live on it. But I got her to agreed at least vacation on it once in a while.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Well, Bob, you know, oceans are rising, right? I mean\u2026  Dr. BALARD: Absolutely.  FLATOW: \u2026we need to be ready for - have more kinds of ideas like this. Because even in the United States\u2026  Dr. BALLARD: Well, you know\u2026  FLATOW: \u2026isn't the water - we're going to be rising over the next century?  Dr. BALLARD: Well, it's going to be rising for a long, long time because all the ice is actually going to melt, unfortunately. It's going to not melt. Everything is going to melt. And sea level's going to rise.  But even if it doesn't rise, there's just so much real estate that's inhabitable. And you, know, you can build these in such a way that, you know, your bedroom is underwater, like it's a giant aquarium underwater, and you can then be up on the top. And I like say, you can control it so you're always in the shade on one side.  It's - I've actually done designs. I did a program with Alan Alda on the \"American Experience. \" And they actually - on PBS. And they actually created a beautiful model of my ship, and it's sort of cool. So if you want to learn more about it\u2026  FLATOW: There you go.  Dr. BALLARD: \u2026look up Alan Alda's program \"American Experience. \"  FLATOW: I just want to interrupt with a little news bulletin from the NPR News desk.  Alaska Governor Sarah Palin announced that she'll step down. She's resigning later this month, and she's handing all the reigns over to lieutenant governor. The lieutenant governor - we'll hear more about that in ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, following SCIENCE FRIDAY. So you'll want to stay tuned for that.  So where do you go now immediately, Bob? What's your next - you have the boat\u2026  Dr. BALLARD: Well, right now?  FLATOW: \u2026you have the boat going out, you have two boats. You have one that I'm near, with the Nautilus. You have the other one going to the Pacific?  Dr. BALLARD: That's right. Well, I'm taking - in fact, in the studio, here -I'm looking at him right now - is my son, Benjamin. And he's 15 years old. And he's been waiting and waiting and waiting. And I told him when he could first talk, and he said, dad, I want to go on one of your expeditions. And I said, Ben, you can't go till you're 15. Well, he's 15.  And so, he's going to be Jason Argonaut on our expedition. And he's going on a Nautilus with me in August on the maiden voyage out of the Bosporus into the Sea of Marmara and down to the Gallipoli. So that's my next expedition. We'll be in the Aegean, and then we're going to end it up in the Black Sea.  So I'm right now getting ready to go to Block Island so we can - we always go there as a family, and we love to live off the sea. And so we're going to do a lot of fishing and clamming and just enjoying New England. Finally, the sun actually comes out\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. BALLARD: \u2026once in a while this year. June was the most dreary June I've ever seen in my life.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: I know. I mean, Connecticut's right next door. We're talking with - I'm talking with Bob Ballard this hour on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  I know that - just in the couple of minutes I have left, tell me what's it like to have to be your own salesperson, right? You're an entrepreneur. You've spent your whole life\u2026  Dr. BALLARD: Yeah.  FLATOW: \u2026having to sell your ideas and then get them\u2026  Dr. BALLARD: Yeah, but then you get to live them.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. BALLARD: I think that comes with the turf. If you really want to be free, you're going to be alone. I mean, freedom is - most people said they want to be free, but real freedom is, you wake up and it's a blank sheet of paper. And most people would like to have it written.  And I love the freedom. I love dreaming up things. And fortunately, I have great sponsors like National Geographic, like the Navy, like NOAA, who bet on my horse over the years. And I just enjoy doing things that have never been done before. I enjoy the freedom of an explorer to literally go where no one has gone before. I'm confident that the Nautilus and the Okianis(ph) explorer are going to make incredible discoveries. How can we fail?  Most of my really important discoveries were done by accident. The discovery of hydrothermal vents, black smokers, et cetera, all were found while looking for something else. And when I think about how many wonderful discoveries we've made and then realized how little real estate we made them in, the potential for discovery on our planet is amazing. What's hard is to convince sponsors.  See, most sponsors want to know what you're going to discover and when. Well, those are sponsors I talked to very much because they don't understand. I can't tell you what I'm going to discover or when I'm going to discover it, but I can show you an incredible track record of making discoveries. And if you'll just bet on our horse, I'll bet you we're going to make discoveries. And so that's what we're off - the next year, to me, is going to be the year of ocean discovery because we finally, actually have ships that are dedicated to the process of exploring.  FLATOW: You don't have to borrow someone else's ship?  Dr. BALLARD: Nope. We got our own now.  FLATOW: Don't have to beg, borrow and steal. You have the resources.  Dr. BALLARD: We have the resources. And Congress has been very generous in this last go-around. The House and Senate were extremely generous in increasing - we hope. We have to go through conference between the House and Senate. And then President Obama has to sign it. But I think we have a group of people now in charge that actually get the - get it. They understand the importance of science and they understand the importance of exploration.  And so I'm very optimistic, because I believe many of our discoveries are going to have commercial impact upon our country. There's vast resources that have yet to be discovered. The Easter Bunny didn't put them just on the land part. There's vast resources to be discovered, living and non-living resources, pharmaceuticals, on the list goes.  So I'm confident that this process of discovery that we're just beginning will not only lead to great science and big discoveries and motivate kids to want to be explorers, but actually impact on the economy of our country.  FLATOW: Well, we wish great luck to you, Robert Ballard\u2026  Dr. BALLARD: Thank you.  FLATOW: \u2026in those - and we hope that we can be part of your discoveries, you'll come back and talk to us when you discover something new.  Dr. BALLARD: Well, stay tuned.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. BALLARD: The game has just begun, 'cause my best stuff is in front of me, not behind me.  FLATOW: The best is yet to come. All right. Thank you very much. Bob Ballard is the president of the Institute for Exploration and explore-in-residence for the National Geographic Society, also director of the Center for Ocean Exploration and Archeological Oceanography at the University of Rhode Island. Happy holiday to you, Bob.  Dr. BALLARD: Thank you, sir.  FLATOW: Good luck to you.  That's about all the time we have for our program today.

JON HAMILTON: You've seen the images, gray cross sections of the human head with vivid bursts of red or yellow showing where the brain seems to be responding to something. The pictures are so clear, so compelling, that even brain scientists like Chris Baker of the National Institutes of Health find them seductive. Dr. CHRIS BAKER (National Institutes of Health): I look at these images of people's brains and I stop and I think, this is really amazing. I'm actually finding a way to look at what's going on in the brain. HAMILTON: Then Baker starts thinking about all the ways these images can mislead a casual viewer. Most of the pretty pictures come from a technology called Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or fMRI. It detects tiny changes in the amount of oxygen carried by blood to brain cells. More oxygen generally means more brain activity. But it takes a whole lot of computer processing and human judgment to get from oxygen levels to a snapshot of love in the brain. Baker says the challenges begin the second you slide someone into a scanner and the machine starts looking for signals that suggest increased brain activity. Dr. BAKER: The problem with function imaging is that the signals we're trying to get at are quite weak and there's a lot of noise. HAMILTON: Noise as in irrelevant information, not actual sounds. Dr. BAKER: So one way to think about that is like listening to a radio station which has a lot of static. So, sometimes, you know, the noise will sort of obscure being able to hear the people, or even being able to pick up the station at all. HAMILTON: Some of the noise comes from the equipment itself. More static comes from the person in the scanner. Every heartbeat affects the flow of blood, which changes the signal. Every tiny head movement blurs the image. Then there's the noise from all the stuff the brain is doing that's not related to the experiment. And an fMRI study isn't as simple as listening to just one faint radio station from one place in the brain. Scientists want a three-dimensional map of activity throughout the brain. So a typical scan gathers data from 100,000 different places, and it's up to the researcher to decide which spots have something to say. Dr. BAKER: You're tuning the radio, looking across different frequencies. And for each frequency you go to, you're trying to pick up and see, was there really somebody speaking there? Did I hear a song at that particular point in time? HAMILTON: If so, what kind of song? Was it about love or rejection or nothing at all? Baker says the signals are often so weak that researchers have to stimulate a person's brain over and over again to see any pattern. Let's say you want to know which areas of the brain respond to faces, something Baker has actually investigated. Dr. BAKER: For the presentation of a single face, we may not be able to pick up anything at all. And typically, we're going to have to present lots and lots of faces to be able to sort of then look across all of those presentations, the faces, on average, do we see this increase in response? HAMILTON: Then they'll have to repeat the experiment on 15 or 20 more people to see if the same area lights up in everyone or not. And face recognition is a pretty simple brain process, compared with experiencing an emotion like love or telling a lie, which is why scientists are wary of scans that claim to identify these things. FMRI studies frequently produce billions of data points, many of which represent static, not a true signal. Baker says that with an ocean of noisy data, it's possible to find patterns produced purely by chance. Dr. BAKER: In the worst case scenario, there are situations in which you could apparently produce a signal out of just noise. HAMILTON: Baker doesn't think that happens very often, but he showed how it could in a recent paper published in Nature Neuroscience. That paper is one of two published this year that suggest the results of many fMRI studies aren't as robust as they appear. Hal Pashler, a professor of psychology and cognitive science at UC San Diego, is an author of the other paper. It was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science. Pashler says he and his co-authors wrote the paper because they were seeing results from fMRI studies that seemed just too good to be true. The team began to ask why and zeroed in on a statistical practice sometimes called double dipping - it's a kind of circular reasoning. Pashler says the easiest way to understand double dipping is to imagine something that has nothing to do with brain imaging. Professor HAL PASHLER (Psychology and Cognitive Science, University of California, San Diego): Suppose you wanted to figure out whether anyone in a town was able to predict the temperature three weeks from now. So you'd get everybody in a town, you get them all to make a prediction, then you come along three weeks later and you look at how well they did. So you might find there's 50 or 100 people who did just amazingly well. Maybe they got the temperature just spot on. HAMILTON: You might conclude that all of these people are just brilliant at predicting the temperature. But Pashler says that's probably not the case because some of the people probably got it right purely by chance. Prof. PASHLER: So if you test them again and have them do it again in six weeks, you're going to find that they'll do better than most people in the town. But they won't do as well as you think they did based on the data you collected when you first picked them out. HAMILTON: Pashler and Baker say that many fMRI studies do something a lot like this when they dip into the same data twice: once to pick out which parts of the brain are responding, and again to measure how strong the response is. The scientists say that's probably made a lot of results appear stronger than they really are. The papers criticizing fMRI studies have been the subject of furious debate in the neuroscience world. But even the strongest defenders of fMRI acknowledge there are problems and a need to exercise great caution when transforming messy data into tidy images. Pashler says it's not just the public that gets misled by overstated results. Prof. PASHLER: When you find that something that really matters, like anxiety or depression, is linked to some very specific hotspot in the brain, that's obviously a clue that investigators and funding agencies are going to use in deciding where to put their efforts in the future. HAMILTON: Pashler says that could mean some areas of the brain are getting attention they don't deserve, while other potentially important areas are being ignored, all because of images that aren't as clear as they seem.

It turned into the first-ever eight-way domino kidney transplant: eight donors, eight recipients, with surgeries performed in four hospitals over three weeks. Dr. Robert Montgomery coordinated the kidney exchange. He's director of the Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Transplant Center. Welcome to the program. Dr. ROBERT MONTGOMERY (Director, Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Transplant Center): Thank you. BLOCK: And Dr. Montgomery, why don't you explain how this domino donor chain works, starting with that first altruistic donor, Thomas Koontz. Dr. MONTGOMERY: The way the domino works is that you have an individual who does not have a designated recipient. In this case, it was Thomas Koontz, who basically said, I'll donate my kidney to anyone who needs it. And so, he gave his kidney to a patient whose sister had wanted to give a kidney to her but was unable to because they were incompatible. And so, Thomas essentially starts the dominos falling. So Thomas gave his kidney to that patient, and then that patient's sister gave a kidney to another patient, who also had an incompatible donor. And you can see then that this sets up a chain reaction. BLOCK: Now, most of the surgeries that we're talking about in this domino kidney transplant were performed there at Johns Hopkins. Others, though, at hospitals in St. Louis, Oklahoma City and Detroit. How did you coordinate all this with these three other hospitals in three other cities? Dr. MONTGOMERY: The kidneys were shuttled between the hospitals in both commercial airliners and charter airliners. So, it does involve a tremendous amount of coordination and a logistical support in order to pull something like this off. Now, we've been doing these domino-paired donations for about six years, and we have been drawing from our single-center pool of incompatible donors and recipients. But in recent years, we've started to cross-pollinate. In other words, we have done computer match runs that have included patients from other hospitals, and that's how this came about. BLOCK: How long can the kidneys be kept in between surgeries? Dr. MONTGOMERY: Generally speaking, live donor kidney transplants, at least up until this point, have had the donor and the recipient at the same hospital \u2014 and in fact, often in adjoining rooms \u2014 and the kidney comes out of the donor and is immediately transplanted into the recipient. Now, we looked at the database, and what we found was that there didn't seem to be any effect if the kidney had only been outside of the body for an hour or as long as eight hours. BLOCK: So, you still had to get those kidneys onto a plane and on their way pretty fast. Dr. MONTGOMERY: Exactly. BLOCK: Dr. Montgomery, somewhere in the middle of this chain, did you start getting confused and losing track of whose kidney was coming from whom and going to whom? Dr. MONTGOMERY: Well, you know, it's sort of like keeping track of your children. BLOCK: If you have a lot of children. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. MONTGOMERY: You know, we pay attention to detail. BLOCK: Well, I would hope so. Dr. MONTGOMERY: So, we have a system of multiple people checking the facts and the data over and over again. It's really not quite as difficult to keep it all together as you might imagine. BLOCK: Well, the last surgery in your chain was on July 6. How are the patients doing? Dr. MONTGOMERY: Patients are doing well. All of our patients are doing well, and the kidneys seem to be quite happy in their new home. BLOCK: These are happy kidneys, the kidneys are happy? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. MONTGOMERY: They're all working well. BLOCK: Well, Dr. Montgomery, thanks for talking with us. Dr. MONTGOMERY: Oh, happy to do it.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Today, at the meeting of G8 world leaders, the U. S. agreed to an important benchmark to limit climate change. It joined some other industrialized countries by agreeing that the globe should not warm up more than two degrees Celsius; that's 3. 6 degrees Fahrenheit. As NPR's Richard Harris reports, it's also an extremely ambitious goal. RICHARD HARRIS: Scientists assembled by the United Nations in 2007 said the world could face significant dangers if we warmed it up by more than two degrees Celsius. Europe is attempting to limit its emissions to prevent the Earth from heating up more than that. But until today, there was not a broader international consensus to limit global warming to two degrees. Mr. KIM CARSTENSEN (Leader, World Wildlife Fund Global Climate Initiative): This is something that we haven't seen the U. S. say before. It's also something we haven't seen Canada, Russia and Japan say before. So, in that sense, it is a step forward for the G8. HARRIS: Kim Carstensen from the World Wildlife Fund is at the G8 talks in Italy, and he was pleased to see that step forward even though the goal is an aspiration not legally binding, and words are easier than action. Mr. CARSTENSEN: What we need to see is what will this translate into in the shorter term. HARRIS: Countries are willing to agree to long-range goals over the coming decades, but it's much harder to get promises for short-term action to start moving in the right direction. Worse, China and India are expected to produce the lion's share of carbon dioxide in the coming decades, so Carstensen says they have to limit their emissions, too. Mr. CARSTENSEN: If you really take the level of ambition that is needed for the world, you need to have action in China and India also, and we need to see that action start pretty soon. HARRIS: But at the meeting in Italy, China and India have bluntly refused to cut their emissions. They want to see more, much more from the richer nations first. Now, the limit of two degrees Celsius arose out of a scientific consensus process. But David Archer at the University of Chicago says it's not a hard and fast danger point, more of a judgment call. Professor DAVID ARCHER (Department of the Geophysical Sciences, University of Chicago): Two degrees would make the Earth warmer than it's been in millions of years, and you know, that just seems kind of dangerous. HARRIS: That kind of warming could, for example, plunge the Southwestern United States and parts of Australia into permanent drought. In fact, the world's climate has already heated up by three-quarters of a degree since the start of the Industrial Revolution, and we're rapidly headed above one degree Celsius. Prof. ARCHER: I am frightened for the impact of one degree, so I don't want to be cavalier about staying within two. But certainly, limiting it to two is better than business as usual. HARRIS: And moving away from business as usual will demand a level of ambition far beyond what anyone has achieved so far. Richard Harris, NPR News.

If confirmed by the Senate, Francis Collins will take over an agency that spends more than $30 billion per year on biomedical research. He would come at a time of great opportunity for the NIH and also some big challenges. So we're going to talk about that this morning with NPR's science correspondent Jon Hamilton. Jon, good morning. JON HAMILTON: Good morning. INSKEEP: The science community knows who Francis Collins is. Tell the rest of us. HAMILTON: Well, this is that rare guy who is a big time scientist but he's also a good administrator and a good communicator. And he's shown pretty good ability to navigate some of the tricky politics that are involved in science. Early on in his career, he's known for finding the gene for cystic fibrosis and some other genes. But he's also probably best known because he was in charge of the government's effort to sequence the entire human genome - the human genome project a few years ago. And he got a lot of credit for that because it came in on time -actually, ahead of schedule and under budget. INSKEEP: You mentioned the tricky politics. Let me raise something that could be a little tricky in this situation. He's an evangelical Christian. Is that something that some people at the NIH are going to be concerned about? HAMILTON: I think there are some scientists who are concerned about it. On the other hand, he's pretty much of a known quantity to the scientists. He spent 15 years running one of the institutes out of the National Institutes of Health. So you have some kind of feeling for it. And at the time his religion never seemed to be an issue. He also has disavowed Creationism. He says he sees no conflict between his religious beliefs and the ability to carry out cutting edge science. INSKEEP: And let me be clear. There's nothing wrong with being an evangelical Christian. Obviously the question here is whether he would have a conflict between his beliefs and the beliefs of some other scientists. And you're saying there doesn't seem to be a big conflict as he sees the world. HAMILTON: No. And I think if there's anything that makes scientists uncomfortable, it's the fact that he's been very public in talking about it. He wrote a book about it and he speaks frequently about his faith. And I think there are some scientists who just - they don't understand how he can reconcile those two parts of his thinking. INSKEEP: But he does. HAMILTON: But he says he does. INSKEEP: Is this a good time to come in as head of the NIH? HAMILTON: Mostly, yes. I mean, you know, for years the NIH has had their budget at a sort of plateau. They've been going nowhere and there's been a lot of frustration among scientists that there's not enough money to do the things they want to do. But right now the NIH is about to get $10 billion - is getting $10 billion of stimulus money. So in the short term, at least, they have a lot of cash to spend and they're going to be able to make a lot of scientists happy. The question is what happens when that money runs out, because that's not built into their base budget. INSKEEP: So what can they do with that money? They're going to be spending more money looking into human DNA, looking into possible cures for diseases and that sort of thing? HAMILTON: Indeed. I mean, the problem at the NIH has been that they have stacks and stacks of things that they have deemed worthy research that they want to do that they've had to turn away because they don't have the money. So for instance, the other day I was out at the National Institute of Mental Health and they were talking about they have had all these projects in autism they've been wanting to take on, but they haven't had the money. Now suddenly they have the money and so they're racing to process all these programs. And it looks like there's going to be tens and tens of millions of dollars spent on autism research that wouldn't have happened without the stimulus package. INSKEEP: And if Francis Collins is confirmed, he's the guy who gets to spend the money. HAMILTON: Indeed. INSKEEP: Jon, thanks very much. HAMILTON: You're welcome. INSKEEP: That's NPR science correspondent Jon Hamilton.  STEVE INSKEEP, host:  President Obama has announced his choice to run the National Institutes of Health. If confirmed by the Senate, Francis Collins will take over an agency that spends more than $30 billion per year on biomedical research. He would come at a time of great opportunity for the NIH and also some big challenges. So we're going to talk about that this morning with NPR's science correspondent Jon Hamilton.  Jon, good morning.  JON HAMILTON: Good morning.  INSKEEP: The science community knows who Francis Collins is. Tell the rest of us.  HAMILTON: Well, this is that rare guy who is a big time scientist but he's also a good administrator and a good communicator. And he's shown pretty good ability to navigate some of the tricky politics that are involved in science. Early on in his career, he's known for finding the gene for cystic fibrosis and some other genes.  But he's also probably best known because he was in charge of the government's effort to sequence the entire human genome - the human genome project a few years ago. And he got a lot of credit for that because it came in on time -actually, ahead of schedule and under budget.  INSKEEP: You mentioned the tricky politics. Let me raise something that could be a little tricky in this situation. He's an evangelical Christian. Is that something that some people at the NIH are going to be concerned about?  HAMILTON: I think there are some scientists who are concerned about it. On the other hand, he's pretty much of a known quantity to the scientists. He spent 15 years running one of the institutes out of the National Institutes of Health. So you have some kind of feeling for it. And at the time his religion never seemed to be an issue.  He also has disavowed Creationism. He says he sees no conflict between his religious beliefs and the ability to carry out cutting edge science.  INSKEEP: And let me be clear. There's nothing wrong with being an evangelical Christian. Obviously the question here is whether he would have a conflict between his beliefs and the beliefs of some other scientists. And you're saying there doesn't seem to be a big conflict as he sees the world.  HAMILTON: No. And I think if there's anything that makes scientists uncomfortable, it's the fact that he's been very public in talking about it. He wrote a book about it and he speaks frequently about his faith. And I think there are some scientists who just - they don't understand how he can reconcile those two parts of his thinking.  INSKEEP: But he does.  HAMILTON: But he says he does.  INSKEEP: Is this a good time to come in as head of the NIH?  HAMILTON: Mostly, yes. I mean, you know, for years the NIH has had their budget at a sort of plateau. They've been going nowhere and there's been a lot of frustration among scientists that there's not enough money to do the things they want to do.  But right now the NIH is about to get $10 billion - is getting $10 billion of stimulus money. So in the short term, at least, they have a lot of cash to spend and they're going to be able to make a lot of scientists happy. The question is what happens when that money runs out, because that's not built into their base budget.  INSKEEP: So what can they do with that money? They're going to be spending more money looking into human DNA, looking into possible cures for diseases and that sort of thing?  HAMILTON: Indeed. I mean, the problem at the NIH has been that they have stacks and stacks of things that they have deemed worthy research that they want to do that they've had to turn away because they don't have the money.  So for instance, the other day I was out at the National Institute of Mental Health and they were talking about they have had all these projects in autism they've been wanting to take on, but they haven't had the money. Now suddenly they have the money and so they're racing to process all these programs. And it looks like there's going to be tens and tens of millions of dollars spent on autism research that wouldn't have happened without the stimulus package.  INSKEEP: And if Francis Collins is confirmed, he's the guy who gets to spend the money.  HAMILTON: Indeed.  INSKEEP: Jon, thanks very much.  HAMILTON: You're welcome.

One thing hasn't changed, and that's a ban on using federal dollars to create new human embryonic stem cell lines. That ban has been in place for nearly 15 years. Congress and President Obama have shown little interest in changing it. So that leaves new lines to be created in the private sector or in the states. But it's expensive, and few researchers are doing it. From member station KQED in San Francisco, Sarah Varney reports. SARAH VARNEY: Here's the prologue to this story. In 2001, President Bush, who opposed human embryonic stem cell research, limited federal funding to less than two dozen stem cell lines then in existence. Scientists chafed at the new rules, and the pace of the research slowed. When President Obama took office, he lifted most of the Bush-era restrictions. Scientists can now use federal funds to study any human embryonic stem cell line - and there are hundreds - as long as the lines meet certain ethical standards. The National Institutes of Health laid out those standards last week. Researchers can only work on lines derived from embryos that would have been discarded anyway after in vitro fertilization, and from donors who give consent. Most scientists applauded the news. But Susan Fisher, a leading stem cell researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, says there is still a significant barrier to stem cell research. Dr. SUSAN FISHER (Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research Center, University of California, San Francisco): The new regulations have done absolutely nothing to change our ability to make those cell lines. VARNEY: Fisher made many of the lines that other scientists will now be able to study, and she did it without any federal money. That's because Congress has long banned the use of government funds for any research that involves destroying a human embryo, and the new Obama guidelines haven't changed that. In other words, scientists can now use NIH money to study human embryonic stem cell lines, but only after someone else has already paid to make them. And deriving a new cell line is expensive, says Fisher. It's an intricate, highly specialized process that involves careful oversight, pricey lab materials and clinical expertise. Dr. FISHER: So, when you come right down to the bottom line, it really takes millions of dollars to derive and bank and distribute new stem cell lines. VARNEY: Just a handful of labs in the U. S. make new human embryonic stem cell lines. Most of them are in California. That's because California voters agreed to spend $3 billion funding the kind of research that President Bush had restricted. Though there are no hard numbers, the state appears to be the nation's largest source of funding for making embryonic stem cell lines. But with hundreds of lines already made, why do scientists need to make more? UCSF's Susan Fisher says one reason is the cell lines are finicky. Dr. FISHER: Most investigators now think that human embryonic stem cells that have been in culture for extended periods of time accumulate errors. It's almost like a hard drive that pretty soon, it becomes useless. VARNEY: But opponents of this kind of research argue there are other ways to create cell lines without destroying embryos. And indeed, stem cell researchers are in a bit of a frenzy over the discovery of what are called induced pluripotent stem cells. They're made from adult skin cells that, with a bit of chemical jujitsu, can be turned back into an embryonic-like state. The director of UCSF's stem cell program, Arnold Kriegstein, says much is yet to be learned about these modified cells. Dr. ARNOLD KRIEGSTEIN (Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, University of California, San Francisco): In the end, you might wind up with a cell type that doesn't really resemble what that cell type was like in the original patient. We just don't know enough about that yet. Embryonic stem cells give a much more faithful representation of what those cell types are. And so at this point, they still remain the gold standard that we have to compare these newer cell lines to. VARNEY: With the Bush-era restrictions lifted, Kriegstein says scientists around the country are anxious to get their hands on the cell lines UCSF is creating. Indeed, Susan Fisher says her phone hasn't stopped ringing. But with Congress seemingly uninterested in lifting the ban on federal support for research that directly destroys embryos, California taxpayers will continue to foot the bill.

They were beginning the historic Apollo 11 mission, the first manned voyage ever to reach the surface of the moon. Mr. NEIL ARMSTRONG (Astronaut): It's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. INSKEEP: Hundreds of millions of people watched on television as Neil Armstrong took that first step. But the pictures that people saw were dark and fuzzy. The astronauts actually sent back better images - higher-quality footage that was recorded by engineers on earth. But three years ago, NPR reported that those original tapes were missing. Our report helped to trigger an exhaustive search by NASA. And NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce recently got an exclusive sneak peek at the 1969 moonwalk like you have never seen it before. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: Stan Lebar is almost 84 years old. Decades ago, he led a team that designed and built a TV camera that is currently on the moon, right where the Apollo 11 astronauts left it. Lebar says his camera actually captured better images of their moonwalk than people saw on TV. Mr. STAN LEBAR: It was better. We knew it was better. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But the lunar camera recorded in an odd format that was incompatible with the normal TV format. So when the footage was received on Earth, it had to be converted for broadcast. The conversion degraded the image. However, engineers on the ground did record the unconverted raw footage onto tapes. Lebar and some colleagues recently decided to go back and look at those tapes. Mr. LEBAR: The whole thing started with the idea that this is the one piece of television footage that's going to be played for the next 50 or 100 or 300 years. Those that follow us deserve better than what we had. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But the tapes were missing. For the last three years, a monumental search has been underway. Mr. LEBAR: We had hundreds and hundreds of leads coming to us during this period. Every one of them was investigated. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Lebar and other searchers spent hours and hours in a vast government storage facility known as the Washington National Records Center, something that sounds like the giant warehouse at the end of the movie \"Raiders of the Lost Ark. \" Mr. DICK NAFZGER (TV Specialist, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center): Stacked with racks of documents, tapes, all kinds of things from NASA and other agencies. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Dick Nafzger is a TV specialist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. He became the unofficial leader of the search team. He says they also went to remote storage facilities, to private homes. They poured over log books and memos and all kinds of 40-year-old handwritten records. Mr. NAFZGER: We went through old file cabinets that would have little record cards, and it gave you an idea if a shipment went in with the name Apollo on it, and did it have Apollo or tape, or did it have anything on there that could be a tape. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They returned again and again to that vast government warehouse. But then they discovered something disturbing: Over the years, NASA had removed massive numbers of magnetic tapes from the shelves. Between 1981 to 1983, NASA permanently withdrew over 40,000 boxes. Why? Lebar says new satellites had gone up. The satellites were producing a lot of data that needed to be recorded. Mr. LEBAR: These satellites were suddenly using tapes seven days a week, 24 hours a day. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And the agency was experiencing a critical shortage of magnetic tapes. So, NASA started erasing old ones and reusing them. That's probably what happened to the original footage from the moon that the astronauts took with Lebar's camera. Mr. LEBAR: So, I don't believe that the tapes exist today at all. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I mean, are you sad about that? Mr. LEBAR: Yeah. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. LEBAR: Well, it was a hard thing to accept, but there was just an overwhelming amount of evidence that led us to believe that they just don't exist anymore. And you have to accept reality. GREENFIELDBOYCE: You may have to accept reality, but that doesn't mean you have to give into it. Nafzger says, look, they started his search with one goal. Mr. NAFZGER: Our goal was to provide to the world the best possible video of a historic event we could for the future. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Since the raw footage was gone, the team decided to try to find the best of what was preserved in the converted broadcast format. Nafzger says they looked through tapes in Australia, tapes in the CBS News archive, stuff no one had looked at in decades. Mr. NAFZGER: We found immediately that just because it was broadcast didn't mean it was similar quality, that the quality of broadcast TV in the existence in 1969 broadcast TV was varied extremely between sources. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Using all of these sources, they pieced together the best possible version of the moonwalk. And then, to make it even better, they turned to the magic of Hollywood. Mr. NAFZGER: We had been in contact at that point with a company called Lowry Digital in California. Mr. JOHN LOWRY (Founder, Lowry Digital): They contacted me at Lowry Digital here in Burbank with the objective of can this material be restored. GREENFIELDBOYCE: John Lowry has a lot of experience doing high-quality digital restorations of old films. Mr. LOWRY: Such as old \"Bambi,\" \"Cinderella,\" \"Lady and the Tramp,\" 20 James Bond movies. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And the \"Star Wars\" films, just to name a few. Early in his career, Lowry had actually worked on footage from later Apollo missions, so he was excited to have the chance to work on the first moonwalk. Over a hundred computers processed the images, carefully removing things like random noise and camera shake without destroying the images' historical legitimacy. Mr. LOWRY: We've got to very, very mindful of history. If you want to go to the extreme, you could take these images and completely recreate them. You could create a three-dimensional model of the lunar lander and you could make it look beautiful. But I don't think that's the point. I think the point is that Apollo 11 was a very, very special historical event. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Last week, at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Dick Nafzger sat down at a computer loaded with the restored video, which he'd just received from California the day before. He called up a side-by-side comparison of the old and new. On the left side of his monitor was the dark, murky footage of Neil Armstrong coming down the ladder of his LEM spacecraft, about to make his first step. Mr. NAFZGER: As you can see on the left, there's nothing but a dark image and possibly a foot. If I told you it was a foot, you'd probably say, okay, it must be a foot. GREENFIELDBOYCE: On the right hand of his screen was the new version. MR. NAFZGER: You can see the structure of the LEM. You can see his full outline of his body and his helmet, a reflection in his helmet. It's still not pristine. It's not clean and detailed, but it's now an astronaut, and it's something no one saw before. This is the first step on the moon. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The restoration won't be complete until the fall. But NASA is releasing some short clips today to mark the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11 blasting off of earth towards its moment in history. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

In this case the little guy is a moth. A species of tiger moth in the Southwestern United States apparently learned to confuse a dangerous predator. Bats are among nature's cleverest predators, using ultrasonic signals to locate their prey at night. They make quick work of moths. But just as guerilla fighters find ways to evade the superior technology of a large army, one species of tiger moths seems to be jamming the signals of enemy bats. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports on an ultrasonic aerial war. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: In the bat-eat-moth world of the summer night, moths are at a distinct disadvantage. Bats can locate and snap up a moth out of midair with the greatest of ease. They use what biologists consider to be one of the animal world's most efficient tools of prey: ultrasonic signals that work like sonar. But Aaron Corcoran, a graduate student at Wake Forest University, was intrigued by a species of moth that also makes ultrasonic sounds. He wondered if this was some kind of bat deterrent. The moth, an orange species with a four-inch wingspan called Bertholdia trigona, has organs on its body called tymbals. Mr. AARON CORCORAN (Wake Forest University): This tymbal kind of works like a pop can, that if you push in on the side of a pop can, it will make a click, and then as it releases out it makes another click. We've measured up to 450 clicks in a tenth of a second. That's a tremendous amount of sound that this moth is making. JOYCE: Corcoran removed the tymbals from some of these moths and then tethered the insects - that's right, tethered them - with fishing line, so they could fly, but not too far. He brought in a bat and filmed what happened. The sounds have been slowed down so the human ear can hear them. Mr. CORCORAN: As a bat is flying around, it's constantly making chirps and listening for the echoes. (Soundbite of chirping) Mr. CORCORAN: And as it closes in on the insect, it increases the repetition rate with which it's making those sounds. (Soundbite of chirping) JOYCE: The tethered moths, the ones that could not click, got eaten. No problem at all for the bats. So what about an intact moth with its tymbals clicking away as the bat closes in? Corcoran tethered up some of these moths. Mr. CORCORAN: You hear the bat going through its normal progression and then starting to speed up. And then the moth turns on its sound production, which sounds almost like a siren because the pitch is going up and down. At that point the bat does something very abnormal: it starts slowing down its repetition rate, the opposite of what it would normally be doing. JOYCE: Here's what it sounds like. The rattle-like sound is the moth clicking. (Soundbite of chirping and clicking) JOYCE: As soon as the rattle started, the bat got confused and missed the moth. This kept happening, over and over, until the bat finally gave up and crawled back to its cage. Corcoran, who published his findings in the journal Science, ran the experiment several times with the same results. He's ruled out the idea that the sound just startles bats. The bats would have grown used to that and eventually had more success. Corcoran and his colleagues think it's some kind of ultrasonic jamming. Mr. CORCORAN: What appears most likely is that the clicks are interfering with the bats' neural processing of the echoes that are coming back. JOYCE: Corcoran says if you live in the southwestern U. S. , you just might catch some of this aerial action underneath a streetlight at night. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

STEVE INSKEEP, host:  Think of this next report of the triumph of the little guy. In this case the little guy is a moth. A species of tiger moth in the Southwestern United States apparently learned to confuse a dangerous predator.  Bats are among nature's cleverest predators, using ultrasonic signals to locate their prey at night. They make quick work of moths. But just as guerilla fighters find ways to evade the superior technology of a large army, one species of tiger moths seems to be jamming the signals of enemy bats. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports on an ultrasonic aerial war.  CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: In the bat-eat-moth world of the summer night, moths are at a distinct disadvantage. Bats can locate and snap up a moth out of midair with the greatest of ease. They use what biologists consider to be one of the animal world's most efficient tools of prey: ultrasonic signals that work like sonar.  But Aaron Corcoran, a graduate student at Wake Forest University, was intrigued by a species of moth that also makes ultrasonic sounds. He wondered if this was some kind of bat deterrent. The moth, an orange species with a four-inch wingspan called Bertholdia trigona, has organs on its body called tymbals.  Mr. AARON CORCORAN (Wake Forest University): This tymbal kind of works like a pop can, that if you push in on the side of a pop can, it will make a click, and then as it releases out it makes another click. We've measured up to 450 clicks in a tenth of a second. That's a tremendous amount of sound that this moth is making.  JOYCE: Corcoran removed the tymbals from some of these moths and then tethered the insects - that's right, tethered them - with fishing line, so they could fly, but not too far. He brought in a bat and filmed what happened. The sounds have been slowed down so the human ear can hear them.  Mr. CORCORAN: As a bat is flying around, it's constantly making chirps and listening for the echoes.  (Soundbite of chirping)  Mr. CORCORAN: And as it closes in on the insect, it increases the repetition rate with which it's making those sounds.

Here in Southern California, we're having a heat wave, temperatures in the 90s, the 100s in some places. I know I shouldn't complain because, well, the weather here is usually perfect, and it's summer after all. It's supposed to be hot. Still, a lot of us are wondering: How much heat can a person stand? Well, here's an answer from our science correspondent Robert Krulwich. ROBERT KRULWICH: Our subject is: When it's even hotter than frying-eggs-on-the-sidewalk hot\u2026 (Soundbite of frying egg) Bernd, are you there? Professor BERND HEINRICH (Biology, University of Vermont; Author, \"Summer World\"): Yeah, I'm there, Robert. KRULWICH: Okay, Bernd Heinrich, esteemed biology professor from the University of Vermont, let's begin with a fact most people know. Water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit when you're down at sea level. Prof. HEINRICH: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. KRULWICH: So you've got to wonder: What would happen if you, say, stepped into a room heated to 211 degrees, just a single degree shy of boiling, and then ever so slowly, you made that room just a little bit hotter? Would your blood start to boil? In your book \"Summer World,\" you describe how once somebody actually tried this. Prof. HEINRICH: Yup, yup. (Soundbite of music) KRULWICH: More than 230 years ago, around 1775 at the Royal Society in London, three very prominent gentlemen - Sir Charles Blagden, doctor and chemist, Sir Joseph Banks, botanist and explorer, and Dr. Daniel Solander, naturalist, also an explorer - they decided to conduct a heat experiment inside a room of their own design. Prof. HEINRICH: A small room, oh, 10, 15 feet or something like that square, and they put a metal stove in there, and they got heating it red-hot, and so they conducted experiments and observation in a heated room. KRULWICH: And those experiments, says Professor Heinrich, began with the room at 210 degrees. Then they moved it up to 211. And one by one, the gentlemen entered, reported it unpleasantly hot but very bearable. So they made the room hotter, to 212, to 220, to 230. Prof. HEINRICH: They got it up to 240 or even more, yeah, 30 or more points above the boiling point of water. KRULWICH: And Sir Charles, was he\u2026 Prof. HEINRICH: Blagden stayed apparently eight minutes at 240 degrees, and afterwards, he felt he could have actually stayed even longer. So this is amazing thing, but there are certain conditions that are involved here. KRULWICH: First of all, the air in that room was dry, not wet heat. It was dry heat. Then, the gentlemen didn't move around hardly at all, and third, and this is the most important, Sir Charles reported almost immediately he began sweating. Prof. HEINRICH: Sweating profusely. KRULWICH: And why is that important? Prof. HEINRICH: Well, the sweat is removing heat. KRULWICH: Meaning, when you sweat, and then the sweat evaporates, that act of evaporation pulls heat away from your skin. When water on your skin turns to gas, the heat gets removed. So you sweat some more, then there's more evaporation, and as long as you keep up this sweating, evaporating, sweating, evaporating, the air right round your skin never gets too hot because evaporation protects you. Prof. HEINRICH: So that tiny, thin layer of air right next to your skin, maybe it's only a millimeter or so, that little space is being cooled. KRULWICH: And that's what keeps you from burning or boiling? Prof. HEINRICH: Yeah, by your body temperature, by the evaporating water, we can cool the whole body through the sweating. KRULWICH: But what happens if you can't sweat? Well, to find that out without doing anybody serious harm, Sir Charles brought a chicken egg - chicken eggs, after all, don't sweat - into the room with him. And what happened to the egg? Prof. HEINRICH: Well, it was cooked solid because the egg doesn't sweat. Of course, a beef steak can evaporate water for quite a while. KRULWICH: Boy, I did forget. They also did bring a juicy beef steak into the room. Prof. HEINRICH: But the beef steak, in 33 minutes, got dry, and then it got really hot, and then it cooked. KRULWICH: So this is a hooray-for-sweat story is what this is. Prof. HEINRICH: Exactly. It shows the power of sweating, which is an amazing power that humans have. (Soundbite of dog growling) KRULWICH: Well, let's be careful here because I understand there was a non-human involved. Prof. HEINRICH: Well, they had a 32-pound bitch. By that, they mean a little\u2026 KRULWICH: Being a family radio station, we have to ask you to explain that. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. HEINRICH: Well, that's a female dog. KRULWICH: Okay. So they bring a dog with them. Prof. HEINRICH: Yeah, and the dog stays in there at 220 degrees Fahrenheit for half an hour, and actually during that time it's in there, the temperature rises to 236 and the dog comes out, it's panting, but it's perfectly all right. KRULWICH: And one month later, says Sir Charles, the dog was still perfectly brisk, showing that if you cool yourself either on the inside through panting or on the outside through sweating, either way, it is apparently possible to survive temperatures, at least for a little while, that would normally boil water. Robert Krulwich, NPR News. BRAND: We've recreated that original experiment with the gentlemen, the eggs, the beef steak and, yes, the dog in an animation at our Web site, npr. org, and bring a towel.

Toucans have enormous ungainly beaks, the biggest in the animal kingdom when you take into account the size of that bird. If you've ever wondered what good that bill is, here's a surprising new answer. It can work like your car's radiator. NPR's Richard Harris explains. RICHARD HARRIS: Biologist Glenn Tattersall works at Brock University in chilly Ontario. So you can hardly be surprised that he tries to spend at least a month a year doing his field work in the tropics. One of the creatures that draws him there is the toucan with its enormous colorful bill. Dr. GLENN TATTERSALL (Biology, Brock University): You can't help but look at them and really wonder what they're thinking when they have this - just to see the way they have to cope with having such a large bill. HARRIS: Charles Darwin suggested the ornate bill was all about, shall we say, courtship. Others have suggested the long bill is a fruit-picking device to improve the bird's reach up in the trees. But any field biologist who has ever held a toucan has noticed something else about the bill. Dr. TATTERSALL: You can feel it with your hand. If you held the bill, you could feel the warmth from it. HARRIS: That got Tattersall and his colleagues wondering, could the bill actually be part of how toucans keep themselves at a comfortable temperature? Dr. TATTERSALL: The initial question was not that the bill could be used as a radiator, because we knew that it was warm, we wanted to know whether it could be shut down. HARRIS: Can toucans turn it on and off, and by so doing, regulate their body temperature? Elephants keep their cool by controlling blood flow to their ears, so this is not a crazy idea. To find out, Tattersall decided to use his infrared camera - the same kind that the military and cops use for night surveillance - to measure changes in heat flow from the toucan's bill. In one experiment he described in Science Magazine, Tattersall chased the bird around a very large cage for about 10 minutes. He wanted to see whether the bird's bill would heat up to keep it cool as it exerted itself. And yes indeed, it did. Dr. TATTERSALL: It went from air temperature to essentially body temperature. HARRIS: So, do you think the bill evolved for the purpose of being a radiator? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. TATTERSALL: I doubt that that's the case. HARRIS: So, then that sort of begs the question, doesn't - why does the toucan have the giant bill if it didn't evolve to keep the bird cold? Dr. TATTERSALL: Yep. Well, sadly, is we still don't have the answer to that question. HARRIS: That's really more a question for an evolutionary biologist like Jason Weckstein at the Field Museum in Chicago. He agrees that the enormous bill probably did not evolve to keep the birds cool, even though it now serves that purpose. Dr. JASON WECKSTEIN (Biologist, Field Museum): If birds really need radiators like this, why don't we see these crazy, wild, ungainly bills more commonly in birds that are living in similar environments to toucans? HARRIS: Weckstein says the bill may have evolved along with other social traits in toucans. It turns out that toucans tend not to be the go-along and get-along sorts of creatures. Many are actually quite aggressive with one another. And Weckstein says gaudy, big bills are part of this shtick. Dr. WECKSTEIN: Toucans that have the largest bills are kind of the most social birds that are most likely to have these kind of aggressive displays. HARRIS: Weckstein, believe it or not, actually studies not only toucans, but the lice that live on them. And here, he says, the bill is clearly a liability. Dr. WECKSTEIN: It turns out that big-billed birds are really bad at getting parasites off of them. HARRIS: So, what's interesting about lice? Who would want to study lice on a toucan? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. WECKSTEIN: That's what my wife always asks me. (Soundbite of laughter) HARRIS: He actually has a pretty good answer to that question, but oops, we're out of time.

ANTHONY WESLEY: Good evening, Linda. Thank you. WERTHEIMER: So what did it look like to you? What did you think you were looking at? WESLEY: When I first saw this black spot near Jupiter's south pole, the first thing that comes to mind is that it's probably the shadow being cast by one of Jupiter's moons. However, after a few minutes of looking at this on Sunday night it became clear that this shadow was the wrong shape and it was in the wrong place to be one of the moons. WERTHEIMER: What do you think caused it? WESLEY: Well, the most likely cause was a comet. Probably a comet no more than one kilometer across traveling at something like 50 to 100 kilometers per second in order to leave a mark which is now spread out to an area approximately the size of the Earth on Jupiter's clouds. WERTHEIMER: What is it about Jupiter that a comet could leave a big, big impact mark like that? WESLEY: So a comet or an asteroid coming in from above moving at incredibly high speed will plow into this atmosphere and explode with great force, much more force than if it had hit a solid body where a lot of the energy would just be dissipated. The black material that we're seeing is a combination of the leftover debris from this explosion and also dark cloud and dark gas that's been brought up from inside Jupiter's atmosphere. WERTHEIMER: This is not the only comet to hit Jupiter. I understand there was one just 15 years ago. Why do comets slam into Jupiter but they haven't hit the Earth anything like as recently as 15 years ago? WESLEY: The Earth is really a very, very small target by comparison. And it would be a very infrequent event, perhaps a hundred to millions or billions of years apart for the Earth to be hit by a comet. WERTHEIMER: Mr. Wesley, what's been the reaction to the fact that an amateur astronomer saw something that all the big telescopes and observatories and whatnot did not see? WESLEY: I think it's a great boon for the professional organizations such as NASA that they know that on any given night there's an army of amateur astronomers with telescopes and cameras monitoring not just Jupiter but other planets as well, such as Venus and Saturn. WERTHEIMER: Thanks very much. WESLEY: Oh, my pleasure. Thank you. WERTHEIMER: This is NPR News. LINDA WERTHEIMER, Host:  Mr. Wesley, welcome. ANTHONY WESLEY: Good evening, Linda. Thank you.

WESLEY: So a comet or an asteroid coming in from above moving at incredibly high speed will plow into this atmosphere and explode with great force, much more force than if it had hit a solid body where a lot of the energy would just be dissipated. The black material that we're seeing is a combination of the leftover debris from this explosion and also dark cloud and dark gas that's been brought up from inside Jupiter's atmosphere. WERTHEIMER: This is not the only comet to hit Jupiter. I understand there was one just 15 years ago. Why do comets slam into Jupiter but they haven't hit the Earth anything like as recently as 15 years ago? WESLEY: The Earth is really a very, very small target by comparison. And it would be a very infrequent event, perhaps a hundred to millions or billions of years apart for the Earth to be hit by a comet. WERTHEIMER: Mr. Wesley, what's been the reaction to the fact that an amateur astronomer saw something that all the big telescopes and observatories and whatnot did not see? WESLEY: I think it's a great boon for the professional organizations such as NASA that they know that on any given night there's an army of amateur astronomers with telescopes and cameras monitoring not just Jupiter but other planets as well, such as Venus and Saturn.

I'm Paul Raeburn, sitting in for Ira Flatow. From the time your alarm clock rang today, you've probably made thousands of decisions. The first was whether to hit the snooze button. Some of the decisions are big and deliberate. Do I actually go to work today or do I stay home and listen to SCIENCE FRIDAY? Others are miniscule and mostly unconscious, putting the toothpaste down on the right side of sink instead to the left or deciding to quickly and unconsciously scratch that mosquito bite on your elbow. In the last few decades, psychologists, neuroscientists, even economists have been trying to pull back the curtain on our brains to see what's going on when we make these decisions, large or small, figuring out for example why someone would decide on Coke instead of Pepsi, could mean millions of dollars for someone in the soda business. If you're a lawyer, it could be a question of life or death for your client. How does a juror decide whether to convict? For the first part of this hour, we'll talk with three researchers studying decision making. If you want to get a piece of the conversation, give us a call. Our number is 1-800-989-8255, that's 1-800-989-talk. If you're on Twitter, you can twit us your questions by writing the @ sign followed by Scifri. And if you want more information about what we're talking about this hour, go to our Web site at, www. sciencefriday. com, where you'll find links to our topic. Now I'd like to introduce my quests. Michael Frank is assistant professor of cognitive and linguistic science, psychology and psychiatry. He is director of the Laboratory for Neural Computation and Cognition at the Brown University Institute for Brain Science. He joins us today from Providence, Rhode Island. Thanks for being with us, Dr. Frank. Dr. MICHAEL J. FRANK (Assistant Professor, Cognitive & Linguistic Sciences; Director, Laboratory for Neural Computation and Cognition, Brown University Institute for Brain Science): I'm very happy to be here. RAEBURN: Jennifer S. Lerner is a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, director of the Decision Science Laboratory at Harvard University. Thanks for talking to us today, Dr. Lerner. Dr. JENNIFER S. LERNER (Professor, Harvard Kennedy School; Director, Decision Science Laboratory, Harvard University): I'm pleased to be here, thanks. RAEBURN: And Colin Camerer is the Robert Kirby Professor of Behavioral Economics at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. Thanks to you too for joining us. Professor COLIN CAMERER (Behavioral Economics, California Institute of Technology): My pleasure. RAEBURN: Again, our number is 1-800-989-8255. Give us a call. Colin Camerer, what are you economists doing messing around with the psychologists and neuroscientists? Prof. CAMERER: Well, I would say trying to reform economics in the sense that the standard economics theory that was developed mathematically starting around 1950s, and which continues to be taught and subject of every exam and also guides a lot of policies, is that people know what they want; they optimize by choosing the right - spend the right amount of time and money on things, even when decisions are very complicated - hundreds of mutual fund choices, distant - there are words are distant like at age 25, you'd have to choose a package that will give you a term and funds when you're in your 70s, and there are very complicated probabilities to calculate it or in some cases, what we call ambiguity, we really know very little about the probability. So, the economic model has been a very mathematical stylized, kind of Martha Stewart meets Mr. Spock on emotional calculating caricature. And it may apply in some cases but often not. It's not a great model of human nature to build the entire social science on. So, what we've been trying to do, is to really import psychology and the increasing (unintelligible) looking directly at brain function when people are making somewhat complicated economic choices. RAEBURN: Now, people talk about - what you're talking about I think is behavioral economics or neuroeconomics, what do these terms mean? Prof. CAMERER: So, behavioral economics takes the idea that people have some normal limits - not pathological limits, although pathology is useful to understand general mechanisms - normal limits on how much they can compute and figure out on greed and on willpower, and try to put those in mathematical terms that kind of soften this sharp caricature of perfect rationality that's been the standard theory. Behavioral economics basically doesn't say very much about detailed brain mechanisms, neuroeconomics does. RAEBURN: Can you do something with the psychology, with mathematics or do you have to abandon the mathematics and use a different approach altogether? Prof. CAMERER: No, in fact, I think one of the - one of the biggest innovations is that, first the mathematics just becomes harder. But that's actually great because there are a lot of mathematical economists who've figured out all the simple stuff and are actually enjoying the challenge nowadays, or trying to mathematize something like envy or social influence. RAEBURN: So, harder becomes harder just because these things are so difficult to quantify. Prof. CAMERER: Yes, exactly. And also there's a lot of different possible avenues, something like the things we're talking about, willpower, addiction, exploration. Michal will talk about, often there are, you know, there are a lot of dimensions and you have to kind of comment to a particular approach. So, typically, for example, nowadays economists are very interested in modeling self control, and there's not a single mathematical model, there are several. So then the ball goes in the court of empiricist to say, which are these seems to be on the right track? RAEBURN: Michael Frank, it was your paper in Nature and Neuroscience that prompted this conversation today. Tell us a little bit about that. What did you find? Dr. FRANK: Well, people have an automatic tendency, based on strong drives at the motivational system, to choose actions that have been associated with good outcomes in the past and to avoid those that had negative outcomes. That's of course, and adaptive thing to do. But, sometimes we don't know, really, what the best outcome is from our actions until we try other actions, essentially until we explore. And then we have to override this basic reinforcement system in order to gain more information and to explore when we're more uncertain. So, we found was that people who'd a particular gene variation - their DNA - were more likely to export choices that had uncertain outcomes than those who had the other form of the gene. RAEBURN: So, if choice that has an uncertain outcome, what would be an example of that? Dr. FRANK: So, one example would be if you're just used to going to the same restaurant again and again, and you kind of enjoy it, but you have lots of other options out there and you're not sure whether you're actually going to like the other option or you might not like the other option. So, the more you're uncertain about that, the less you know about it or the more variability that you have in your experience is where the particular choice that you might make, the more uncertain you are both that and then in order to gain more information to find out whether it's actually better than what you've been doing before. That's the condition where you might want to explore. RAEBURN: So, when I'm deciding whether to go to my favorite restaurant or to try this new restaurant, you're telling me that seems like a fairly trivial thing that wouldn't require a whole lot of computing power up in my head. But you're telling me that it does require enough to at least be encoded partly in our genes. Dr. FRANK: Right. I mean essentially you have to compute a lot of the things, you're not actually computing, explicitly in your head. You're not sort of measuring in your head exactly how much other uncertainty you have about going to a particular restaurant or anything. But, an example that I like to give sometimes, is if you're faced with choosing - like you had in your introduction, salmon versus steak - you might have chosen both of those in the past many times and what you go on, which one you chose on a given day, might depend on your sort of integrated experience of all the times you've had steak or all the times you'd salmon in the past, together with a bunch of other contextual factors, of course. But it's not like you're remembering each individual instance which you had salmon or which you had steak. Instead your brain essentially is remembering that in one sort of integrated value. But the computations necessary to compute that integrated value is a function of your past experience, of course, require complex brain mechanisms which themselves are influenced by the gene. And similarly the computations of how uncertain you are about that value are also influenced by brain mechanisms. RAEBURN: I'm little afraid of what we think about this too much. I'm not going to have any idea what I have for dinner tonight by the time we're done talking about it. (Soundbite of laughter) RAEBURN: Dr. Lerner, you've talked about emotions and their role in decision making, just to make this thing even more complicated sounding that it already is, go ahead and tell us what role emotions play? Dr. LERNER: Sure. Well, it's useful to first think a semantic distinction between two different kinds of emotion that can enter into judgment and decision making. The first is what we call, integral emotion and these are feelings that one may have about the judgment or decision at hand. So, for example, if I'm about to make a decision about whether to invest in a particular stock or change the allocation of my retirement savings, that sort of thing, I may have feelings about that decision and feelings about - and I can anticipate feelings like how I would feel if the market dropped further or if it started to go up, I can have an excitement or worries. Those are all integral to the judgment or decision at hand, and from a -traditionally a standard economic model can actually do - incorporate those feelings relatively easily. There's another kind of feeling, which we call incidental emotion, and these are feeling that one just happens to be having at the time of a judgment or decision and that have no normative relevance to the judgment or decision at hand. So say, you've just had a - you've just driven into work and someone cut you off in traffic, which actually happens quite often here in Cambridge, and you nearly had a fender bender, and you're all mad, and then you go in and you're making this decision about re-allocating your retirement savings. Your anger over having this unpleasant altercation and the bad driver who ended up maybe treating you badly, your anger about that should not influence your decisions that you're about to make, and in fact they should just be incidental but not influential. But what we find over and over again is that once the emotion systems are activated, for example, the anger system in your body, it creates a whole bunch of changes, and the brain is just not wired up to say, oh, that anger is from the traffic and should not be influencing my stock allocations, but instead it just carries over, and very often it carries over when we're not even aware of it. So those are the two kinds of emotion in simple terms: integral and incidental. Both have strong influences on judgment and decision-making. One of them is a kind normatively defensible influence because it is relevant to the judgment or choice at hand, and the other is not, but both occur with quite - with intensity and commonly. RAEBURN: Are you or others trying to quantify that mathematically as well, as we discussed with some of the other aspects of this? Dr. LERNER: Absolutely. We do experiments in our laboratory, and we - everything, all of our results boil down to a mathematical model, where we can actually quantify the degree of the emotional influence on a variety of judgment and decision-making outcomes. RAEBURN: And so this is where the Mr. Spock image comes up again. The mathematics of emotions sounds inherently contradictory. Dr. LERNER: Well, it isn't really. Actually, emotion for much of the 20th century, there's an interesting history and philosophy of science story here, was considered unscientific and not worthy of study, and\u2026 RAEBURN: Let me stop you right now. We'll hear more about that when we come back. We'll be right back after this short break. (Soundbite of music) RAEBURN: From NPR News, this is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Paul Raeburn. We're talking this hour about the science of decision-making. My guests are Michael J. Frank, assistant professor of cognitive and linguistic science, psychology and psychiatry, and director of the Laboratory for Neural Computation and Cognition at Brown University; Jennifer S. Lerner, professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, director of the Decision Science Laboratory there; and Colin Camerer, the Robert Kirby Professor of Behavioral Economics at Cal Tech. Jennifer Lerner, you were telling us about the emotions and mathematics. I think you also did an experiment about looking at anger in decision-making. Tell us about that. Dr. LERNER: Okay. Want to hear about the experiment first or about the issue of whether emotion can be studied scientifically? RAEBURN: Well, finish the discussion about emotion and scientific study, and then we'll talk about the experiment. Dr. LERNER: Okay. So B. F. Skinner, one of the founders of classic behaviorism in psychology right here at Harvard, said this famous quote. In the middle of the last century he said, Emotion is one of the fictional causes to which we attribute behavior. And essentially he thought it did not - emotion didn't need to be studied at all. We just thought that emotion was influencing our behavior, but it wasn't really. And his view really did dominate much of the last century's thinking. RAEBURN: That was one of the things that made him such a controversial figure, wasn't it? Dr. LERNER: It was, and emotion was really not studied very much in the 20th century, and it was - in fact, there's - one of the first books that Charles Darwin ever wrote is called \"The Expression of Emotion in Man and Animals,\" but for the last century it went out of print, and you couldn't even purchase that book. That is how out of fashion or out of scientific fashion the study of emotion was. But toward the end of the last century there were a number of methodological advances. Brain imagining is one of them, also a lot of advances in studying the autonomic nervous system, and advances - some of them have become quite popular - in coding fine muscle movements in the face and being able to quantify different emotion expressions and how those expressions can actually predict underlying biological changes. And so we now internationally, across laboratories, have a number of very good tools for studying emotion, and in part through working with our colleagues in economics, improved tools for studying judgment and decision-making. So there's now this really thrilling field that's burgeoning right at the intersection of psychology, economics and neuroscience and making a number of discoveries and also in particular with an exciting focus on how emotion influences these outcomes, again combining a psychological, an economic, and a neuroscience perspective. RAEBURN: So tell us about the anger experiment. The anger seems to be - here's my unscientific view. Anger is responsible for a lot of bad decisions by a lot of people in a lot of circumstances. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. LERNER: Yes. We have been doing research on anger for about 15 years in terms of how it influences judgment and decision-making. So we have a lot of experiments, and the typical paradigm that we'll use is one where we're interested in incidental anger. So as I described a few minutes ago, we're interested in the times when anger from one situation carries over and influences decisions in another situation, even when people, for the most part, are not aware of it. This is a very old problem. It was actually Aristotle who first said, Anybody can be angry, but to - and he said, that's easy, but to be angry with the right person at the right time and in the right way, that's not easy. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. LERNER: And so that is what we find in our empirical data in the lab. RAEBURN: Now we know Aristotle was right, after all this time. Dr. LERNER: Aristotle was right. He's actually - \"Nicomachean Ethics. \" I highly recommend the book. It has a lot of predictions that are bearing out in our highly controlled laboratory experiments. RAEBURN: I want to take some calls, but just in a nutshell, what did you find in this experiment, that the anger does carry over to other situations. Dr. LERNER: Anger does carry over, and I'll give you one kind of non-intuitive result. Most people think that when you're in a negative mood, like anger, you'll have a negative outlook. You'll be pessimistic. It turns out the opposite. Anger makes you optimistic and makes you perceive less risk than if you were in a neutral state, and if makes you take more risks. So for example, you're more likely to choose a gamble over a sure thing when you're angry. Anger does a lot of other things, as well. It makes you think more heuristically rather than systematically. It automatically activates relative left frontal hemisphere, which is associated with approach. So when you're mad, it predisposes you toward believing things are going to work out your way, believing that you have some sense of control. It gives you a sense of certainty, makes you take more risks, perceive less risk, think less deeply, a whole series of choices, and we have, if anyone wants to read, a summary of a lot of these experiments in a paper that is easily accessible online called \"Portrait of the Angry Decision-maker. \" RAEBURN: Okay, we'd like to take a question from Jonathan Wesley(ph) via twitter, who wants to know, Michael Frank, if big and small decisions are processed differently in the brain. Dr. FRANK: Well, I guess it would depend on what big and small mean. If you mean small like some of the examples you gave before, in terms of just simple motor decisions that you're not aware of, like where you put your soap and things like that, versus big decisions like which career you should take, then I was saw absolutely they're processed in different ways in different parts of the brain. Of course, they share some overlap in terms of how value might be assigned to some of these decisions. So where you put your soap originally, when you're learning to move as a child and through development, you're trying to figure out what is the best way to move and with the most efficiency and the least cost, the least effort, and some movements work better than others, and so that system slowly gets ingrained until it becomes unconscious. Similarly, when you're actually making deliberative decisions, it's possible that some of the same brain areas that are involved in selecting between simple motor programs are also involved in selecting between sort of more complex cognitive decisions, although they're not exactly in the same parts of the brain. They're sort of overlapping circuits, we think. RAEBURN: Colin Camerer, can you tell us a little bit about what light a functional MRI sheds on some of these questions? Dr. CAMERER: Well, MRIs has a few advantages. It has severe limits, which people sometimes talk about and sometimes gloss over. It doesn't have really great temporal and spatial resolution compared to some other techniques, like measuring directly the firing rate of a particular neuron, but at least it gives us a starting point, and it's often a very useful compliment to other types of tools to try to understand geographical specialization in the brain. And importantly, that doesn't mean that we're going to find, say, an envy region of the brain. More likely what we'll find is, and what we do find, is sort of neural circuitry, several different regions that are causally influencing one another, maybe in a detectable time path, and that can then be the object of a computational model. And in a few cases, in what's sometimes called decision neuroscience, we've - there's very good convergent evidence that in valuing a wide range of objects from very simple things like a drop of juice if you're thirsty to more complex things like which charity to give money to, that there's activity in fairly specialized areas in what's called the medial orbital frontal cortex, that's in the middle, above the eye sockets. That's the orbital part, like, right between your eyebrows, and also in regions called the ventral striatum and caudate(ph), deep in the kind of oldest part of the brain. And a little bit is also known about how people with damage in those regions sort of behave abnormally in terms of simple decision-making. So there's some converging evidence on lots of different objects that need to have values that are traded off to make complex in decisions where in the brain that's occurring, and once we have some clues about where things are happening, then we can start to do other kinds of really interesting causal experiments, which you couldn't do. So in our lab and many others, people use something called TMS, transcranial magnetic stimulation. What that is is a magnetic coil that's held on the outside of the brain and can stimulate an area on the kind of surface of the brain about the size of a quarter. So if you know, for example, that a particular region is involved in sort of assigning a monetary value to food when you're hungry, and we disrupt that activity in that area, does that mean that monetary values become more erratic? Does that mean monetary values go down? So we can actually influence brain activity that way, and then there are lots of other tools for doing this, like electrical stimulation, pharmacological manipulations that adjust the amount of serotonin or dopamine or something in the brain. So understanding the geography of the brain is really just partly a stepping stone to then be able to really confirm things with lesion patients and these causal influences. RAEBURN: Jennifer Lerner, we have another question from Twitter from 1213, who asks whether decision-making and things we do based on habit come out of the same parts of the brain or the same system, or whether those are completely different things. Dr. LERNER: That's a fascinating question. We don't have a definitive answer to that yet, but we are starting to make important inroads on that, in part because, for example, in the research that we're doing on incidental emotion, a lot of times, they carry over a curse without people realizing it. And so, for example, if they're in a sad state, we observe that they spent more to buy something than if they were in a neutral state. And we made them sad by having them watch a short little film clip of about four minutes. And they've been randomly assigned to watch that clip or randomly assigned to watch a neutral clip. And then afterwards, we give them a task that involves buying and selling goods, involving real commodities, real money. And afterwards, we'll ask them, did what you saw in that video clip in any way influence the prices that you set? And people will tell us, no. And they actually are offended. And they say, you know, how could you suggest that I would? That would be ridiculous if it did. And so, there's a question between these sorts of non-conscious processes, where emotions are influencing how much we buy and - the price that which we buy and sell. But the process is opaque to intersection. So, the subjects themselves don't see that it's going on. And then getting back to your question, how similar different is that kind of non-conscious process from what we would call a habit? So we are investigating this now on the behavioral level and increasingly on the neuroscience level. And these are some of the fascinating questions about how the mind works that the field is now taking up. RAEBURN: Michael Frank, can the genetics work that you do be correlated with the geographic work that comes out of the fMRI scans? Dr. FRANK: Absolutely. And there's a whole line of research that's attempting to do so and we're following up on our original research and trying to do so as well. What you can do is you can genotype people and put them in the scanner and look at whether activations in particular parts of the brain that are, in this case, involve in decision-making or reward processing, whether the activations that you see very according to the genotype. So in some cases, you do see that where you'll put someone in the scanner and then you'll deliver rewards to them in a form of either financial rewards that are gambling and making money or you can actually deliver juice directly to their mouth if they're thirsty and you actually can see that the reward area -sorry - the reward areas of the brain can sort of activate, they light up. And to the extent that they have particular genotypes that might actually modulate their sensitivity to reward, which could also predict their sensitivity to reward in other aspects of their life. RAEBURN: Now, what other types of decisions can you study at the genetic level? These genes involved Dopamine, is that correct? Dr. FRANK: That's right. So you can study - and what I mentioned before is there's the gene that predicts your tendency to sort of override your more basic reinforcement system in order to explore. But, of course, you can study the more basic process itself, and we and others have done that as well, so that your sensitivity to rewards versus your sensitivity to negative outcomes, like losses or punishment, and those depend on separate goal mechanisms within the brain. And there's also genetics that are associated with us to aspects of learning. There's also other ways to sort of carve up the space of sensitivity to reward and decision-making, for example, temporal context. So, if went to a restaurant and you had uh, salmon once, and it was terrible, do you remember that very last experience and decide to change your whole strategy for restaurants, or you do sort of take a longer-term view? And that sort of poses a computational tradeoff in terms of the brain systems that are involved in learning from or responding to very recent history versus integrating sort of over the course of your lifetime what seems to be true on average. RAEBURN: Let me take a moment to remind everyone, I'm Paul Raeburn. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. So, Colin Camerer, tell us a little bit about the particular work that you do, some of your recent research and how that bears on some of these questions. Prof. CAMERER: Okay. So a recent study we did, that came out in Science this May, had to do with self-control. And in that study, as I mentioned, it's something which was talked about a lot. It seems to be a very important in the economy as - and we went down and noticed the savings rate in the U. S. in modern times is quite low, sometimes negative. And credit card debt is enormous, something in the scale of several thousand dollars per household. And in addition, where there's had been a tremendous worldwide rise in obesity, people just eating too much and not exercising enough. And that has an enormous cause in terms of later health care. So self-control is a big stakes thing that were interesting philosophically and from a critical point of view. So our paradigm is very simple. People see actual foods: yogurt, Snickers bars, Cheetos, and rate them on how healthy do you think they are and how tasty do you think they are. And then we asked them whether they want to choose this food or kind of a neutral food that's in between on health and taste. And these are people who say they're dieting and struggling a little bit to control their diet. And what we find is that when there's activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - I apologize for the jargon, but these do have names because we talk about in that way. Dorsal means sort of upward in the brain, lateral is on the side. It's a spot maybe two or three inches above your eyebrow. And when there's stronger activity in that region, that's predictive of when people are able to exhibit self-control in a sense of say no to things that aren't healthy but are really tasty. And as I mentioned, once we know a little bit about the neurocircuitry, the dorsolateral PFC and how it's kind of modulating the weight that's placed on health, which is also being expressed in another part of the brain and medial LC. Once we start to know something about the circuitry - and there are other regions involved, too. I'm just highlighting a couple. We can start to ask about genetic influences, particular neurotransmitters, we can do TMS and things like that. So we, you know, interpreted in an overly glib way. It's something like an attempt to understand the locus of will power in the brain. And related to what Jennifer works on, another thing which people can do outside of fMRI is - we know that this dorsolateral prefrontal region is also activated in working memory tasks, like if you're trying to pay attention while driving or remember somebody's phone number. So what happens if you overload the DLPFC with an additional kind of cognitive distractor task, does that mean that people then have trouble resisting tempting foods? The prediction would seem to be yes. So once we know something about these areas and what other things those areas are involved in, we can - it generates a big range of other cognitive experiments you can do. So there really is a kind of - fMRI is sort of the glamorous tool because pictures of the brain is so beautiful, but it also works best when it tells you other kinds of experiments that hundreds of people can't do if you don't have brain imaging. RAEBURN: Well, I think that's about all the time we have. I'd like to thank my guest for being with us. Michael J.

He is director of the Laboratory for Neural Computation and Cognition at the Brown University Institute for Brain Science. He joins us today from Providence, Rhode Island. Thanks for being with us, Dr. Frank.  Dr. MICHAEL J. FRANK (Assistant Professor, Cognitive & Linguistic Sciences; Director, Laboratory for Neural Computation and Cognition, Brown University Institute for Brain Science): I'm very happy to be here.  RAEBURN: Jennifer S. Lerner is a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, director of the Decision Science Laboratory at Harvard University. Thanks for talking to us today, Dr. Lerner.  Dr. JENNIFER S. LERNER (Professor, Harvard Kennedy School; Director, Decision Science Laboratory, Harvard University): I'm pleased to be here, thanks.  RAEBURN: And Colin Camerer is the Robert Kirby Professor of Behavioral Economics at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. Thanks to you too for joining us.  Professor COLIN CAMERER (Behavioral Economics, California Institute of Technology): My pleasure.  RAEBURN: Again, our number is 1-800-989-8255. Give us a call. Colin Camerer, what are you economists doing messing around with the psychologists and neuroscientists?  Prof. CAMERER: Well, I would say trying to reform economics in the sense that the standard economics theory that was developed mathematically starting around 1950s, and which continues to be taught and subject of every exam and also guides a lot of policies, is that people know what they want; they optimize by choosing the right - spend the right amount of time and money on things, even when decisions are very complicated - hundreds of mutual fund choices, distant - there are words are distant like at age 25, you'd have to choose a package that will give you a term and funds when you're in your 70s, and there are very complicated probabilities to calculate it or in some cases, what we call ambiguity, we really know very little about the probability.  So, the economic model has been a very mathematical stylized, kind of Martha Stewart meets Mr. Spock on emotional calculating caricature. And it may apply in some cases but often not. It's not a great model of human nature to build the entire social science on. So, what we've been trying to do, is to really import psychology and the increasing (unintelligible) looking directly at brain function when people are making somewhat complicated economic choices.  RAEBURN: Now, people talk about - what you're talking about I think is behavioral economics or neuroeconomics, what do these terms mean?  Prof. CAMERER: So, behavioral economics takes the idea that people have some normal limits - not pathological limits, although pathology is useful to understand general mechanisms - normal limits on how much they can compute and figure out on greed and on willpower, and try to put those in mathematical terms that kind of soften this sharp caricature of perfect rationality that's been the standard theory. Behavioral economics basically doesn't say very much about detailed brain mechanisms, neuroeconomics does.  RAEBURN: Can you do something with the psychology, with mathematics or do you have to abandon the mathematics and use a different approach altogether?  Prof. CAMERER: No, in fact, I think one of the - one of the biggest innovations is that, first the mathematics just becomes harder. But that's actually great because there are a lot of mathematical economists who've figured out all the simple stuff and are actually enjoying the challenge nowadays, or trying to mathematize something like envy or social influence.  RAEBURN: So, harder becomes harder just because these things are so difficult to quantify.  Prof. CAMERER: Yes, exactly. And also there's a lot of different possible avenues, something like the things we're talking about, willpower, addiction, exploration. Michal will talk about, often there are, you know, there are a lot of dimensions and you have to kind of comment to a particular approach. So, typically, for example, nowadays economists are very interested in modeling self control, and there's not a single mathematical model, there are several. So then the ball goes in the court of empiricist to say, which are these seems to be on the right track?  RAEBURN: Michael Frank, it was your paper in Nature and Neuroscience that prompted this conversation today. Tell us a little bit about that. What did you find?  Dr. FRANK: Well, people have an automatic tendency, based on strong drives at the motivational system, to choose actions that have been associated with good outcomes in the past and to avoid those that had negative outcomes. That's of course, and adaptive thing to do. But, sometimes we don't know, really, what the best outcome is from our actions until we try other actions, essentially until we explore. And then we have to override this basic reinforcement system in order to gain more information and to explore when we're more uncertain. So, we found was that people who'd a particular gene variation - their DNA - were more likely to export choices that had uncertain outcomes than those who had the other form of the gene.  RAEBURN: So, if choice that has an uncertain outcome, what would be an example of that?  Dr. FRANK: So, one example would be if you're just used to going to the same restaurant again and again, and you kind of enjoy it, but you have lots of other options out there and you're not sure whether you're actually going to like the other option or you might not like the other option. So, the more you're uncertain about that, the less you know about it or the more variability that you have in your experience is where the particular choice that you might make, the more uncertain you are both that and then in order to gain more information to find out whether it's actually better than what you've been doing before. That's the condition where you might want to explore.  RAEBURN: So, when I'm deciding whether to go to my favorite restaurant or to try this new restaurant, you're telling me that seems like a fairly trivial thing that wouldn't require a whole lot of computing power up in my head. But you're telling me that it does require enough to at least be encoded partly in our genes.  Dr. FRANK: Right. I mean essentially you have to compute a lot of the things, you're not actually computing, explicitly in your head. You're not sort of measuring in your head exactly how much other uncertainty you have about going to a particular restaurant or anything. But, an example that I like to give sometimes, is if you're faced with choosing - like you had in your introduction, salmon versus steak - you might have chosen both of those in the past many times and what you go on, which one you chose on a given day, might depend on your sort of integrated experience of all the times you've had steak or all the times you'd salmon in the past, together with a bunch of other contextual factors, of course.  But it's not like you're remembering each individual instance which you had salmon or which you had steak. Instead your brain essentially is remembering that in one sort of integrated value. But the computations necessary to compute that integrated value is a function of your past experience, of course, require complex brain mechanisms which themselves are influenced by the gene. And similarly the computations of how uncertain you are about that value are also influenced by brain mechanisms.  RAEBURN: I'm little afraid of what we think about this too much. I'm not going to have any idea what I have for dinner tonight by the time we're done talking about it.  (Soundbite of laughter)  RAEBURN: Dr. Lerner, you've talked about emotions and their role in decision making, just to make this thing even more complicated sounding that it already is, go ahead and tell us what role emotions play?  Dr. LERNER: Sure. Well, it's useful to first think a semantic distinction between two different kinds of emotion that can enter into judgment and decision making. The first is what we call, integral emotion and these are feelings that one may have about the judgment or decision at hand. So, for example, if I'm about to make a decision about whether to invest in a particular stock or change the allocation of my retirement savings, that sort of thing, I may have feelings about that decision and feelings about - and I can anticipate feelings like how I would feel if the market dropped further or if it started to go up, I can have an excitement or worries.  Those are all integral to the judgment or decision at hand, and from a -traditionally a standard economic model can actually do - incorporate those feelings relatively easily.  There's another kind of feeling, which we call incidental emotion, and these are feeling that one just happens to be having at the time of a judgment or decision and that have no normative relevance to the judgment or decision at hand.  So say, you've just had a - you've just driven into work and someone cut you off in traffic, which actually happens quite often here in Cambridge, and you nearly had a fender bender, and you're all mad, and then you go in and you're making this decision about re-allocating your retirement savings. Your anger over having this unpleasant altercation and the bad driver who ended up maybe treating you badly, your anger about that should not influence your decisions that you're about to make, and in fact they should just be incidental but not influential.  But what we find over and over again is that once the emotion systems are activated, for example, the anger system in your body, it creates a whole bunch of changes, and the brain is just not wired up to say, oh, that anger is from the traffic and should not be influencing my stock allocations, but instead it just carries over, and very often it carries over when we're not even aware of it.  So those are the two kinds of emotion in simple terms: integral and incidental. Both have strong influences on judgment and decision-making. One of them is a kind normatively defensible influence because it is relevant to the judgment or choice at hand, and the other is not, but both occur with quite - with intensity and commonly.  RAEBURN: Are you or others trying to quantify that mathematically as well, as we discussed with some of the other aspects of this?  Dr. LERNER: Absolutely. We do experiments in our laboratory, and we - everything, all of our results boil down to a mathematical model, where we can actually quantify the degree of the emotional influence on a variety of judgment and decision-making outcomes.  RAEBURN: And so this is where the Mr. Spock image comes up again. The mathematics of emotions sounds inherently contradictory.  Dr. LERNER: Well, it isn't really. Actually, emotion for much of the 20th century, there's an interesting history and philosophy of science story here, was considered unscientific and not worthy of study, and\u2026  RAEBURN: Let me stop you right now. We'll hear more about that when we come back. We'll be right back after this short break.  (Soundbite of music)  RAEBURN: From NPR News, this is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Paul Raeburn. We're talking this hour about the science of decision-making. My guests are Michael J. Frank, assistant professor of cognitive and linguistic science, psychology and psychiatry, and director of the Laboratory for Neural Computation and Cognition at Brown University; Jennifer S. Lerner, professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, director of the Decision Science Laboratory there; and Colin Camerer, the Robert Kirby Professor of Behavioral Economics at Cal Tech.  Jennifer Lerner, you were telling us about the emotions and mathematics. I think you also did an experiment about looking at anger in decision-making. Tell us about that.  Dr. LERNER: Okay. Want to hear about the experiment first or about the issue of whether emotion can be studied scientifically?  RAEBURN: Well, finish the discussion about emotion and scientific study, and then we'll talk about the experiment.  Dr. LERNER: Okay. So B. F. Skinner, one of the founders of classic behaviorism in psychology right here at Harvard, said this famous quote. In the middle of the last century he said, Emotion is one of the fictional causes to which we attribute behavior. And essentially he thought it did not - emotion didn't need to be studied at all. We just thought that emotion was influencing our behavior, but it wasn't really. And his view really did dominate much of the last century's thinking.  RAEBURN: That was one of the things that made him such a controversial figure, wasn't it?  Dr. LERNER: It was, and emotion was really not studied very much in the 20th century, and it was - in fact, there's - one of the first books that Charles Darwin ever wrote is called \"The Expression of Emotion in Man and Animals,\" but for the last century it went out of print, and you couldn't even purchase that book. That is how out of fashion or out of scientific fashion the study of emotion was. But toward the end of the last century there were a number of methodological advances.  Brain imagining is one of them, also a lot of advances in studying the autonomic nervous system, and advances - some of them have become quite popular - in coding fine muscle movements in the face and being able to quantify different emotion expressions and how those expressions can actually predict underlying biological changes. And so we now internationally, across laboratories, have a number of very good tools for studying emotion, and in part through working with our colleagues in economics, improved tools for studying judgment and decision-making.  So there's now this really thrilling field that's burgeoning right at the intersection of psychology, economics and neuroscience and making a number of discoveries and also in particular with an exciting focus on how emotion influences these outcomes, again combining a psychological, an economic, and a neuroscience perspective.  RAEBURN: So tell us about the anger experiment. The anger seems to be - here's my unscientific view. Anger is responsible for a lot of bad decisions by a lot of people in a lot of circumstances.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. LERNER: Yes. We have been doing research on anger for about 15 years in terms of how it influences judgment and decision-making. So we have a lot of experiments, and the typical paradigm that we'll use is one where we're interested in incidental anger.  So as I described a few minutes ago, we're interested in the times when anger from one situation carries over and influences decisions in another situation, even when people, for the most part, are not aware of it.  This is a very old problem. It was actually Aristotle who first said, Anybody can be angry, but to - and he said, that's easy, but to be angry with the right person at the right time and in the right way, that's not easy.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. LERNER: And so that is what we find in our empirical data in the lab.  RAEBURN: Now we know Aristotle was right, after all this time.  Dr. LERNER: Aristotle was right. He's actually - \"Nicomachean Ethics. \" I highly recommend the book. It has a lot of predictions that are bearing out in our highly controlled laboratory experiments.  RAEBURN: I want to take some calls, but just in a nutshell, what did you find in this experiment, that the anger does carry over to other situations.  Dr. LERNER: Anger does carry over, and I'll give you one kind of non-intuitive result. Most people think that when you're in a negative mood, like anger, you'll have a negative outlook. You'll be pessimistic. It turns out the opposite.  Anger makes you optimistic and makes you perceive less risk than if you were in a neutral state, and if makes you take more risks. So for example, you're more likely to choose a gamble over a sure thing when you're angry.  Anger does a lot of other things, as well. It makes you think more heuristically rather than systematically. It automatically activates relative left frontal hemisphere, which is associated with approach. So when you're mad, it predisposes you toward believing things are going to work out your way, believing that you have some sense of control. It gives you a sense of certainty, makes you take more risks, perceive less risk, think less deeply, a whole series of choices, and we have, if anyone wants to read, a summary of a lot of these experiments in a paper that is easily accessible online called \"Portrait of the Angry Decision-maker. \"  RAEBURN: Okay, we'd like to take a question from Jonathan Wesley(ph) via twitter, who wants to know, Michael Frank, if big and small decisions are processed differently in the brain.  Dr. FRANK: Well, I guess it would depend on what big and small mean. If you mean small like some of the examples you gave before, in terms of just simple motor decisions that you're not aware of, like where you put your soap and things like that, versus big decisions like which career you should take, then I was saw absolutely they're processed in different ways in different parts of the brain.  Of course, they share some overlap in terms of how value might be assigned to some of these decisions. So where you put your soap originally, when you're learning to move as a child and through development, you're trying to figure out what is the best way to move and with the most efficiency and the least cost, the least effort, and some movements work better than others, and so that system slowly gets ingrained until it becomes unconscious.  Similarly, when you're actually making deliberative decisions, it's possible that some of the same brain areas that are involved in selecting between simple motor programs are also involved in selecting between sort of more complex cognitive decisions, although they're not exactly in the same parts of the brain. They're sort of overlapping circuits, we think.  RAEBURN: Colin Camerer, can you tell us a little bit about what light a functional MRI sheds on some of these questions?  Dr. CAMERER: Well, MRIs has a few advantages. It has severe limits, which people sometimes talk about and sometimes gloss over. It doesn't have really great temporal and spatial resolution compared to some other techniques, like measuring directly the firing rate of a particular neuron, but at least it gives us a starting point, and it's often a very useful compliment to other types of tools to try to understand geographical specialization in the brain.  And importantly, that doesn't mean that we're going to find, say, an envy region of the brain. More likely what we'll find is, and what we do find, is sort of neural circuitry, several different regions that are causally influencing one another, maybe in a detectable time path, and that can then be the object of a computational model.  And in a few cases, in what's sometimes called decision neuroscience, we've - there's very good convergent evidence that in valuing a wide range of objects from very simple things like a drop of juice if you're thirsty to more complex things like which charity to give money to, that there's activity in fairly specialized areas in what's called the medial orbital frontal cortex, that's in the middle, above the eye sockets.  That's the orbital part, like, right between your eyebrows, and also in regions called the ventral striatum and caudate(ph), deep in the kind of oldest part of the brain. And a little bit is also known about how people with damage in those regions sort of behave abnormally in terms of simple decision-making.  So there's some converging evidence on lots of different objects that need to have values that are traded off to make complex in decisions where in the brain that's occurring, and once we have some clues about where things are happening, then we can start to do other kinds of really interesting causal experiments, which you couldn't do.  So in our lab and many others, people use something called TMS, transcranial magnetic stimulation. What that is is a magnetic coil that's held on the outside of the brain and can stimulate an area on the kind of surface of the brain about the size of a quarter.  So if you know, for example, that a particular region is involved in sort of assigning a monetary value to food when you're hungry, and we disrupt that activity in that area, does that mean that monetary values become more erratic? Does that mean monetary values go down?  So we can actually influence brain activity that way, and then there are lots of other tools for doing this, like electrical stimulation, pharmacological manipulations that adjust the amount of serotonin or dopamine or something in the brain.  So understanding the geography of the brain is really just partly a stepping stone to then be able to really confirm things with lesion patients and these causal influences.  RAEBURN: Jennifer Lerner, we have another question from Twitter from 1213, who asks whether decision-making and things we do based on habit come out of the same parts of the brain or the same system, or whether those are completely different things.  Dr. LERNER: That's a fascinating question. We don't have a definitive answer to that yet, but we are starting to make important inroads on that, in part because, for example, in the research that we're doing on incidental emotion, a lot of times, they carry over a curse without people realizing it.  And so, for example, if they're in a sad state, we observe that they spent more to buy something than if they were in a neutral state. And we made them sad by having them watch a short little film clip of about four minutes. And they've been randomly assigned to watch that clip or randomly assigned to watch a neutral clip.  And then afterwards, we give them a task that involves buying and selling goods, involving real commodities, real money. And afterwards, we'll ask them, did what you saw in that video clip in any way influence the prices that you set? And people will tell us, no. And they actually are offended. And they say, you know, how could you suggest that I would? That would be ridiculous if it did.  And so, there's a question between these sorts of non-conscious processes, where emotions are influencing how much we buy and - the price that which we buy and sell. But the process is opaque to intersection. So, the subjects themselves don't see that it's going on. And then getting back to your question, how similar different is that kind of non-conscious process from what we would call a habit?  So we are investigating this now on the behavioral level and increasingly on the neuroscience level. And these are some of the fascinating questions about how the mind works that the field is now taking up.  RAEBURN: Michael Frank, can the genetics work that you do be correlated with the geographic work that comes out of the fMRI scans?  Dr. FRANK: Absolutely. And there's a whole line of research that's attempting to do so and we're following up on our original research and trying to do so as well.  What you can do is you can genotype people and put them in the scanner and look at whether activations in particular parts of the brain that are, in this case, involve in decision-making or reward processing, whether the activations that you see very according to the genotype.  So in some cases, you do see that where you'll put someone in the scanner and then you'll deliver rewards to them in a form of either financial rewards that are gambling and making money or you can actually deliver juice directly to their mouth if they're thirsty and you actually can see that the reward area -sorry - the reward areas of the brain can sort of activate, they light up. And to the extent that they have particular genotypes that might actually modulate their sensitivity to reward, which could also predict their sensitivity to reward in other aspects of their life.  RAEBURN: Now, what other types of decisions can you study at the genetic level? These genes involved Dopamine, is that correct?  Dr. FRANK: That's right. So you can study - and what I mentioned before is there's the gene that predicts your tendency to sort of override your more basic reinforcement system in order to explore. But, of course, you can study the more basic process itself, and we and others have done that as well, so that your sensitivity to rewards versus your sensitivity to negative outcomes, like losses or punishment, and those depend on separate goal mechanisms within the brain. And there's also genetics that are associated with us to aspects of learning.  There's also other ways to sort of carve up the space of sensitivity to reward and decision-making, for example, temporal context. So, if went to a restaurant and you had uh, salmon once, and it was terrible, do you remember that very last experience and decide to change your whole strategy for restaurants, or you do sort of take a longer-term view? And that sort of poses a computational tradeoff in terms of the brain systems that are involved in learning from or responding to very recent history versus integrating sort of over the course of your lifetime what seems to be true on average.  RAEBURN: Let me take a moment to remind everyone, I'm Paul Raeburn. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  So, Colin Camerer, tell us a little bit about the particular work that you do, some of your recent research and how that bears on some of these questions.  Prof. CAMERER: Okay. So a recent study we did, that came out in Science this May, had to do with self-control. And in that study, as I mentioned, it's something which was talked about a lot. It seems to be a very important in the economy as - and we went down and noticed the savings rate in the U. S. in modern times is quite low, sometimes negative. And credit card debt is enormous, something in the scale of several thousand dollars per household. And in addition, where there's had been a tremendous worldwide rise in obesity, people just eating too much and not exercising enough. And that has an enormous cause in terms of later health care.  So self-control is a big stakes thing that were interesting philosophically and from a critical point of view. So our paradigm is very simple. People see actual foods: yogurt, Snickers bars, Cheetos, and rate them on how healthy do you think they are and how tasty do you think they are. And then we asked them whether they want to choose this food or kind of a neutral food that's in between on health and taste.  And these are people who say they're dieting and struggling a little bit to control their diet. And what we find is that when there's activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - I apologize for the jargon, but these do have names because we talk about in that way. Dorsal means sort of upward in the brain, lateral is on the side. It's a spot maybe two or three inches above your eyebrow.  And when there's stronger activity in that region, that's predictive of when people are able to exhibit self-control in a sense of say no to things that aren't healthy but are really tasty.  And as I mentioned, once we know a little bit about the neurocircuitry, the dorsolateral PFC and how it's kind of modulating the weight that's placed on health, which is also being expressed in another part of the brain and medial LC. Once we start to know something about the circuitry - and there are other regions involved, too. I'm just highlighting a couple. We can start to ask about genetic influences, particular neurotransmitters, we can do TMS and things like that. So we, you know, interpreted in an overly glib way. It's something like an attempt to understand the locus of will power in the brain.  And related to what Jennifer works on, another thing which people can do outside of fMRI is - we know that this dorsolateral prefrontal region is also activated in working memory tasks, like if you're trying to pay attention while driving or remember somebody's phone number.  So what happens if you overload the DLPFC with an additional kind of cognitive distractor task, does that mean that people then have trouble resisting tempting foods? The prediction would seem to be yes.  So once we know something about these areas and what other things those areas are involved in, we can - it generates a big range of other cognitive experiments you can do. So there really is a kind of - fMRI is sort of the glamorous tool because pictures of the brain is so beautiful, but it also works best when it tells you other kinds of experiments that hundreds of people can't do if you don't have brain imaging.  RAEBURN: Well, I think that's about all the time we have. I'd like to thank my guest for being with us. Michael J.

President BARACK OBAMA: Walter Cronkite was the most trusted voice in America. Unidentified Man #1: Uncle Walter, the most trusted man in America. Unidentified Man #2: Well the key here, Scott, is trust. Unidentified Woman #1: He was the most trusted man in America. Unidentified Man #3: He was a trusted narrator. Unidentified Man #4: On his reservoir of trust\u2026 Unidentified Man #5: They trusted Cronkite more than anyone else. Unidentified Man #6: He also was the most trusted. ROBERT SIEGEL: The journalist who was known as the most trusted man in America. RAEBURN: We're not going to take issue with any of that. We trusted him, too, but all this coverage made us wonder: Why did we trust him so much? What happens in our brains to make us trust one person and not another? Is it an automatic response, does it change with years of experience as we go on in life, or is it a little bit of both? Joining me now to talk about the science of trust is my guest, Antonio Damasio, the Dornsife Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. He's also director of the Brain and Creativity Institute there, and he joins us from a studio on the Pepperdine University campus. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Damasio. Dr. ANTONIO DAMASIO (University of Southern California): Thank you, pleasure to be here. RAEBURN: Did you trust Walter Cronkite? Dr. DAMASIO: Absolutely. I could say just about the same things we just have heard. He was entirely trustworthy, but the interesting thing is the reasons why he was, and you just outlined a couple of them, but I think we could go into detail, and it's certainly not one reason only. RAEBURN: Did you think about your own reaction to him to try to sort this out? Dr. DAMASIO: Yes, I did. But of course, since I have thought a little bit about this problem, and we have done some research on the issue, I think that my own reactions were not as important as what I think I know about trust. And of course, it's not very much, but it certainly helps. RAEBURN: Spoken like a scientist. You're just an anecdotal example yourself, of course. Dr. DAMASIO: Of course. (Soundbite of laughter) RAEBURN: Tell me just briefly, before we go to a break, what research you've done that bears on this question? Dr. DAMASIO: Well, one has to do with the study we did years ago on faces, in which we have a large number of faces of men and women of different ages without a particular facial expression of emotion, in which we asked a large number also of men and women of all ages to rank the faces in terms of the degree of trustability. In other words, the question was, how much would you trust this person with a problem of yours? How would you go to this person, and would you approach this person if you felt you had a problem? And we got some very interesting results that, in a nutshell, were like this. People's faced divided in a bimodal distribution were largely the ones that were either extremely inspiring of trust or the ones that you really would not go to in case you were in need, and this was very interesting because it had to do just with normal behavior of normal people and faces that were quite normal, as well. So that was one of the things we did, and then we also did a study that is very relevant to this, and that is a study in which one particular part of the brain, specifically the amygdale - which is a collection of nuclei deep in the temporal lobe. When that particular group of nuclei is damaged, it turns out that people become much more trustworthy, and I will tell you how. RAEBURN: The - yes, tell me how. Dr. DAMASIO: Well, so what happens is that if you have people who have damage to the amygdale, and they look at exactly the same faces that entirely normal folk looked at, they will look at the ones that everyone trusts very much, and they will give ratings that are very, very similar. However, when they look at the faces that normal individuals do not trust, it turns out that they trust them, as well. RAEBURN: Let me stop you right there. We'll be right back after this short break. (Soundbite of music) RAEBURN: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) RAEBURN: From NPR News, this is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Paul Raeburn, filling in for Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about trust, why we trust people, why some people are more trusting than others, with my guest, Antonio Damasio, the Dornsife Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. He is also director of the Brain and Creativity Institute there. Give us a call if you have question: 1-800-989-8255. We've heard a lot about trust in recent days with the passing of Walter Cronkite. Dr. Damasio, there were several oft-replayed clips over the last week or so showing some emotion at the moon landing and at the death of President Kennedy. Is that kind of emotion, although he didn't show it often, something that could help build that bond between him and his viewers? Dr. DAMASIO: I'm - of course it would help build the bond. I don't think that's what would explain the trust that we had in him. I think that probably simply confirmed it because it was a reaction that, of course, so many other people had. So there was a greater degree of comfort that you could have. You simply confirmed what you already thought about the man. I think that the reasons behind the trust we had, an you alluded slightly to one of them, is to begin with, something that one could call a natural preference that human beings have for certain configurations of face and, for that matter, for certain kinds of voice print. So when we look at faces in general - and this is independent of what we know about the people - there are certain aspects of the configuration, for example, the symmetry, the overall balance of the composition, the relative sizes of the components of the face that will trigger some sort of automatic, extremely rapid response, which really is non-conscious and not deliberated and which will give you this reaction of, for example, likeability or not, in relation to the person. This is, by the way, the way we judge, automatically, faces as being beautiful or, for that matter, being ferocious, and I think trust falls in the same category. Of course, very rapidly after you find that automatically a face is beautiful and have a reaction of pleasure with it, or that you find that a face is ferocious and you feel apprehension or even fear, quite rapidly you come to realize that you are feeling those emotions and that you have that reaction. But to begin with, the reaction is fast, automatic and undeliberated. And of course, there is one thing that we have to take into account, that natural preference, and I would imagine that Cronkite's face calls in that category. But of course, that does not explain why, over the years, we continued to trust him. That could explain the beginning of it, and I think it's very important to realize that after a long exposure of many years, we come to realize that he did not betray that trust and that he used the trust we deposited in him in a very modest, reliable way. And I think that is another step, and that has to do with that particular face in relation to the viewing public. By the way, this is something that also happens with faces with actors. Somebody very bright must have decided early on that the face of James Stewart was one that you could trust, and that's probably why Alfred Hitchcock put him as the doctor in \"The Man Who Knew Too Much,\" you know, a perfectly reliable, very decent character, and why he did not cast Peter Lorre for that matter. Well, he did cast Peter Lorre, very early on, when he did the villain in the first \"Man Who Knew Too Much in 1935. So those first choices that a casting director will do explain why certain roles were given to certain actors. And exactly in the same manner, certain actors will have been able to maintain the credibility of that role, the credibility of that trust over the years, provided they actually were given those particular roles to play. RAEBURN: It's interesting you talk about actors, because Walter Cronkite, of course, was not an actor. On the other hand, he was a TV personality and although he gave the impression that he was just being himself on TV, there's certainly art and technique that go into creating that kind of impression. Is this quality of trust - yeah, go ahead. Dr. DAMASIO: Yeah, but I was going to say that it's part of the job of a great actor to give the impression that it is he, himself, that is playing the role at that moment. That kind of natural and sincere way of assuming the role, that's of course what defines the great actor. RAEBURN: So this artifice, if you would call it that, can affect our brains and out perception of trust, our sense of trust? Dr. DAMASIO: Absolutely, and of course, it does - we know just a little bit about the possible detailed mechanisms behind this. For example, there's very good evidence that a very small neuro-peptide by the name of oxytocin - very small, nine amino acids only - this is a peptide that can be released in the brain or in the body. Inside the brain, it functions as a neuro-modulator. In the body, it functions really as a hormone, and the release of that peptide in the central nervous system in the brain will actually induce, first of all, a greater approachability. So the subject that is affected by the release of that substance, tends to approach others more easily and have less of the somewhat natural reaction of fear in relation to the other. And it will, in very specific experimental situations, increase the trust that the person who has that increased release has relative to someone else. So that's one of the first bits of evidence that, of course, besides having certain systems in the brain that are operating, to generate that feeling of trust, there are details of the neurochemistry that are beginning to be known, and that that neuro-modulator, oxytocin, will play that role. By the way, it's a very interesting molecule, because it has numerous other positive effects in human behavior. And you know, it appears everywhere from, for example, lactation and childbirth to behaviors that have to do with sexual behavior, for example. So it's very, very complex, many, many actions. RAEBURN: Sexual - romance, as well as sexual behavior, or just sexual behavior? Dr. DAMASIO: Maybe. RAEBURN: Maybe. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. DAMASIO: Both. Both, actually, but the important thing for our case today, is that it does increase trust. RAEBURN: Okay, let's take a question. We have James in Rockville, Maryland. James, can you hear me? JAMES (Caller): Good morning. How are you? RAEBURN: Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. JAMES: I am a scout leader. And the first part of the scout law, I like to tell my scouts, there's no accident that it is the first point, is that a scout is trustworthy. The idea that you earn people's trust by your actions and by your words, and that the possibility of being trusted that way is very, very important in your life. You might not trust your ex-wife very much. You might trust your mother. You might trust the fellow that is beside you because you know he's a scout and for no other reason. You might trust the guy that you went through basic training with more than the sergeant that taught you basic training. It's because of what you know about that person and what you know they have been through and what they have been to you, if you will. RAEBURN: All right, so Dr. Damasio, what about the Boy Scout who maybe happens to have a not very trustworthy face? Can he learn to be - to have people trust him? Mr. DAMASIO: Of course, of course. And that is probably just more of an uphill battle in that case. But I think that a very important point is that it doesn't make any difference. You may have a face that someone would classify as not very trustworthy, and nonetheless, you can build that trust precisely by your behavior. And that's why I would caution against, you know, just imagining that Cronkite had the right face, and that's why we trusted him. Again, it's the issue that he maintained that trust by not betraying us, by not behaving in any way in which he would violate what we expected, the idea that we had formed of that man, and so that is something that he earned over the years, and I don't know. It would be interesting to find if, early in his broadcasting career, he was immediately considered a trustworthy person. I would suspect not, and I would suspect that it was built over time, and that was the judgment with which we ended by the time he retired and certainly we were reminded of last week. RAEBURN: Thanks, James. JAMES: Thank you. RAEBURN: Let's take a question from John in Plymouth, Michigan. John? JOHN (Caller): Good afternoon, gentlemen. How are you? RAEBURN: You on a cell phone in your car? JOHN: Yes, I am. RAEBURN: Okay. I think - make it short because you're breaking up a bit. But go ahead. JOHN: Well, I'm a sales rep and obviously trust is a very, very big issue. It seems as if the establishment of trust prior to even presenting the product is a bit of a challenge in its own right because of preconceived notions that people have about salespeople in general. Now, I tend to be a little bit different than a standard sales rep, where I'm not as aggressive. But I guess the question I have is, what can I do to help break that barrier a little bit better? RAEBURN: Okay. Thanks, John. I'm going to let you go because of the noise. But we'll go ahead with your question. Dr. Damasio, go ahead. Dr. DAMASIO: Well, the only thing I can suggest is behave very well and convince people by whatever means you have available that you are sincere about what you're saying and that what your - the product you're selling has merit and that you're not lying and that you're not deceiving, and that we should, in that case, trust you. That's the only recommendation. RAEBURN: So we didn't need neuroscience to tell us that, really. That's old fashioned advice. Dr. DAMASIO: No. No, no. Exactly. I don't think that that has much to do with neuroscience. I think the only thing that neuroscience has to do with here is the fact that we are beginning to understand some of the systems that can give you some idea of how it works. But I think that this is about general human behavior. And I don't really think - I think it's very interesting to know that a certain molecule will be important to - as the broker of this state. But I don't think that that alters the fundamentals of the situation, which is that you will be trusted if you are truthful and if you behave consistently in that manner. RAEBURN: Our number here at SCIENCE FRIDAY is 1-800-989-8255 or 1-800-989-TALK. Now, the - there is a field of neural marketing or neuroscience being applied to marketing. Can this research, this notion of trust and what we're learning about it, help GM sell more cars and get itself back in its feet? Dr. DAMASIO: Yes. I would - you know, I don't know exactly to what degree. I think we could be pretty much in the same situation of deciding what, you know, how can the salesman be more trusted. And I think it goes back to fundamentals of human behavior. And we do not need to interpose detailed knowledge of the brain for that. I think where the knowledge of the brain is very helpful is to give us the idea that some of these things are acquired, but some - and are acquired over the years with experience because we all go through life encountering people that are truthful to us and others that are not, and some that begin by being truthful but then betray our trust. So that acquisition part of the trust is very clear. What is very important is for people to factor in the fact that there's this other aspect of trust with which we begin the interview, which is natural, which is spontaneous, which is automatic and non-conscious. And that is the kind of process that will function as a bias. So one thing that neuroscience is telling you is that if you look at somebody that does not appear to inspire trust and that puts you on guard, that maybe you should wait and give the person a chance because you may be biased in your view by something that is not under your conscious control and that is not really based on the knowledge you have of that person. Now, I think that part is very important and that's very practical. Of course, again, ancient wisdom would tell you that you should not judge people by first encounter, but the fact that neuroscience can guarantee that that's indeed the case may help somebody pay more attention\u2026 RAEBURN: Let me interrupt for just a moment to say that I'm Paul Raeburn and this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Now, one of the things - you talked about the voice a little bit being part of this, not that we have any particular interest in the voice at NPR. But can voice alone create this kind of trust that we're talking about? Dr. DAMASIO: I believe so. I believe so. And of course, it has to do with numerous aspects of the voice. Probably the pitch is very important. I think that voices that are in middle range probably tend to be more trusted than others, especially if they are in very high range or voices that are very shrill, for example. And - but then there are all sorts of aspects that have to do with the music of the voice, what we call prosody. Of course, with accent\u2026 RAEBURN: What is that word? Prosody? Dr. DAMASIO: Prosody. It has to do with the kind of musical intonation that any person's speech will naturally show. So for example, your voice, as you speak, or mine, have a certain music that is fairly characteristic of each of us. And it is really - it has to do with tones and how they glide as you speak. It does not have to do with the phonemes specifically, it does not have to do at all with the content of the words. There are many ways of saying a word with different kinds of prosody and many kinds of inflection and cadence and whatsoever. So all of those characteristics, which of course can be teased apart, but overall together when you and I area speaking are also part of how a person judges a voice, especially when you're listening to the voice, as we do in radio, without being able to look at the person. RAEBURN: Well, I'm sorry to say that's all the time we have. My guest has been Antonio Damasio, the Dornsife Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. He's also director of the Brain and Creativity Institute there. Thanks for joining us today, Dr. Damasio. Dr. DAMASIO: Thank you. My pleasure.  PAUL RAEBURN, host:  Over the past week, with all the coverage with Walter Cronkite's passing, we've heard a lot about trust.  President BARACK OBAMA: Walter Cronkite was the most trusted voice in America.  Unidentified Man #1: Uncle Walter, the most trusted man in America.  Unidentified Man #2: Well the key here, Scott, is trust.  Unidentified Woman #1: He was the most trusted man in America.  Unidentified Man #3: He was a trusted narrator.  Unidentified Man #4: On his reservoir of trust\u2026  Unidentified Man #5: They trusted Cronkite more than anyone else.  Unidentified Man #6: He also was the most trusted.  ROBERT SIEGEL: The journalist who was known as the most trusted man in America.  RAEBURN: We're not going to take issue with any of that. We trusted him, too, but all this coverage made us wonder: Why did we trust him so much? What happens in our brains to make us trust one person and not another? Is it an automatic response, does it change with years of experience as we go on in life, or is it a little bit of both?  Joining me now to talk about the science of trust is my guest, Antonio Damasio, the Dornsife Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. He's also director of the Brain and Creativity Institute there, and he joins us from a studio on the Pepperdine University campus. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Damasio.  Dr. ANTONIO DAMASIO (University of Southern California): Thank you, pleasure to be here.  RAEBURN: Did you trust Walter Cronkite?  Dr. DAMASIO: Absolutely. I could say just about the same things we just have heard. He was entirely trustworthy, but the interesting thing is the reasons why he was, and you just outlined a couple of them, but I think we could go into detail, and it's certainly not one reason only.  RAEBURN: Did you think about your own reaction to him to try to sort this out?  Dr. DAMASIO: Yes, I did. But of course, since I have thought a little bit about this problem, and we have done some research on the issue, I think that my own reactions were not as important as what I think I know about trust. And of course, it's not very much, but it certainly helps.  RAEBURN: Spoken like a scientist. You're just an anecdotal example yourself, of course.  Dr. DAMASIO: Of course.  (Soundbite of laughter)  RAEBURN: Tell me just briefly, before we go to a break, what research you've done that bears on this question?  Dr. DAMASIO: Well, one has to do with the study we did years ago on faces, in which we have a large number of faces of men and women of different ages without a particular facial expression of emotion, in which we asked a large number also of men and women of all ages to rank the faces in terms of the degree of trustability.  In other words, the question was, how much would you trust this person with a problem of yours? How would you go to this person, and would you approach this person if you felt you had a problem?  And we got some very interesting results that, in a nutshell, were like this. People's faced divided in a bimodal distribution were largely the ones that were either extremely inspiring of trust or the ones that you really would not go to in case you were in need, and this was very interesting because it had to do just with normal behavior of normal people and faces that were quite normal, as well.  So that was one of the things we did, and then we also did a study that is very relevant to this, and that is a study in which one particular part of the brain, specifically the amygdale - which is a collection of nuclei deep in the temporal lobe. When that particular group of nuclei is damaged, it turns out that people become much more trustworthy, and I will tell you how.  RAEBURN: The - yes, tell me how.  Dr. DAMASIO: Well, so what happens is that if you have people who have damage to the amygdale, and they look at exactly the same faces that entirely normal folk looked at, they will look at the ones that everyone trusts very much, and they will give ratings that are very, very similar. However, when they look at the faces that normal individuals do not trust, it turns out that they trust them, as well.  RAEBURN: Let me stop you right there. We'll be right back after this short break.  (Soundbite of music)  RAEBURN: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  RAEBURN: From NPR News, this is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Paul Raeburn, filling in for Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about trust, why we trust people, why some people are more trusting than others, with my guest, Antonio Damasio, the Dornsife Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. He is also director of the Brain and Creativity Institute there.  Give us a call if you have question: 1-800-989-8255. We've heard a lot about trust in recent days with the passing of Walter Cronkite.  Dr. Damasio, there were several oft-replayed clips over the last week or so showing some emotion at the moon landing and at the death of President Kennedy. Is that kind of emotion, although he didn't show it often, something that could help build that bond between him and his viewers?  Dr. DAMASIO: I'm - of course it would help build the bond.

This is, by the way, the way we judge, automatically, faces as being beautiful or, for that matter, being ferocious, and I think trust falls in the same category.

Food contamination causes about 75 million illnesses a year in America, a figure President Obama says is unacceptable. NPR's Joanne Silberner talks with a food inspector and shares some food handling tips to keep us from getting sick. JOANNE SILBERNER: Imported food faces its first hurdle at ports like this one in Baltimore. WERTHEIMER: What you're looking at here is Point Breeze in the Port of Baltimore. And as you look out over the landscape you see literally thousands of containers. SILBERNER: Before the ships even dock, workers have identified what they want to inspect more closely - about 7,000 products a year. What requires close inspection is brought to a centralized exam site a few miles away. WERTHEIMER: We look for labeling violations. We look for insect infestation. We look for bioterrorism issues. SILBERNER: For swells or leaks in cans. Workers go over some of the containers with ultraviolet light to look for rodent urine. They pay special attention to products from importers that haven't been tested in a while or have tried to ship contaminated food in the past. SILBERNER: A staffer opens a carton of soy sauce and picks six bottles at random to send out to an FDA lab for closer analysis - bacteria, pesticide residues, feathers. Detained products that prove to be contaminated or mislabeled are destroyed or returned to the importer. WERTHEIMER: The average detention rate of products in Baltimore district is probably about nine percent of all the products we look at. SILBERNER: Doesn't that scare you about the products that you don't look at? WERTHEIMER: It does to some extent, but one has to hope that the products that we do target for examination are the ones that create the most health hazard and that's what we hope to accomplish. SILBERNER: The government estimates that about 325,000 people are hospitalized each year with a food-borne disease; 5000 people die. Sixteen years ago, one of them was the son of Nancy Donley. He ate contaminated meat regulated by the Department of Agriculture, not the FDA. Donley started a group called Safe Tables Our Priority or STOP. And she wants contaminated food to be identified before it gets to the port of Baltimore or anywhere else. WERTHEIMER: We need to have strong standards in place that countries must meet - food safety standards - before they are allowed to ship food to the United States. We don't have that system in place yet. SILBERNER: And she says, a closer watch is needed on domestically produced food as well. David Acheson of the Food and Drug Administration says the agency is working hard on food safety. It's expanded its philosophy. WERTHEIMER: Which really means focusing on prevention. Traditionally FDA has reacted to problems. We continue to react to problems, but the key here is to prevent the problems in the first place. SILBERNER: In the last year, it's opened up offices in China, India and several other places. It's increasing the number of inspections of farm food facilities from 100 to 1,000 a year. Still not a lot, he says, but it's something. It's working more closely with state agencies, and it's watching food safety legislation work its way through Congress. In the meantime, Nancy Donley of Safe Tables Our Priority now approaches food as if everything is contaminated. That may be more than what's needed, but what she does is what food experts and the FDA recommend. WERTHEIMER: I now use a meat thermometer, where I never used to before, and I make sure that I cook foods thoroughly to the temperatures that are recommended. SILBERNER: Joanne Silberner, NPR News.

Fishermen are pulling them out of the sea far faster than the fish populations can grow back. Some fisheries are heading toward collapse or even extinction. But a major new analysis shows that fisheries aren't all doomed. In fact, some are on the mend, as NPR's Richard Harris reports. RICHARD HARRIS: Three years ago, Boris Worm and his colleagues at Dalhousie University in Canada, sent shockwaves to the world of fishing and fishery science. They published a paper showing that if current trends continued, the oceans would essentially be fished out by the middle of this century. The paper was enormously controversial, both for its methods and its conclusions. But the controversy didn't just generate heat \u2014 it has generated light. Professor BORIS WORM (Marine Biology, Dalhousie University, Canada): Coming out of that controversy is some of the critics and myself and some of my co-workers, and a lot of other people who were interested in the topic, got together to do what's probably the most detailed assessment of world fisheries to date. HARRIS: Worm says this new analysis relies on much more scientific data to assess the state of the world's fisheries. And it's still not an upbeat report. Prof. WORM: This trend in increasing species collapse that we found in the previous paper still persists. HARRIS: But this paper, which is published in Science Magazine, then goes a step farther. Prof. WORM: What this paper shows is there are solutions, and those solutions are beginning to work in a number of places. HARRIS: Some of the good-news stories come from the United States. Strict federal fishing laws have cut back significantly on overfishing. For example, haddock off New England have rebounded so well, they're actually as healthy as they've ever been. Iceland, too, has rebuilt some of its fisheries. There's also a good-news story from Kenya. There, fisheries scientists have been working with the traditional fishermen. Prof. WORM: And the solution they have found was to ban a certain fishing gear, which was very unselective, and it was catching a lot of the fish before they could grow and reproduce - it's called a beach seine. And then the second solution was to implement closed areas. HARRIS: Boris Worm says fish reproduced in the closed areas safely, and then spread out to repopulate the overfished areas. Prof. HARRIS: And that has worked exceptionally well, and over a period of less than 10 years, the income of individual fishermen from the fishery has actually doubled in those areas that had both the net removed and the closed area in place. HARRIS: But for every hopeful example, there are many depressing ones. The worst one they document is in Europe. There, fish managers are letting fishermen drive the majestic bluefin tuna toward extinction. Prof. WORM: Our analysis actually shows that eastern bluefin tuna is the most overfished of all the species we looked at, meaning that the rate it's captured is about 10 times higher than what would be sustainable. HARRIS: Overall, 80 percent of Europe's fisheries are being overfished. And China is also fishing unsustainably on the high seas, but the facts there are sketchy. Steve Murawski, chief scientist at the National Marine Fisheries Service, says this new research is pretty realistic. It shows that fisheries aren't in fact doomed to extinction. Dr. STEVE MURAWSKI (Chief Scientist, National Marine Fisheries Service): In the majority of cases, in fact virtually all the cases, where fishery rates have been cut substantially, we've seen a positive response. And that is a pivotal result of this paper. It basically says that fishery management works. HARRIS: The issue is getting over what can be a painful transition from overfishing to a lower, but sustainable rate of fishing. That often means short-term pain as fishing boats and fishermen are forced into retirement. Dr. MURAWSKI: It's up to us. If we want sustainable fisheries, we can achieve them.

So it may come as some surprise to hear that jellyfish and similar animals could be influencing oceans and the climate on a global scale. That's what a report in this week's issue of the journal Nature suggests. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has more. GEOFF BRUMFIEL: It's not obvious that jellyfish would be involved in something as important as climate change. They're not particularly exciting animals. They don't have fins or teeth or even eyes to speak of. And they bob around in pretty much the same way that their ancestors did half a billion years ago. Professor JOHN DABIRI (Bioengineer, Caltech University): If you see them in the ocean, you think of them as sort of the leftovers in the gene pool, if you will. BRUMFIEL: That's John Dabiri. He's a bioengineer at Caltech who has been studying jellyfish for the better part of a decade. Prof. DABIRI: However, jellyfish are actually the first animals to use muscle power to swim. They've survived some major extinction events. And so we actually see them as a model system for successful propulsion now. BRUMFIEL: In fact, they're more successful than Dabiri, who, as it turns out, is a lousy swimmer. But he's got the upper hand when it comes to fluid mechanics. He's devoted a lot of time to learning about the swirls and eddies that jellyfish make as they swim. For decades, some scientists have speculated that swimming animals might contribute to stirring up water in the oceans, and that's where climate change comes in. Carbon dioxide from the air dissolves in the surface layer of the ocean. Stirring up the ocean sends that dissolved carbon dioxide to the bottom and stores it there. To find out whether jellyfish were helping the process, his team filmed dozens of the animals. It wasn't easy. Prof. DABIRI: We actually had a jellyfish that we were measuring out in Woods Hole. It's a place where we go quite often. And you have to understand that it can take a half an hour, an hour to get an animal in the perfect position to take these measurements. And right when the animal was set up, a crab comes out and grabs it in its claw and pulls it away. So we lost our data. BRUMFIEL: After studying the tapes, Dabiri and his team noticed something. As jellyfish swim, they stir up the water, but they also pull it along behind them. And, Dabiri says, it could work on a large scale. That's because every night, jellyfish and other smaller creatures swim thousands of feet up to the surface to feed. They may be dragging up cold water without much carbon dioxide in it, and pulling down warm water filled with carbon dioxide when they return to the depths. So could jellyfish help to combat climate change? Dr. BILL DEWAR (Oceanographer, Florida State University): I wouldn't go so far as to say that jellyfish are a solution to global warming. BRUMFIEL: Bill Dewar, an oceanographer at Florida State University. Dr. DEWAR: What I think we can say defensively at the moment is, is that it's a plausible idea, plausible input to mixing, which has been overlooked. BRUMFIEL: Dabiri says this work means that swimming marine life may need to be accounted for in future computer models of climate change. To do that, scientists need to know more about how the animals behave. Prof. DABIRI: So it really is a big question mark as to exactly where the animals are at any given time, and which animals are generating the mixing. We need more data. BRUMFIEL: For John Dabiri's colleagues, that's good news and bad. They're going to be traveling to more great ocean dive spots. But they're also probably going to be getting a lot more jellyfish stings. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News.

I'm Ira Flatow. You say you are a hardworking grad student and it's summer vacation time. You have a few weeks to kill before the new semester. If you want to take a trip or cruise to Alaska, Majorca, I got a better place. How about Great Pacific Garbage Patch? Yeah, that more your style? Well, maybe you can catch the next one because the first group is ready to leave this Sunday. Student scientists from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography will be headed out there. And their mission: to sample the water in the patch and get a handle of what happens to all that plastic that we dump into the ocean. Joining me now to talk more about the trip, dubbed SEAPLEX, is my guest Miriam Goldstein. She is the chief scientist for that mission that stands for Scripps Environmental Accumulation of Plastic Expedition. She is a Ph. D. student at Scripps and - that's at the University of California, San Diego. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Ms. MIRIAM GOLDSTEIN (Chief Scientist, University of California): Hi. I'm delighted to be here. FLATOW: How did you get on a gig like that? (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. GOLDSTEIN: Well, we're very fortunate at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography to have a program called the U. C. Ship Funds which allows graduate students such as myself and my colleagues and also post-docs and professors early in their career to apply to do our own cruises, which is really very, very unusual in the scientific world. So, we - last year, a group of students interested in this issue got together and wrote a grant to the U. C. Ship Funds and much to our surprise, it was funded and thus SEAPLEX was started. And just recently, few more - some more days of ship times were added by a non-profit that we're collaborating with called Project Kaisei. FLATOW: So, you're all getting on a ship on Sunday. And where are you headed to? Ms. GOLDSTEIN: Well, we are headed to really the middle of nowhere. We are going to be about a thousand miles offshore northeast of Hawaii. So if you sort of envision a spot pretty much evenly spaced between the northern California and Hawaii, that's where we'll be. FLATOW: And you're going to be sampling the water out there. And what is this Great Garbage Patch like? Ms. GOLDSTEIN: Well, I just want to attribute it to - upon what we think, although we haven't seen it yet, we're pretty sure there is no island. Like, there is no\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. GOLDSTEIN: \u2026we're going to able to walk across the water on the garbage, although that does sound like fun, but it is\u2026 FLATOW: Not like a giant land\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: It's not like a giant landfill out there is what\u2026 Ms. GOLDSTEIN: Exactly. We are in fact - we think, although again we'll report back once we get there, is that we're not going to actually be able to see much visually at all. Most of the trash is thought to be less than a couple of millimeters in size. The group that's done the most work out there, the Algalita Marine Research Foundation, has found that pretty much there's about one of these little pieces per meter cubed of water. So that's like a tiny piece the size of your little fingernail inside, say, something the size of a mini-fridge. So, you can't really see that with your eyes, although it's a lot compared to having no plastic in the ocean, like there should be. So how we look at that is we're going to drag assorted kinds of nets through the water and gather up that plastic that way. FLATOW: And how did all that stuff get there? Ms. GOLDSTEIN: Well, we think that - and the current research thinks that most of it is actually coming off land. The way the currents go, everything that comes off the West Coast of the U. S. and everything that comes off the east coast of Asia would - that make that float would be predicted to accumulate in this area. FLATOW: So there are currents that are just drawing it from east and west. Ms. GOLDSTEIN: That's right. The gyre - the North Pacific Gyre itself is an oceanographic feature. It's like a big slow whirlpool that currents clockwise. So, stuff from California gets drawn south in the California current and sort of twirls around. And stuff that comes off Asia gets - goes east in the Kuroshio Current and then everything just gets drawn towards the middle as this big whirlpool turns. FLATOW: And so you're going to take - you take a net and scoop it up or you're going to sample it in water, like in jars and things like that? Ms. GOLDSTEIN: Oh, we're going to do it all. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. GOLDSTEIN: We'll be both taking water samples and that will be looking at the really small stuff, the phytoplankton, the tiny plants. And we're also going to be doing different kinds of nets for the little animals, the zooplankton, as well as the plastic. And we'll be doing somewhat larger nets to look at the small fish. We're also - if we see big accumulation, we're just going to scoop it right up in hand nets and looks at the animals that are growing on it, as well as what kinds of debris are out there. FLATOW: Are going to be sending Tweets from out there in the ship? Ms. GOLDSTEIN: We will be. We're going to be both - trying to do at least one blog entry a day and sending Tweets and posting a daily picture. And I believe our collaborators, Project Kaisei, are also going to plan on posting a whole bunch of pictures. So, be able to follow along with what we're seeing out there. FLATOW: And how long will you be out there for? Ms. GOLDSTEIN: We're going to be out there for 20 days. So, we'll get in - we're leaving on Sunday. We'll get into Newport, Oregon on August 21st. FLATOW: I hope you're taking a lot of suntan oil. Ms. GOLDSTEIN: We sure are. I actually have started ordering it in bulk from Cosco. It's one of the habits of the job. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: All right. Well, good luck to you. Ms. GOLDSTEIN: Well, thank you so much. FLATOW: And how will you know that this has been successful a mission? Rather than just something to do when you write about what I did on my summer vacation? Ms. GOLDSTEIN: I don't - doctoral students usually don't get summer vacations unfortunately. But we - what we're hoping - we're - I'm sorry, I had to rephrase that. We're going to - it's going to take us a while to figure out what we found because what we're actually going to come off the ship with is about a thousand jars filled with stuff that came up in our net. But it's all really small. So, it's going to take us a while of looking at it under the microscope and doing different kinds of analyses to really figure out what we had. But such is the cost of science. You get to spend, you know, three weeks on the ocean and then, a year and a half in the lab. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Well\u2026 Ms. GOLDSTEIN: But we're thrilled that we get to do it. FLATOW: Well, good luck to you. I want to wish you good luck as I say and happy hunting. Ms. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you so much. FLATOW: We'll check back when you back in. Ms. GOLDSTEIN: We will. Thank you. FLATOW: Miriam Goldstein is chief scientist for the SEAPLEX Mission and that's the Scripps Environmental Accumulation of Plastic Expedition headed out to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow.  You say you are a hardworking grad student and it's summer vacation time. You have a few weeks to kill before the new semester. If you want to take a trip or cruise to Alaska, Majorca, I got a better place. How about Great Pacific Garbage Patch? Yeah, that more your style? Well, maybe you can catch the next one because the first group is ready to leave this Sunday. Student scientists from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography will be headed out there. And their mission: to sample the water in the patch and get a handle of what happens to all that plastic that we dump into the ocean.  Joining me now to talk more about the trip, dubbed SEAPLEX, is my guest Miriam Goldstein. She is the chief scientist for that mission that stands for Scripps Environmental Accumulation of Plastic Expedition. She is a Ph. D. student at Scripps and - that's at the University of California, San Diego. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Ms. MIRIAM GOLDSTEIN (Chief Scientist, University of California): Hi. I'm delighted to be here.  FLATOW: How did you get on a gig like that?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. GOLDSTEIN: Well, we're very fortunate at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography to have a program called the U. C. Ship Funds which allows graduate students such as myself and my colleagues and also post-docs and professors early in their career to apply to do our own cruises, which is really very, very unusual in the scientific world. So, we - last year, a group of students interested in this issue got together and wrote a grant to the U. C. Ship Funds and much to our surprise, it was funded and thus SEAPLEX was started. And just recently, few more - some more days of ship times were added by a non-profit that we're collaborating with called Project Kaisei.  FLATOW: So, you're all getting on a ship on Sunday. And where are you headed to?  Ms. GOLDSTEIN: Well, we are headed to really the middle of nowhere. We are going to be about a thousand miles offshore northeast of Hawaii. So if you sort of envision a spot pretty much evenly spaced between the northern California and Hawaii, that's where we'll be.  FLATOW: And you're going to be sampling the water out there. And what is this Great Garbage Patch like?  Ms. GOLDSTEIN: Well, I just want to attribute it to - upon what we think, although we haven't seen it yet, we're pretty sure there is no island. Like, there is no\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. GOLDSTEIN: \u2026we're going to able to walk across the water on the garbage, although that does sound like fun, but it is\u2026  FLATOW: Not like a giant land\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: It's not like a giant landfill out there is what\u2026  Ms. GOLDSTEIN: Exactly. We are in fact - we think, although again we'll report back once we get there, is that we're not going to actually be able to see much visually at all. Most of the trash is thought to be less than a couple of millimeters in size. The group that's done the most work out there, the Algalita Marine Research Foundation, has found that pretty much there's about one of these little pieces per meter cubed of water. So that's like a tiny piece the size of your little fingernail inside, say, something the size of a mini-fridge.  So, you can't really see that with your eyes, although it's a lot compared to having no plastic in the ocean, like there should be. So how we look at that is we're going to drag assorted kinds of nets through the water and gather up that plastic that way.  FLATOW: And how did all that stuff get there?  Ms. GOLDSTEIN: Well, we think that - and the current research thinks that most of it is actually coming off land. The way the currents go, everything that comes off the West Coast of the U. S. and everything that comes off the east coast of Asia would - that make that float would be predicted to accumulate in this area.  FLATOW: So there are currents that are just drawing it from east and west.  Ms. GOLDSTEIN: That's right. The gyre - the North Pacific Gyre itself is an oceanographic feature. It's like a big slow whirlpool that currents clockwise. So, stuff from California gets drawn south in the California current and sort of twirls around. And stuff that comes off Asia gets - goes east in the Kuroshio Current and then everything just gets drawn towards the middle as this big whirlpool turns.  FLATOW: And so you're going to take - you take a net and scoop it up or you're going to sample it in water, like in jars and things like that?  Ms. GOLDSTEIN: Oh, we're going to do it all.

A deadly form of malaria has something in common with HIV-AIDS. Both appear to have jumped to humans from chimpanzees in Africa. That's according to a new genetic study of the origins of what's known as malignant malaria. NPR's Jon Hamilton explains. JON HAMILTON: Malaria kills more than a million people each year. It's spread by mosquitoes carrying parasites that cause the disease. And a parasite called Plasmodium falciparum causes the most dangerous form of malaria. Professor FRANCISCO AYALA (University of California, Irvine): It's a very, very nasty disease. HAMILTON: Francisco Ayala of the University of California, Irvine has spent the past 15 years trying to trace the origin of the falciparum parasite. He says people who grow up in areas where it is common develop some immunity. But everyone else is very vulnerable, including scientists like the famous geneticist William Hamilton. He was in Africa a few years ago doing research on the origin of HIV. Prof. AYALA: The sad story is he got bitten. He got infected with malignant malaria. A few days later he was dead. That's why falciparum malaria is feared. HAMILTON: But scientists couldn't figure out where the parasite came from. Dan Hartl, a biologist at Harvard, says there was a lot of confusion. Professor DANIEL HARTL (Biology, Harvard University): The earliest data suggested that human malaria might have come from birds. HAMILTON: That was based on a genetic analysis that showed similarities between parasites carried by birds and those in people. Prof. HARTL: Everybody was a little skeptical of that result. But that's the way the data were pointing at the time. HAMILTON: Ayala was among the skeptics. So, he and his team began studying parasites carried by chimps. First, they discovered a parasite that was much closer to falciparum than the bird parasites. Then they tried to figure out whether this parasite had infected a common ancestor of humans and chimps millions of years ago or whether the chimp version had jumped into humans more recently. His team took samples of parasites from chimps and humans and studied regions of DNA in which mutations tend to accumulate at a known rate. Prof. AYALA: Because they are timekeepers. HAMILTON: The regions act as a sort of genetic clock: the longer a parasite has been around, the more mutations it acquires. Ayala says his team found that the chimp parasite called reichenowi, had a lot more mutations than the human parasite, falciparum. Prof. AYALA: Indicating, thereby, clearly that the reichenowi is the ancestor of falciparum. At some point there was a transmission from a chimp to a human. HAMILTON: Hartl says the finding offers a major revision of malaria's history. Prof. HARTL: It suggests that there was a single transfer from chimps to humans, and that it surely occurred well within the last, let's say, 100,000 years. HAMILTON: And perhaps quite recently. Scientists say it's only in the past 10,000 years or so that nomadic people in Africa began to settle down and cultivate the land. That meant denser populations and standing water, the conditions that make it easy for mosquitoes to transmit parasites from one person to the next. Hartl says Ayala's version of events makes sense to him. Prof. HARTL: This brings the human malaria picture into consonance with what we know about other monkey and primate malarias. HAMILTON: As well as what we know about diseases including HIV. And that should make it easier to come up with better medicines or a vaccine.

Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. : mouth guards for sleep apnea. But first, what is normal sleep, and how do we get it? Research suggests that shifting to two rounds of shut eye, with a period of wakefulness in the middle of the night, is a natural tendency for some people. NPR's Allison Aubrey reports. ALLISON AUBREY: If you've ever been camping, sleeping under the stars, when suddenly you wake up and sort of lie there awhile quietly, then you doze off again 'til morning - well, that sort of divided sleep is similar to what many Colonial Americans likely experienced. Here's psychiatrist Tom Wehr. : There are historical records of people sleeping in two bouts at night. They called the first bout first sleep, or dead sleep, and the second bout, they called morning sleep. And the period in between, they referred to as watch, or watching. AUBREY: Wehr points out that before artificial lighting, a winter day could bring 14 hours of solid darkness. People lived from sun to sun. He was curious. What might happen if he put busy Americans into that environment? How would they sleep? To find out, he and his colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health recruited 15 healthy adult volunteers, who went about their normal business during the day, then reported to a sleep lab in the early evening. : We had our subjects basically go into the dark at 6 o'clock at night, lie down and rest, and then get up at 8 o'clock in the morning. So it was a kind of simulated winter day. AUBREY: What Wehr found is that the long nights had the same effect on his subjects as they had on colonial folks: two bouts of concentrated sleep, with a wakeful period in the middle - say, at 1 or 2 a. m. - lasting a few hours. And Wehr says interestingly, most of the participants described it as a time of quiet calm. : You might think that lying awake for two hours in the middle of the night would be a kind of torture, but it wasn't at all. It was a - it's a kind of a quiescent, almost meditative state. AUBREY: The notion of staying in bed, or in the dark, for 12 hours may seem ridiculous. We have busy lives, and experts say it's no surprise that in our 24/7 culture, we've adapted to a more efficient way of sleeping, consolidating it into one long stretch. This works for most people, but as we age, sleep changes. : Sleep tends to be more fragile, in general, as we age. AUBREY: Mary Carskadon is the director of chronobiology and sleep research at Brown University. She explains one way to assess the age-related changes in sleep is to look at brain waves. : When we're little, we have a lot of very high, slow brain waves at the beginning of the night. And that seems to be the best, most restorative kind of sleep. AUBREY: But as the decades go by, these peaks diminish. So if adolescent brain waves are the Himalayas, then by early adulthood, think Rockies, and in the elderly, Appalachians - or just foothills. : And so it's easier to wake us up because those high, slow waves are very protective for disturbances in the environment. AUBREY: Say a snoring partner or a barking dog. So the question is, what can we do about it? One option is to embrace a longer night. Sleep expert Jack Edinger of Duke University points out this really only works for people who are retired or have very flexible schedules. : They can afford, arguably, to spend more time in bed and experience this middle-of-the-night wake time because they can then stay in bed later in the morning and have that second bout of sleep. AUBREY: One technique is to tightly restrict the number of hours in bed, sort of encouraging efficient sleep. Edinger stresses that sleep requirements vary, with six to nine hours being the normal range. : There are people that fall outside of that range and do fine.

I'm Madeline Brand in California. MELISSA BLOCK, host: I'm Melissa Block in Washington. And, Madeline? BRAND: Mm-hmm. BLOCK: How many physicists do you think it takes to fix the world's biggest particle collider? BRAND: Melissa, is this one of your physicist jokes? (Soundbite of laughter) BLOCK: I think it might be. And I actually have no idea what the punch line would be. But I can tell you this: the giant machine broke down last fall and high-energy physics went on hold. Now, Europe's high energy physics lab CERN has announced plans to restart the collider. And NPR's Geff Brumfiel is going to tell us all about it. GEOFFREY BRUMFIEL: If you want to see something really new in high-energy physics, you've got to go big and that's where the Large Hadron Collider comes in. The LHC is nearly 17 miles around. It accelerates ordinary particles to near the speed of light and smashes them together. Researchers hope that studying the subatomic shrapnel from those collisions will bring them closer to a theory of everything, and might also reveal other things like dark matter. That's the strange stuff that glues galaxies together. The LHC is vastly complicated, which is why it's so amazing that last September, scientists got particles whizzing around the ring on the very first try. Unidentified Man: Okay (Foreign language spoken) Unidentified Woman: Three, Two, One, go. (Soundbite of cheering) BRUMFIEL: It all went so smoothly that researchers were expecting the particles to start colliding right away. Joe Lykken is a theoretical physicist at Fermilab near Chicago. Dr. JOE LYKKEN (Theoretical Physicist, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory): We were actually betting on when the first collisions would happen. We had a pool going on whether it would be tomorrow or next week or two weeks from now. BRUMFIEL: Nine days later, all bets were off. A faulty connection caused a massive electrical short. Repairing the mess has taken most of the year. Now to understand what this means for high-energy physics, you have to understand that the LHC is pretty much the only game in town. Fermilab also has a working collider, but it's only a fraction as powerful. That makes it a lot harder to find the really cool stuff everyone wants to study, like dark matter. Dr. LYKKEN: It's very disconcerting for all of us in terms of planning our lives. We want to be there when the exciting things are happening. But we can't afford to just hang around in Geneva forever and wait for years and years for these things to come up and run. BRUMFIEL: Top researchers can go work on something else for a while, but junior scientists need the LHC. Dr. LYKKEN: The people that are really hurts are the young people, especially the graduate students who were hoping to have LHC data to analyze in order to finish their Ph. D. theses and become famous and get jobs. Ms. SARAH LOCKWITZ (Graduate Student, Yale University): Don't let me see anything that destroys my career. (Soundbite of laughter) BRUMFIEL: That's Sarah Lockwitz. She and her husband are both graduate students at Yale. They moved near Geneva to be closer to the collider. They needed its data to finish their Ph. Ds. But the delays have made that impossible. So, this summer, they made a big decision. They left Switzerland for Illinois, to get data from the smaller collider at Fermilab. Ms. LOCKWITZ: On the Geneva side, we had to sell everything for, you know, pennies on the dollar, a pennies on the euro or whatever you want to say, to try and get out of there in a couple of weeks and we just came over with two suitcases and landed and realized like the car we left behind didn't work. So we used Cash-for-Clunkers and got a new car and drove over to Chicago. BRUMFIEL: They're not alone. An increasing number of American graduate students are moving back to Fermilab. Others are just having to wait. It's not ideal, says Joe Lykken. Dr. LYKKEN: We shrug our shoulders, what else can we do? You don't just switch on a machine like the LHC and have it run smoothly on day one. It's just not the way these things work. BRUMFIEL: When the LHC switches on again in November, it'll be at energies too low to see very much. But for the waiting physicists, low energies are better than no energies. Geff Brumfiel, NPR News.  MADELINE BRAND, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Madeline Brand in California.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  I'm Melissa Block in Washington. And, Madeline?  BRAND: Mm-hmm.  BLOCK: How many physicists do you think it takes to fix the world's biggest particle collider?  BRAND: Melissa, is this one of your physicist jokes?  (Soundbite of laughter)  BLOCK: I think it might be. And I actually have no idea what the punch line would be. But I can tell you this: the giant machine broke down last fall and high-energy physics went on hold. Now, Europe's high energy physics lab CERN has announced plans to restart the collider. And NPR's Geff Brumfiel is going to tell us all about it.  GEOFFREY BRUMFIEL: If you want to see something really new in high-energy physics, you've got to go big and that's where the Large Hadron Collider comes in. The LHC is nearly 17 miles around. It accelerates ordinary particles to near the speed of light and smashes them together. Researchers hope that studying the subatomic shrapnel from those collisions will bring them closer to a theory of everything, and might also reveal other things like dark matter. That's the strange stuff that glues galaxies together. The LHC is vastly complicated, which is why it's so amazing that last September, scientists got particles whizzing around the ring on the very first try.  Unidentified Man: Okay (Foreign language spoken)  Unidentified Woman: Three, Two, One, go.  (Soundbite of cheering)  BRUMFIEL: It all went so smoothly that researchers were expecting the particles to start colliding right away. Joe Lykken is a theoretical physicist at Fermilab near Chicago.  Dr. JOE LYKKEN (Theoretical Physicist, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory): We were actually betting on when the first collisions would happen. We had a pool going on whether it would be tomorrow or next week or two weeks from now.  BRUMFIEL: Nine days later, all bets were off. A faulty connection caused a massive electrical short. Repairing the mess has taken most of the year. Now to understand what this means for high-energy physics, you have to understand that the LHC is pretty much the only game in town. Fermilab also has a working collider, but it's only a fraction as powerful. That makes it a lot harder to find the really cool stuff everyone wants to study, like dark matter.  Dr. LYKKEN: It's very disconcerting for all of us in terms of planning our lives. We want to be there when the exciting things are happening. But we can't afford to just hang around in Geneva forever and wait for years and years for these things to come up and run.  BRUMFIEL: Top researchers can go work on something else for a while, but junior scientists need the LHC.  Dr. LYKKEN: The people that are really hurts are the young people, especially the graduate students who were hoping to have LHC data to analyze in order to finish their Ph. D. theses and become famous and get jobs.  Ms. SARAH LOCKWITZ (Graduate Student, Yale University): Don't let me see anything that destroys my career.  (Soundbite of laughter)  BRUMFIEL: That's Sarah Lockwitz. She and her husband are both graduate students at Yale. They moved near Geneva to be closer to the collider. They needed its data to finish their Ph. Ds. But the delays have made that impossible. So, this summer, they made a big decision. They left Switzerland for Illinois, to get data from the smaller collider at Fermilab.  Ms. LOCKWITZ: On the Geneva side, we had to sell everything for, you know, pennies on the dollar, a pennies on the euro or whatever you want to say, to try and get out of there in a couple of weeks and we just came over with two suitcases and landed and realized like the car we left behind didn't work.

About a half-dozen spiny, venomous lionfish washed into the Atlantic Ocean. Lionfish are native to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, but in the past few years they've spread up the eastern seaboard and throughout the Caribbean. The Bahamas have been hit the hardest. Ann Dornfeld has the story from the Exuma Islands. ANN DORNFELD: People come to the Exumas to kayak between tiny, uninhabited islands and dive in the shallow, turquoise water. (Soundbite of splash) DORNFELD: Above the water, the landscape looks like pristine tropical paradise. But the same is not true beneath the waves. Oregon State University zoology professor, Mark Hixon, has studied reef fish here for almost two decades. Professor MARK HIXON (Zoology, Oregon State University): In 2005, the first lionfish showed up, and we didn't pay much attention to it. The next year, we saw a few more. And then in 2007 there was a population explosion. There were so many lionfish around that they were eating the fish that we were studying, and we had to start studying the lionfish. There was nothing else to do. DORNFELD: They're hard to miss with their red and white stripes and a tall row of venomous spines down their backs. The fan-like fins look like a lion's mane. And like a lion, they're ferocious predators. Last year, Hixon co-authored a study with Mark Albins that showed a lionfish can kill three-quarters of a reef's fish population in just five weeks. Prof. HIXON: This year we're going to see if that's gotten worse \u2014 because the number of lionfish has definitely increased in the intervening year. (Soundbite of scuba gear) DORNFELD: We pull on scuba gear and descend to the coral reefs. (Soundbite of splashing) DORNFELD: Hixon shines a light under every ledge, looking for lionfish and the fish they like to eat. After a few minutes, he waves his light frantically under an overhang. A lionfish the size of a football fans the water with its huge, quilled fins. These days, the only thing unusual about spotting a lionfish in the Bahamas is seeing just one of them. Back on the boat, Hixon is upbeat. Last year, his team pulled more than a dozen lionfish off this reef. Prof. HIXON: And this year, there's just one. And so what that tells us is that our removals took and lasted a whole year. DORNFELD: But Hixon says divers can only catch so many. So he's also studying native lionfish in the Pacific Ocean to understand what keeps their populations in check. Parasites could be one limiting factor. Zoologist Paul Sikkel peers through a microscope at the gills of one of the lionfish Hixon's team has just caught. Mr. PAUL SIKKEL (Zoologist): Wow. Just so clean. There's nothing in there. Have a look. A local fish, you'd see a bunch of really small worms on those red gill filaments. And they squirm, so it's easy to pick them out. But there's nothing on there. DORNFELD: Sikkel says native fish are crawling with parasites - these lionfish aren't - and that might be one secret to the invasion. Mr. SIKKEL: If you consider parasites as sort of a tax that fish have to pay, a lot of their energy gets diverted into parasites, and so a fish that doesn't have those can devote more of its energy to its own growth and reproduction. DORNFELD: Until marine predators or parasites learn to feed on lionfish, the best hope for slowing the spread may be humans. They're a delicacy in Asia, but not in the Bahamas, given the painful sting their spines can inflict. A few restaurants serve lionfish now, but there's an effort to teach Bahamians to catch and cook them. Lakeshia Anderson with the Bahamas Department of Fisheries says their livelihoods depend on slowing the invasion. Ms. LAKESHIA ANDERSON (Bahamas Department of Fisheries): With the quantities of lionfish that we've found in our waters and the amount of food that they consume, it has the potential of really collapsing our commercially important species \u2014 our fishing industry in general. DORNFELD: Tourism is a $5 billion-a-year industry and accounts for half the employment in the Bahamas. Anderson worries that the lionfish continue to devour colorful reef fish, divers will vacation elsewhere. Researcher Mark Hixon says in some places, the damage is already done. Prof. HIXON: I was diving on a reef I've studied since 1991 last week, and it was so degraded and there were so few fish in what used to be a teeming reef, that at one point I was overcome and went to tears. DORNFELD: He says in the best case scenario, some natural control will kick in and lionfish will become a minor part of the Caribbean and Atlantic reef community. For NPR News, I'm Ann Dornfeld.

I'm Madeleine Brand in California. MELISSA BLOCK, host: And I'm Melissa Block in Washington. The oceans may seem endless, but in fact, we're starting to run out of room. That's especially true in coastal waters. Conflicts arise between the needs of wind energy, aqua culture, shipping, wildlife and of course, fishing. Before those conflicts get out of hand, the Obama administration is hoping to create a master plan for managing territorial waters. Today we begin a three-part series Oceans at Risk. And NPR's Richard Harris travels to one potential flashpoint for conflict: Massachusetts Bay. RICHARD HARRIS: Anybody who has tried to dodge around Boston's notorious streets can tell you that the city is one bustling place. But it might come as a surprise that the same can be said for the waters that extend off of Boston shore out into Massachusetts Bay. And there's no better way to make that point than to head out to sea. Ms. SALLY YOZELL (Nature Conservancy): Oh, we could not have picked a better day. HARRIS: Sally Yozell of the Nature Conservancy has offered to take us out with a friend of hers, Captain John Williamson. The sun is shining and there's a cooling breeze. Ms. YOZELL: Here he is. HARRIS: The fisherman turned conservationist pulls his gleaming, white boat up to a dock behind Boston's aquarium. Captain JOHN WILLIAMSON (Conservationist): Good morning. HARRIS: Nice to meet you. Capt. WILLIAMSON: Nice to meet you. HARRIS: We breathe deep the tangy salt air tinged with a hint of diesel. (Soundbite of boat) Capt. WILLIAMSON: We are steaming out of Boston Harbor on the Sea Keeper, which is a modified lobster boat. It was obvious, as we were passing the Boston waterfront, that people have planned and thought very carefully about what would be built out there. What Boston has done to its waterfront, Massachusetts is now planning to do to the waters out here. (Soundbite of boat) HARRIS: Zoning is coming soon to the ocean to help sort out the many conflicting uses. We pass freighters as the city skyline starts to recede, and we see fishing trawlers docked along the shore, unloading their catches. A lone windmill stands in the distance, a harbinger of some big plans for offshore wind in the area. And from the helm, Williamson says, don't forget about the rich and abundant wildlife here, above and below the waves. Capt. WILLIAMSON: We're now about to go into Mass Bay. And Mass Bay is one of the most diverse ecological areas in the eastern seaboard, okay? And it also happens to be juxtaposed with a six million urban population in Boston. HARRIS: Bostonians need, among other things, fuel to heat their homes. And some of that is shipped from overseas to a point about three miles offshore. Ms. YOZELL: So we're coming up on the liquefied natural gas terminal. And you can see off to our side that there is a - what looks like a service vessel that is probably finishing off some of the construction. It looks pretty benign from the surface, don't you think? HARRIS: Yeah, I don't see anything at all. Ms. YOZELL: Nope. Not much to see on the surface from here, although there's probably a small buoy and dock on the other side of that ship. HARRIS: Yozell says from this point, a flexible pipe runs down 250 feet to the ocean bottom and into a buried pipeline, which carries the gas ashore. There's a second terminal nearby, so two gas tankers can unload at the same time. Capt. WILLIAMSON: There's a quarter-mile restricted zone radius around each one, and they're about a quarter mile apart. HARRIS: It's one of the rare instances where the sea is already zoned. In this case, an area reserved exclusively for gargantuan, liquefied natural gas tankers. (Soundbite of boat) HARRIS: A whale-watching vessel steams across our bow. Williamson throttles up and follows it toward the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary. From the surface, the sanctuary is indistinguishable from the sea around it. But Williamson says don't be fooled. Capt. WILLIAMSON: It's very easy standing on the beach and you look out at the expanse of blue water and you think that it's all the same. But not every square inch of the ocean is the same. And some areas are very much more important than others. HARRIS: Stellwagen is a case in point. Here, the water suddenly becomes shallower. That, in turn, lifts the nutrient-rich Labrador Current up from the depths and feeds a thriving ecosystem. Small fish called sand lances are abundant and those in turn attract larger fish and in turn a phalanx of fishing vessels. Capt. WILLIAMSON: These are all boats out here that are fishing for bluefin tuna. HARRIS: Seagulls and storm-petrels reel in the dazzling blue sky and dip down to join the feast. The whale-watching boat is here because the fish also attract humpback whales. Capt. WILLIAMSON: The sand lance is like a pad of butter for the humpback whale. They're just a very fatty fish. And then, so these whales are spending the summer here fattening up for a long, lean winter. HARRIS: So whales and fishing boats share the marine sanctuary. Sally Yozell says that's a compromise. It might work out, but nobody can say for sure because nobody is really looking at the big picture out here. Ms. YOZELL: The federal government manages for each individual sector. So you have the fisheries service managing on fisheries. You have the minerals management service on energy. You have the Fish and Wildlife Service on birds and, you know, Army Corps on dredging. And they all do it individually. HARRIS: The Obama administration is now in the midst of developing a comprehensive management plan for U. S. waters for the first time ever. Some states, such as Massachusetts, are already leading the way. States control the first three miles of coastal waters. The federal government controls everything beyond that, out to 200 miles. This summer, Ian Bowles unveiled Massachusetts' draft plan for managing its waters. He's secretary for Energy and Environmental Affairs. And he says what really pushed the state legislature to act was the prospect of some large offshore wind farms, including a controversial one off of Cape Cod. Secretary IAN BOWLES (Energy and Environmental Affairs): It's actually in federal waters and not covered by this plan and so far along in the permitting process that it was exempted by the legislature. But I think the idea that there were going to be several other proposals for our state waters for commercial wind development. But, really, a sense that we needed to figure out where do want this to happen and where do we need to - where are the areas that it should avoid? HARRIS: During the process, the state has tentatively selected two sites for offshore wind and rejected a third as too environmentally sensitive. With this plan, clean offshore wind will meet only just a tiny fraction of the demand for power in Massachusetts. Another sore point: Bowles acknowledges that the plan does not designate any new area as truly protected marine preserves. Sec. BOWLES: We'll end up, of course, with criticism from the conservation community and the renewable energy industry. And we think we've done a good job of balancing all those different factors. Ms. YOZELL: It's a brilliant framework. They've really laid out an excellent framework. HARRIS: Sally Yozell from the Nature Conservancy says, even so, there's room from improvement. Ms. YOZELL: We would like to see them go a little further on the cumulative impacts: what happens over years and what happens when you layer different human uses on the environment for areas that certainly need to be set off for certain protections. (Soundbite of boat) HARRIS: Back on the boat, our persistence on the Stellwagen Bank has paid off. Sally Yozell spies a humpback whale's fin slicing through the waves. Ms. YOZELL: That's a pretty good sized one. There goes the flute. Cool. HARRIS: Captain John Williamson chases behind at a respectable distance so we can get a closer look. Ms. YOZELL: Oh, there goes the spout. Oh, it's cruising. That's beautiful. HARRIS: The graceful and vulnerable animal is a living reminder of what's at stake out here in the bustling waters off the coast. Richard Harris, NPR News. BLOCK: And at our new redesigned Web site, npr. org, you can find the Massachusetts draft plan for ocean management. BRAND: And tomorrow we continue our series Oceans at Risk with a trip to the Caribbean island of Bonaire. In 1998, a massive warming episode in the oceans killed off nearly a fifth of the world's coral. On Bonaire, all that remained was a vast expanse of bleached out, lifeless reefs. Unidentified Man: The reef slope actually looked like a mountain slope full of snow. People here were taking their skis out and took pictures for home, like they were skiing the coral reefs. BRAND: The reef recovered and now scientists are studying it to find out what will make coral reefs resilient as global warming heats up the oceans. We'll have that story for you tomorrow on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.  MADELEINE BRAND, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Madeleine Brand in California.

Ms. YOZELL: We would like to see them go a little further on the cumulative impacts: what happens over years and what happens when you layer different human uses on the environment for areas that certainly need to be set off for certain protections.  (Soundbite of boat)  HARRIS: Back on the boat, our persistence on the Stellwagen Bank has paid off. Sally Yozell spies a humpback whale's fin slicing through the waves.  Ms. YOZELL: That's a pretty good sized one. There goes the flute. Cool.  HARRIS: Captain John Williamson chases behind at a respectable distance so we can get a closer look.  Ms. YOZELL: Oh, there goes the spout. Oh, it's cruising. That's beautiful.  HARRIS: The graceful and vulnerable animal is a living reminder of what's at stake out here in the bustling waters off the coast.  Richard Harris, NPR News.  BLOCK: And at our new redesigned Web site, npr. org, you can find the Massachusetts draft plan for ocean management.  BRAND: And tomorrow we continue our series Oceans at Risk with a trip to the Caribbean island of Bonaire. In 1998, a massive warming episode in the oceans killed off nearly a fifth of the world's coral. On Bonaire, all that remained was a vast expanse of bleached out, lifeless reefs.  Unidentified Man: The reef slope actually looked like a mountain slope full of snow. People here were taking their skis out and took pictures for home, like they were skiing the coral reefs.  BRAND: The reef recovered and now scientists are studying it to find out what will make coral reefs resilient as global warming heats up the oceans.

Delirium is a common problem that affects more than two million seniors a year when they go into the hospital. Now, health care professionals are trying to teach doctors and families how to deal with it. NPR's Joseph Shapiro reports. JOSEPH SHAPIRO: Virginia Helton says her husband is a brilliant man. He's a scientist who can explain complex chemistry and physics. But when he was in the hospital last February, she didn't recognize the man who was acting so bizarrely. Ms. VIRGINIA HELTON: I was feeling very scared. SHAPIRO: Her husband was talking wild nonsense. He was taking off his clothes. Mr. EARLE HELTON: I remember quite vividly my desire to escape. SHAPIRO: That's Earle Helton. He's 79. Mr. HELTON: And as a matter of fact, I ended up executing, at least one occasion, managed to get through the hospital and underneath one of the surgical beds. Ms. HELTON: They tied his hands down because he kept trying to get out of bed. And that made him furious. And they did that several times when he was in this state of delirium. SHAPIRO: Delirium - it's a sudden and frightening onset of confusion. Dr. Sharon Inouye was working at the Boston hospital where Earl Helton was a patient. She recognized he was on an anti-seizure medication that can cause confusion and she stopped the medicine. Inouye says delirium is a common, but largely unrecognized problem in elderly people when they're in the hospital. Dr. SHARON INOUYE (Geriatrician, Harvard Medical School, Hebrew SeniorLife): What we look for is a person who is having a lot of difficulty answering questions. They often will not make sense. They may hallucinate. They may be very agitated. They may have a totally different personality. You know, very often family members will say to me: Well, he's nothing like that at home. SHAPIRO: Inouye is a geriatrician at Harvard Medical School and Hebrew SeniorLife. She's seen delirium in her own patients, even in her own elderly father. Dr. INOUYE: My father wound up getting delirious, even when I was there at his bedside. And I'm an expert in delirium, and I couldn't prevent it from happening. SHAPIRO: She says because hospital care is so complex and fragmented. Dr. INOUYE: There were just so many physicians taking care of my father, so many medications. It was really hard for me to keep track of everything. You know, I knew there were certain medications he couldn't tolerate, and I told one group of physicians. And then another group of physicians would prescribe it. And so it just was really quite eye-opening. SHAPIRO: If one of the world's leading researchers on delirium couldn't protect her own father, you might feel helpless, too. Still, there are things to do, steps based on the workup Inouye and others researchers like Dr. Malaz Boustani at Indiana University's School of Medicine. He says family members can start by being aware of drugs that can cause delirium. Dr. MALAZ BOUSTANI (Indiana University School of Medicine): There's one class of medications that are really a big factor of triggering delirium. We call them anti-cholinergic medications. SHAPIRO: These are common prescription and over-the-counter drugs. They include some sleeping pills, asthma medications and antidepressants. Boustani says it's also important for older patients in the hospital to keep using their eyeglasses and hearing aids, and that they're allowed to sleep through the night, because delirium can be triggered by an environment that creates confusion. Boustani recently studied a thousand elderly people who came to an Indianapolis hospital. One-third developed delirium. He says doctors often dismiss delirium because they think it's just dementia in older people. The two are different. Delirium is a temporary form of cognitive impairment. Still, there's a link between dementia and delirium. Dr. BOUSTANI: And what we found, that if you develop delirium in the hospital and we follow you up to five years, the odds of developing dementia or Alzheimer's disease is five times more. SHAPIRO: Boustani says researchers are split on the reason. It may be that getting delirium in the hospital can cause a long-term dementia, or it might be that an episode of delirium shows dementia that already exists or is developing. Boustani says that's one more reason why it's important for researchers, doctors and patients to better understand delirium that occurs in the hospital and how to avoid it. Joseph Shapiro, NPR News.

Dr. ROBERT LAMONT(ph) (Itch specialist, Yale): And they send electrical signals into the spinal cord. HAMILTON: Where, says Yale itch specialist Robert Lamont, the signals reach other nerve cells. Dr. LAMONT: And those presumably send signals to the brain. HAMILTON: Lamont doesn't have a lot more to say about the process. Dr. LAMONT: Because, you know, there hasn't been much itch research. HAMILTON: Which is why itch researchers are pretty excited about the results of a mouse experiment at Washington University in St. Louis. First, normal mice were given substances known to cause itching in people. You can't ask a mouse whether something itches, so researcher Zhou-Feng Chen said the team watched closely. Professor ZHOU-FENG CHEN (Anesthesiology, Washington University):  All animal scratch when they itch. So all you needed to do is to count how many times the animals scratched. HAMILTON: And all the normal mice scratched like crazy. Then the team tried the experiment on mice that had been treated to eliminate a certain type of nerve cell in their spinal cords. Prof. CHEN: Very surprisingly, we found that those mice, they didn't scratch much no matter what kind of itchy stimuli they were given. HAMILTON: They still felt pain. They moved around fine and they appeared completely normal. They just didn't seem to itch. The result suggests that Chen's team has identified specific cells in the spinal cord that are part of an itch pathway between the skin and brain. That's a big step forward for itch research.

These patients, the only way that can relieve them of their itch is by scratching and causing it to bleed. HAMILTON: The new research is preliminary. Also, it's hard to know whether what works in mice will work in people. But Yosipovitch says knowing which cells communicate itchiness should give researchers a starting point to develop a drug for patients with chronic itch. Dr. YOSIPOVITCH: If there is a receptor that we can target and inhibit itch without causing any pain or any adverse effects, that would be very helpful for those patients. HAMILTON: And the research adds to evidence that itching has some real survival value. If it didn't, evolution would have been unlikely to designate specific cells to convey the itch sensation. Yosipovitch says it's remarkable how many different species seem to itch and scratch. Dr. YOSIPOVITCH: Even observations that fish scratch themselves in the aquarium. HAMILTON: And Yosipovitch says it's easy to imagine how itching might help animals protect themselves.

I'm Linda Wertheimer. STEVE INSKEEP, host: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Good morning. Today in Your Health, helping older folks deal with delirium. But first, we have an advisory of sorts for people in their 40s. Two recent studies suggest that high cholesterol and belly fat in middle age may increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. NPR's Allison Aubrey explains how researchers are trying to nail down these links between lifestyle, weight and disease. ALLISON AUBREY: The standard advice to older folks for preventing Alzheimer's disease goes something like this: Keep your brain active, exercise and maintain social relationships. So if you do all these and toss in a daily crossword or Sudoku, surely you'll keep dementia at bay, right? Well, not exactly. Dr. REISA SPERLING (Director of Alzheimer's Research, Brigham and Women's Hospital): There'll be some individuals who do everything right, who exercise, who are very bright, who are very active and still get Alzheimer's disease. AUBREY: Reisa Sperling directs Alzheimer's research and treatment at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She says there is some evidence that a healthy lifestyle is protective. But she explains genes seem to play a very significant role, too. Those who have a parent with Alzheimer's or inherit a certain gene called ApoE4 are more susceptible to the disease. And once people begin to experience the first symptoms, it's difficult to slow the progression, even with medicines. This is why Sperling and lots of other researchers are interested in studying people in their 40s, just hitting middle age. Dr. SPERLING: I believe that factors that affect changes in the brain decades before people actually get Alzheimer's disease are the ones we need to be looking at. AUBREY: One factor that may affect changes in the brain is cholesterol. A new study of about 10,000 men and women found that people who had elevated levels of cholesterol when they were in their early 40s were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's and vascular dementia in their 70s and 80s. Researcher Rachel Whitmer of Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, California, led the study. She says it's well documented that high cholesterol raises the risk of cardiovascular disease. But this study, she says, adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting high cholesterol's also a risk factor for brain disease. Dr. RACHEL WHITMER (Kaiser Permanente): One of the bottom lines here is what's good for the heart is also good for the mind, so one should be even thinking about these risk factors in midlife. AUBREY: All the Alzheimer's experts I interviewed agreed with this notion. There's a clear overlap between brain and heart disease risks. But what hasn't been worked out yet is exactly how to control or reduce the risks of dementia. In theory, if you take the findings of this recent study linking high cholesterol to Alzheimer's, you might think that simply lowering cholesterol would reduce the risk of dementia. But it may not be that easy. Sam Gandy heads Alzheimer's research at the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York. He says there've been several experiments with people taking statin medications. These are the drugs most widely used to lower cholesterol. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: Dr. Gandy is associate director of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. ] Dr. SAM GANDY (Associate Director, Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Mount Sinai School of Medicine): Unfortunately, so far they've been disappointing. Despite the fact that in these trials cholesterol has been controlled, we haven't seen the expected impact on later dementia that we would have hoped. AUBREY: It's possible that people didn't start taking statins early enough in life. Or it's possible that there's some other process in the body that leads to dementia, even when cholesterol and other risk factors are controlled. Researchers are looking at genetics. It could be that genes contribute to a buildup of a protein in the brain called amyloid beta. Brain imaging studies suggest that people with Alzheimer's tend to have abnormal accumulations of amyloid in their brains. Reisa Sperling says figuring out a way to prevent the buildup would be significant. Dr. SPERLING: I envision a time where we will treat Alzheimer's disease just the way we treat cholesterol, or we will find agents that lower amyloid and we will give them to people in a preventative fashion. AUBREY: There are some anti-amyloid therapies already being tested, but this could be a long way off. If the strategy pans out, Sterling says it may be the best hope for prevention.

I'm Madeleine Brand. MELISSA BLOCK, host: And I'm Melissa Block. The world could lose all of its coral reefs within our children's lifetimes. As the Earth heats up, warming ocean waters could be deadly. The fate of coral reefs will depend in part on how healthy they are to begin with. For the second story in our series Oceans at Risk, NPR's Richard Harris travels to an island where scientists are trying to help coral reefs become more resilient. RICHARD HARRIS: Coral reefs are the rainforests of the oceans, teeming with diverse and postcard-perfect fish, towering sponges, and multicolored coral. The magnificent ecosystem along the shores of the Caribbean island of Bonaire is also a vital human resource: think scuba tanks. (Soundbite of hammering metal) HARRIS: I think it's fair to say that's the sound of the economy of Bonaire, wouldn't you think? Dr. RAMON DE LEON (Manager, Bonaire Marine Park): Exactly. Definitely. You will hear this noise all day long, all around Bonaire. HARRIS: Ramon de Leon is in charge of Bonaire's National Marine Park. It's one of the healthiest coral reefs in Caribbean, and it's his job to keep it that way. Dr. DE LEON: Bonaire is known as a diver's paradise. Anywhere between 50 and 70 percent of the economy is running tourism, and 90 percent of the tourism is diving tourism. HARRIS: On this balmy evening, de Leon has come to this combination bar and dive shop to meet up with a team of scientists. They plan to spend the next 10 days in the water to see how the reef is doing. Dr. GABRIEL GRIMSDITCH (Scientist, International Union for Conservation of Nature): Hi. Are you Henry(ph)? HENRY: Yeah. Dr. GRIMSDITCH: Hi, Gabriel. Nice to meet you. HENRY: Nice to meet you, Mr. Gabriel. HARRIS: Gabriel Grimsditch, from the conservation group IUCN, has organized the research. Their mission is to identify the factors that can keep this reef healthy and resilient. These scientists can't stop global warming from overheating the surrounding ocean waters, but they can identify other problems that make the coral more vulnerable to heat damage. Dr. GRIMSDITCH: Okay, so where should we start? Maybe we can go through the methods. HARRIS: Grimsditch explains that this is part of a project that's taking place around the globe. It was stimulated by a massive ocean warming episode 11 years ago. Overheated waters worldwide forced the colorful microorganisms that live inside the coral to abandon their homes. The coral turned white, it bleached. And a staggering 16 percent of all the world's coral died off during that episode. Dr. GRIMSDITCH: And it basically got people thinking that climate change was actually one of the most important threats to corals at the moment. So people started looking at why coral reefs recover from bleaching or why they don't. HARRIS: That's one reason they've come to Bonaire. The reef here was hit hard during the 1998 bleaching episode. Marine biologist Mark Vermeij, from the nearby island of Curacao, remembers it vividly. Dr. MARK VERMEIJ (Marine Biologist): The reef slope actually looked like a mountain slope full of snow. People here were taking their skis out and took pictures for home, like they were skiing the coral reefs. HARRIS: But much to everybody's relief, the coral here didn't die off. The live-in microorganisms eventually returned to the mineral coral skeletons. The reef regained its color and came back to life. But Bonaire's reefs may not stay healthy enough to bounce back next time. Some parts of the reef are under pressure from the very people who come to admire them. Unidentified Man: (Foreign language spoken) HARRIS: The next day, the biologists take their first dive. It's right off one of the many resorts on Bonaire. Ramon de Leon squeezes into his wetsuit and straps on a 35-pound tank. Dr. DE LEON: How do I look? (Soundbite of laughter) HARRIS: You look glorious. Dr. DE LEON: No, that's the (unintelligible). HARRIS: Clipboard in one hand, measuring square in the other, de Leon trudges across a small beach of imported sand and leads his colleagues into the water. (Soundbite of splashes) HARRIS: This resort looks idyllic: the sand, palm trees, a tiki hut bar. But as Mark Vermeij emerges from the dive an hour later, he says the reef offshore looks bad. Dr. VERMEIJ: This is not something you get happy about, that's for sure. HARRIS: Sure, he saw a lot of corals out there. Dr. VERMEIJ: But instead of pointing up, they're pointing sideways right now. HARRIS: It turns out this reef was whacked by a tropical storm last October. That in itself shouldn't be such a big deal. Reefs have been clobbered by storms for millions of years and recovered. But Vermeij says the added stress of living alongside human beings made it hard for this reef to bounce back. For one thing, nutrient runoff from the resort's lush gardens have encouraged green algae to smother the coral in places. Dr. VERMEIJ: And you can sort of see what happens, right? You hit them once and then everything else follows. That algal overgrowth, diseases, sure, but death by a thousand cuts. That's what this is, right here. HARRIS: Study coordinator Gabriel Grimsditch says pinpointing the problems and then eliminating the causes could actually help corals to recover from bleaching and natural disturbances. Dr. GRIMSDITCH: We're trying to give Ramon some data that he can point to just to tell people the reef is being affected in this way. And there are certain actions that you can take to improve the resilience of the reef. HARRIS: Ramon de Leon can't keep the water cool. But as park manager, he does have some sway over the threats that make the coral more vulnerable to overheating. We clamber into one of the park's well worn pick-up trucks and drive along the narrow island roads. This is actually a desert island, as in arid, dry. But people want it to look like the classic Caribbean paradise, so they plant coconut palms and other vegetation. Then they water. And the water rushes through the porous soils, sweeping nutrients with it. Dr. DE LEON: These nutrients will end up, sooner or later, in the reef. HARRIS: Nobody wants to hurt the reef, de Leon says. On the other hand, nobody really wants to hear from the park manager that they need to change their ways. Dr. DE LEON: Sometimes you have to point fingers and say: This is the problem. You are the cause. You have to solve it. Nobody likes that so we have to do it very careful. But all in all, I think people appreciate what we do for the coral reef here. HARRIS: Since de Leon came to Bonaire 11 years ago from Uruguay, he's been telling people that if they care about the reef, they need to think differently about everything from coastal development and irrigation to fishing. And when he wants to show off just how healthy a reef can be, he takes people to one of the island's more remote and unpopulated dive spots. In fact, the science team heads to one of those pristine sites the next day, an island mockingbird calls down from a cactus as the divers gear up, and Grimsditch makes a few last-minute adjustments to the science plan. Dr. GRIMSDITCH: I think it's (unintelligible). That's pretty good. But I noticed that it looks like the corals are taking a lot more time. HARRIS: Once again, the divers disappear beneath the waves. But this time, when Mark Vermeij comes back, he looks happier. So how healthy is this reef compared to the one you were diving at yesterday? Dr. VERMEIJ: This? Waters of magnitude is better. HARRIS: Vermeij says the reef here felt the impact of the same storm that caused so much damage down the coast last fall. Dr. VERMEIJ: I mean, yeah, this place got hammered like hell, but it's grown back as hell, too. HARRIS: Everything that should be working to help the reef recover is working here, he says. Dr. VERMEIJ: Like corals that were fragmented, so the ones that were lying on the ground for awhile, they're growing back. Lots of parrotfish, everybody happy. But, yeah, it doesn't result in a postcard reef sort of thing. Resilience: the ability to come back after you got kicked very hard. This is the place where it\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. VERMEIJ: \u2026where it actually works like that. HARRIS: The lesson here is clear. A reef that's healthy to begin with can rebound. So Vermeij says to help these rich and abundant ecosystems survive global warming, we need to reduce the stresses that are on them now. Richard Harris, NPR News. BLOCK: At the new npr. org, you can watch a slideshow of some of the amazing organisms that live underwater off the island of Bonaire. BRAND: And tomorrow, we head to Monterey Bay, California, as we wrap up our series Oceans at Risk. The burning of fossil fuels doesn't just pollute the air we breathe. It also hurts the ocean and everything in it.  MADELEINE BRAND, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Madeleine Brand.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  And I'm Melissa Block.  The world could lose all of its coral reefs within our children's lifetimes. As the Earth heats up, warming ocean waters could be deadly. The fate of coral reefs will depend in part on how healthy they are to begin with. For the second story in our series Oceans at Risk, NPR's Richard Harris travels to an island where scientists are trying to help coral reefs become more resilient.  RICHARD HARRIS: Coral reefs are the rainforests of the oceans, teeming with diverse and postcard-perfect fish, towering sponges, and multicolored coral. The magnificent ecosystem along the shores of the Caribbean island of Bonaire is also a vital human resource: think scuba tanks.  (Soundbite of hammering metal)  HARRIS: I think it's fair to say that's the sound of the economy of Bonaire, wouldn't you think?  Dr. RAMON DE LEON (Manager, Bonaire Marine Park): Exactly. Definitely. You will hear this noise all day long, all around Bonaire.  HARRIS: Ramon de Leon is in charge of Bonaire's National Marine Park. It's one of the healthiest coral reefs in Caribbean, and it's his job to keep it that way.  Dr. DE LEON: Bonaire is known as a diver's paradise. Anywhere between 50 and 70 percent of the economy is running tourism, and 90 percent of the tourism is diving tourism.  HARRIS: On this balmy evening, de Leon has come to this combination bar and dive shop to meet up with a team of scientists. They plan to spend the next 10 days in the water to see how the reef is doing.  Dr. GABRIEL GRIMSDITCH (Scientist, International Union for Conservation of Nature): Hi. Are you Henry(ph)?  HENRY: Yeah.  Dr. GRIMSDITCH: Hi, Gabriel. Nice to meet you.  HENRY: Nice to meet you, Mr. Gabriel.  HARRIS: Gabriel Grimsditch, from the conservation group IUCN, has organized the research. Their mission is to identify the factors that can keep this reef healthy and resilient. These scientists can't stop global warming from overheating the surrounding ocean waters, but they can identify other problems that make the coral more vulnerable to heat damage.  Dr. GRIMSDITCH: Okay, so where should we start? Maybe we can go through the methods.  HARRIS: Grimsditch explains that this is part of a project that's taking place around the globe. It was stimulated by a massive ocean warming episode 11 years ago. Overheated waters worldwide forced the colorful microorganisms that live inside the coral to abandon their homes. The coral turned white, it bleached. And a staggering 16 percent of all the world's coral died off during that episode.  Dr. GRIMSDITCH: And it basically got people thinking that climate change was actually one of the most important threats to corals at the moment. So people started looking at why coral reefs recover from bleaching or why they don't.  HARRIS: That's one reason they've come to Bonaire. The reef here was hit hard during the 1998 bleaching episode.  Marine biologist Mark Vermeij, from the nearby island of Curacao, remembers it vividly.

Some of the risks are obvious, like global warming, which results in overheated seas. Others are more subtle, as NPR's Richard Harris discovered when he visited a coral reef surrounding the Caribbean island of Bonaire. RICHARD HARRIS: Both corals and the algae have natural allies. Corals get help from parrot fish, which eat the intruding algae from the reef. And the algae get help from certain species of damselfish. HARRIS: Damselfish are these little fish, and what they do, they make little yards on the bottom of the reef. HARRIS: Yards or gardens or pastures, marine biologist Mark Vermeij says call them what you want. These small fish are actually farming algae right on the coral. HARRIS: And in order to make place for one of these yards, they basically kill the coral. So they go to the coral, they start sucking on little polyps until they die. And then when that happens, little algae establish in that died-off patch. HARRIS: Once the algae starts growing, the damselfish becomes not just a farmer, but a warrior. HARRIS: They're little feisty guys. I mean, there are rainbow parrot fish that are almost a meter long, and then this damselfish that's not much bigger than a goldfish just comes out. And this parrot fish is sort of aiming at feeding in the guy's little meadow. The little damselfish comes out and just scares that thing away. They're aggressive as hell. HARRIS: Now, this drama has been going on since time immemorial. But now, welcome onto the scene hooks, lines and sinkers. People don't eat these little damselfish, but Vermeij says people do eat bigger fish on the reef. And that's where the story takes a twist. HARRIS: Twenty years ago, life on these reefs for little fish was basically annoying, because there was all these big fish around that would eat you if you weren't paying attention. And then because a lot of people took the big fish out, it's a much safer environment for these little fish. HARRIS: As a result, the damselfish population has boomed. As Mark Vermeij tells the story, Henry DeBey listens in. He's a graduate student at Yale University. He's here on Bonaire to get a better handle on the damselfish story. And he says it turns out that one predatory fish in particular goes after the damselfish. It's called a graysby. M: Graysbys, which are a type of grouper, are a local favorite, a local specialty. So Bonarians like to fish graysbys. HARRIS: As a result, graysby populations have been in severe decline along Bonaire's reef. DeBey and a fellow graduate student from Yale are here to quantify just how much graysby overfishing has led to a surge in damselfish and their algae gardens. They want to provide ironclad evidence that the marine park manager can use to give local fishermen a Hobson's choice. M: Feel free to fish graysbys, but corals will decline as a result, indirectly. And everything else that depends on those corals, including the graysbys, ultimately, will also go down. HARRIS: Richard Harris, NPR News.

The 2005 season was the busiest in recorded history. As NPR's Jon Hamilton reports, there is now evidence suggesting you'd have to go back 1,000 years to find another period with so much hurricane activity. JON HAMILTON: It's not easy to study hurricanes that occurred before reliable weather records came along, but there is a way. Thanks to an emerging field that some call paleotempestology. Dr. MICHAEL MANN (Director, Earth Systems Science Center, Pennsylvania State University): Paleotempestology. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. MANN: Okay? It's one of my favorite words actually. HAMILTON: Michael Mann, of Pennsylvania State University, says the discipline relies on scientists who hunt for physical evidence of ancient storms. Mann says these researchers often look for a lagoon that is separated from the open ocean - except during a hurricane. Dr. MANN: Typically they send a coring device into the bed of the lagoon. And, again, what one looks for are layers of sediment in that core that tell you that there was an event that was strong enough to take the stuff from the open ocean and bring it all the way across the barrier into that lagoon environment. HAMILTON: Studying these layers is a bit like using tree rings to see what the weather was like hundreds of years ago. Paleotempestologists also search for evidence of conditions that would have favored hurricanes. These include warm ocean temperatures in parts of the Atlantic and the presence of La Nina: the climate phenomenon that makes it easy for storms to grow. Coral growth patterns reveal when the water was warm. Ice cores help identify La Nina years. When Mann and his team reviewed that sort of evidence, they found that the conditions were ideal for hurricanes in the Middle Ages. Dr. MANN: There appears to have been sort of a perfect storm, no pun intended, of conditions about a thousand years ago that relate to these various influence I just talked about. HAMILTON: Even perfect conditions don't necessarily produce storms though. So Mann's team looked at medieval sediments taken from lagoons between Massachusetts and Puerto Rico. And the sediments confirmed that a number of big storms actually had struck the coast during that period. Dr. MANN: We probably would've had seasons like that amazing 2005 season where we had 28 named storms and we had some very powerful storms, of course, like Katrina. HAMILTON: But Mann says the current period of intense hurricane activity differs from the medieval one in an important way. He says today's activity is associated primarily with warmer ocean temperatures, rather than the influence of La Nina. Dr. MANN: And we do believe that a substantial part of the reason for that anomalous recent warmth is, in fact, the human influence on climate: increased greenhouse gas concentrations due to fossil fuel burning. HAMILTON: There is still debate about the effect of warmer water on hurricanes. Skeptics say it could've been a coincidence that the medieval storms came during a period of warm water and La Nina conditions. But James Elsner, of Florida State University, says the new research on ancient hurricanes is providing a kind of information that modern satellites and aircraft surveillance just can't. Dr. JAMES ELSNER (Florida State University): It does provide us some additional clues about how things might change in the long term. HAMILTON: And at the moment, he says, those clues support the idea that global warming is one reason we're seeing so many hurricanes. The new research appears in the journal, Nature.

I'm Melissa Block. MADELEINE BRAND, host: And I'm Madeleine Brand. When we burn fossil fuels, we're not just putting carbon dioxide into the air; a lot of it goes into the sea. And there, carbon dioxide turns into carbonic acid. BLOCK: As a result, the oceans are becoming more corrosive. Biologists say that's bad for corals, oysters, and other shell-building animals. And scientists are just starting to realize that ocean acidification could affect many other forms of sea life, as well. To wrap up our series, Oceans at Risk, NPR's Richard Harris has this report from California's Monterey Bay. (Soundbite of sea lions) RICHARD HARRIS: It's comical to watch 600 pounds sea lions in the harbor at Moss Landing, California. They jostle, spar, and try to cram themselves onto to docks that can barely hold their weight. Mr. ERIC PANE (Marine Biologist, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute): It must be pup season because there's numerous youngsters out there, you can see. HARRIS: Eric Pane looks on approvingly at what seems to be part of a Pacific success story. Up and down the coast, biologists see healthy populations of marine mammals, fish and other wildlife. But as we head into his laboratory at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Pane's outlook about the future of life in the sea takes a dark turn. His budding career as a marine biologist is framed by an ominous trend: civilization is venting carbon dioxide from our tailpipes, smokestacks and chimneys at a prodigious rate. Mr. PANE: And that CO2, at least a third of it so far has actually ended up in our oceans, so which is sort of good and bad news in that it's prevented more CO2 from accumulating in the atmosphere. But unfortunately, it comes at a price, and that CO2 going into the ocean leads to it being acidified. HARRIS: Acidity is measured on the pH scale. Already, the oceans are a tenth of a unit more acidic. And by the end of this century, pH will change by half a unit. But don't be fooled by these modest-sounding numbers. Mr. PANE: So we say, oh, only half a unit. What's the big deal about that, you know? That's a tripling of acidity. I mean, that's a threefold increase. HARRIS: Over the past half-dozen years, marine biologists studying ocean acidification have focused mostly on the animals they assume will be the most vulnerable, such as coral reefs and shellfish. If acid levels in the ocean get too high, their shells can literally dissolve. Eric Pane is part of a second wave of research on ocean acidification - that is, biologists trying to understand the consequences for all the life in the sea. Mr. PANE: Right now, we're scrambling and we're trying to get our feet beneath us, and we're trying to basically address the simplest issue to figure what is organism response, also deal with simple ecosystem responses. HARRIS: So do you have critters growing in your lab? Can you\u2026 Mr. PANE: We do. We do. We're trying to, at this point, basically get as many animals as we can across a spectrum of invertebrates, vertebrates. All we can get to, basically, get them in the laboratory and expose them to these different scenarios of CO2. HARRIS: His lab is focusing on animals that live in relatively deep water. That makes sense because they live surprisingly nearby. There's an enormous underwater canyon just offshore, slicing through Monterey Bay. Mr. PANE: We've got gastropods, marine snails. We've had brachiopods. We've worked with decapod crabs, basic crustacea, hoping to get some smaller fish in down in our seawater lab facility. HARRIS: Eric Pane leads us over to a lab bench. Three-inch-long marine snails sit in a glass dish. Mr. PANE: So these are neptunium that we drilled a hole through the top of the shell, basically, so we can repetitively stick a needle through that hole and draw a sample of blood out. HARRIS: And where did this critter come from? Mr. PANE: These guys came from 700 meters right in the bottom of the canyon, right offshore in the Monterey Canyon. HARRIS: Each animal they want to study presents different challenges, whether it's getting a blood sample from a snail or figuring out how to keep deep sea fish alive in the lab. It's also not always so obvious what effects to look for. A change in acid can actually impose a subtle energy tax on marine animals. They already use some energy pumping acid out of their cells to maintain a healthy pH. As the oceans get more acidic, Pane says they'll expend more energy to maintain that balance. Mr. PANE: You're going to have less energy available for the important things: growing, reproducing. We're going to be looking at fecundity, amount of offspring produced, health of offspring produced, and then try to extrapolate into a long-term approach what that's going to do to these ecosystems that we know. HARRIS: It's too early to say just yet what this portends for life at sea, up to and including the fat and happy sea lions down on the dock. Mr. PANE: I think the least we can say is there's going to be profound changes in ocean ecosystems. From there, where we go and the judgments we make about that, you know, perhaps is an issue for further on. But\u2026 HARRIS: People think marine biology sounds really exciting. Your career almost sounds depressing. Mr. PANE: In a way, in way. I mean, within a few years, there's going to be change, basically, and I'm not sure how it's going to work out. Now you're depressing me. HARRIS: There are just a few people in the world who have actually been thinking about ocean acidification for decades. And one of those is down the hall from Eric Pane. Peter Brewer realized that something was amiss with the ocean's chemistry back in the 1960s, and he's seen the problem grow much, much worse. Dr. PETER BREWER (Senior Scientist, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute): The quantity of carbon dioxide we've put in the ocean is now well over 500 billion tons. And you can't just transfer that much mass without making changes in the physical properties, as well as the biological properties. HARRIS: Brewer says the carbon dioxide has already altered ocean chemistry in such a way that it affects the way sound travels through the ocean. That effect will grow, as more and more carbon dioxide ends up in the sea. Dr. BREWER: Sound will travel farther and noise levels will rise. That's a strange result of ocean acidification. HARRIS: What consequences does that have? Dr. BREWER: Nobody is that sure. It will be about, say, a 40 percent change by the middle of the century from the pre-Industrial signal. One assumes that whales, which communicate at these frequencies, will sense this effect. Whether they will adapt their communication patterns, one does not know. HARRIS: Scientists may simply have to wait and watch to see how that unintentional experiment evolves. But Brewer doesn't have to wait to see what rising acid levels will do to ecosystems at the bottom of the sea. Unidentified Man #1: Hi, Peter. Dr. BREWER: This is an apparatus we're going to put on the sea floor. HARRIS: The scientific instrument that's under construction has a green metal frame, bigger than a car with Plexiglas wings that can unfurl under water. One of the technicians is sitting right in the middle of the machine, where a test chamber will be. Dr. BREWER: We're trying to get the cameras in? Unidentified Man #1: Yeah. Unidentified Man #2: The cameras and the strobe for imaging the sea floor area. Dr. BREWER: And then we fly down and we can put some animals in there, add some carbon dioxide. It will flow through the chamber. We can create a change, and we can observe behavior, make measurements. HARRIS: Studying animals on the sea floor would, after all, be a more realistic experiment than a lab study, presuming they can get the instrument to do a good job of simulating future ocean conditions. It'll probably take another year to sort out the technical challenges of getting this instrument to work well. And while those problems seem solvable, Brewer ponders the enormous societal problems that created ocean acidity in the first place. Dr. BREWER: We're all in a bind here. You know, there - it's going to be very hard to maintain this number of people on the planet and not have these problems. It worries me that scientists sound the alarm but don't come up with solutions. Yeah, we're going to have to try. HARRIS: Technology has revolutionized ocean science during Brewer's career. He can only hope that it will also revolutionize the way we produce energy before the oceans suffer irreparable harm. Richard Harris, NPR News. BLOCK: And you can hear Richard's other stories from our series, Oceans at Risk, at our newly redesigned Web site, npr. org.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block.  MADELEINE BRAND, host:  And I'm Madeleine Brand.  When we burn fossil fuels, we're not just putting carbon dioxide into the air; a lot of it goes into the sea. And there, carbon dioxide turns into carbonic acid.  BLOCK: As a result, the oceans are becoming more corrosive. Biologists say that's bad for corals, oysters, and other shell-building animals. And scientists are just starting to realize that ocean acidification could affect many other forms of sea life, as well.  To wrap up our series, Oceans at Risk, NPR's Richard Harris has this report from California's Monterey Bay.  (Soundbite of sea lions)  RICHARD HARRIS: It's comical to watch 600 pounds sea lions in the harbor at Moss Landing, California. They jostle, spar, and try to cram themselves onto to docks that can barely hold their weight.  Mr. ERIC PANE (Marine Biologist, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute): It must be pup season because there's numerous youngsters out there, you can see.  HARRIS: Eric Pane looks on approvingly at what seems to be part of a Pacific success story. Up and down the coast, biologists see healthy populations of marine mammals, fish and other wildlife. But as we head into his laboratory at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Pane's outlook about the future of life in the sea takes a dark turn.  His budding career as a marine biologist is framed by an ominous trend: civilization is venting carbon dioxide from our tailpipes, smokestacks and chimneys at a prodigious rate.  Mr. PANE: And that CO2, at least a third of it so far has actually ended up in our oceans, so which is sort of good and bad news in that it's prevented more CO2 from accumulating in the atmosphere. But unfortunately, it comes at a price, and that CO2 going into the ocean leads to it being acidified.  HARRIS: Acidity is measured on the pH scale.

But students in the U. S. aren't exactly flocking to programs that would prepare them to tackle these challenges. So NASA is taking to the skies in hopes of luring students into studying the planet. NPR's Jon Hamilton went along for a ride. JON HAMILTON: A great place to study the Earth is from the air. Ms. KAMIL ARMAIZ-NOLLA (Student Scientist): Five, four, three, two, one, open. HAMILTON: These researchers are working in an airborne laboratory, a modified DC-8 flying low over the inland valleys of Central California. Mr. DANIEL TKACIK (Graduate Student): Ready, close. HAMILTON: Every minute or so, one of them opens a valve that sends a sample of air from outside the plane into a stainless steel canister the size of an overgrown cocktail shaker. Unidentified Man: Good. Now you can open it up a little bit more to let the flow\u2026 Ms. ARMAIZ-NOLLA: Oh, okay. I don't want it to drop there. Mr. TKACIK: Yeah, yeah, yeah. HAMILTON: The experiment will measure gases from dairy farms 1,000 feet below us. Cows belch up a lot of methane and the process used to prepare their feed can raise levels of ozone, another greenhouse gas. Usually flights like this are reserved for top researchers, but these two scientists are students. Kamil Armaiz-Nolla is 29 and dressed in the flight's unofficial uniform: jeans and a t-shirt. She's been in pretty much constant motion sense the seatbelt sign went off. When Kamil's not checking the weather on a laptop, she's running the air sampler. (Soundbite of air sampler) HAMILTON: It helps that she's thin enough to squeeze into the small gap between the equipment and a row of seats. Kamil has a background in chemistry and she's about to finish a masters in environmental management at the Metropolitan University in Puerto Rico. Ms. ARMAIZ-NOLLA: Right now I am applying to - for a Ph. D in oceanography, and actually chemical oceanography. So I can, you know, apply what I study, but I also can experience new things, especially the ocean, which is my passion. HAMILTON: Daniel Tkacik grew up in Georgia and has a buzz cut that falls somewhere between edgy and aerospace engineer. He's 23, but Daniel's resume already includes stuff like studying carbon in the salt marshes of Skidaway Island. This fall, Daniel will start a Ph. D. in civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. But he says he's been intrigued by the Earth's atmosphere since he was a kid. Mr. TKACIK: You know, my family would be down in the basement during a tornado warning and I would be running around upstairs trying to, you know, look out the window, try to see what I can see, and you know, parents yelling at me. HAMILTON: Daniel and Kamil are exactly the kind of people NASA hopes to attract to studying our planet. They are highly motivated. They are fascinated by the Earth and troubled by its environmental problems. Also, since high school, they've been taking all the right courses. Mr. TKACIK: Calculus, Calculus II, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, multivariable calculus, electromagnetics, Physics I\u2026 Ms. ARMAIZ-NOLLA: Analytical Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry II, Physical Chemistry, Organic. HAMILTON: High academic achievement helped them to get on today's flight. The flight is part of NASA's Student Airborne Research Program, an experimental six-week session designed to get young people excited about Earth science. The 29 students in this session have already heard lectures from people including Sherwood Rowland. He won the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for figuring out that CFCs were damaging the Earth's ozone layer. For the past few days, the students have been at NASA's Dryden Aircraft Operations Facility in Palmdale, California. Dr. George Seielstad from the University of North Dakota worked with NASA to set up the program, including the in-flight experiments. Dr. GEORGE SEIELSTAD (University of North Dakota): We're doing real science. This isn't a little practice lab session where you get to see how things would be done someday if you became a scientist. You're going to be a scientist, and we're going to come out with some real results, and the results all impact society. HAMILTON: In addition to gases from dairy farms, the students are looking at water consumption by cotton and almond plants. That's a big deal in central California, where those crops have been hurt by years of drought. And the students are using an image sensor to study unusual algae growth in Monterey Bay. So-called algal blooms can kill fish and make shellfish poisonous. The blooms are more common in water contaminated by sewage and agricultural fertilizers. Dr. SEIELSTAD: So in every case it's beautiful science. But this will help people if we come up with some solutions. HAMILTON: Seielstad says those solutions are likely to come from a new generation of Earth scientists. Dr. SEIELSTAD: My generation has done the best science it could and I think we've learned a lot about the Earth. But you're always looking for new ideas. HAMILTON: And new ideas, he says, often come from people who don't necessarily look like the older generation, or sound like them. Unidentified Woman: (Spanish spoken) HAMILTON: A couple of hours into the flight, the students have collected most of the critical air samples and the DC-8 is about to turn toward Monterey Bay for the algae experiment. There's been a lot of concern about a fog bank hovering over the bay. Fog makes it almost impossible to detect algae blooms. But at the moment, forecasters are predicting clear skies. The algae team, which includes Daniel and Kamil, is pretty pumped up. Then the pilot hears a couple of small clunks. Mr. TKACIK: Did you hear the excitement? HAMILTON: And the students get some bad news. Mr. TKACIK We hit a small bird in engine number two and there's a little hole, but it's no emergency or anything. We're going to do the cotton field run one more time and basically head back. So we will not be flying over Monterey Bay, which means we have no data from this flight HAMILTON: You can tell you're on a plane full of scientists when the biggest concern about a hole in the plane is whether it will screw up someone's experiment. Mr. TKACIK: It sucks. I was - because the clouds - here, let's take a look at this little image right here. The clouds have finally opened up. Everything looks awesome. We would have had so much data. But now we got nothing. That is exactly the real world of science. Not everything works all the time, and you know, you've just got to keep trying sometimes, I don't know. HAMILTON: By the time we're back on the ground, though, everyone is sounding a lot more optimistic. Unidentified Man: A big round of applause for the flight crew and the support crew. (Soundbite of applause) HAMILTON: Next, the students will go back to the University of California, Irvine, to analyze their data. Unidentified Woman: Tomorrow's morning checkout is at 11:00 a. m. sharp, so\u2026 HAMILTON: The air sampling team will quantify the methanol and ethanol and ethane coming from dairy farms. This will help show the farm's contribution to global warming and perhaps whether the cows there should go on a low-emissions diet. Another group will figure out which parts of the cotton fields and almond orchards need more irrigation and which could do with a bit less. And Daniel and Kamil will try to salvage their algae experiment using data from a flight two days earlier. Ms. ARMAIZ-NOLLA: This group of techs are going to help us process the data. And then next week it starts, the data analysis and all the hard work. HAMILTON: There are already hints that this hard work will pay off. A first look at the data suggests that an algae bloom is beginning to form in one corner of Monterey Bay. Jon Hamilton, NPR News.

Some of us cope better than others. There are those people who famously and maddeningly can get by on just a few hours of sleep. Well, now a study in the journal \"Science\" finds that how much you sleep may be written in your genes, as Geoff Brumfiel reports. GEOFF BRUMFIEL: Meet my friend Ann Marie Williams(ph). She's a graduate student and she doesn't sleep much. Ms. ANN MARIE WILLIAMS: I went to bed at midnight. BRUMFIEL: People like her really bug me. I need a solid eight hours just to function and that's pretty normal. Studies show that most people who get less can have difficulty with everyday tasks like driving. Ann Marie is in the more elite class. Thomas Edison, for example, claimed to sleep just four or five hours a night with no problem. It turns out that the reason for these differences may be genetic. Researchers have now found a mutation that appears to let some people get by on less sleep than others. Dr. YING-HUI FU (Neurologist, University of California at San Francisco): I wish I had the mutation but I don't. (Soundbite of laughter) BRUMFIEL: Ying-Hui Fu is a neurologist at the University of California at San Francisco. She and her colleagues were doing a large-scale sleep study when they came across a mother and daughter who had an unusual change to their genetic code. Both had the same mutation of a gene known to help regulate the body clocks of animals. Dr. FU: When these people have this mutation, their sleep amount is less. Normal people need eight to eight-and-a-half hours of sleep. These people sleep five-and-a-half to six. BRUMFIEL: Even though the pair weren't sleeping as much, they seem fine. Dr. FU: It's not like they have sleep problem. They just don't sleep as much. BRUMFIEL: Do they feel tired? Dr. FU: Not more than most regular people. BRUMFIEL: Fu's group wanted to study the effect of the mutation in a more controlled way. So they created a strain of mice with the same genetic change. Sure enough, they found that these mice slept less than the average mouse. What's more, they seemed to recover more quickly from periods of sleep deprivation. The work is an important step forward, says Charles Czeisler, a sleep expert at Harvard Medical School. Professor CHARLES CZEISLER (Sleep Medicine, Harvard Medical School): This study really shows that the amount of sleep that we need each night is genetically hardwired. This tiny genetic change is making a huge change in the behavior of both the people and the animals. BRUMFIEL: In some ways this study raises as many questions as it answers about sleep. Czeisler says that it doesn't prove that people with the mutation function as well as the rest of us. It's possible that they're just unable to get the sleep they need. He says it's hard to tell because we really don't understand the process of sleep at all. Prof. CZEISLER: No one really knows what the function of sleep is, although the leading hypothesis is that sleep's core function relates to the repair and reorganization of brain cells. BRUMFIEL: Still, studying this gene could help give clues about how and why we sleep. As for those of us who don't have the mutation, Ying-Hui Fu says that we shouldn't try and beat our genetic code. Dr. FU: When I was younger, I was one of those people that tried every method to not sleep as much, you know. And now that I study sleep, I really realize sleep is so important for our health. So I say forget this. I'm just going to sleep as much as I need. (Soundbite of laughter) BRUMFIEL: So if you're feeling sleepy right now, turn down your radio and take a nap.

I'm Linda Wertheimer. STEVE INSKEEP, host: And I'm Steve Inskeep. It's taken almost 200,000 years for humans to evolve from cave-dwelling stone throwers to net surfing twitterers. Is that evolution or devolution? Anyway, along the way, were a few eureka moments when somebody figured out how to make life a little easier. Scientists in South Africa believe they've discovered evidence of just such a moment, as NPR's Christopher Joyce reports. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: So, it's the southern tip of Africa, about 70,000 years ago, and some humans have built a fire. Maybe it's to keep warm, or to cook up some gazelle steaks. To kill time, they do a little flint knapping - whacking one rock with another to chip off razor-sharp flakes. They use the flakes to cut meat or make spear points. After the fire dies down, one of them drags a big stone out of the embers and tries whacking that, and discovers that it makes really good flakes: it chips predictably, and the flakes are symmetrical and sharp. Eureka \u2014 pyro engineering is born. Mr. KYLE BROWN (Graduate Student, University of Cape Town): It's a real critical step in the evolution of technology. Somewhere around 70,000 years ago, it became very common. JOYCE: Kyle Brown is a graduate student in archaeology at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, and he makes his own stone tools. The campfire scenario is based on Brown's own eureka moment. Here's how it happened: Brown had noticed that many ancient tools found in South Africa were made from silcrete, a kind of rock notoriously difficult to work with. It's known that heating rock can improve stone for making tools, but no one knew when or where the practice started. So Brown tried heating some silcrete himself, for 10 hours at a time. Mr. BROWN: I did a lot of the early experiments with a fire pit in my yard, just sitting up making sure that the fire stayed hot and had enough wood on it. JOYCE: What'd your neighbors think of you sitting out there all night long\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) JOYCE: \u2026cooking rocks? Mr. BROWN: They think I'm pretty crazy. JOYCE: Crazy or not, Brown discovered that the cooked rock was much easier to flake. Mr. BROWN: The stone becomes harder and stiffer. It basically becomes more brittle. JOYCE: The flakes were sharper, too, and they had a certain glossiness on the surface that the 70,000-year-old stone tools also had. Writing in the journal Science, Brown says the practice must have been intentional. The flakes weren't made first and then dropped into a fire. He tried that, and it didn't work. Further tests suggested that cooking the rock first - to about 600 degrees Fahrenheit - apparently alters its crystalline structure and gives it something knappers call rebound hardness so it fractures more predictably. Anthropologist Grant McCall from Tulane University, who studies and makes stone tools himself, says it seems to be part of the flowering of what scientists call behavioral modernity - things that modern humans did that set them apart from their ancestors. Professor GRANT MCCALL (Anthropology, Tulane University): The striking ones from elsewhere in southern Africa have to do with the manufacture of symbolic objects. So you have the manufacture of marine shell beads and engraved ochre fragments and things like that that indicate that people were operating in a very symbolic way. JOYCE: This explosion of modern behavior - including pyro engineering tools -seems to have occurred earlier in south Africa than in Europe or Asia. And it's possible pyro engineering began even further back. The scientific team has found the same kind of tools at other South African sites that appear to date back 165,000 years. That's long before so-called modern behavior emerged elsewhere, making the discovery even more striking. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.  LINDA WERTHEIMER, host:  This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News.

We don't always co-exist peacefully, though. Over the last two decades, airplane bird strikes have killed more than 200 people around the world and cost the U. S. aviation industry hundreds of millions of dollars. NPR's Robert Benincasa reports on the search for a way to keep man and bird on separate flight paths. ROBERT BENINCASA: The next time you get on an airplane, consider how far human flight has come. In 1930, it was still faster to travel across the country by train. Anyone fearless and wealthy enough to fly endured jarring flights in unpressurized cabins. Today's high-tech airplanes move us around the world so well, it's become routine. Still, there's one low-tech problem we haven't quite solved: birds. Mr. CHESLEY SULLENBERGER (Pilot): This is Cactus 1549, hit birds. We've lost thrust in both engines. We're turning back towards LaGuardia. BENINCASA: You probably recall what happened to that U. S. Airways Flight back in January. Unidentified Man #1: Yes, there was a bird strike. Can I get him in for Runway One? Unidentified Man #2: Runway One, that's good. Unidentified Man #1: Cactus 1529, turn right 280. You can land Runway One at Teterboro. Mr. SULLENBERGER: We can't do it. Unidentified Man #2: Okay, which runway would you like at Teterboro? Mr. SULLENBERGER: We're going to be in the Hudson. BENINCASA: We're going to be in the Hudson, the words of pilot Chesley Sullenberger. He was forced to bring his plane down in the river after both engines sucked in geese and lost power. The bird strike problem has worsened in recent years as bird populations have grown. Most strikes happen at low altitudes near airports. So until now, airport managers have tried to make the ground around airports inhospitable to birds. They've changed the vegetation the birds feed on or disturbed their rest with loud noises. But what if we could warn the birds away from an approaching aircraft in the sky? Brad Blackwell is a wildlife biologist for the Agriculture Department, and he's trying to break down the communication barrier between species. Mr. BRAD BLACKWELL (Wildlife Biologist, Agriculture Department): Vision is the primary sensory pathway in birds. And so if we can play upon that sensory pathway, understand it, and use the lights that are on the aircraft basically to buy time for the aircraft and buy time for the birds\u2026 All right, birds, here we go. BENINCASA: Enter the geese. We're at Plum Brook Station, a high-security government campus near Sandusky, Ohio. A member of Blackwell's team climbs into the back of a pickup truck and ushers four Canada geese into a neatly mowed, fenced-off circle 56 feet across. Cameras surround the birds, recording their every move. The geese, with their wings clipped, pad peacefully around the grass until Indiana State University biologist Steven Lima comes on the scene. Mr. STEVEN LIMA (Biologist, Indiana State University): Surprisingly, no one's actually looked at how planes approach birds and how they respond. It's never been done. BENINCASA: So Lima's doing it now with a model plane. It looks like a miniature Cessna about six feet long with bright, white, pulsating LED lights mounted on it. (Soundbite of model aircraft) BENINCASA: Lima works the two joysticks on a radio control box, sending the plan aloft. Mr. LIMA: Right at them. BENINCASA: He flies the plane over the heads of the birds a few times that brings it down in a rough landing. (Soundbite of model aircraft) Mr. LIMA: Not bad for (unintelligible) landing. BENINCASA: Getting a rise out of these geese is a challenge. They're city dwellers, rounded up in a Cleveland park. Like many of the birds near airports, they're well acclimated to human activity, and that's part of the problem. Mr. BLACKWELL: They're obviously not afraid of this aircraft. It's a nine-foot wing span that's coming right at them. They even challenge it in some cases. Then there is the ducking response, but they're definitely not taking initiative to get out of the way. BENINCASA: So what might warn the birds off? Qantas Airlines recently reported a reduction in bird strikes when it mounted pulsing lights on 737s. Blackwell's team wants to firm up the science behind those observations. Mr. BLACKWELL: In this experiment, we run a treatment with the aircraft approaching without lights and one with the lights. BENINCASA: You want to know if the lights make a difference. Mr. BLACKWELL: I want to know if the lights can make a difference, even if they give us a slight edge, and then can we tweak the system a little bit more? Can we start playing with wavelengths that these birds can see better? BENINCASA: Biologist Esteban Fernandez-Juricic looks at video from a previous day's flights in a nearby trailer. Mr. ESTEBAN FERNANDEZ-JURICIC (Biologist, Perdue University): The first reaction that you see is that the birds pull together, and they group together very quickly as the airplane goes by. And then the second reaction that we can see here is that some individuals duck down right there. BENINCASA: The geese are ducking. They seem to regard the plane as a predator. The challenge is to make that predator as threatening as possible. But first, Fernandez needs to understand what the birds actually see. Mr. FERNANDEZ-JURICIC: Humans have three visual pigments, birds have four visual pigments, and this visual pigment usually is in the UV range, in the ultraviolet range. So birds can perceive more colors than humans can. BENINCASA: So we might end up some day with lights on aircraft that are ultraviolet that we can't see that the birds can. Mr. FERNANDEZ-JURICIC: We might. BENINCASA: For now, though, the secret of a finely tuned aerial warning system remains with the birds.

Bolt slashed a full eleven-hundredths off his previous record time in the 100-meter finals at the World Track and Field Championships in Berlin. His new record: 9. 58 seconds. So, where could it stop? Is there a human speed limit? We're going to put that question to professor Peter Weyand, a physiologist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. He specializes in the biomechanics of running. Professor Weyand, welcome to the program. Professor PETER WEYAND (Physiologist, Southern Methodist University): Thank you. It's nice to be here. BLOCK: And what do you think? Can this record keep tumbling? Prof. WEYAND: Oh, absolutely. I expect that it will, and I think there's a lot more to come than what we've seen so far. BLOCK: Well, how far? I mean, Usain Bolt was asked about this right after the race. He said, well, maybe 9. 4 seconds. Maybe that would be the limit, but he said you never know. Prof. WEYAND: You never do. And I would say that he's being conservative. I think it could fall a lot more than that. You know, I would say in the next decade, it wouldn't surprise me if it goes below nine seconds. BLOCK: Nine seconds? Prof. WEYAND: Sure. It could go faster than that - and it probably will. BLOCK: Well, what determines this physiologically? I mean, when you study the biomechanics of running and you've looked at these 100-meter sprinters, what do you see that's contributing to these faster and faster times? Prof. WEYAND: Well, what they do is really remarkable because it comes down to how hard they can hit the ground in relation to how much they weigh, and how fast they can do it. So, for somebody of Usain Bolt's caliber, he will hit the ground with a peak force of about five times his body weight. So if he's just under 200 pounds, that's almost 1,000 pounds of force. And they do that in about a tenth of a second or less. So what they do is hit really hard, really fast. BLOCK: And you're figuring that the more he runs, the better he'll get? Prof. WEYAND: Yeah. I think the - when the ultimate - the question of the ultimate speed limit is posed, it really comes down to a limitation of how fast the muscles can turn on. And we know biologically, we're not anywhere close to that limit. BLOCK: If you leave out anything you might chemically add to your body to get it to do things it wouldn't ordinarily do, what else can the human body do to improve on these incredible speeds that we're seeing? Prof. WEYAND: Since the scientific understanding of speed is not terribly mature, we're seeing some training programs that have come along in the last five to 10 years that seem to be a lot more effective. And those training programs being implemented progressively more effectively by these elite athletes certainly has the potential to bring times down by another half a second or so. BLOCK: Now, Usain Bolt is 6'5\". He's taller than those other runners. Is that an advantage to him or not? I mean, it takes him longer to get out of the blocks, I guess, but he has this enormous stride. Prof. WEYAND: It should be a disadvantage being that tall, and he is unusually tall. What sprinters do is a trade-off between starting and finishing. And when they start, it's a disadvantage to be taller and bigger because it takes longer to get the body going. But once they get up to speed, it's an advantage. So if you look at athletes, how tall they are and how big they are by event specialty, the sprinters that run the short indoor dashes tend to be shorter bodies because most of that race is the accelerating or speeding up part, where it's an advantage to be short. But outdoors on the track, for example, if you go from 100 to 200 to 400 meters, the specialists get progressively taller as you go from 100 to 200, and then again from 200 to 400. So, what's remarkable about him, he should be disadvantaged at the start, but he's not. He gets out just as fast or faster than his competitors, which is at odds in terms of muscle physiology and body size as we understand it currently. BLOCK: What about the age factor for Usain Bolt here? He's 22. That's pretty young for a sprinter? Prof. WEYAND: It is pretty young. Although in recent years, we've seen sprinters continue to compete well into their early 30s. So he's got a lot of time left. BLOCK: He could do a lot. Prof. WEYAND: Oh, yeah. Absolutely. BLOCK: Professor Weyand, thanks very much. Prof. WEYAND: Okay. Thank you, Melissa. BLOCK: Professor Peter Weyand is a physiologist and biomechanist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  When Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt blasted through his own world record yesterday, he barely had time to savor that incredible feat before people were asking, how much lower can he go? Bolt slashed a full eleven-hundredths off his previous record time in the 100-meter finals at the World Track and Field Championships in Berlin. His new record: 9. 58 seconds.  So, where could it stop? Is there a human speed limit? We're going to put that question to professor Peter Weyand, a physiologist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. He specializes in the biomechanics of running.  Professor Weyand, welcome to the program.  Professor PETER WEYAND (Physiologist, Southern Methodist University): Thank you. It's nice to be here.  BLOCK: And what do you think? Can this record keep tumbling?  Prof. WEYAND: Oh, absolutely. I expect that it will, and I think there's a lot more to come than what we've seen so far.  BLOCK: Well, how far? I mean, Usain Bolt was asked about this right after the race. He said, well, maybe 9. 4 seconds. Maybe that would be the limit, but he said you never know.  Prof. WEYAND: You never do. And I would say that he's being conservative. I think it could fall a lot more than that. You know, I would say in the next decade, it wouldn't surprise me if it goes below nine seconds.  BLOCK: Nine seconds?  Prof. WEYAND: Sure. It could go faster than that - and it probably will.  BLOCK: Well, what determines this physiologically? I mean, when you study the biomechanics of running and you've looked at these 100-meter sprinters, what do you see that's contributing to these faster and faster times?  Prof. WEYAND: Well, what they do is really remarkable because it comes down to how hard they can hit the ground in relation to how much they weigh, and how fast they can do it. So, for somebody of Usain Bolt's caliber, he will hit the ground with a peak force of about five times his body weight. So if he's just under 200 pounds, that's almost 1,000 pounds of force.

If you're trying to imagine a ponderosa pine just think of old westerns or reruns of Bonanza. An hour south of the canyon you will find the largest unbroken swath of ponderosas. They stretch from the high desert of northern Arizona all the way to New Mexico. Arizona Public Radio Daniel Kraker found that these trees have a few secrets. DANIEL KRACKER: A great place to see the Ponderosas is in the Coconino National Forest just outside Flagstaff. As you look around the forest youll notice some trees have black bark, but others are yellow. Mr. STEVE HIRST (U. S. Forest Service): Early lumbermen coming through here thought they were actually two different species. KRAKER: Steve Hirst with the U. S. Forest Service is leading a summer hiking tour through these Ponderosas. Mr. HIRST: And they call these black jack pines and the yellow ones they called the yellow pine. KRAKER: But they're the same tree  the yellow ones are just older, says Hirst. At around 120 years, thats a mere teenager for a Ponderosa, they begin to shed their black bark and reveal a yellowish interior. That's why locals call them Yellowbellies. Mr. HIRST: A lot of people wonder why do they turn color like this. KRAKER: Well, foresters dont really know why. And theres something else odd that starts to happen, but you have to stick your nose into the crevice of the bark to find out. (Soundbite of sniffing) KRAKER: These hikers have now entered a long-standing controversy here in northern Arizona. What is that smell? Mr. HIRST: What so you think? Unidentified Man #1: I think butterscotch. Mr. HIRST: Butterscotch? Okay. Unidentified Woman #1: With a hint of vanilla. KRAKER: And there wasnt much consensus. Unidentified Woman #2: Cinnamon, for sure. KRAKER: Cinnamon? Unidentified Woman #3: Thats definitely cinnamon. Unidentified Man #2: I think it smells like coconut. KRAKER: I smelled butterscotch. Were told the scent, whatever it is, probably comes from a chemical in the sap being warmed by the sun. (Soundbite of bark flaking) KRAKER: And this flaky, thick bark weve just had our noses wedged in is also the secret to the trees defense against fire. Mr. HIRST: When the lightening hits the tree, it just flash-boils the sap, and it just blows the bark off. It doesnt even burn the tree. KRAKER: Thats good, because this area at 7,000 feet has one of the highest rates of lightning strikes in the country. Mr. HIRST: During the height of the monsoon season, the storm season here in the summer, theres lots of lightning strikes, lots of fire starts, burning away the competition and leaving the Ponderosas in charge. KRAKER: At least thats the way it should be. But for much of the past century, fires in this Ponderosa forest have been suppressed. As a result, its become choked with too much vegetation. And its this overgrowth, says Steve Hirst, thats made some recent fires rage out of control, endangering the pines. Mr. HIRST: When these crowns of these trees burn and you destroy an entire stand, they may never come back. KRAKER: Which is why the U. S. Forest Service, in collaboration with environmental groups and timber companies, is now thinning out trees and setting prescribed fires, so the Ponderosas can continue to reign over this stretch of the Southwest. Mr. HIRST: Here is probably the grandest place in all of the Ponderosa forest. Were standing among 100 foot high pines dominated completely by the San Francisco peaks, the 13,000 foot volcanic peak.

Scientists say white nose syndrome is spreading rapidly in North America. They now fear that the continent's most common bat species could be wiped out in the next few years. As North Country Public Radio's Brian Mann reports, biologists are still trying to understand basic questions about the epidemic. BRIAN MANN: Imagine for a moment if one of the most common birds in North America - robins, say, or blue jays - were to suddenly disappear, that's exactly what Brock Fenton at the University of Western Ontario says it's happening to bats. Dr. BROCK FENTON (Bat Researcher, University of Western Ontario): The brown bat will be extirpated in the Northeast within 10 years. That's, like, unbelievable, right? Because, I mean, those are the bats in everybody's church and cottage. MANN: Fenton is one of the top bat researchers in the world. On a summer evening, his team is testing bats at a nursery colony in Willsboro, New York. Unidentified Woman: All right they're number is going to be three, zero\u2026 MANN: Some of the thumb-sized bats are being fixed with radio transmitters. (Soundbite of beep) MANN: Two years ago, a fungal disease called white nose syndrome was identified in a handful of caves near Albany, a couple of hours drive from here. The fungus seems to drive the most common species of North American bats crazy, disrupting their delicate pattern of feeding and hibernating and damaging their wings. Scientist hope the epidemic would be limited to the Northeast. But, in the months since, white nose has spread fast, as far away as West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Millions of animals have died and Fenton says, this summer, they're finding whole nesting sites that have been depopulated. Dr. FENTON: They're so few little brown bats active. I don't see anything to be happy about. MANN: Researchers fear that white nose will reach vitally important bat colonies in Florida, Georgia, Ohio and Tennessee in the next year. Dr. Thomas Kunz, director of the Center for Ecology and Conservation Biology at Boston University, told a congressional panel in June, that the epidemic could spread coast to coast. Dr. THOMAS KUNZ (Director, Center for Ecology and Conservation Biology, Boston University): This is one of the most devastating conditions I have ever observed. We are witnessing one of the most precipitous declines of wildlife in North America. MANN: What that will mean to the environment is still a complete mystery. But, the U. S. Department of Agriculture has estimated that losing bats could cost farmers a billion dollars a year. People think of bats as pests, but Brock Fenton says the truth is exactly the opposite. Dr. FENTON: So, each of these bats is eating half its body weight in  insects every night. (unintelligible) pregnancy, a lactating female, she's eating her own body weight in insects every night. So, that's a hell of a lot of insects. MANN: Scientists have fanned out through the infected area, trying to understand and hopefully slow the spread of white nose. (Soundbite of door opening) MANN: On a hot summer day Fenton drags himself through a tiny hatchway, into the broiling attic of Willsboro's Methodist church. Dr. FENTON: See the formation's growing?

They dangle precariously from the rafters, snagging furious, little brown bats and stuffing them in paper bags. (Soundbite of tapping) MANN: The work here is meant to answer a big question. Does white nose syndrome only spread in caves contaminated with the fungus spores, or did it spread readily from bat to bat in the summer colonies? Dr. FENTON: We don't have the answer to that. MANN: Which means they still don't know for sure how far or fast the epidemic will travel. This kind of research has been hampered by what Fenton and others say is a desperate lack of funding. State and federal agencies, grappling with the disease, have seen their budgets slashed in recent years. At the congressional hearing in June, Marvin Moriarty, with the U. S.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Scientists are racing to develop strains of super rice. The idea is to prevent deadly famines. Researchers say tough, highly-productive rice plants offer the best hope for feeding a world population that will reach nine billion by 2050. As NPR's Jon Hamilton reports, the quest to create super rice is producing a lot of scientific papers on rice genetics. (Soundbite of rice field) JON HAMILTON: In the rice fields of northern Bangladesh, farmers like to say: rice is life. And since the 1960s, rice crops here have been getting better and better. These farmers in the Rangpur District say that's changed everything for them. (Soundbite of farmers) Unidentified People: (Speaking in foreign language) Unidentified Man #1: Thirty to 40 years back, people used to die because of starvation. But they don't see people dying because of starvation now. HAMILTON: It's not just Bangladesh. Across Asia, famines have all but disappeared, thanks to genetically superior rice plants. Bob Zeigler directs the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. He says things changed when scientists found out how to breed rice plants that put their energy into making more rice grains, rather than longer stalks. Dr. BOB ZEIGLER (Director, International Rice Research Institute): It's essentially doubled rice production in Asia. And what it has allowed is for food supplies in Asia to grow faster, or at least as fast as population. So we've averted the famine. HAMILTON: But rice production will have to double again by 2050 to keep up with demand. That will mean creating plants that can thrive despite floods, draughts and disease. Zeigler says these qualities aren't easy to breed into a plant. ZEIGLER: Fortunately, in rice we're in a situation where - with rice having its genome sequenced - the first crop species to have its genome sequenced - with a lot of molecular biological tools at our disposal, we're able for the first time to actually breed for these much more difficult traits. HARRIS: Scientists describe new ways to do that in three leading scientific journals this week. One study looks at so-called deep-water rice. Rens Voesenek from Utrecht University in the Netherlands says these plants have evolved several ways to solve the problem of rising flood waters. Dr. RENS VOESENEK (Utrecht University, Netherlands): One of the solutions is that the plant starts to grow very fast, in such a way that parts of the shoot will be above the water level, so that that part can function as a sort of a snorkel. HAMILTON: Unfortunately, the snorkel plants don't produce much rice. But in the journal Nature this week, a team from Japan offers a solution to that problem, too. Voesenek says the team identified genes called Snorkel One and Snorkel Two that control the so-called elongation response in these plants. Dr. VOESENEK: By knowing how the elongation is brought about, we can cross them with high-yielding varieties and combine the capacity to elongate, with much higher yields than you would normally expect based on the deep-waterized varieties. HARRIS: A second study from Japan, this one in the journal Science, identifies a gene that helps rice plants resist something called Rice Blast. Blast is a fungus so devastating to crops that the U. S. considered using it as a biological weapon against Japan during World War II. In the past, plants bred to resist the fungus produced rice that didn't taste good. But the Japanese team says its genetic discovery should make it possible to combine resistance and good taste. Professor SUSAN MCCOUCH (Plant Biology, Cornell University): It's a great day for rice genetics. HAMILTON: Susan McCouch of Cornell University says this is precisely the sort of research that could head off famines. And, she says, rice genetics could help improve the quality of rice, as well as the quantity. McCouch has a paper of her own in the \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \" It describes the origin of fragrance in rice, specifically the fragrance conferred by a gene called BADH2. Prof. MCCOUCH: Fragrance may sound like a luxurious and maybe slightly less than vital characteristic, but it costs nothing to breed it in. HAMILTON: And that's possible, now that scientists have found the fragrance gene. Jon Hamilton, NPR News.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  And I'm Robert Siegel.  Scientists are racing to develop strains of super rice. The idea is to prevent deadly famines. Researchers say tough, highly-productive rice plants offer the best hope for feeding a world population that will reach nine billion by 2050.  As NPR's Jon Hamilton reports, the quest to create super rice is producing a lot of scientific papers on rice genetics.  (Soundbite of rice field)  JON HAMILTON: In the rice fields of northern Bangladesh, farmers like to say: rice is life. And since the 1960s, rice crops here have been getting better and better. These farmers in the Rangpur District say that's changed everything for them.  (Soundbite of farmers)  Unidentified People: (Speaking in foreign language)  Unidentified Man #1: Thirty to 40 years back, people used to die because of starvation. But they don't see people dying because of starvation now.  HAMILTON: It's not just Bangladesh. Across Asia, famines have all but disappeared, thanks to genetically superior rice plants.  Bob Zeigler directs the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. He says things changed when scientists found out how to breed rice plants that put their energy into making more rice grains, rather than longer stalks.  Dr. BOB ZEIGLER (Director, International Rice Research Institute): It's essentially doubled rice production in Asia. And what it has allowed is for food supplies in Asia to grow faster, or at least as fast as population. So we've averted the famine.  HAMILTON: But rice production will have to double again by 2050 to keep up with demand. That will mean creating plants that can thrive despite floods, draughts and disease. Zeigler says these qualities aren't easy to breed into a plant.  ZEIGLER: Fortunately, in rice we're in a situation where - with rice having its genome sequenced - the first crop species to have its genome sequenced - with a lot of molecular biological tools at our disposal, we're able for the first time to actually breed for these much more difficult traits.  HARRIS: Scientists describe new ways to do that in three leading scientific journals this week. One study looks at so-called deep-water rice. Rens Voesenek from Utrecht University in the Netherlands says these plants have evolved several ways to solve the problem of rising flood waters.  Dr. RENS VOESENEK (Utrecht University, Netherlands): One of the solutions is that the plant starts to grow very fast, in such a way that parts of the shoot will be above the water level, so that that part can function as a sort of a snorkel.  HAMILTON: Unfortunately, the snorkel plants don't produce much rice. But in the journal Nature this week, a team from Japan offers a solution to that problem, too. Voesenek says the team identified genes called Snorkel One and Snorkel Two that control the so-called elongation response in these plants.  Dr. VOESENEK: By knowing how the elongation is brought about, we can cross them with high-yielding varieties and combine the capacity to elongate, with much higher yields than you would normally expect based on the deep-waterized varieties.  HARRIS: A second study from Japan, this one in the journal Science, identifies a gene that helps rice plants resist something called Rice Blast. Blast is a fungus so devastating to crops that the U. S. considered using it as a biological weapon against Japan during World War II.  In the past, plants bred to resist the fungus produced rice that didn't taste good. But the Japanese team says its genetic discovery should make it possible to combine resistance and good taste.  Professor SUSAN MCCOUCH (Plant Biology, Cornell University): It's a great day for rice genetics.  HAMILTON: Susan McCouch of Cornell University says this is precisely the sort of research that could head off famines. And, she says, rice genetics could help improve the quality of rice, as well as the quantity. McCouch has a paper of her own in the \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \" It describes the origin of fragrance in rice, specifically the fragrance conferred by a gene called BADH2.  Prof. MCCOUCH: Fragrance may sound like a luxurious and maybe slightly less than vital characteristic, but it costs nothing to breed it in.

So you may be surprised to hear that it might not be the case. That's because the pound is defined against the metric system's unit of weight, the kilogram. And the kilogram may be changing. Geoff Brumfiel reports. GEOFF BRUMFIEL: This story starts with a metal cylinder about the size of a salt shaker. It was forged over 100 years ago in London. From there, it traveled to a suburb of Paris, where it was weighed, polished and locked in a vault. And it's stayed there every since. This little cylinder is the kilogram. I'll say it again: the kilogram. This is the one on which all other kilograms are based. That makes it very valuable. Mr. RICHARD DAVIS (International Bureau of Weights and Measures): I mean, I picked up its container and I've looked at it, but I have not had the pleasure of actually handling it. BRUMFIEL: Richard Davis works at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, where the kilogram is kept. He's been in charge of the cylinder since 1993, but they won't actually let him weigh anything with it. And there's a good reason for that. Mr. DAVIS: It can be affected by many things. It can get dirty. It needs to be cleaned. You need to watch out about scratching. BRUMFIEL: The scientists who keep watch are so paranoid that they've only taken it out three times - in 1889, 1946 and 1989. Each time, they used it to check a set of copies. In the beginning, the copies and the kilogram weighed the same. Today, that's no longer the case. Peter Moore is with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, in Gaithersburg, Maryland. He studied the measurements. Dr. PETER MOHR (Physicist, National Institute of Standards and Technology): They don't have a lot of data but it shows that they're drifting apart. BRUMFIEL: In other words, the weight of the official kilogram seems to be changing. No one really knows why the cylinder might be absorbing air and getting heavier or washing it before its use may have made it lighter or it could be that the copies are changing. There's just no way to tell. Dr. MOHR: It is the kilogram. There's nothing to compare it to. It is the standard. And so if it's changing, there is no way to know it. BRUMFIEL: The bottom line is that nobody is sure whether that cylinder in Paris, the official kilogram, weighs the same as it did a hundred years ago. The entire metric system hangs in the balance, well, sort of. The change is small, at most 50 micrograms - that's billionths of a kilogram. Dr. MOHR: The actually ramifications for a person going into the store and buying something will be negligible. But for very precise work, it makes a difference. And for scientific work, it makes a difference. BRUMFIEL: And because of this scientists want to throw out the metal cylinder all together and replace it with a reliable number that won't change. To get this number, they've got to weigh the kilogram in a completely different way. They've got to measure its mass without using another weight as a reference. And they've got to do it really carefully. So, NIST has built a special scale. It's kept out back near the woods in the small building whose entry way is covered in little shreds of something black. Dr. RICHARD STEINER (Physicist, National Institute of Standards and Technology): I've to apologize about the rubber on the floor. We have a raccoon. It gets up into over the rafters there and it pushes the stuff out of the little cracks. BRUMFIEL: Richard Steiner is in charge of the scale, which is called the watt balance. Dr. STEINER: You mentioned about being far out. Yes, we are very far out. That we have probably more raccoons come out here than visitors. BRUMFIEL: Inside of a raccoon free room, it is a two storey contraption. Instead of using weights, it uses electrical and magnetic forces to measure the mass of a metal cylinder - an official copy of the kilogram in Paris. Dr. STEINER: The fundamental part of this is actually fairly simple. It's basically a very highly calibrated bathroom scale. BRUMFIEL: Now here's how this thing is going to replace the cylinder with a fixed number. Once Rich Steiner can weigh the kilogram accurately enough, he will be able to relate it to one of the so-called constants of nature - numbers that never change like the speed of light. This will turn the kilogram into a number as permanent as the constants themselves. The challenge is that the cylinder must be weighed with atomic precision. And that's where the watt balance comes in. It's sensitive to as little as 10 billionths of a kilogram. Dr. STEINER: If you pull the hair out of a person's head and then weighed them, we could tell the difference. BRUMFIEL: Unfortunately a scale that's sensitive is sensitive to a lot of other things too. Vibrations from passing lawnmowers, for example - the tides, even earthquakes on the other side of the planet upset it, which is why it's taking so long to weigh the kilogram. Steiner has been at it for 16 years. And he considers himself a newcomer to the field. Dr. STEINER: It's just complicated because we're making mechanical measurements. And we're doing it at the precision of eight digits. BRUMFIEL: Despite all the problems, Steiner is confident that scientists will be able to redefine the kilogram in five or six more years. When that happens, the little cylinder in Paris will be replaced by a single number, eight digits long. Anybody with a watt balance and a lot of patience will be able to check it for themselves.

BRUMFIEL: Judging by their polo shirts and tidy haircuts, these two aren't mad scientists, but they are very, very close to creating life from scratch. It's not quite as crazy as it sounds. The basic blueprint for life is written in molecules known as DNA. Dr. GLASS: It's a long molecule that's made up of carbon, phosphorous, oxygen and nitrogen, I think. And hydrogen. Of course. Duh. BRUMFIEL: Yeah, duh. These five elements make up the genomes of every living thing, and scientists can decode an existing genome by looking at the DNA one segment at a time.

What is in these organisms that makes this bag of chemicals be more than a bag of chemicals? BRUMFIEL: The group already knows how to build a genome. They use a yeast cell as a kind of factory. The yeast strings together pieces of synthetic DNA. But to make the synthetic genome spring to life, Vashee says they need to put it into a bacterial cell. Dr. VASHEE: We needed to put it together. BRUMFIEL: That's not so easy. Yeast is a fungus, and the bacteria's immune system attacks foreign genetic material. The team has now solved that problem, though. They figured out how to shut down the bacterial defenses. Glass says that they tested it by transplanting a non-synthetic genome from yeast into a bacterial cell. Dr. GLASS: Now, think of it as I took the software from one computer. Now, I took that software and I put it into another kind of computer, a different kind of cell. BRUMFIEL: It worked.

Professor DREW ENDY (Synthetic Biologist, Stanford University): All the steps in the process have been demonstrated, and that's the significant thing, all right. It means that anybody in the world could begin the good work of trying to figure out how living organisms work or use the same tools to make useful new things.

The vivid, vibrant little flowers give what amount to come-hither looks to bees. You could call orchids the Scarlet O'Hara of flowers. Some even emit an aroma \u2014 kind of Givenchy for male bees that tricks the bees into thinking the orchid is a female bee who finds them irresistible. Fools. Michael Pollan is the author of \"Lies and Love,\" a National Geographic article about the ways in which orchids attract bees and keep their own species going. He joins us from the journalism school at the University of California Berkeley. Michael, thanks very much for being with us. Mr. MICHAEL POLLAN (Author): Sure, Scott. Good to be here. SIMON: Most of us think we know about the birds and the bees - I hope my daughters aren't listening. What about the birds and the bees and the orchids? Mr. POLLAN: Well, the orchids, as it turns out, practice some very weird sex, even by the standards of the animal world. The reproductive strategy of several different orchid species involves tricking bees into thinking that the orchids themselves are female bees. I'm speaking now of the Ophrys orchid, also called the prostitute orchid. We found it in Sardinia, and this is the one that has evolved to look like a bee, as viewed from the rear, with her head stuck in a green flower. The male bee proceeds to pseudo-copulate and realizes at some point that this isn't working or feeling the way it's supposed to. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. POLLAN: And\u2026 SIMON: This is not what my father told me. Mr. POLLAN: No. SIMON: Yeah, yeah. Mr. POLLAN: And breaks off and goes looking for a more suitable mate, in this frenzy though, because he's been aroused. And he starts looking around madly for another bloom. And when he finds that other bloom, he commences to pseudo-copulate again and deposits the pollen of the orchids. SIMON: It's not just bees though, right? Wasps, butterflies? Mr. POLLAN: Oh no, wasps too. I mean, there's actually another case - which I didn't get to see - the Tongue Orchid. This orchids fools a wasp into thinking it is a female of that wasp's species - the Lissopimpla excels wasp. The wasp begins to pseudo-copulate with it. And the weird thing is it actually ejaculates, which seems seriously maladaptive. The literature describes it as costly sperm wastage. SIMON: Yeah. Mr. POLLAN: But in fact it's a very clever strategy both for the flower and for the wasp. And here's how: This is a kind of wasp that when the female gets sperm from a male, it produces roughly equal amounts of males and female offspring. But when it doesn't get male sperm, it can still reproduce, but what it reproduces is a lot more males. So you see, the orchid is actually inducing its pollinator into having a large population of males, who of course are all pollinators and will have to compete fiercely for females because there's so many males and therefore won't be picky about mates and will go ahead and have sex with flowers. So that's very clever. But then you have to worry about, you know, all this costly sperm wastage on flowers. And it turns out, though - and this is something that might be true for other species - that basically having sex with anything that moves, on balance, is a good reproductive strategy for males. Even though they're wasting sperm\u2026 SIMON: Boy, I wish you hadn't phrased it that way. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. POLLAN: It probably wasn't the most solicitous way to do it. SIMON: No, I - it's perfectly airable. I just mean\u2026 Mr. POLLAN: Troubling. SIMON: \u2026it's not supposed to be modern thinking. Yes, exactly, yeah. Mr. POLLAN: No, it's not modern thinking at all. But it appears to be natural history thinking. The people who've studied this question thinks that a male wasp that's overly picky about its mates will end up leaving less offspring than a male that goes off and has sex with anything that is a wasp or it looks like a wasp. But make no mistake: these are the inflatable love dolls of the floral kingdom and they get a lot of attention. SIMON: You know, downstairs, where my family and I live, is a flower store. And they weren't open this morning yet as I was leaving. But there were some bees outside and I wanted to say to them, I know what you're after. (Soundbite of laughter) SIMON: You are the Woody Allen of the insect world. Mr. POLLAN: Although we shouldn't laugh at them, because we too have been implicated in this whole thing. I mean, that orchid store down from your apartment has hybrid orchids. 'Cause we pollinate orchids too, of course, in the orchid industry. And we're responsible for, you know, hundreds of thousands of new sexual combinations that would have been literally inconceivable without us. So I hate to say it, but we're as much orchid dupes now as the bees. SIMON: Michael, thank you so much. Mr. POLLAN: You're welcome, Scott. SIMON: We learned something from you. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. POLLAN: It's always fun. I appreciate it. I love your show. SIMON: Thanks very much. Michael Pollan\u2026 Mr. POLLAN: Okay. SIMON: \u2026his article \"Lies and Love\" is in the September issue of National Geographic.

SCOTT SIMON, host:  Dear listeners, I think it's about time we had a talk about the birds and the bees - and the orchids. The vivid, vibrant little flowers give what amount to come-hither looks to bees. You could call orchids the Scarlet O'Hara of flowers. Some even emit an aroma \u2014 kind of Givenchy for male bees that tricks the bees into thinking the orchid is a female bee who finds them irresistible. Fools.  Michael Pollan is the author of \"Lies and Love,\" a National Geographic article about the ways in which orchids attract bees and keep their own species going. He joins us from the journalism school at the University of California Berkeley. Michael, thanks very much for being with us.  Mr. MICHAEL POLLAN (Author): Sure, Scott. Good to be here.  SIMON: Most of us think we know about the birds and the bees - I hope my daughters aren't listening. What about the birds and the bees and the orchids?  Mr. POLLAN: Well, the orchids, as it turns out, practice some very weird sex, even by the standards of the animal world. The reproductive strategy of several different orchid species involves tricking bees into thinking that the orchids themselves are female bees.  I'm speaking now of the Ophrys orchid, also called the prostitute orchid. We found it in Sardinia, and this is the one that has evolved to look like a bee, as viewed from the rear, with her head stuck in a green flower. The male bee proceeds to pseudo-copulate and realizes at some point that this isn't working or feeling the way it's supposed to.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. POLLAN: And\u2026  SIMON: This is not what my father told me.  Mr. POLLAN: No.  SIMON: Yeah, yeah.  Mr. POLLAN: And breaks off and goes looking for a more suitable mate, in this frenzy though, because he's been aroused. And he starts looking around madly for another bloom. And when he finds that other bloom, he commences to pseudo-copulate again and deposits the pollen of the orchids.  SIMON: It's not just bees though, right? Wasps, butterflies?  Mr. POLLAN: Oh no, wasps too. I mean, there's actually another case - which I didn't get to see - the Tongue Orchid. This orchids fools a wasp into thinking it is a female of that wasp's species - the Lissopimpla excels wasp. The wasp begins to pseudo-copulate with it. And the weird thing is it actually ejaculates, which seems seriously maladaptive. The literature describes it as costly sperm wastage.  SIMON: Yeah.  Mr. POLLAN: But in fact it's a very clever strategy both for the flower and for the wasp. And here's how: This is a kind of wasp that when the female gets sperm from a male, it produces roughly equal amounts of males and female offspring. But when it doesn't get male sperm, it can still reproduce, but what it reproduces is a lot more males. So you see, the orchid is actually inducing its pollinator into having a large population of males, who of course are all pollinators and will have to compete fiercely for females because there's so many males and therefore won't be picky about mates and will go ahead and have sex with flowers. So that's very clever.  But then you have to worry about, you know, all this costly sperm wastage on flowers. And it turns out, though - and this is something that might be true for other species - that basically having sex with anything that moves, on balance, is a good reproductive strategy for males. Even though they're wasting sperm\u2026  SIMON: Boy, I wish you hadn't phrased it that way.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. POLLAN: It probably wasn't the most solicitous way to do it.  SIMON: No, I - it's perfectly airable. I just mean\u2026  Mr. POLLAN: Troubling.  SIMON: \u2026it's not supposed to be modern thinking. Yes, exactly, yeah.  Mr. POLLAN: No, it's not modern thinking at all. But it appears to be natural history thinking. The people who've studied this question thinks that a male wasp that's overly picky about its mates will end up leaving less offspring than a male that goes off and has sex with anything that is a wasp or it looks like a wasp.  But make no mistake: these are the inflatable love dolls of the floral kingdom and they get a lot of attention.  SIMON: You know, downstairs, where my family and I live, is a flower store. And they weren't open this morning yet as I was leaving. But there were some bees outside and I wanted to say to them, I know what you're after.  (Soundbite of laughter)  SIMON: You are the Woody Allen of the insect world.  Mr. POLLAN: Although we shouldn't laugh at them, because we too have been implicated in this whole thing. I mean, that orchid store down from your apartment has hybrid orchids. 'Cause we pollinate orchids too, of course, in the orchid industry. And we're responsible for, you know, hundreds of thousands of new sexual combinations that would have been literally inconceivable without us. So I hate to say it, but we're as much orchid dupes now as the bees.  SIMON: Michael, thank you so much.  Mr. POLLAN: You're welcome, Scott.  SIMON: We learned something from you.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. POLLAN: It's always fun. I appreciate it. I love your show.  SIMON: Thanks very much. Michael Pollan\u2026  Mr. POLLAN: Okay.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Scientists in Oregon have developed a technique that could be used to prevent certain genetic diseases. They've demonstrated it in monkeys and are now eager to try it in people. But the technique raises ethical questions because, as NPR's Richard Harris reports, it makes a permanent genetic change not just in an individual, but in all generations that follow. RICHARD HARRIS: You need to know just a bit of biology before you can understand what these guys are doing. Most of our genes are in our chromosomes, which are in the cell's inner sanctum, the nucleus. But 37 human genes are outside the nucleus. They are contained in tiny bodies called mitochondria, which float around in our cells. Mitochondria are the mini power plants for our cells. And mutations in the genes inside mitochondria can cause disease. Shoukhrat Mitalipov and his colleagues at Oregon Health and Science University are trying to figure out how to treat this class of rare genetic diseases. They have been working with eggs of rhesus monkeys. If you fix a genetic problem in an egg, you'll fix it in all the cells the egg grows into - the whole animal. Dr. SHOUKHRAT MITALIPOV (Researcher, Oregon Health and Science University): So basically, we construct this experimental egg, which will contain, you know, nuclear genes from one female, but mitochondrial genes from another female. HARRIS: In short, they can remove the nucleus from an egg that has defective mitochondrial genes, and put it into an egg that has healthy mitochondria. So the mother's chromosomes end up in an egg that has healthy mitochondria, albeit from a different female. And the technique worked quite well in monkeys, according to a study Nature magazine has published online. The researchers made this transfer with 15 eggs, fertilized them, and ended up with four baby monkeys. Dr. MITALIPOV: So we showed these manipulated eggs behave like normal eggs and most importantly, they resulted in births of healthy offspring. HARRIS: The monkeys are only a few months old so far. It will take four or five years before the scientists know whether they are able to reproduce successfully. And it could take even longer to notice any long-term health effects. Mitalipov says he doesn't want to wait that long. He wants to try the technique in people. To do that, he would need to convince the Food and Drug Administration that the technique is safe. And he will also have to deal with a key ethical issue. Art Caplan, at the University of Pennsylvania, says the issue is that modifying eggs means that the change doesn't merely affect one individual. Professor ARTHUR CAPLAN (Center for Bioethics, University of Pennsylvania): It goes on forever because it's passed on from generation to generation. HARRIS: This kind of manipulation is called germ line therapy, and it's been considered taboo. For one thing, if there are health risks, they will affect multiple generations. For another, it could open the door to genetically engineering a lineage of people with supposedly superior qualities. This is called eugenics, and many people find that repugnant. So Caplan says the proposal to try this technique in humans deserves special attention. Prof. CAPLAN: It does breach the principle: no germ line engineering. It breaches a promise that many geneticists have made, that whatever else, they're not going down that road. I always thought that promise would be difficult to keep. This particular experiment shows why. HARRIS: Caplan argues the egg manipulation in this case isn't seeking to make an improved person, just a healthy one, and he's okay with that. But George Annas at Boston University is uneasy, both for ethical reasons and for practical ones. Professor GEORGE ANNAS (Bioethics and Human Rights, Boston University): I don't think anything should necessarily be totally off the table, although this would be pretty extreme. This would certainly be at that end that I would probably have a presumption it shouldn't be done. And the burden of proof would be on the people who are proposing it to show that it's safe and that it's not going to create problems, not just for the children, but for the children's children. HARRIS: And he says it will take a lot more than just four apparently healthy baby monkeys to make that case. Richard Harris, NPR News.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. And now, a shaggy dog story. Scientists have located the genes that make a poodle's hair curly, and a collie's hair long and straight. But the research is not so much about hair as it is about how genes cause disease. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports that the hair of the dog has a tale to tell. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: Before we get to the science, let's get the skinny on dog hair from a hands-on expert, dog groomer Patty Dunn(ph), who works at Greater Annapolis Veterinary Hospital in Maryland. (Soundbite of dogs barking) Ms. PATTY DUNN: This is the kennel. This is where they board. JOYCE: She gamely tries to describe the kinds of dog hair she has to work with. Ms. DUNN: This one is an Old English sheepdog on the left. He's just had his hair cut. They definitely have really long hair - coats. JOYCE: OKy, so dogs wanted no part of this. We retreated, and I pressed on in my investigation of canine coiffure. MS. DUNN: A poodle would definitely give you more options as far as a haircut goes than a border collie. Poodle kind of has, like, an afro that you can fluff up and do anything you want to, whereas the border collie lies flat, so you have fewer options. JOYCE: And that difference is exactly why geneticist Elaine Ostrander studied dog hair. Ms. ELAINE OSTRANDER (Geneticist): So if you think about a dog's coat, it can be long, it can be short, it can be curly, it can be wavy, it can be straight, it can be wiry, it can be soft. JOYCE: Ostrander, who works at the National Human Genome Research Institute, wanted to know how genes create all this variety. So she studied about 1,000 dogs from about 90 different breeds. She searched dog DNA the way a chef might compare recipes for souffle. What changed ingredient makes one different from the next? What mutation gives an Airedale his curls and a golden retriever her tresses? What she discovered, and published in the journal Science, was that a mere three genes control all the different kinds of dog hair. Ms. OSTRANDER: This particular study has demonstrated to us how you can take a seemingly really complex trait - you can go to the dog park, and every breed of dog looks different than other breed, it seems. And yet, you know, when we get down to the molecular biology, we really find that it's combinations of three different genes that accounts for all that variation - and that's incredible. I mean, I - 20 years ago, I never would've predicted that. JOYCE: Now, this actually has value in studying disease. Human and dog cancers are very similar, so the fact that only three genes can create so much variation in hair might provide clues to how genes cause so many cancers in dogs and humans. Ms. OSTRANDER: Whether or not the exact same gene is mutated in humans doesn't really matter. It's telling us the pathways that are involved, the kinds of genes that are involved, and the kinds of changes in those genes that lead to those diseases. JOYCE: Ostrander admits she had help with her research from one particular border collie. Ms. OSTRANDER: Tess. It was short for Contessa because she thought she was really something. I got her when she was 9 weeks old. And for the first 10 years of my career, she came to work with me most days.

The culprit is a gas called nitrous oxide, known in your dentist's office as laughing gas. NPR's Richard Harris has the story. RICHARD HARRIS: The Earth is protected from harsh ultraviolet sunlight by a layer of ozone up in the stratosphere. That layer was being depleted by synthetic chemicals used in aerosol spray cans, refrigerators and air conditioners. We averted global disaster by phasing out those chemicals with a treaty called the Montreal Protocol. But the Montreal Protocol is silent about another chemical that can destroy ozone. That's nitrous oxide. It's always been a normal part of our atmosphere\u2026 Mr. A. R. RAVISHANKARA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration): But since industrialization, its concentration has been going up. HARRIS: A. R. Ravishankara is a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colorado. He wondered now that the nasty synthetic chemicals are waning in the atmosphere, how big a deal is nitrous oxide, which comes mainly from agriculture. As he reports in Science magazine, it turns out that it's a big deal. Mr. RAVISHANKARA: In fact, there's so much being emitted, that right now, nitrous oxide emissions would be the largest ozone depleting gas emissions today, and it will continue to be in the future. HARRIS: Nitrous oxide doesn't threaten to devastate the Earth's ozone layer the way the synthetic chemicals did. But it's still eroding a bit of our planetary sun shield, so it's increasing the risk of skin cancer, among other concerns. Now, you may recall that the biggest ozone problem is over Antarctica, an annual thinning event called the ozone hole. That hole is slowly on the mend, and Ravishankara says he expects that healing to continue over the coming decades. Mr. RAVISHANKARA: It turns out that nitrous oxide does not have a deleterious effect on the ozone hole. Its effect is on the global ozone layer. HARRIS: That's because the ozone hole is influenced by supercold clouds found only over the poles. Those clouds release damaging chlorine, but they actually neutralize nitrous oxide. So that's the good news. The bad news is that it isn't easy to reduce human production of nitrous oxide. Cindy Nevison at the University of Colorado says controlling chlorofluorocarbons and other synthetic chemicals that destroy ozone was relatively easy, since just a few factories produced them. Dr. CINDY NEVISON (University of Colorado): Whereas nitrous oxide is produced by microbes in the soil, and the humans have greatly increased the rate of nitrogen available to these microbes. HARRIS: When we spread nitrogen fertilizer on the soil, we also feed those bacteria. And they produce more nitrous oxide. Bacteria in seawater also produce nitrous oxide when the fertilizer runs down the rivers and out to sea. Nevison says factories and automobile tailpipes produce some nitrous oxide, but not all that much. Dr. NEVISON: I think that limiting nitrous oxide is going to be more difficult than, for example, limiting carbon dioxide emissions. And we know how difficult that is. HARRIS: That's because we need nitrogen \u2014 it's an essential part of protein. Carbon dioxide comes mostly from smokestacks and tailpipes. Dr. NEVISON: You can get your energy from other sources than carbon, but you really can't get your food from sources other than nitrogen. HARRIS: We can't phase out nitrogen fertilizers, she says. And studies show we could make only a modest difference if we used them more carefully. And it's not just the ozone layer that's at issue here.

It's about a composer who sought to figure out how and why music has such a hold on our emotions. He said he gained an insight by writing music, not for humans, but for monkeys. NPR's Richard Harris has the story. RICHARD HARRIS: David Teie is a cellist who plays with the National Symphony Orchestra and even on occasion with the heavy metal band Metallica. And he's a composer. He's also been developing a theory to explain why music plays on human emotions. His theory is that music relates to the most primitive sounds we make and respond to, like laughter, heartbeats, or a mother's cooing. Mr. DAVID TEIE (Cellist, National Symphony Orchestra): When I thought I had all the pieces put into place, I figured any good theory is testable. So, one of the ways to test it would be to see if I could write music that would be affective for a species other than human. HARRIS: He wrote to Chuck Snowdon, a psychology professor who managed a colony of monkeys called cottontop tamarins at the University of Wisconsin. Snowdon says he was happy to cooperate and sent Teie recordings he'd made in the lab. (Soundbite of monkeys) Professor CHUCK SNOWDON (University of Wisconsin): That's an animal that's being threatened by a veterinarian. So, he's very upset. He's coming out to the front of the cage as though to attack or to show aggressiveness. HARRIS: Snowdon also sent a sound that, believe it or not, monkeys make when they're feeling mellow. (Soundbite of monkey) HARRIS: That's a quick one. Again: (Soundbite of monkey) HARRIS: With those samples and a few others as a starting point, David Teie composed music for monkeys. Mr. TEIE: Basically, I took those elements and patterned them the way we do normally with music. You repeat them and take them up a third or, you know. It was using the same kind of compositional techniques that are often used in human music. HARRIS: He played the compositions on his cello and then electronically boosted them up three octaves, to a pitch that matched the monkeys' voices. Monkeys don't respond at all to music written for humans, but they did respond when they heard this composition, written specifically for them. (Soundbite of music) HARRIS: Chuck Snowdon says people may not be calmed by this relatively fast tempo pieces, but the monkeys in his lab certainly were. Prof. SNOWDON: This is a rhythm that approaches the resting heart rate of a tamarin and had this calming effect on them, even though the pum-pum-pum-pum in the background was maybe a bit faster than we would expect as humans for this music. HARRIS: Compare that with the music that Teie wrote to see if he could agitate the monkeys, a la Metallica. (Soundbite of music) Prof. SNOWDON: Monkeys reacted to this by increasing their movement. They moved faster through their environment. And also showed an increase in a whole variety of behaviors that we have associated with anxiety. HARRIS: Snowdon and Teie report these findings in the journal Biology Letters. And they argue they aren't simply sounds that imitate monkey voices, they are actually music. Teie says they are written on a staff, played on a musical instrument, and they have rhythm and tonal structure. But is it really music? Mr. JOSH MCDERMOTT (New York University): I wouldn't say so, to be honest. HARRIS: Josh McDermott studies music and the brain at New York University. Mr. MCDERMOTT: There's always this sort of issue of how you ought to define music. HARRIS: And in this case, McDermott says it's impossible to say whether the monkeys are reacting to the musical elements that Teie has added to the recordings or simply to the sounds that mimic monkey voices. And that's the nub of the issue. Teie is, after all, trying to understand the nature of music \u2014 what makes it tug at his heartstrings. It's a question so powerful, at first he was afraid to even ask it. Mr. TEIE: The paradox is that I remember - I distinctly remember, thinking once that when they figure out why Puccini makes me cry, I hope I die the day before the news gets out. But the great news about this exploration into music is that it's actually more magical and wonderful once you realize how it works. HARRIS: In fact, Teie is now hoping to use his insights to compose music that will appeal to other species \u2014 and to trigger even deeper emotional reactions in us. Richard Harris, NPR News. (Soundbite of music) MONTAGNE: You can hear more monkey calls and the songs they inspired at the new NPR. org. (Soundbite of music) MONTAGNE: This is NPR News.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host:  And we have more animal news in our next story. It's about a composer who sought to figure out how and why music has such a hold on our emotions. He said he gained an insight by writing music, not for humans, but for monkeys.  NPR's Richard Harris has the story.  RICHARD HARRIS: David Teie is a cellist who plays with the National Symphony Orchestra and even on occasion with the heavy metal band Metallica. And he's a composer.  He's also been developing a theory to explain why music plays on human emotions. His theory is that music relates to the most primitive sounds we make and respond to, like laughter, heartbeats, or a mother's cooing.  Mr. DAVID TEIE (Cellist, National Symphony Orchestra): When I thought I had all the pieces put into place, I figured any good theory is testable. So, one of the ways to test it would be to see if I could write music that would be affective for a species other than human.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Your 6-month-old won't stop sucking his toes. Your 2-year-old shouts uh-oh at the top of her lungs. Your 4-year-old tells you that Sam the Tiger wants Cocoa Puffs, too. At moments like those, parents wonder if their little children think at all. And then there are the moments, as you gaze into those impossibly big eyes, when you realize that bald head contains the wisdom of the ages. For a long time, most psychologists came down for option one: babies were regarded as incomplete adults. Now, in a new book, psychologist Alison Gopnik argues that babies are much smarter than we think, in many ways more intelligent than grown-ups. Parents, tell us your stories. What have you learned from your baby? What does your baby do that keeps you guessing? 800-989-8255 is the phone number. The email address is talk@npr. org. You can also join the conversation on our Web site at npr. org, just click on TALK OF THE NATION. Later in the program, writer Ariel Dorfman on news today of arrest warrants on charges of torture and murder that date back to the days of General Pinochet in Chile. But first, Alison Gopnik joins us from the studio at the University of California, Berkeley, where she is a professor of psychology. Her book is \"The Philosophical Baby: What Children's Minds Tell Us About Truth, Love and the Meaning of Life. \" And Alison Gopnik, nice to have you back on the program. Professor ALISON GOPNIK (University of California): Well, great to be back. CONAN: And for those of us still mystified by infants, what do we know about the way a little one thinks? Prof. GOPNIK: Well, what we've discovered is that babies and young children really seemed to be designed to learn. So their intelligence is very different from the kinds of intelligence we typically think of for adults. So grown-ups are very good at planning, at doing things, at executing, at getting things done. Babies are terrible at all that. CONAN: Yeah. Prof. GOPNIK: But when - yes, as you may have noticed. But when it comes to figuring out how the world works, just learning about the world and being flexible, imagining new possibilities, that's where babies and young children really come into their own. And that's where they shine - and in some ways are even smarter than we are. CONAN: Well, you described this as sort of adults have this flashlight intelligence that can focus on single tasks and get them done by excluding everything else, while infants have what you describe as lantern intelligence. Prof. GOPNIK: Yes. Well, if you look at our understanding of how adult consciousness works, adult attention, it looks as if what happens when we're a grown-up is that we have - attention works like a kind of spotlight. So we narrow in on the things that are important to us, and we shut out everything else. And in the book I talk about studies we even have that show us how the brain actually manages to do that. When we look at babies and young children's attention, it's a very different picture. So they're very bad at focusing in on just one thing. We say that they don't pay attention. What we really mean is they don't not pay attention. They can't weed out all the other distractions. That makes them not very good at doing things, but it's great at picking up any kind of information that's important. So I think for them, consciousness is like a kind of lantern. They're open to everything that's going on around them in a very rich way. CONAN: There was a really interesting psychological study that's been referenced, and that is showing children two cards saying: ignore the one on the left and just tell us about the one on the right, remember the one on the right. The adults doing the same thing - and of course adults are pretty good at remembering that was the jack of spades on the right. And it turns out that children are incredibly good at remembering what the card on the left was, the one they were told to ignore. Prof. GOPNIK: Exactly. And in fact adults, as you might expect, were much better at remembering the one that they were told to remember. But surprisingly, the younger children were actually better than say, older children at remembering the one that they hadn't been told to pay attention to. So it seems as if they have a kind of wider focus, an ability to learn more about more different things than adults do. And their consciousness is captivated by anything that they think might teach them about how the world works. CONAN: And that - you used an interesting phrase a moment ago: their brains are designed differently. And that raised the question - I'm sure every parent has thought of this, too - what possible evolutionary advantage has there been to have this creature that's utterly helpless when born and pretty useless for many years thereafter? (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. GOPNIK: Yeah, well, one of the puzzles is that we have a much longer period of childhood than any other species. And I think even really devoted moms like me occasionally think, oh, why can't we be like those cats that just toss them out after a couple of months? It turns out that if you look across the animal kingdom, that long period of immaturity is correlated with intelligence and flexibility. And if you think about it for a minute, it kind of makes sense. If your strategy is to learn as much as you can about the world - and that really seems to be the human strategy - then that's a great strategy. It's the reason why we can exist in all sorts of environments, including outer space. But it has one big disadvantage, which is, you don't want to be sitting there when the charging mastodon is coming toward you and saying, hmm, what tool would be most effective for dealing with this mastodon? You want to have a period in which you can do all that learning that you're going to put to use as an adult. So one of the things I say is, it's like babies are the R&D department of the human species. Evolution seems to have solved this problem by giving us a division of labor where the young creatures get to learn and imagine and think of possibilities. And then us old creatures take what we learned as children and actually put it to use. Another thing I say is, it's more like metamorphosis than growth except the babies are the butterflies that get to flutter around, and we're the caterpillars that have to take what we know and hump along our adult path. CONAN: Well, as you can imagine, we've got listeners that have loads of questions about this. And 800-989-8255 is the phone number. Email us: talk@npr. org. We'll get to those in just a minute. But one more question before we go to the callers. How do we possibly know this? You can't give a, you know, an 18-month-old a questionnaire. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. GOPNIK: Right. Well, one of the reasons why there's been such a change in our view of babies is that we had to learn how to ask babies and young children questions in their own language. And it turns out that that language often isn't language. So in order to find out what babies think, we have to look at what they look at or what they reach for or what they give you. And even with 3-year-olds, even if you ask a 3-year-old a question and you get either silence or beautiful stream of consciousness monologue, you'll do much better if you actually ask the child something like, well, make this machine go. CONAN: And you - but you also talk a lot about babies who are pre-verbal. I mean, how do we possibly know what they're thinking? Prof. GOPNIK: Well, let me give you an example of one, wonderful, recent experiment by Faye Shu(ph). who's now a colleague of mine at Berkeley. And she looked at 8-month-olds, and she wanted to see if they could understand something about statistics. So what she did was show them a box full of mixed-up ping-pong balls - 80 percent red and 20 percent white. And then she showed them an experimenter who either took out mostly red - four red and one white ping-pong balls, or mostly white - four white and one red ping-pong ball -from the box. Now - then she looked to see what the babies looked at most intently. And if the experimenter did sort of the expected thing, chose the right sample, random sample from the population, four red and white, the babies didn't look as much as if she did the unexpected, novel, remarkable thing, that's four white and one red. Just like a scientist who says, hmm, this phenomenon is less than 0. 05 by a statistical - test. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. GOPNIK: What is going on there? So by looking at this very simple thing, where the babies looked longest, Faye could figure out that they had these tremendous capacities to learn about statistics. CONAN: All right. As I promised, let's get some listeners in on the conversation. We'll start with Ruth. Ruth calling us from Bountiful in Utah. RUTH (Caller): Hi. I agree with you. There's a lot more going on than you would think when you look at a baby. I was telling them, when my daughter was 15 months old, she couldn't quite walk yet. She would just watch her sister put together puzzles all day long. Just sit and watch and watch. And I thought, well, there's nothing going on in her mind, she just is content to watch. And then when she learned to walk around 16 months, she went over and picked up one piece out of her puzzle, and hid it behind the couch. (Soundbite of laughter) RUTH: You know, her sister could not finish that project without that one piece. She knew enough to go take the piece and hide it. But she could not do a puzzle yet herself. And I - how could she possibly know that from just watching? (Soundbite of laughter) RUTH: There's a lot going on. That child turned out to be an Asperger's savant. But at that age, I just thought nobody was home, you know? That's kind of how they come off, is there's - I think there's a processing that's non-verbal that's going on, but I figured - and I don't think they worry. I don't think, after having seven kids, small babies, they'll have worries. They just don't bring all that into their decisions. They just do. They just react - do. CONAN: Alison? Prof. GOPNIK: Well, one of the things that we know is that small babies are already figuring out a lot about things like what people want. So that's consistent with that story. Sort of surprisingly, recent studies show that, you know, even 7-month-olds already understand something about the fact that when someone reaches for a toy, for instance, that they want the toy. And by the time they're 18 months, they know something about what will make other people happy or not so happy. CONAN: Thanks very much, Ruth. RUTH (Caller): Okay, thanks. CONAN: Bye-bye. A lot of this has to do with the development of the prefrontal cortex. That's the part of the brain that's just behind the forehead there. And it's - well, it does a lot of good things, but it does a lot of things that, well, restrict our intelligence in some ways - at least, you argue that. Prof. GOPNIK: Yeah. Well, the prefrontal cortex is one of the most distinctively human parts of the brain, and it's a great part of the brain. It's sort of like where our CEO is located. It's like head office. The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain that lets us inhibit our responses, that lets us not pay attention to things. It lets us plan for the long term. And those are all great abilities. The prefrontal cortex, though, is also one of the parts of the brain that takes the longest to mature, to take its final shape, in some cases not until kids are in their mid-20s. And what that suggests is that to begin with, again, we're not really very good at being executives, but we're very good at learning all the things that an executive will need later on. CONAN: We're talking with Alison Gopnik about her new book. It's called \"The Philosophical Baby: What Children's Minds Tell us about Truth, Love, and the Meaning of Life. \" Let's - if you'd like to get in on the conversation, give us a phone call.

Click on TALK OF THE NATION. Let's go next to Liz, and Liz calling us from Harrison in Michigan. LIZ (Caller): Hi. I'm calling about my - the smartest grandchild ever born, Henry. He just turned a year old, but when he first was learning how to crawl and, you know, self-motivate himself around the house in his walker or crawling around 7, 7 and a half months old, my son, his father, is a guitarist and always kept on a stand in the living room his very fine guitar. Well, of course, that was little Henry's goal in life, was to get his dad's guitar. So one afternoon, while Henry was sleeping, Dad switched out guitars for another guitar that - Grandma can't tell the difference. You know, unless you can read the label, I don't know, you know. But Henry woke up from his nap, came out, went to his usual task of trying to get to Dad's guitar, took one look at it, went to Dad's bedroom door and started trying to get in there, where he knew the good guitar was. (Soundbite of laughter) LIZ: He didn't want the knock-off. He didn't want the (unintelligible) guitar. He wanted the good\u2026 CONAN: The real thing. LIZ: \u2026the real guitar. (Soundbite of laughter) LIZ: And now, he was asleep the entire time. That same child, his parents taught him sign language. And early this summer, around 8 or 9 months old - you know, the very simple, basic, baby signing - he knew - he knows no. He knows doggie, a bunch of other very simple things. They took him to the zoo, and he's a very calm baby, which I believe that sign language has taught him not to be frustrated when he has needs. He can express himself, and they're not trying to figure out what it is. They got the child to the zoo, and all he could sign was in an absolute panic: no doggie, no doggie. He's seeing all these animals, and he knew they weren't dogs, but he had nothing, nothing. He knew nothing what they were, and he was a wreck. (Soundbite of laughter) LIZ: When they went home, Mom exposed him to a lot more stuff. A couple of months later, they take him back, and he people-watched, didn't pay any attention to the animals. (Soundbite of laughter) CONAN: It's\u2026 LIZ: The guitar thing was just so\u2026 CONAN: Well, to some degree, it makes sense because the guitar is obviously a huge part of his landscape, and he would notice that instead of the Empire State Building, it's suddenly the Chrysler Building. (Soundbite of laughter) LIZ: Right, exactly, except for me to look at it, you know, it's a six-string guitar. The keys are all on the same side. They're both black body, natural neck. They're very, very similar for me, besides the labels that are written on the head stock. I can't tell the difference. CONAN: Well, Liz, thanks very much for the call. We appreciate it. LIZ: Thank you. CONAN: I wanted to follow up, though, on her point about language, and sign language in her case. This is an email from Denise(ph) in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. My daughter moved from Oklahoma to Germany after college. She married a German man who's also a gypsy. He speaks no English, so every day, my 16-month-old grandson hears his parents converse in German, hears his father converse in Roma with other members of the family, and hears English from my daughter. So a few weeks ago, he comes home from his playgroup singing what? \"Frere Jacques. \" And it speaks to that ability, you write about it in the book and it's well-known: Small children have this incredible facility to learn languages. Prof. GOPNIK: Yeah, that's right. That's one of the things that we're starting to understand, and I think this is one of the ones where what we've discovered has some real practical implications. I think people often have the intuition that children aren't going to be able to track more than one language, and all the evidence is just the opposite, that children are so good at learning language that they very happily will learn two or three languages, and with nothing but good effects. All it does is make it easier for them to learn yet another language. So that's one where I think we really underestimated how much babies and children can do, and that makes a difference to even what we would do with them. CONAN: Let's talk with Mike, Mike with us from Milwaukee. Mike? MIKE (Caller): Yes. CONAN: You're on the air. Go ahead, please. MIKE: Oh, yeah, I was listening to your show, and there's a nifty experiment. I did it with my kid. When they reach a certain age, you can teach them to count to eight. So you put eight coins on the floor, and they'll go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. But that's sort of like a rote memory. And what happens then if you put eight matchsticks right next to each coin and then quickly ask them how many matchsticks, they won't be able to know it's eight. And so I think what we're doing is, baby sees everything as a whole, but what they're learning, basically, is just to cut up the whole into parts. They're just learning little bits and pieces of the world, but they can't generalize. They can't reason with that, and\u2026 CONAN: Is that right, Alison Gopnik? Prof. GOPNIK: Well, I think it probably isn't right in the sense that what we're discovering - we've discovered a tremendous amount about children's understanding of number, in particular. And it turns out that even very, very, very young babies, babies under the age of a year, already have some simple ideas about at least simple numbers, like numbers up to three or four. There's even some evidence that those babies can add and subtract, put together numbers to make other numbers up until about three or four. MIKE: Try my experiment. See what happens. Prof. GOPNIK: Well, part of what happens, again, is there's a difference between understanding numbers and getting the number words right. So this is part of where we underestimated children, is that we - because we were doing things like asking them to give linguistic responses to things like how many numbers are there, that's a kind of different ability than the ability to, say, reason with numbers or put numbers together. So there's some lovely experiments that show that, you know, if you put one thing into a box, and then you put two more things into a box, one at a time, with 9-month-olds, and if they could then crawl over and find that there are actually four things in the box, there's no things in the box, they're really surprised. So that means even though they don't have words for those numbers yet, they're starting to understand the idea of numbers. Now, the other thing is they start out with these very small sets of numbers, and it's only gradually, as they learn number words, that they start to be able to deal with larger problems, like problems like - with numbers like eight or 10. So they understand something about numbers and can reason with them to begin with, but it's not linguistic, and it's for these small sets of numbers rather than the kind of large numbers that we have to learn about at school. MIKE: They can't tell sets are the same sets. So if I put eight coins on the floor, and they count to eight, they know that's eight coins or whatever they think it is. They can't say that those matchsticks are the same set as the coins, and that's an interesting thing. Please try my experiment. CONAN: All right, Mike, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it. It's interesting. You were talking about, well, concepts of numbers and facility for language and other things, certainly recognition and the way they look at the world. But your book is entitled \"The Philosophical Baby. \" What do you mean by philosophical? Do you mean quantities of right and wrong, moral quantities? Prof. GOPNIK: Well, the book title says two things. One thing is that the babies themselves are trying to solve some of the big philosophical questions that philosophers have solved - for instance, figuring out how other people work, but also things like figuring out how right or wrong works, figuring out moral rules. And this is another place where we used to think that babies and young children were amoral. Some people argued they didn't really have a moral sense until they were adolescents. And we started to discover that even very young babies already have a sense of empathy. They're already tuned into what other people are feeling. So to go back to the story about the guitar, babies can sense, for instance, oh, this is something that Dad thinks is really important and wonderful. That means it must be - I must - it must be wonderful for me, too. And by the time they're 18 months old, babies are already being altruistic. They'll crawl across the room on cushions - there's a nice new study that shows this - to, you know, help somebody pick up a pen that they've dropped. And by the time they're 3, babies or young children already can distinguish between things that are intrinsically moral, like they'll say it would be wrong to hit someone, no matter what, even if the teacher said it was OK, and things that are just social conventions, like, well, it would be - it's wrong to drop your clothes on the ground, but if everybody said it was OK, it wouldn't be so bad. CONAN: It wouldn't be the end of the world. Let's see if we can get another caller on the line. Keri(ph), Keri with us from Dartmouth in Massachusetts. KERI (Caller): Hi. I had a question for Dr. Gopnik. With all of the emphasis lately on adding academics to kindergarten and even preschool, how does that interact with your research about this idea of lantern knowledge with young children? Prof. GOPNIK: Right. Well, one of the things that I think is really important to say, when we say how much learning these children are doing early on - it's very tempting, I think, for parents and even for governments to say oh, OK, we'd better get them into school early. But one of the points is the kind of learning they're doing is very different from the kind of learning that typically happens in school. And many of the things that they're learning about most profoundly are things like how other people's minds and emotions work, which are very different from the kinds of things that go on in school. We know, also, that the way that children are learning is through observation and imitation and experimentation. They're learning by looking at other people and playing around with the world around them. So I think it would be a terrible shame if we took away things like pretend corners, which we know are really important for children's learning about other people, and insisted that they sit down and do reading drills instead. KERI: There was this article in the Boston Globe last - Boston Globe Magazine last Sunday that was talking about the new kindergarten. And they were saying in some kindergartens, children have 90 minutes of language arts and 60 minutes of math. And I'm a parent. I'm a parent of a 3-year-old and a 5-year-old. And that is a concern for me. But I also understand, how do you then help children who do come into kindergarten, or even preschool, so far behind their peers? You know, I understand that - the push to have academics and to help these children who come in who are behind. But if that's not the way to do it, and it's - your intuition, my intuition tells me it's not the way to do it, to have 60 minutes of math worksheets. How do you help children who enter the school system really far behind? You know, because they haven't had the experiences, or they haven't been in a very language-rich home, or what do you do for them? Prof. GOPNIK: Right. Well, I think one of the things that we can do is to have early childhood education programs that will help children to have those kinds of experiences that we know are important for them. We have lots of evidence that putting investments in early childhood education, even evidence from very hard-nosed economists, is one of the very best investments that the society can possibly make. And yet we still don't have public support for things like preschools. So I think one thing is to start out by giving all children the kinds of rich, spontaneous experiences. And I think it's important to say that you can teach a lot of things that are important for academics, like language skills. Something like reading depends a lot on just having people around you who talk to you and read you books, more than sitting down and, say, doing a reading drill when you're 3 or 4 years old. So we need to be able to give all young children the experiences they need to be able to learn so much. CONAN: Thanks very much for the call, Keri. KERI: Thank you. CONAN: Again, we're talking with Alison Gopnik. Her book is \"The Philosophical Baby: What Children's Minds Tell Us About Truth, Love, and the Meaning of Life. \" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, which is coming to you from NPR News. And here's an email related to that last call, this from Sarah in Louisiana. I was wondering if your guest had ever done any research on the Suzuki method of teaching music to 3-year-olds, stating that was the best time to get a child to learn music. Prof. GOPNIK: Well, I haven't done research specifically on Suzuki. But there is a lot of research that suggests that babies are tuned into music and rhythm from a very early age - maybe even from literally, the time they're born. And infants already, for instance, can kind of sense whether a musical phrase ends the way that it should - that make - in a way that makes sense. And babies bounce and play and hum and dance from the time they're very early. Someone asked recently: What kind of music do they like? And I said, they like a song that you can dance to. But don't we all? CONAN: Let's go next to Barbara, Barbara with us from Corvallis, Oregon. BARBARA (Caller): Hi. CONAN: Hi. BARBARA: I'm thinking that your description of the child's brain sounds a lot like an ADD brain, or ADHD brain. And I wonder if you've made that comparison and know what the implications might be for educating ADD kids or how we deal with ADD. Prof. GOPNIK: Yeah. That's a really interesting question, and I think we haven't done very much research on it. I think it's pretty clear that there's a lot of variance among people in how good they are at this kind of focused attention versus this more wide-ranging, multitasking attention. And I think it's fair to say that part of why ADD becomes a problem and a syndrome and a disease is because we're in a culture that really demands focused attention, at least older - further on in life. So it's a really interesting question about, how do we deal with the fact that there's this natural variance in the ways that people pay attention, and still enable children to do the things that they need to do to get along in our particular culture. BARBARA: Well, it seems like when you're speaking about how well babies are learning and what - and how capable they are because of these kinds of brains, that that might have some implications about how we can maybe educate ADD kids differently. Does that\u2026 Prof. GOPNIK: Mm-hmm. I think it does. Although again, it has to be said that ADD is a very, very variable syndrome with lots of different, complicated things going on. And I think, as with all those things, there probably isn't some, you know, simple, magic-bullet answer. But I think lots of people think that ADD is related to the fact that we put such tremendous demands of focused attention on children in school. CONAN: Barbara, thank you. And here's a related question from Rachel: When do kids go from learning, open to all and unable to block out, to organizing, able to block out what we want? It seems to me adulthood is delayed compared to 50 to a hundred years ago, when kids took responsibility at younger ages. Would we be hurting learning ability to demand that kids take responsibility earlier? Prof. GOPNIK: Well, I think the evidence is pretty clear that there's a big shift about, you know, 5 or 6 years old. So that's when we send children to school, but we've only been doing that for about a hundred years. But in almost all cultures, children start behaving differently and being treated differently when they're 6 or 7 years old. And what seems to happen is that that's the point at which children become apprentices to the adult culture. That's when they stop just being open to everything and start learning - here's the specific discipline skills that you're going to need as an adult. And I think throughout life, even for adults, there's a kind of trade-off between flexibility and what neuroscientists call plasticity, openness to experience, and then that really important discipline and focus that we really do need as adults. And I think the secret of education for older children - for, say, 6 and 7n-year-olds up to adulthood - is to try and find a balance so that children can go back and forth between the responsible, disciplined kind of way of being in the world, and still keep some of that flexibility and openness - something I think is important for us even as grown-ups. CONAN: When is it that when we're grown-ups - and I'm afraid we just have a few seconds left - but when is it, as grown-ups, that we use that childlike ability, that lantern intelligence? Prof. GOPNIK: Well, part of calling the book \"The Philosophical Baby\" is that I think babies have philosophical lessons even for grown-ups. And if you think about things like going to an exotic, strange place, or doing certain kinds of meditation, those are times when you're like a baby. Everything around you is fresh and open and new. And those are good ways of experiencing some of that childlike wonder, even if it means that you also do wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning crying. (Soundbite of laughter) CONAN: Alison Gopnik, thank you so much for your time today. Prof. GOPNIK: Thank you so much for having me. CONAN: And again, the book is \"The Philosophical Baby: What Children's Minds Tell Us About Truth, Love, and the Meaning of Life. \" Alison Gopnik joined us from a studio at the University of California at Berkeley, where she is a professor of psychology. Coming up, new charges in Chile's Dirty War, dating back more than 30 years. Can sometimes very serious crimes be forgiven in the interests of reconciliation? What is the balance with justice? Stay with us. Ariel Dorfman will join us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  NEAL CONAN, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  Your 6-month-old won't stop sucking his toes. Your 2-year-old shouts uh-oh at the top of her lungs. Your 4-year-old tells you that Sam the Tiger wants Cocoa Puffs, too. At moments like those, parents wonder if their little children think at all. And then there are the moments, as you gaze into those impossibly big eyes, when you realize that bald head contains the wisdom of the ages. For a long time, most psychologists came down for option one: babies were regarded as incomplete adults.  Now, in a new book, psychologist Alison Gopnik argues that babies are much smarter than we think, in many ways more intelligent than grown-ups. Parents, tell us your stories. What have you learned from your baby? What does your baby do that keeps you guessing? 800-989-8255 is the phone number. The email address is talk@npr. org. You can also join the conversation on our Web site at npr. org, just click on TALK OF THE NATION.  Later in the program, writer Ariel Dorfman on news today of arrest warrants on charges of torture and murder that date back to the days of General Pinochet in Chile. But first, Alison Gopnik joins us from the studio at the University of California, Berkeley, where she is a professor of psychology. Her book is \"The Philosophical Baby: What Children's Minds Tell Us About Truth, Love and the Meaning of Life. \" And Alison Gopnik, nice to have you back on the program.  Professor ALISON GOPNIK (University of California): Well, great to be back.  CONAN: And for those of us still mystified by infants, what do we know about the way a little one thinks?  Prof. GOPNIK: Well, what we've discovered is that babies and young children really seemed to be designed to learn. So their intelligence is very different from the kinds of intelligence we typically think of for adults. So grown-ups are very good at planning, at doing things, at executing, at getting things done. Babies are terrible at all that.  CONAN: Yeah.  Prof. GOPNIK: But when - yes, as you may have noticed. But when it comes to figuring out how the world works, just learning about the world and being flexible, imagining new possibilities, that's where babies and young children really come into their own. And that's where they shine - and in some ways are even smarter than we are.  CONAN: Well, you described this as sort of adults have this flashlight intelligence that can focus on single tasks and get them done by excluding everything else, while infants have what you describe as lantern intelligence.  Prof. GOPNIK: Yes. Well, if you look at our understanding of how adult consciousness works, adult attention, it looks as if what happens when we're a grown-up is that we have - attention works like a kind of spotlight. So we narrow in on the things that are important to us, and we shut out everything else. And in the book I talk about studies we even have that show us how the brain actually manages to do that. When we look at babies and young children's attention, it's a very different picture.  So they're very bad at focusing in on just one thing. We say that they don't pay attention. What we really mean is they don't not pay attention. They can't weed out all the other distractions. That makes them not very good at doing things, but it's great at picking up any kind of information that's important. So I think for them, consciousness is like a kind of lantern. They're open to everything that's going on around them in a very rich way.  CONAN: There was a really interesting psychological study that's been referenced, and that is showing children two cards saying: ignore the one on the left and just tell us about the one on the right, remember the one on the right. The adults doing the same thing - and of course adults are pretty good at remembering that was the jack of spades on the right. And it turns out that children are incredibly good at remembering what the card on the left was, the one they were told to ignore.  Prof. GOPNIK: Exactly. And in fact adults, as you might expect, were much better at remembering the one that they were told to remember. But surprisingly, the younger children were actually better than say, older children at remembering the one that they hadn't been told to pay attention to. So it seems as if they have a kind of wider focus, an ability to learn more about more different things than adults do. And their consciousness is captivated by anything that they think might teach them about how the world works.  CONAN: And that - you used an interesting phrase a moment ago: their brains are designed differently. And that raised the question - I'm sure every parent has thought of this, too - what possible evolutionary advantage has there been to have this creature that's utterly helpless when born and pretty useless for many years thereafter?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Prof. GOPNIK: Yeah, well, one of the puzzles is that we have a much longer period of childhood than any other species. And I think even really devoted moms like me occasionally think, oh, why can't we be like those cats that just toss them out after a couple of months? It turns out that if you look across the animal kingdom, that long period of immaturity is correlated with intelligence and flexibility. And if you think about it for a minute, it kind of makes sense. If your strategy is to learn as much as you can about the world - and that really seems to be the human strategy - then that's a great strategy. It's the reason why we can exist in all sorts of environments, including outer space. But it has one big disadvantage, which is, you don't want to be sitting there when the charging mastodon is coming toward you and saying, hmm, what tool would be most effective for dealing with this mastodon? You want to have a period in which you can do all that learning that you're going to put to use as an adult. So one of the things I say is, it's like babies are the R&D department of the human species. Evolution seems to have solved this problem by giving us a division of labor where the young creatures get to learn and imagine and think of possibilities. And then us old creatures take what we learned as children and actually put it to use.  Another thing I say is, it's more like metamorphosis than growth except the babies are the butterflies that get to flutter around, and we're the caterpillars that have to take what we know and hump along our adult path.  CONAN: Well, as you can imagine, we've got listeners that have loads of questions about this. And 800-989-8255 is the phone number. Email us: talk@npr. org. We'll get to those in just a minute. But one more question before we go to the callers. How do we possibly know this? You can't give a, you know, an 18-month-old a questionnaire.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Prof. GOPNIK: Right. Well, one of the reasons why there's been such a change in our view of babies is that we had to learn how to ask babies and young children questions in their own language. And it turns out that that language often isn't language. So in order to find out what babies think, we have to look at what they look at or what they reach for or what they give you. And even with 3-year-olds, even if you ask a 3-year-old a question and you get either silence or beautiful stream of consciousness monologue, you'll do much better if you actually ask the child something like, well, make this machine go.  CONAN: And you - but you also talk a lot about babies who are pre-verbal. I mean, how do we possibly know what they're thinking?  Prof. GOPNIK: Well, let me give you an example of one, wonderful, recent experiment by Faye Shu(ph). who's now a colleague of mine at Berkeley. And she looked at 8-month-olds, and she wanted to see if they could understand something about statistics. So what she did was show them a box full of mixed-up ping-pong balls - 80 percent red and 20 percent white. And then she showed them an experimenter who either took out mostly red - four red and one white ping-pong balls, or mostly white - four white and one red ping-pong ball -from the box. Now - then she looked to see what the babies looked at most intently. And if the experimenter did sort of the expected thing, chose the right sample, random sample from the population, four red and white, the babies didn't look as much as if she did the unexpected, novel, remarkable thing, that's four white and one red. Just like a scientist who says, hmm, this phenomenon is less than 0. 05 by a statistical - test.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Prof. GOPNIK: What is going on there? So by looking at this very simple thing, where the babies looked longest, Faye could figure out that they had these tremendous capacities to learn about statistics.  CONAN: All right. As I promised, let's get some listeners in on the conversation. We'll start with Ruth. Ruth calling us from Bountiful in Utah.  RUTH (Caller): Hi. I agree with you. There's a lot more going on than you would think when you look at a baby. I was telling them, when my daughter was 15 months old, she couldn't quite walk yet. She would just watch her sister put together puzzles all day long. Just sit and watch and watch. And I thought, well, there's nothing going on in her mind, she just is content to watch. And then when she learned to walk around 16 months, she went over and picked up one piece out of her puzzle, and hid it behind the couch.  (Soundbite of laughter)  RUTH: You know, her sister could not finish that project without that one piece. She knew enough to go take the piece and hide it. But she could not do a puzzle yet herself. And I - how could she possibly know that from just watching?  (Soundbite of laughter)  RUTH: There's a lot going on. That child turned out to be an Asperger's savant. But at that age, I just thought nobody was home, you know? That's kind of how they come off, is there's - I think there's a processing that's non-verbal that's going on, but I figured - and I don't think they worry. I don't think, after having seven kids, small babies, they'll have worries. They just don't bring all that into their decisions. They just do. They just react - do.  CONAN: Alison?  Prof. GOPNIK: Well, one of the things that we know is that small babies are already figuring out a lot about things like what people want. So that's consistent with that story.  Sort of surprisingly, recent studies show that, you know, even 7-month-olds already understand something about the fact that when someone reaches for a toy, for instance, that they want the toy. And by the time they're 18 months, they know something about what will make other people happy or not so happy.  CONAN: Thanks very much, Ruth.  RUTH (Caller): Okay, thanks.  CONAN: Bye-bye. A lot of this has to do with the development of the prefrontal cortex. That's the part of the brain that's just behind the forehead there. And it's - well, it does a lot of good things, but it does a lot of things that, well, restrict our intelligence in some ways - at least, you argue that.  Prof. GOPNIK: Yeah. Well, the prefrontal cortex is one of the most distinctively human parts of the brain, and it's a great part of the brain. It's sort of like where our CEO is located. It's like head office.  The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain that lets us inhibit our responses, that lets us not pay attention to things. It lets us plan for the long term. And those are all great abilities.  The prefrontal cortex, though, is also one of the parts of the brain that takes the longest to mature, to take its final shape, in some cases not until kids are in their mid-20s. And what that suggests is that to begin with, again, we're not really very good at being executives, but we're very good at learning all the things that an executive will need later on.  CONAN: We're talking with Alison Gopnik about her new book. It's called \"The Philosophical Baby: What Children's Minds Tell us about Truth, Love, and the Meaning of Life. \" Let's - if you'd like to get in on the conversation, give us a phone call.

Click on TALK OF THE NATION.  Let's go next to Liz, and Liz calling us from Harrison in Michigan.  LIZ (Caller): Hi. I'm calling about my - the smartest grandchild ever born, Henry. He just turned a year old, but when he first was learning how to crawl and, you know, self-motivate himself around the house in his walker or crawling around 7, 7 and a half months old, my son, his father, is a guitarist and always kept on a stand in the living room his very fine guitar.  Well, of course, that was little Henry's goal in life, was to get his dad's guitar. So one afternoon, while Henry was sleeping, Dad switched out guitars for another guitar that - Grandma can't tell the difference. You know, unless you can read the label, I don't know, you know. But Henry woke up from his nap, came out, went to his usual task of trying to get to Dad's guitar, took one look at it, went to Dad's bedroom door and started trying to get in there, where he knew the good guitar was.  (Soundbite of laughter)  LIZ: He didn't want the knock-off. He didn't want the (unintelligible) guitar. He wanted the good\u2026  CONAN: The real thing.  LIZ: \u2026the real guitar.  (Soundbite of laughter)  LIZ: And now, he was asleep the entire time. That same child, his parents taught him sign language. And early this summer, around 8 or 9 months old - you know, the very simple, basic, baby signing - he knew - he knows no. He knows doggie, a bunch of other very simple things.  They took him to the zoo, and he's a very calm baby, which I believe that sign language has taught him not to be frustrated when he has needs. He can express himself, and they're not trying to figure out what it is.  They got the child to the zoo, and all he could sign was in an absolute panic: no doggie, no doggie. He's seeing all these animals, and he knew they weren't dogs, but he had nothing, nothing. He knew nothing what they were, and he was a wreck.  (Soundbite of laughter)  LIZ: When they went home, Mom exposed him to a lot more stuff. A couple of months later, they take him back, and he people-watched, didn't pay any attention to the animals.  (Soundbite of laughter)  CONAN: It's\u2026  LIZ: The guitar thing was just so\u2026  CONAN: Well, to some degree, it makes sense because the guitar is obviously a huge part of his landscape, and he would notice that instead of the Empire State Building, it's suddenly the Chrysler Building.  (Soundbite of laughter)  LIZ: Right, exactly, except for me to look at it, you know, it's a six-string guitar. The keys are all on the same side. They're both black body, natural neck. They're very, very similar for me, besides the labels that are written on the head stock. I can't tell the difference.  CONAN: Well, Liz, thanks very much for the call. We appreciate it.  LIZ: Thank you.  CONAN: I wanted to follow up, though, on her point about language, and sign language in her case. This is an email from Denise(ph) in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma.  My daughter moved from Oklahoma to Germany after college. She married a German man who's also a gypsy. He speaks no English, so every day, my 16-month-old grandson hears his parents converse in German, hears his father converse in Roma with other members of the family, and hears English from my daughter. So a few weeks ago, he comes home from his playgroup singing what? \"Frere Jacques. \"  And it speaks to that ability, you write about it in the book and it's well-known: Small children have this incredible facility to learn languages.  Prof. GOPNIK: Yeah, that's right. That's one of the things that we're starting to understand, and I think this is one of the ones where what we've discovered has some real practical implications.  I think people often have the intuition that children aren't going to be able to track more than one language, and all the evidence is just the opposite, that children are so good at learning language that they very happily will learn two or three languages, and with nothing but good effects. All it does is make it easier for them to learn yet another language.  So that's one where I think we really underestimated how much babies and children can do, and that makes a difference to even what we would do with them.  CONAN: Let's talk with Mike, Mike with us from Milwaukee. Mike?  MIKE (Caller): Yes.  CONAN: You're on the air. Go ahead, please.  MIKE: Oh, yeah, I was listening to your show, and there's a nifty experiment. I did it with my kid. When they reach a certain age, you can teach them to count to eight. So you put eight coins on the floor, and they'll go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. But that's sort of like a rote memory. And what happens then if you put eight matchsticks right next to each coin and then quickly ask them how many matchsticks, they won't be able to know it's eight.  And so I think what we're doing is, baby sees everything as a whole, but what they're learning, basically, is just to cut up the whole into parts. They're just learning little bits and pieces of the world, but they can't generalize. They can't reason with that, and\u2026  CONAN: Is that right, Alison Gopnik?  Prof. GOPNIK: Well, I think it probably isn't right in the sense that what we're discovering - we've discovered a tremendous amount about children's understanding of number, in particular. And it turns out that even very, very, very young babies, babies under the age of a year, already have some simple ideas about at least simple numbers, like numbers up to three or four. There's even some evidence that those babies can add and subtract, put together numbers to make other numbers up until about three or four.  MIKE: Try my experiment. See what happens.  Prof. GOPNIK: Well, part of what happens, again, is there's a difference between understanding numbers and getting the number words right. So this is part of where we underestimated children, is that we - because we were doing things like asking them to give linguistic responses to things like how many numbers are there, that's a kind of different ability than the ability to, say, reason with numbers or put numbers together.  So there's some lovely experiments that show that, you know, if you put one thing into a box, and then you put two more things into a box, one at a time, with 9-month-olds, and if they could then crawl over and find that there are actually four things in the box, there's no things in the box, they're really surprised. So that means even though they don't have words for those numbers yet, they're starting to understand the idea of numbers.  Now, the other thing is they start out with these very small sets of numbers, and it's only gradually, as they learn number words, that they start to be able to deal with larger problems, like problems like - with numbers like eight or 10.  So they understand something about numbers and can reason with them to begin with, but it's not linguistic, and it's for these small sets of numbers rather than the kind of large numbers that we have to learn about at school.  MIKE: They can't tell sets are the same sets. So if I put eight coins on the floor, and they count to eight, they know that's eight coins or whatever they think it is. They can't say that those matchsticks are the same set as the coins, and that's an interesting thing. Please try my experiment.  CONAN: All right, Mike, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it. It's interesting. You were talking about, well, concepts of numbers and facility for language and other things, certainly recognition and the way they look at the world. But your book is entitled \"The Philosophical Baby. \" What do you mean by philosophical? Do you mean quantities of right and wrong, moral quantities?  Prof. GOPNIK: Well, the book title says two things. One thing is that the babies themselves are trying to solve some of the big philosophical questions that philosophers have solved - for instance, figuring out how other people work, but also things like figuring out how right or wrong works, figuring out moral rules. And this is another place where we used to think that babies and young children were amoral.  Some people argued they didn't really have a moral sense until they were adolescents. And we started to discover that even very young babies already have a sense of empathy. They're already tuned into what other people are feeling.  So to go back to the story about the guitar, babies can sense, for instance, oh, this is something that Dad thinks is really important and wonderful. That means it must be - I must - it must be wonderful for me, too. And by the time they're 18 months old, babies are already being altruistic.  They'll crawl across the room on cushions - there's a nice new study that shows this - to, you know, help somebody pick up a pen that they've dropped. And by the time they're 3, babies or young children already can distinguish between things that are intrinsically moral, like they'll say it would be wrong to hit someone, no matter what, even if the teacher said it was OK, and things that are just social conventions, like, well, it would be - it's wrong to drop your clothes on the ground, but if everybody said it was OK, it wouldn't be so bad.  CONAN: It wouldn't be the end of the world. Let's see if we can get another caller on the line. Keri(ph), Keri with us from Dartmouth in Massachusetts.  KERI (Caller): Hi. I had a question for Dr. Gopnik. With all of the emphasis lately on adding academics to kindergarten and even preschool, how does that interact with your research about this idea of lantern knowledge with young children?  Prof. GOPNIK: Right. Well, one of the things that I think is really important to say, when we say how much learning these children are doing early on - it's very tempting, I think, for parents and even for governments to say oh, OK, we'd better get them into school early. But one of the points is the kind of learning they're doing is very different from the kind of learning that typically happens in school. And many of the things that they're learning about most profoundly are things like how other people's minds and emotions work, which are very different from the kinds of things that go on in school.  We know, also, that the way that children are learning is through observation and imitation and experimentation. They're learning by looking at other people and playing around with the world around them.  So I think it would be a terrible shame if we took away things like pretend corners, which we know are really important for children's learning about other people, and insisted that they sit down and do reading drills instead.  KERI: There was this article in the Boston Globe last - Boston Globe Magazine last Sunday that was talking about the new kindergarten. And they were saying in some kindergartens, children have 90 minutes of language arts and 60 minutes of math. And I'm a parent. I'm a parent of a 3-year-old and a 5-year-old. And that is a concern for me. But I also understand, how do you then help children who do come into kindergarten, or even preschool, so far behind their peers?  You know, I understand that - the push to have academics and to help these children who come in who are behind. But if that's not the way to do it, and it's - your intuition, my intuition tells me it's not the way to do it, to have 60 minutes of math worksheets. How do you help children who enter the school system really far behind? You know, because they haven't had the experiences, or they haven't been in a very language-rich home, or what do you do for them?  Prof. GOPNIK: Right. Well, I think one of the things that we can do is to have early childhood education programs that will help children to have those kinds of experiences that we know are important for them. We have lots of evidence that putting investments in early childhood education, even evidence from very hard-nosed economists, is one of the very best investments that the society can possibly make. And yet we still don't have public support for things like preschools.  So I think one thing is to start out by giving all children the kinds of rich, spontaneous experiences. And I think it's important to say that you can teach a lot of things that are important for academics, like language skills. Something like reading depends a lot on just having people around you who talk to you and read you books, more than sitting down and, say, doing a reading drill when you're 3 or 4 years old. So we need to be able to give all young children the experiences they need to be able to learn so much.  CONAN: Thanks very much for the call, Keri.  KERI: Thank you.  CONAN: Again, we're talking with Alison Gopnik. Her book is \"The Philosophical Baby: What Children's Minds Tell Us About Truth, Love, and the Meaning of Life. \"  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, which is coming to you from NPR News.  And here's an email related to that last call, this from Sarah in Louisiana. I was wondering if your guest had ever done any research on the Suzuki method of teaching music to 3-year-olds, stating that was the best time to get a child to learn music.  Prof. GOPNIK: Well, I haven't done research specifically on Suzuki. But there is a lot of research that suggests that babies are tuned into music and rhythm from a very early age - maybe even from literally, the time they're born. And infants already, for instance, can kind of sense whether a musical phrase ends the way that it should - that make - in a way that makes sense. And babies bounce and play and hum and dance from the time they're very early. Someone asked recently: What kind of music do they like? And I said, they like a song that you can dance to. But don't we all?  CONAN: Let's go next to Barbara, Barbara with us from Corvallis, Oregon.  BARBARA (Caller): Hi.  CONAN: Hi.  BARBARA: I'm thinking that your description of the child's brain sounds a lot like an ADD brain, or ADHD brain. And I wonder if you've made that comparison and know what the implications might be for educating ADD kids or how we deal with ADD.  Prof. GOPNIK: Yeah. That's a really interesting question, and I think we haven't done very much research on it. I think it's pretty clear that there's a lot of variance among people in how good they are at this kind of focused attention versus this more wide-ranging, multitasking attention. And I think it's fair to say that part of why ADD becomes a problem and a syndrome and a disease is because we're in a culture that really demands focused attention, at least older - further on in life.  So it's a really interesting question about, how do we deal with the fact that there's this natural variance in the ways that people pay attention, and still enable children to do the things that they need to do to get along in our particular culture.  BARBARA: Well, it seems like when you're speaking about how well babies are learning and what - and how capable they are because of these kinds of brains, that that might have some implications about how we can maybe educate ADD kids differently. Does that\u2026  Prof. GOPNIK: Mm-hmm. I think it does. Although again, it has to be said that ADD is a very, very variable syndrome with lots of different, complicated things going on. And I think, as with all those things, there probably isn't some, you know, simple, magic-bullet answer. But I think lots of people think that ADD is related to the fact that we put such tremendous demands of focused attention on children in school.  CONAN: Barbara, thank you. And here's a related question from Rachel: When do kids go from learning, open to all and unable to block out, to organizing, able to block out what we want? It seems to me adulthood is delayed compared to 50 to a hundred years ago, when kids took responsibility at younger ages. Would we be hurting learning ability to demand that kids take responsibility earlier?  Prof. GOPNIK: Well, I think the evidence is pretty clear that there's a big shift about, you know, 5 or 6 years old. So that's when we send children to school, but we've only been doing that for about a hundred years. But in almost all cultures, children start behaving differently and being treated differently when they're 6 or 7 years old. And what seems to happen is that that's the point at which children become apprentices to the adult culture. That's when they stop just being open to everything and start learning - here's the specific discipline skills that you're going to need as an adult. And I think throughout life, even for adults, there's a kind of trade-off between flexibility and what neuroscientists call plasticity, openness to experience, and then that really important discipline and focus that we really do need as adults.  And I think the secret of education for older children - for, say, 6 and 7n-year-olds up to adulthood - is to try and find a balance so that children can go back and forth between the responsible, disciplined kind of way of being in the world, and still keep some of that flexibility and openness - something I think is important for us even as grown-ups.  CONAN: When is it that when we're grown-ups - and I'm afraid we just have a few seconds left - but when is it, as grown-ups, that we use that childlike ability, that lantern intelligence?  Prof. GOPNIK: Well, part of calling the book \"The Philosophical Baby\" is that I think babies have philosophical lessons even for grown-ups. And if you think about things like going to an exotic, strange place, or doing certain kinds of meditation, those are times when you're like a baby. Everything around you is fresh and open and new. And those are good ways of experiencing some of that childlike wonder, even if it means that you also do wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning crying.  (Soundbite of laughter)  CONAN: Alison Gopnik, thank you so much for your time today.  Prof. GOPNIK: Thank you so much for having me.  CONAN: And again, the book is \"The Philosophical Baby: What Children's Minds Tell Us About Truth, Love, and the Meaning of Life. \" Alison Gopnik joined us from a studio at the University of California at Berkeley, where she is a professor of psychology.  Coming up, new charges in Chile's Dirty War, dating back more than 30 years. Can sometimes very serious crimes be forgiven in the interests of reconciliation? What is the balance with justice?

A new experiment suggests that in certain situations, dogs and 10-month-old babies have more in common than dogs and wolves. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce explains. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: Decades ago, the well-known child psychologist Jean Piaget did a classic experiment. It goes like this: take a little baby, say, a 10-month-old, put the baby in front of two screens, screen A and screen B. Then show the baby a toy. Dr. ADAM MIKLOSI (Professor of Biology, Eotvos Lorand University): Hello, here is a toy. You make sure that the subject actually watches. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That's Adam Miklosi, a biologist in Hungary. He says, as the baby watches, you put the toy behind screen A, and say, okay, get the toy. Dr. MIKLOSI: And they always find it and are correct in finding objects. GREENFIELDBOYCE: You repeat this a few times, always putting the toy behind screen A and then you do something different. You say, okay baby, watch. And you move the toy, so that it's behind screen B. Dr. MIKLOSI: They follow it quite clearly with head movement or with eye movement. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The baby sees the toy go behind screen B. But, here's the crazy thing. To get the toy, the baby will still reach for screen A. Babies grow out of this by the time they're one, but it's such a weird observation that psychologists have been arguing about what it means for decades. Some people say it's babies' perception of the permanence of an object. Others think it might have something to do with how babies learn from other people. Now, Miklosi is mainly interested dogs rather than babies. He works at Eotvos University in Budapest, studying how dogs have evolved so they can live with people. He wondered what dogs would do in this classic experiment. Would they make the same mistake as a baby? Unidentified Woman: Lucky, (unintelligible). GREENFIELDBOYCE: He and his colleagues basically did the test with dogs and their wild relatives - wolves, ones raised by people. The scientists found that wolves were not like young babies. They made a beeline for the right hiding place. But dogs acted like a 10-month-old infant, going to screen A even after seeing someone put the toy behind screen B. Here's what Miklosi thinks is going on. Dr. MIKLOSI: The dogs are sort of looking at the human as a sort of a teacher that has the privilege of some sort of information. And they don't want to override it with their own understanding of the case. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And he thinks maybe the babies are doing that as well. His team did another version of this experiment - one that didn't involve a human teacher at all. The researchers rigged things up so that now a string moved the toy around. Dogs and babies had an interesting reaction. Without a human, they went to the right place to get the toy. Dr. MIKLOSI: For me, this was the biggest surprise. GREENFIELDBOYCE: For Miklosi, it suggests that both dogs and babies are primed to look at other people for information about the world. But they did find one interesting difference. When they redid the classic experiment but had more than one person do the hiding, it didn't matter to the babies. They kept reaching for screen A, suggesting they were able to generalize about people. But adding a new person changed everything for the dogs. Dr. MIKLOSI: For the dog, if you're changing the person, the knowledge is gone. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The dogs ignored what had previously happened and, like wolves, went straight to the right hiding place. The results are reported in the journal Science. Professor CLIVE WYNNE (University of Florida): It's a very original approach. It's a very thought-provoking experiment. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Clive Wynne studies dog cognition at the University of Florida. He says this research raises all sorts of questions. Prof. WYNNE: There's a puzzle in this paper in that you've got adult dogs behaving like 10-month-old children. When 10-month-old children are only going to act like this for two more months, they're going to grow out of it very quickly. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Wynne says it's important to figure out how dogs see our social world. In part to better understand ourselves but also because American homes contain around 70 million dogs - far more dogs than little children. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

I'm Renee Montagne. ARI SHAPIRO, host: And I'm Ari Shapiro. Here's one way to cut carbon emissions: bury the stuff in farm fields. The Senate is considering a plan that would pay farmers to do just that as part of a climate and energy bill. The bill would essentially raise the cost of any fuel that emits carbon dioxide, the main contributor to climate change. As a result, farmers would see higher prices for their fuel and fertilizer. The payments for burying the carbon on their land would soften the blow, as NPR's Christopher Joyce reports. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: The American Clean Energy and Security Act aims to make companies reduce the amount of carbon dioxide they emit or be penalized. Reducing emissions can be hard and expensive, so the bill creates something called an offset. It's kind of like a get out of jail card in Monopoly. A company could offset its emissions by paying someone else to get rid of carbon instead. Someone who can do it more cheaply. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack recently told Congress that farmers would be delighted to get paid to store some of that carbon. Secretary TOM VILSACK  (Department of Agriculture): They'll be able through the use of land, through cover crops, through altering how they use fertilizer to how they raise livestock to what they do what they do with their land. I mean, there are a series of steps that can be taken and will be taken that will generate opportunities for offsets. JOYCE: A good place to store carbon is in dirt, something farmers have a lot of. Dirt is full of organic matter, plant residue, microorganisms, earthworms. It's chock full of carbon. And theoretically, if you don't till the field more of the carbon stays put. Guided by that belief, members of Congress want to allow farmers to sell offsets earned by no-till farming. Does it work? Scientists say maybe. Dr. MICHEL CAVIGELLI (Soil scientist, United States Department of Agriculture): My name is Michel Cavigelli. I'm a soil scientist with the U. S. D. A. in Beltsville, Maryland. JOYCE: Cavigelli shows me a no-till plot. Dr. CAVIGELLI: We have a corn crop on our left and we have a soybean crop on our right. We might want to go inside the field a little bit. Ok. So I'm digging up the soil. You'll notice that when I break it apart it breaks apart relatively easily. It's not a hard block like a brick. JOYCE: Compared to a plowed field, this one has lots of dead vegetation in and on top of the dirt. Dr. CAVIGELLI: The percentage of organic matter in this soil, for example, is two percent, twice as much as in some of the tilled systems, at the very surface. JOYCE: At the surface and down to about four inches or so. And the carbon will stay put if it isn't plowed. Plowing exposes the soil's organic matter to the air. It breaks down and the carbon goes up into the atmosphere. Dr. CAVIGELLI: If you till it, you can lose almost all the carbon you gained in the previous five years say with one tillage, even. So one of the challenges is to maintain your no-till fields forever, in essence, to really gain the benefits of carbon sequestration. JOYCE: But that doesn't fit in with the kind of no-till that most American farmers practice. Dr. RATTAN LAL (Soil scientist, Ohio State University): The reason is farmers plow one year and does no-till the next year. JOYCE: That's Rattan Lal, a soil scientist at Ohio State University. Moreover, Lal says research finds that no-till fields actually don't store any more carbon than plowed fields if you look deeper - say three feet down. So do no-till fields really qualify as carbon offsets? Lal says they can store more carbon than a plowed field if the conditions are just right \u2014 the right kind of soil and soil temperature, for example. There's a possible conflict brewing here, though. Federal law and the energy bill encourage farmers to remove crop residue to make ethanol. And, says Lal\u2026 Dr. LAL: That's a no-no. The moment you take the crop residue away the benefit of no-till farming on erosion control, water conservation, on carbon sequestration - will not be realized. JOYCE: Nonetheless, Lal supports no-till for carbon offsets, mostly because of how no-till fields are planted. When you don't plow, you use less fossil fuel to run equipment and make fertilizer. Dr. LAL: Saving in diesel, saving in labor, saving in fertilizer consumption, saving in time. JOYCE: These savings mean that no-till has a smaller carbon footprint than plowing. Farm interests are eager to win offsets for farmers. In part, because they say the energy bill will raise their fuel costs across the board. The final list of what will be allowed in the bill could help win supporters when the Senate on the measure. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

I'm Noah Adams. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. New Yorkers are being asked to take their cell phones into the wilds, or at least what pass for the wilds, of New York City next week in the hopes of recording this sound. (Soundbite of katydid) SIEGEL: That is the sound of the common true katydid. It's very different from, say, the northern fall field cricket. (Soundbite of cricket) SIEGEL: Once again, common true katydid: (Soundbite of katydid) SIEGEL: And northern fall field cricket: (Soundbite of cricket) SIEGEL: Now, if you're wondering: why would hundreds or possibly thousands of people go out in search of the common true katydid? Well, so are we. So we've called upon Louis Sorkin, who is an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History and a co-organizer of the NYC Cricket Crawl, which happens next Friday. Why? Why are you doing this? Mr. LOUIS SORKIN (Entomologist, American Museum of Natural History): We're trying to find out if this particular species of katydid is, in fact, still in this area. Previously, there have been reports that the insect had been extirpated from a large area - it's native geographic area because of very many reasons. Some of those could be deforestation, change in the environment. SIEGEL: And those reports go back, I gather, to 1920. Mr. SORKIN: That's correct. And then recent research by workers up in the Bronx said they did hear that katydid. So that's what prompted a few of us to look into it and organize a cricket crawl. SIEGEL: A cricket crawl. Now, you're asking people to go out with their cell phones and then, I guess, phone in what they get into some central point. What can you actually determine from that? And how good a recording device is a cell phone? Mr. SORKIN: Well, actually, what we did realize is that cell phones are optimized for human voice, and that doesn't include katydids and crickets necessarily. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. SORKIN: That's right. So they're not one of the better ways to do it, but if people do their homework, you know, go to the cricket-crawl Web site, look at pictures of the common katydids and crickets that will be mostly likely found and listen to their vocalizations, then they'll be prepared to go into the wilds of New York and listen. SIEGEL: And will you be able to locate all of these different recordings, as to where they were done? You discover that you can hear this katydid up near Van Cortlandt Park, but nowhere in Queens? Can you get that specific? Mr. SORKIN: Oh, sure. Wherever people are going to be, if they've done their homework, they'll know what they've heard. And if they have a better device than the cell phone, they may be able to record it and then always, you know, email that in or even come in to our base camp. SIEGEL: If a family goes out armed with their cell phone or some other recording device, perhaps, what's the best time for them to go listening for katydids and crickets? Mr. SORKIN: Well, that's later in the day, 8:00, 8:30 even, and it will be going until at least midnight. SIEGEL: And you have some real-time, online assembly of all this information, I gather. Mr. SORKIN: That's correct, and we'll have life-time maps and other information about what people are reporting. SIEGEL: So it would be like watching the returns come in from an election that just happened, to see where the katydids are popping up around the city. Mr. SORKIN: That's right. Things will be hopping. SIEGEL: You know, when we think of New York City and the sound of katydids or crickets, it seems like nowhere is the competition greater to record a sound than in New York, where there's going to be traffic and the sound of the subway and air traffic overhead and just the sound of a lot of people being around. Mr. SORKIN: Well, it actually depends on the neighborhood, too, because eight o'clock, maybe midnight, in certain areas of the city are actually quite quiet, and you may even hear a cricket chirp or a pin drop. SIEGEL: Well, Louis Sorkin, thank you very much for talking with us about the New York City Cricket Crawl set for September 11th. Mr. SORKIN: Thank you. SIEGEL: That's entomologist Louis Sorkin, of the American Museum of Natural History. He spoke to us from our bureau in New York.  NOAH ADAMS, host:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Noah Adams.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  And I'm Robert Siegel. New Yorkers are being asked to take their cell phones into the wilds, or at least what pass for the wilds, of New York City next week in the hopes of recording this sound.  (Soundbite of katydid)  SIEGEL: That is the sound of the common true katydid. It's very different from, say, the northern fall field cricket.  (Soundbite of cricket)  SIEGEL: Once again, common true katydid:  (Soundbite of katydid)  SIEGEL: And northern fall field cricket:  (Soundbite of cricket)  SIEGEL: Now, if you're wondering: why would hundreds or possibly thousands of people go out in search of the common true katydid? Well, so are we. So we've called upon Louis Sorkin, who is an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History and a co-organizer of the NYC Cricket Crawl, which happens next Friday. Why? Why are you doing this?  Mr. LOUIS SORKIN (Entomologist, American Museum of Natural History): We're trying to find out if this particular species of katydid is, in fact, still in this area.  Previously, there have been reports that the insect had been extirpated from a large area - it's native geographic area because of very many reasons. Some of those could be deforestation, change in the environment.  SIEGEL: And those reports go back, I gather, to 1920.  Mr. SORKIN: That's correct. And then recent research by workers up in the Bronx said they did hear that katydid. So that's what prompted a few of us to look into it and organize a cricket crawl.  SIEGEL: A cricket crawl. Now, you're asking people to go out with their cell phones and then, I guess, phone in what they get into some central point. What can you actually determine from that? And how good a recording device is a cell phone?  Mr. SORKIN: Well, actually, what we did realize is that cell phones are optimized for human voice, and that doesn't include katydids and crickets necessarily.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. SORKIN: That's right. So they're not one of the better ways to do it, but if people do their homework, you know, go to the cricket-crawl Web site, look at pictures of the common katydids and crickets that will be mostly likely found and listen to their vocalizations, then they'll be prepared to go into the wilds of New York and listen.  SIEGEL: And will you be able to locate all of these different recordings, as to where they were done? You discover that you can hear this katydid up near Van Cortlandt Park, but nowhere in Queens? Can you get that specific?  Mr. SORKIN: Oh, sure. Wherever people are going to be, if they've done their homework, they'll know what they've heard. And if they have a better device than the cell phone, they may be able to record it and then always, you know, email that in or even come in to our base camp.  SIEGEL: If a family goes out armed with their cell phone or some other recording device, perhaps, what's the best time for them to go listening for katydids and crickets?

Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. ARI SHAPIRO, host: And I'm Ari Shapiro. The memory of a terrifying event can be almost impossible to erase. That's one reason it's so hard to treat people who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Now, new research shows that scientists are beginning to figure out why fearful memories are so persistent and how to eliminate them. NPR's Jon Hamilton has the story. JON HAMILTON: Some veterans come home haunted by memories they can't escape. Kerry Ressler of Emory University treats a few of these veterans. He says a typical story goes something like this. Dr. KERRY RESSLER (Emory University): When I was in the Humvee in Iraq the bomb blew up, and I have all these awful memories from that. HAMILTON: Death, dismemberment, chaos. The vets come home and find that even a drive to the supermarket can trigger those bad memories. Ressler says behavioral therapies can help PTSD patients cope with their fears. They learn to believe that a car ride doesn't have to end in violence. Dr. RESSLER: When I'm driving my car down a street in Atlanta, it's a different context, it's a different place. I don't need to be afraid. HAMILTON: But the traumatic memory is still there and can be set off again by almost any emotional event. That's because fear comes from a part of the brain called the amygdala. Ressler says the amygdala isn't logical. It just reacts. Dr. RESSLER: Before we are even consciously aware of something, the amygdala has activated the fight-or-flight reflex and activated the fear system. HAMILTON: So to understand why fearful memories are so persistent, researchers have been studying the amygdala. And a Swiss team seems to have found some clues \u2014 at least in rats. Andreas Luthi of the Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research in Basel worked with rats who'd learned to associate a certain sound with an electric shock. Even after the scientists stopped giving them the shocks, the sound would cause a freezing response. Dr. ANDREAS LUTHI (Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research): It simply means they stop moving. HAMILTON: Usually for several seconds. Luthi and his team showed that adult rats never lost their fear of that sound. But it was a different story for baby rats. They did eventually forget. The memory was erased. Luthi thinks he knows why. When rats are about three weeks old, the brain cells in the amygdala acquire a molecular sheath that seems to protect memories made after that time. And when Luthi's team injected adult rats with a drug that dissolved the sheath, voila, the adult rats forgot their fear. The scientists restored their earlier ability to erase fearful memories. Dr. LUTHI: This juvenile mechanism is not lost during development but still exists. It's still like dormant in adult animals. That is, you can recover the ability of these animals to erase fear memories. HAMILTON: But what about people? Joseph LeDoux of New York University is one of the nation's most prominent fear researchers. He says when it comes to fear, rats and people have a lot in common. He says you can see that in a video taken during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. There's a crowd of people watching a concert. Then a bomb explodes. (Soundbite of explosion) (Soundbite of screaming) Unidentified Man: Whoa. Dr. JOSEPH LEDOUX (New York University): The bomb goes off and you see the camera shake and the camera's still pointing at the crowd and everyone is, you know, hunkered down in a freezing posture. HAMILTON: For several seconds, just like rats. LeDoux says he's confident that rat experiments like the one done by Luthi's team will lead to better treatments for humans. Human brain cells have sheaths just like those in rats, and these could become a target for new drugs. This sort of memory research has some people worried about the potential for misuse by governments or the military. But LeDoux says it would be wrong to halt experiments that could help people with phobias, panic disorder, or PTSD. Dr. LEDOUX: Any PTSD patient you talk to or at least that I've talked to has been willing to sacrifice a few normal memories for the bad ones that they may get rid of if these experiments are successful.

That's because great white sharks have been spotted close to shore. It may be scary for some beachgoers, but it's been a great opportunity for biologists. They've managed to tag five sharks with sophisticated electronic devices to track migratory patterns. NOAH ADAMS, host: Greg Skomal is a marine biologist with the Massachusetts Department of Marine Fisheries. Welcome to our program, sir. Dr. GREG SKOMAL (Marine Biologist, Massachusetts Department of Marine Fisheries): Nice to here, thank you for inviting me. ADAMS: Tell us where you are, please, and about the vessel you're on. Dr. SKOMAL: We are on the fishing vessel Ezduzit, which is a commercial vessel. And we're about a quarter mile off the Coast of Monomoy Island, where we've tagged five sharks with the aid of Captain Bill Chaprales and his crew. ADAMS: Why now? Why are the great whites coming that close to shore, do you think, this September? Dr. SKOMAL: It's a great question. And I think the most motivating factor is the presence of a fairly sizable grey seal colony that has recently rebounded over the last decade in this area. Sharks are finally catching on that there's a viable and readily available - a food resource for them. ADAMS: You went out this morning early? Dr. SKOMAL: Yup. Billy left the dock about 7 a. m. and he had the first shark tagged this morning at 8:30 and had two more sharks tagged over the course of the next couple of hours. So it's been a very successful day. ADAMS: Could I speak with Captain Chaprales, please? Dr. SKOMAL: Absolutely, I'll put him on right now. ADAMS: Thank you. Captain BILL CHAPRALES (Ezduzit, Commercial Fishing Vessel): Hello. ADAMS: Captain, hi, it's Noah Adams, congratulations. Capt. CHAPRALES: Thank you, thank you. ADAMS: Would you describe the process? This is, basically, it's sort of an old-fashioned harpoon device with a high-tech tag on the end of it, right? Capt. CHAPRALES: Yes, that's correct. ADAMS: How close do you have to get? Capt. CHAPRALES: Oh, we've got to get pretty close, or at least for the shark to be at least four feet under the surface. This morning, the first fish we tagged, we were over in six feet of water right on the surf. So, we had to watch out not to bottom out. But it was a nice tag, and we were able to get out of there before we went aground. ADAMS: Well, congratulations. Let me speak again, please, to Greg Skomal. Capt. CHAPRALES: Yup, all right, nice talking to you. ADAMS: Thank you. Mr. CHAPRALES: Standby. Dr. SKOMAL: Hello. ADAMS: Now, describe for us, please, Mr. Skomal, these tags - I have read that they are in place and that they will pop off and rise to the surface in January and transmit information to you in your laboratory? Dr. SKOMAL: Yeah, that's how the technology works. They archive temperature, depth and light level information and stores those data in its little computer chip. And then at a time programmed by us, which in this case is January and February and now May, those tags will come off the sharks, float to the surface and transmit those data to a satellite which then relays them to me, telling me what it did after we tagged it. ADAMS: You know, back when you were in college studying biology for the first time, I bet if somebody would've told you that you would have something like this to use, you would've said no, no way. Dr. SKOMAL: Yeah, when I was an undergrad, we didn't have personal computers. So now I'm putting computers\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. SKOMAL: \u2026on white sharks. It's the most amazing thing. And I'll tell you, if anyone told me I'd be doing this, not only putting computers on sharks, but looking at them and studying them and playing with them like we have, I would've said, no, forget it.

The Hubble Space Telescope has been orbiting earth for 19 years and it's working better than ever, that's what NASA officials said today. They were releasing the first images taken by Hubble after astronauts refurbished it. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has this story. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: The Hubble Space Telescope has been upgraded five times in space, the most recent mission almost didn't happen. It was cancelled after the space shuttle Columbia disaster. NASA officials felt going to Hubble again might be too risky. But astronomers fought the decision, hoping to keep Hubble alive. And in the end, the mission went forward in May. Astronauts did five tricky spacewalks. They installed a new camera, added a fancy new spectrograph, plus fixed two other instruments. Ed Weiler heads up NASA's Science Mission Directorate. He says, after the mission was over, he kept hearing one question. Dr. ED WEILER (Associate Administrator, Science Mission Directorate, NASA): When are we going to see the pictures? We know we've had successful spacewalks, but when will we see the pictures? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Today, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington, D. C. , a music video featuring colorful new pictures flashed on a screen: faraway galaxies, a nebula shaped like a butterfly and a densely packed star cluster. (Soundbite of music) (Soundbite of applause) GREENFIELDBOYCE: After a summer testing and calibrating the telescope, scientists say Hubble is now more powerful than ever before. Heidi Hammel works at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado. Dr. HEIDI HAMMEL (Senior Research Scientist, Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colorado): We in the community are already starting to get our data and we are giddy with the quality of the data that we have with this new telescope. GREENFIELDBOYCE: David Leckrone is senior project scientist for Hubble at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. He says with the new and improved Hubble, the backgrounds of images are full of interesting detail. Dr. DAVID LECKRONE (Senior Project Scientist for Hubble, Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA, Maryland): You can already see remarkable differences between what we're seeing now and what we saw with the prior instrumentation - just in this ability to see, oh, look what's in the background. My goodness, I didn't realize that was there. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says plans for future observations includes studying objects like Pluto at the edge of our solar system and analyzing the atmospheres of planets around other stars. The astronauts who did all these fixes last spring say they were amazed by the new pictures. Mike Massimino says when they closed up Hubble for the last time and came home, they thought the mission had gone well. Mr. MIKE MASSIMINO (Astronaut): And so it's really great to see the evidence that it actually does work. And those images just look great. And I am so grateful that it is working, and that I didn't break anything. (Soundbite of laughter) GREENFIELDBOYCE: NASA has no plans to repair Hubble again. The hope is that it will continue working until at least 2014, that's when the agency plans to launch the James Webb Space Telescope, a new large space observatory. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

It could have helped our ancestors survive the last ice age, as NPR's Richard Harris reports. RICHARD HARRIS: 30,000 years ago humans in Europe were trying to shrug off the cold of the last ice-age. Some people lived in caves in the present day Republic of Georgia. To get a picture of life back then, scientists look at pollen from those caves to figure out what plants were around when the people were. Ofer Bar-Yosef from Harvard explains that a colleague of his put some cave pollen into a chamber to look at it under the microscope. Professor OFER BAR-YOSEF (Anthropology, Harvard University): Her major discovery was that many of these pollen chambers actually contain fibers of flax. HARRIS: Flax was growing wild at the time. And it turns out not only to be a source of edible grain, but of fiber. These fibers were twisted \u2014 a sure sign that the flax had been spun. Now, flax fibers woven together make linen, but in this case, linen doesn't mean crisply pressed summer suits. Bar-Yosef says the fibers they found in the cave were probably braided together, macrame style.

And that fits nicely with her hypothesis that plain old string was a powerful technology, which helped people weather the last ice age. Prof. BARBER: It totally revolutionized what they could do. I mean, on a very simple basis, think about the fact you can tie things up into packages so you can carry more. You can put out nets and snares to catch more game so you can eat better and so on and so forth. HARRIS: We of course think of clothing when we think of woven materials. But Barber says woven clothing was probably not around 30,000 years ago. Prof. BARBER: There's no real evidence they wore clothing. I mean, if you were cold, you would pull, you know, the pelt that came off of last night's dinner around your shoulders. HARRIS: Instead, she says, woven clothing developed not so much for comfort as for fashion, socially important fashion. Prof. BARBER: It's not until you start to get haves and have-nots that people start differentiating themselves by, look what I'm wearing as opposed to what you're wearing or not wearing.

I'm Ira Flatow. What if you had tens of billions of dollars to spend to try and cure diseases? How would you spend it? Cancer? AIDS? Autism? Swine flu? What about some of those so-called orphan diseases that only a handful of people get? Well, $30, $40 billion, roughly, just happens to be what the National Institutes of Health, one of the largest funders of basic medical research in the world, has to work with. Under the NIH umbrella is the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, headed by Anthony Fouci. The NIH has been under a microscope recently by critics and commentators who claim that it shies away from funding research that is innovative and not in the mainstream. Some critics say the peer-review process of deciding who gets funding is arcane. It puts some innovative research at a disadvantage if it doesn't fit into the mold expected by the scientist reviewers. At the helm of the NIH is a newly appointed leader, a well-respected scientists with a great reputation. He has also been known to be quite an innovator himself. Will he carry over that innovative spirit to his new job now that he's, well, it's hard to say, a bureaucrat? We'll find out what he has to say. Francis Collins is his name, and he was recently picked by President Obama to be the director of the National Institutes of Health. You may remember Dr. Collins' name from his work on the Human Genome Project. He's served in the past as the head of the National Human Genome Research Institute. He's also author of the book, \"The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief. \" He joins us from NIH headquarters in Bethesda. Thanks for being with us again, Dr. Collins. Dr. FRANCIS COLLINS (Director, National Institutes of Health; Former Director, National Human Genome Research Institute; Author, \"The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief\"): Great to be with you, Ira, but did you really call me a bureaucrat? Oh, no. FLATOW: Well, that's - well, you are, aren't you? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. COLLINS: No, no, no, no, no. I am an incredibly fortunate person to have probably the most exciting job in all of science: overseeing this amazing organization called NIH and having a chance to stand at the helm and try to steer this ship in the direction of the most exciting biomedical research. FLATOW: Well, I didn't mean that as an insult. I meant it as a challenge, actually, because we've seen, in all the years I've been doing this, I've seen scientists go from being, you know, really fun, innovative, creative people to then going to work for the government, and suddenly they speak like they've lived in Washington their whole career. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. COLLINS: Well, of course, the Genome Project was also run by NIH, and so it's not an unfamiliar place to me. I came to NIH in 1993, and except for the past year, where I took a year off to write a book and think about what I might want to do with the next chapter of my life, I've been in the midst of this NIH process, and all the while, I've kept my own research lab going, and I will continue to do that as NIH director as a way of remaining anchored in the reality of what science is all about. FLATOW: When you were first interviewed after accepting this position, you laid out some of your priorities, some of your themes for your tenure, and one of those themes was health care reform. Can you explain how NIH will interact about health care reform? Dr. COLLINS: Well, I think you can't be an American at the moment without being concerned about the direction that health care is going and the need to do something about that scary cost curve as it heads ever upward. And NIH can play a role and has been playing a role in terms of providing the kinds of data, the kinds of evidence, to enable wise decision-making about how we can allocate our resources. One area that's particularly of interest, right now, is called comparative-effectiveness research, where you try to assess, in a circumstance where there's more than one possible intervention, what actually works best and then try to make sure that that information gets out there so that practitioners take advantage of it. NIH has conducted such studies over the years. Just take one, for instance, the Diabetes Prevention Program, that showed quite clearly that diet and exercise intervention was extremely effective in reducing the incidence of diabetes in people who already had early signs of it and more effective, in fact, than other interventions involving drug therapy. So those kinds of things, we will be doing even more of in the current circumstance, trying to provide the data to enable our health care system to move forward in a way that achieves better outcomes but also reigns in some of this scary cost curve that otherwise we really can't sustain. FLATOW: Now, the members of NIH, the different department heads of the different institutions, are all very vocal, and a lot of them out front visible scientists. Do you see yourself, being the chief of them all now, being a little more visible than your predecessor? Dr. COLLINS: Well, I guess that's going to be somewhat up to other people, but I am excited about the way that biomedical research is going, and I enjoy the opportunity to talk about that. And so on occasions, well, like being on NPR SCIENCE FRIDAY, I'm likely to be quite willing to come forward and talk about the opportunities, to give information to the public about how we're spending their money, hopefully to inspire young people who are thinking about a career in medical research that there are great opportunities here. I think that's all part of my job. FLATOW: There has been no funding - criticism of the funding process at NIH. There - I can read you various blurbs from different places, from different people who say that the peer-review system there is so rigid and set in its ways that new ideas, and I know you're a gentleman of new ideas, have a hard time cracking what we used to call in the old days the good-old-boy system, the old-boy network, of getting new ideas through to get funding, and they fall by the wayside if they don't pass a rigid test of oh, I think this is going to work, this is not going to work. Are you going to try to loosen that up a bit? Dr. COLLINS: Well, absolutely, and this has been a chronic area of great interest and concern. I think first of all, you should say, however, that the peer-review system that NIH uses for biomedical research is the gold standard for the rest of the world, because it does require investigators to put forward ideas and defend them in front of their peers before large sums of money get spent. Lots of other places that give out research dollars don't have such a rigorous system for weeding out things that really aren't worth supporting and trying to identify the things that are most likely to succeed. But it is true, especially in tight budgetary times, that peer review can tend in a conservative direction, of funding the things that are more surefire as opposed to the high-risk ones. My predecessor, Elias Zerhouni, was very concerned about that and initiated a number of programs, which I think are significant in this regard. Things like the Pioneer Awards, which are given to investigators to explore high-risk ideas without having to exactly defend where they're going to go with them, things like a new program, the Transformative R01s. R01 is the standard NIH grant. Well, these are only given to people who come forward with ideas that are truly transformational, things like the new innovators, which are intended for investigators who have not previously had their own major grant from NIH but are required to be innovative. Much of what I've done in my first three-and-a-half weeks of being here has been to review hundreds of summary statements of some of these awards to see what's there, and I must say there's very exciting stuff, and we are doing everything we can to be sure that part gets funded, but this is a constant struggle. We are in the midst of a review - of a renovation of the peer-review process. By the early part of next year, I think we'll have a sense of how that has succeeded in addressing some of these concerns, but it's going to be an ongoing process. We will never be confident we've got it right. FLATOW: Give us an idea of how many proposals you get and what percentage of them actually get funded. Dr. COLLINS: Well, I should say that one particular example of that we should mention is the Recovery Act, which has provided NIH an opportunity to try to fund a great deal of innovative science that otherwise we would not have been able to do during the course of this year and next. FLATOW: Is that the $10 billion stimulus money? Dr. COLLINS: That's the $10 billion that came from the stimulus package to NIH, recognizing that biomedical research is actually a very positive way to stimulate the economy. It creates jobs. It creates goods and services. It multiplies the effect more than two-fold in less than a year. But it's also a great way of getting some exciting biomedical research done that's going to have profound consequences for all of our health. One of the programs that NIH put forward in a big hurry, knowing that this was a unique moment, something called challenge grants. We invited people to come forward with really ambitious, creative ideas, and we thought maybe we'd get a few thousand proposals. Well, actually, we got about 21,000 proposals, and when the dust all settles, even with this marvelous increment coming from the Recovery Act, we're only able to fund about three percent of those. FLATOW: Three percent, wow. Dr. COLLINS: The standard at the moment at NIH has fallen down to about 20 percent of grants that come in that we're able to fund, which is to say 80 percent don't get paid. And that is clearly not a healthy circumstance. And most people looking at this situation would say a much healthier success rate is in the neighborhood of 30 percent, but we haven't been there for several years. FLATOW: There's been a lot of talk recently about the war on cancer and not yielding great results as people had hoped for. Is it a question of just throwing more money at it, as we've heard over the last decade, or do you really need some new directions? Dr. COLLINS: Well, Ira, I think we have some new directions. This is one of the areas I'm most excited about, and this is going to be a big boost from the Recovery Act. We know that cancer is a disease of DNA. It comes about because of glitches, of mutations in vulnerable places in the genome that cause a good cell to go bad. And yet up until now, we've pretty much been limited to looking in specific places where we had a hunch that we might have mutations. Now, with the advances in technology, many of them coming from the Genome Project, we finally are positioned to do this in a comprehensive way and actually get all of the answers to how cancer comes about. That has been achieved in a pilot effort for brain tumor and for ovarian cancer, and one big consequence of having the Recovery Act dollars is now the opportunity to scale that up and go after 20 common tumors and basically tell the entire scientific community, in an open-access way, by tackling those tumors, exactly what is wrong in each one of them - for lung cancer, for prostate cancer, for breast cancer, for colon cancer. All these types, we will finally have the whole story, and that is going to illuminate hundreds of new drug targets that we didn't know about, as well as all kinds of diagnostic opportunities and opportunities for prevention. We are about to see a real quantum leap in our understanding of cancer. FLATOW: Not that I'm going to dispute this, but if this - this sounds like I've heard this before, you know, in other years with other directors and other decades, starting with Richard Nixon. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. COLLINS: Well, yes. We did have the war on cancer going back quite a ways, and I don't mean to put that down because that was incredibly ambitious, well-intentioned. Ted Kennedy had a big role in getting that war on cancer started back there. And any of us who have been involved in medical research have great reverence for Senator Kennedy and greatly miss him, but the war at that point was being declared at a time where we didn't have the right weapons to really know how to win. What's happened in the last few years, and I can't overemphasize this, we have really moved into territory where we're finally empowered. We've got the weapons to be able to figure out how to win this war. FLATOW: All right, Dr. Collins, we'll talk more about the war and some other topics. Our number, 1-800-989-8255, talking with Francis Collins, new hear of the NIH. Stay with us. We'll be back with your calls and questions after this break. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking with Dr. Francis Collins, who is the new head of the National Institutes of Health. Our number, 1-800-989-8255, and also we're tweeting @scifri. That's @-S-C-I-F-R-I. Dr. Collins, there has been some criticism of your appointment to head the NIH because of your religious beliefs, and I wanted to give you an opportunity to address some of this criticism. I know that you have been addressing it. Especially, I know one of the most vociferous critics has - is Sam Harris. He's an author of \"The End of Faith\" and co-founder of The Reason Project, and he thinks that your religious beliefs stand in the way of understanding -completely understanding, things like, you know, our soul, free will, moral loss, spiritual hunger, genuine altruism, etcetera, as he writes. Do you think some of these things might stand in the way of understanding who we are and what we do without having to bring in a religious element into it? Dr. COLLINS: Well, I know those concerns have been voiced by Mr. Harris and others, but I'd really like to reassure people that I don't think there is a need here to worry that somehow the new director of the NIH has a religious agenda. I do not. I do think that we, as human beings, have an opportunity, when we are stepping outside of the details of daily life, to think about the big questions, and I do think it's a mistake for science to imagine that it is the only way to try to answer some of those really large questions, like why am I here anyway? What's life all about? Does God exist? But those are not scientific questions. As the director of the NIH, it seems to me it would be utterly inappropriate for me to spend my time exploring those, or spending government resources in the scientific community addressing those kinds of issues. So I want to reassure everybody that my agenda as the NIH director is a scientific one, not a religious one. It is odd, though, isn't it, that there's such a strong outcry from some quarters, that somehow a scientist cannot have interest in religious matters? What about Isaac Newton? You know, what about Gregor Mendel? There's a long tradition of people who made substantial advances in science who also thought that questions of a larger spiritual sort were important. FLATOW: But when you talk to psychologists, psychiatrists or researchers and neurologists, one of their main areas of research and what they want to know about is the mind and the elements of the mind like morality and altruism, and you seem to be saying that any discussion of that has to include elements of religion there because that completes the picture. Dr. COLLINS: I don't know if I say it has to. I do think the study of the mind is one of the great frontiers of scientific research right now. I'm enormously interested to see where neuroscience can take us in understanding these complexities of the human brain and how it works, but I do think there may be limits in terms of what science can tell us about what does good and evil mean anyway, and what are those concepts about? Evolution has a lot to say about that, and I think we should all be thoughtful about the ways in which evolutionary psychology is illuminating those questions. I find that fascinating. But I think it's probably overreaching for science to say that they have ruled out any other important perspectives about issues like morality and about issues like the spiritual aspect of humanity. FLATOW: So if scientists came to you with research proposals that would delve into the scientific aspects of these, you would not turn them down, saying these are really out of the purview of science? Dr. COLLINS: Oh, heavens no. I think those are extremely important research studies, and if well-designed and subjected to peer review in the NIH way that proved them to be highly meritorious, I would love to see more of that work get done. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Portland, Dr. David McCaron(ph) is it? Dr. DAVID McCARON: That's right, Ira. Actually, I was on the show about a decade ago. FLATOW: Well, welcome back. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. McCARON: With you, arguing about salt and blood pressure. FLATOW: Absolutely. Dr. McCARON: First of all, Dr. Collins, I applaud the position about personal beliefs. It's absolutely critical that we hold those types of our lives to the same standard that we do science. So the question, though, may be even a more challenging one, and that is we're in a position now where the U. S. government is the major funder of medical research, essentially in the world, when it comes down to it. At the same time, and an example would be the Obama administration, which I think is also to be applauded, trying to determine what is effective therapy. And we're in this conundrum, that the source of major funding is also sitting at the table determining, potentially, what is the most effective therapies for the society, setting public policy. And to me, that's like a drug company developing a drug and then going to the FDA and appointing that scientist to chair the panel that approves the drug. And it's obviously not the people at the NIH that are setting these policies and reviewing therapies, but it is, a lot of times, principal investigators, of which I used to be one, that are getting large sums of money from NIH, and they're sometimes in a very tough position of not wanting to pass judgment on a policy that's based upon NIH research. I'll stop. FLATOW: Okay. Dr. COLLINS: Well, I think you're pointing to an important issue about how does the information that comes out of medical research find its way into those decisions, particularly when it comes about reimbursement for care. I am proud to be part of the Obama administration. I'm honored to have been chosen by this president at this time to play this role, as far as trying to provide the evidence, the data, that we all need in order to make rational decisions. Some of that will be data that finds its way into what third parties decide to do, whether they're insurance companies or the government, in terms of what they think is scientifically legitimate and therefore ought to be supported by payment. And that's not new. That's been going on a long time. In fact, people would say there's probably been a problem of insufficient data, not too much. But recognizing that people are quite concerned about whether that information could get used in a way that deprives people to access to therapies that might have helped them, I think we have to be very careful at NIH when we do these studies, and when we publish them, to explain what we've learned from this and what we haven't. For me, as somebody who's particularly interested in personalized medicine, the fact that we are all different from each other at the DNA level, and that may have consequences for our response to therapies, one of the things I think we need to be closely paying attention to is not to lose track of that in the process of trying to make comparisons between treatments and decide what works best. Because what works best for me might actually not work best for you because we're not quite biologically the same. I think there are ways to identify those things when they happen, but we ought to be careful not to neglect them. FLATOW: Thank you, David. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to another call, Stephanie(ph) in Kansas City. Hi, Stephanie. STEPHANIE (Caller): Hi there. How are you, Ira? FLATOW: Fine, how are you? STEPHANIE: Fine thanks. I wanted to extend a big thank you to Dr. Collins for his research on cystic fibrosis. I have a nine-year-old little boy named Henry that has CF, and Dr. Collins' lab - am I right in saying your lab was responsible for identifying and isolating the gene that causes CF in 1989? Dr. COLLINS: That's correct, just about exactly 20 years ago, and how's Henry doing? STEPHANIE: Right. Well, he's doing really well, and he is the third of five kids that I have, and we've got - we're very involved with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and we have a sibling advocacy group coming to Capitol Hill next month. My 12-year-old, Henry's older brother, is going to come with me, and we're going to try to meet the politicians and see what we can do. My kids obviously - Henry's brothers and sisters - are very keyed in to what Henry has to do every day to stay healthy. And so we thank you for that research, and I wanted to find out, with regard to diseases like cystic fibrosis, some of the orphan diseases, what your plans are, what you see kind of as the future and some of the things that maybe we could even ask for when we come to Capitol Hill. FLATOW: All right, thanks for calling, Stephanie. Dr. COLLINS: So thanks for the question, Stephanie, because this is one of the areas, I think, of great excitement and one of the areas I'm personally most anxious to see pushed forward. While diseases like cystic fibrosis are considered rare, there are more than 6,000 of them, and collectively, they effect 20 million people in the United States. So these are really important for us to pay attention to. And here again, we've arrived at a juncture in the last three or four years of being much more empowered to be able to take the fundamental information that's being learned about those diseases and move that into the development of new treatments. The CF Foundation has, in many ways, led the way in showing how that can happen with the investments they've made, working with biotech companies and academic researchers, to come up with new drug-treatment approaches to this disease, which are showing great promise. I'm the keynote speaker, in about a month, at the CF annual meeting in Minnesota. And just looking at the data that's going to be presented there, it really is exciting to see, after two years of a pretty tough slog, that really very exciting, new, therapeutic opportunities are emerging. And we can do that, I think now, increasingly with partnerships between academic investigators who are now better empowered to get involved in therapeutic development than ever and working with the private sector, tackle a long list of rare diseases and neglected diseases of the developing world, and increasingly moving those into the common diseases as well. There's a new program at NIH called Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases - T-R-N-D, trend - which is focused on this which I think is going to be one of the most exciting things that we should be watching in the next couple of years. FLATOW: One of the most, I guess, talked about diseases is autism. Are you going to be spending more money on looking for the causes of autism? And also trying to tell the truth about what we know about autism versus what we keep hearing in the blogospheres all over the place? Dr. COLLINS: Well, obviously, there's great concern about this disease, and now a disease that afflicts about one in 150 kids - and clearly an indication that that is increasing. And the causes remain very frustrating to try to determine, and people have some strong opinions about this. Is this related to environment? Is it genetics? One of the areas of strongest investment with these dollars that have arrived at NIH from the Recovery Act is autism. And we are going to learn a prodigious amount in the next couple of years about this, both by looking at potential environmental influences, looking at early interventions to try to see what works, and by looking at potential genetic causes. Because we are now at a point where instead of looking here and there in the genome, we can sequence the entire genomes of a large number of individuals with autism and try to see - is there something there that might explain this very puzzling disease. FLATOW: What about the future of embryonic stem cell research at NIH? Dr. COLLINS: Well, obviously, great opportunities have arrived  scientifically and also in terms of policy with the Obama signature of the executive order back in March that opens up the possibility of federally funded investigators being able to work with a larger number of human embryonic stem cell lines than before. In addition, from my view, one of the most exciting scientific developments in the last decade has been the realization that you could take a skin cell and talk it back into becoming a so-called pluripotent, these induced pluripotent stem cells that each of us potentially could have created for us if we needed them to replace things that aren't working in applications like diabetes or Parkinson's disease or spinal cord injury. All of those are areas of great promise, but at the present time uncertainty as far as how realistic that promise is. I want to see that pushed extremely vigorously in the coming years. And I think, scientifically, we have the chance and a lot of investigators interested in plunging in and pushing this forward. FLATOW: Talking with NIH director Dr. Francis Collins on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. Lots of people, lots - asking lots of questions. So, let's see if we can get to a few more of them. Let's go to Jamestown, New York. John(ph), hi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. JOHN (Caller): Hey. Good afternoon. Honored to speak with you, gentlemen, today. I just can't believe it. My question is this. As far as nutrition goes, I joined a group four years ago called Life Extension Foundation - a big group of scientists, a big group of doctors that believe in mainstream medicine along with alternative medicine. I've often said to my friends in discussion that we can't possibly take control of the medical disaster that we have going on in this country as far as costs scopes unless we use integrated medicine. For instance, I take for my arteriosclerosis - I'm a self-employed carpenter. I have no insurance. I think President Obama's speech the other day was actually fantastic, just wonderful. Loved it. FLATOW: All right. Let me get an answer because we're running out of time. Nutrition\u2026 JOHN: Here's the deal: I take a Pomegranate CocoaGold and a fat enzyme instead of expensive statin drugs, atenolol, which is clinically, human-study proven to clean my vascular system and heal my endothelium. How come we're not going quickly in that direction? Thank you. FLATOW: You're welcome. Dr. COLLINS: So, I think lots of people are interested in these alternative medicine approaches and how they can be integrated with what you'd call sort of more the mainstream medicine approaches. The NIH has a whole center devoted to this, the National Center for Complimentary and Alternative Medicine, which has, as its goal, to apply in a rigorous way tests of these alternative therapies to see what works. I think that's the real question is what's the data? Do these particular interventions, be they traditional drugs or be they more alternative approaches, show benefit when you apply them rigorously - not just what you hope the answer to be, but let's find out what the answer really is. And in that regard, we're going to continue to push that effort as vigorously as we can and try to give the public the information they need to make decisions about what kinds of interventions they want to choose for themselves. FLATOW: A quick question before the break from Laura Goynoyd(ph) in Second Life. Is DNA sequencing going to become a standard part of tumor treatment -I'll just add, other kinds of treatments? How important will it be to get your DNA sequence to know what's going to work for you? Dr. COLLINS: Oh, I think it's going to be the mainstream of medicine in another five or six years when the cost of sequencing your genome drops to $1,000 or less, it's going to be very compelling to do that. If you're interested, get that information in your medical record in a carefully controlled way so that it's private. And then, when your care provider needs to know something quickly about whether you're about to get a drug that's going to make you better or cause a side effect, that information will be there. And for cancer, I think as soon as we can afford it every tumor ought to have its complete DNA analyzed because that's going to tell you what's the right choice of drugs for that tumor that will be smart bombs instead of the carpet bombing approach which doesn't always work as well as we want it to. FLATOW: And then, a digitized computer database will save us money. Dr. COLLINS: Oh, absolutely. Because if you want to know your genome sequence for a whole host of reasons for the next 20 years, it's better to just do it once, get it digitized, and have it there instantly when you need it. It's not going to change if you're talking about your inherited DNA sequence. FLATOW: Okay. Can you picture a day when you'll carry a little thumb drive around with you\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: \u2026with your sequence in it? Mr. COLLINS: Oh, probably something much smaller than that. But, yeah, I'm sure this kind of information is going to be very much something we all value. It's who - at a certain level of digitized information, it's who we are. FLATOW: All right. We're going to take a break, and I'm going to hold over. Dr. Collins, if you'll stay with us a little bit longer\u2026 Dr. COLLINS: Sure. FLATOW: \u2026and take some more of your questions. Our number: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Talking with Dr. Francis Collins, new head of NIH. Also, we're twittering, @scifri. And as you can see, folks are gathering at Second Life, asking their questions, so we'll be right back after this break. Stay with us. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking with Dr. Francis Collins, new director of the National Institutes of Health. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Carl(ph) in Chicago. Hi, Carl. CARL (Caller): Hi. This is Dr. Carl Boccelano(ph). FLATOW: Go ahead. CARL: I want to let you know that I was a medical student at the University of Michigan for 1991 and 1995 and had the wonderful opportunity to have Dr. Collins give us lectures - introductory lectures as a first year medical student. And I was just - I heard the news that he was the - became the director of NIH and was very, very about that. He was able to do high-level research and yet give very introductory lectures to students in a way that kept us interested and often drew in a lot of humor between him and his co-investigators, which we always enjoyed. I was also present for one of his talks, how he, sort of, reconciled his religious beliefs and his research in medicine. And being a Catholic, I was very impressed with his thought process. And we're sad to see him go to Boston after the University of Michigan, but knew he was moving out to bigger and better things. And, once again, as an OBGYN, I talk to patients every day about cystic fibrosis strain and just want to thank him of all of his work. FLATOW: Thank you, Carl. Dr. COLLINS: Thanks, Carl. That's wonderful. FLATOW: Let me see if I can get one quick call in here before we have to go because we're running out of time. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Iggy(ph) in Kansas City. Hi, Iggy. Quickly. IGGY (Caller): Oh, hey, Dr. Collins. I have a quick question. You know, you're an evangelical Christian, my understanding, so you probably adhere to the statement: faith is belief in things not seen. So my question to you is how can you have this approach to basically fighting these dreadful diseases that had been bestowed on us by your God? Either he created these dreadful diseases and they were good or these diseases developed after the fall of man. So I'm just kind of curious to know how you can reconcile this mythological approach in rational investigation, if you wouldn't mind. FLATOW: Thank you, Iggy. Dr. COLLINS: Well, that's a question that's difficult to answer in a soundbite. That's one of the questions I think believers and non-believers have struggled with down through the centuries. What is the source of evil? What is the cause of human suffering? I did write about that in this book called \"The Language of God\" that was referred to in the introduction and I'd certainly refer the caller to that. But, basically, I think one argument that's been put forward is that the way in which the earth came into being and the way we came in to be creates certain possibilities of things going wrong. And if you want to have life, you also need to have life change and sometimes that means it changes in ways that causes illness. And, of course, a lot of the illness that we see around us are things we do to ourselves. If we are in bad shape because of bad choices we have made, I don't know that we should blame external forces for that. At the same time, when you see a child with cancer, you have to wonder, now, wait a minute. What's going on here? I think there are answers to those questions. They're not easy answers. They are answers that I don't think anybody should feel complacent about, but I think they can be explored from a spiritual perspective in a way that actually increases your interest in the possibility of God rather than discounting it. FLATOW: Dr. Collins, I want to thank you for taking time to be with us today. We've ran out of time. Dr. COLLINS: It's a pleasure to be with you anytime, Ira. FLATOW: Always pleasure to have you back. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, talking about becoming the new head of NIH, and also talking about his book, \"The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief. \"  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. What if you had tens of billions of dollars to spend to try and cure diseases? How would you spend it? Cancer? AIDS? Autism? Swine flu? What about some of those so-called orphan diseases that only a handful of people get?  Well, $30, $40 billion, roughly, just happens to be what the National Institutes of Health, one of the largest funders of basic medical research in the world, has to work with. Under the NIH umbrella is the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, headed by Anthony Fouci.  The NIH has been under a microscope recently by critics and commentators who claim that it shies away from funding research that is innovative and not in the mainstream. Some critics say the peer-review process of deciding who gets funding is arcane. It puts some innovative research at a disadvantage if it doesn't fit into the mold expected by the scientist reviewers.  At the helm of the NIH is a newly appointed leader, a well-respected scientists with a great reputation. He has also been known to be quite an innovator himself. Will he carry over that innovative spirit to his new job now that he's, well, it's hard to say, a bureaucrat? We'll find out what he has to say.  Francis Collins is his name, and he was recently picked by President Obama to be the director of the National Institutes of Health. You may remember Dr. Collins' name from his work on the Human Genome Project. He's served in the past as the head of the National Human Genome Research Institute. He's also author of the book, \"The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief. \" He joins us from NIH headquarters in Bethesda. Thanks for being with us again, Dr. Collins.  Dr. FRANCIS COLLINS (Director, National Institutes of Health; Former Director, National Human Genome Research Institute; Author, \"The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief\"): Great to be with you, Ira, but did you really call me a bureaucrat? Oh, no.  FLATOW: Well, that's - well, you are, aren't you?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. COLLINS: No, no, no, no, no. I am an incredibly fortunate person to have probably the most exciting job in all of science: overseeing this amazing organization called NIH and having a chance to stand at the helm and try to steer this ship in the direction of the most exciting biomedical research.  FLATOW: Well, I didn't mean that as an insult. I meant it as a challenge, actually, because we've seen, in all the years I've been doing this, I've seen scientists go from being, you know, really fun, innovative, creative people to then going to work for the government, and suddenly they speak like they've lived in Washington their whole career.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. COLLINS: Well, of course, the Genome Project was also run by NIH, and so it's not an unfamiliar place to me. I came to NIH in 1993, and except for the past year, where I took a year off to write a book and think about what I might want to do with the next chapter of my life, I've been in the midst of this NIH process, and all the while, I've kept my own research lab going, and I will continue to do that as NIH director as a way of remaining anchored in the reality of what science is all about.  FLATOW: When you were first interviewed after accepting this position, you laid out some of your priorities, some of your themes for your tenure, and one of those themes was health care reform. Can you explain how NIH will interact about health care reform?  Dr. COLLINS: Well, I think you can't be an American at the moment without being concerned about the direction that health care is going and the need to do something about that scary cost curve as it heads ever upward. And NIH can play a role and has been playing a role in terms of providing the kinds of data, the kinds of evidence, to enable wise decision-making about how we can allocate our resources.  One area that's particularly of interest, right now, is called comparative-effectiveness research, where you try to assess, in a circumstance where there's more than one possible intervention, what actually works best and then try to make sure that that information gets out there so that practitioners take advantage of it.  NIH has conducted such studies over the years. Just take one, for instance, the Diabetes Prevention Program, that showed quite clearly that diet and exercise intervention was extremely effective in reducing the incidence of diabetes in people who already had early signs of it and more effective, in fact, than other interventions involving drug therapy.  So those kinds of things, we will be doing even more of in the current circumstance, trying to provide the data to enable our health care system to move forward in a way that achieves better outcomes but also reigns in some of this scary cost curve that otherwise we really can't sustain.  FLATOW: Now, the members of NIH, the different department heads of the different institutions, are all very vocal, and a lot of them out front visible scientists. Do you see yourself, being the chief of them all now, being a little more visible than your predecessor?  Dr. COLLINS: Well, I guess that's going to be somewhat up to other people, but I am excited about the way that biomedical research is going, and I enjoy the opportunity to talk about that. And so on occasions, well, like being on NPR SCIENCE FRIDAY, I'm likely to be quite willing to come forward and talk about the opportunities, to give information to the public about how we're spending their money, hopefully to inspire young people who are thinking about a career in medical research that there are great opportunities here. I think that's all part of my job.  FLATOW: There has been no funding - criticism of the funding process at NIH. There - I can read you various blurbs from different places, from different people who say that the peer-review system there is so rigid and set in its ways that new ideas, and I know you're a gentleman of new ideas, have a hard time cracking what we used to call in the old days the good-old-boy system, the old-boy network, of getting new ideas through to get funding, and they fall by the wayside if they don't pass a rigid test of oh, I think this is going to work, this is not going to work. Are you going to try to loosen that up a bit?  Dr. COLLINS: Well, absolutely, and this has been a chronic area of great interest and concern. I think first of all, you should say, however, that the peer-review system that NIH uses for biomedical research is the gold standard for the rest of the world, because it does require investigators to put forward ideas and defend them in front of their peers before large sums of money get spent.  Lots of other places that give out research dollars don't have such a rigorous system for weeding out things that really aren't worth supporting and trying to identify the things that are most likely to succeed. But it is true, especially in tight budgetary times, that peer review can tend in a conservative direction, of funding the things that are more surefire as opposed to the high-risk ones.  My predecessor, Elias Zerhouni, was very concerned about that and initiated a number of programs, which I think are significant in this regard. Things like the Pioneer Awards, which are given to investigators to explore high-risk ideas without having to exactly defend where they're going to go with them, things like a new program, the Transformative R01s. R01 is the standard NIH grant.  Well, these are only given to people who come forward with ideas that are truly transformational, things like the new innovators, which are intended for investigators who have not previously had their own major grant from NIH but are required to be innovative.  Much of what I've done in my first three-and-a-half weeks of being here has been to review hundreds of summary statements of some of these awards to see what's there, and I must say there's very exciting stuff, and we are doing everything we can to be sure that part gets funded, but this is a constant struggle.  We are in the midst of a review - of a renovation of the peer-review process. By the early part of next year, I think we'll have a sense of how that has succeeded in addressing some of these concerns, but it's going to be an ongoing process. We will never be confident we've got it right.  FLATOW: Give us an idea of how many proposals you get and what percentage of them actually get funded.  Dr. COLLINS: Well, I should say that one particular example of that we should mention is the Recovery Act, which has provided NIH an opportunity to try to fund a great deal of innovative science that otherwise we would not have been able to do during the course of this year and next.  FLATOW: Is that the $10 billion stimulus money?  Dr. COLLINS: That's the $10 billion that came from the stimulus package to NIH, recognizing that biomedical research is actually a very positive way to stimulate the economy. It creates jobs. It creates goods and services. It multiplies the effect more than two-fold in less than a year. But it's also a great way of getting some exciting biomedical research done that's going to have profound consequences for all of our health.  One of the programs that NIH put forward in a big hurry, knowing that this was a unique moment, something called challenge grants. We invited people to come forward with really ambitious, creative ideas, and we thought maybe we'd get a few thousand proposals. Well, actually, we got about 21,000 proposals, and when the dust all settles, even with this marvelous increment coming from the Recovery Act, we're only able to fund about three percent of those.  FLATOW: Three percent, wow.  Dr. COLLINS: The standard at the moment at NIH has fallen down to about 20 percent of grants that come in that we're able to fund, which is to say 80 percent don't get paid. And that is clearly not a healthy circumstance. And most people looking at this situation would say a much healthier success rate is in the neighborhood of 30 percent, but we haven't been there for several years.  FLATOW: There's been a lot of talk recently about the war on cancer and not yielding great results as people had hoped for. Is it a question of just throwing more money at it, as we've heard over the last decade, or do you really need some new directions?  Dr. COLLINS: Well, Ira, I think we have some new directions. This is one of the areas I'm most excited about, and this is going to be a big boost from the Recovery Act.  We know that cancer is a disease of DNA. It comes about because of glitches, of mutations in vulnerable places in the genome that cause a good cell to go bad. And yet up until now, we've pretty much been limited to looking in specific places where we had a hunch that we might have mutations.  Now, with the advances in technology, many of them coming from the Genome Project, we finally are positioned to do this in a comprehensive way and actually get all of the answers to how cancer comes about. That has been achieved in a pilot effort for brain tumor and for ovarian cancer, and one big consequence of having the Recovery Act dollars is now the opportunity to scale that up and go after 20 common tumors and basically tell the entire scientific community, in an open-access way, by tackling those tumors, exactly what is wrong in each one of them - for lung cancer, for prostate cancer, for breast cancer, for colon cancer.  All these types, we will finally have the whole story, and that is going to illuminate hundreds of new drug targets that we didn't know about, as well as all kinds of diagnostic opportunities and opportunities for prevention.  We are about to see a real quantum leap in our understanding of cancer.  FLATOW: Not that I'm going to dispute this, but if this - this sounds like I've heard this before, you know, in other years with other directors and other decades, starting with Richard Nixon.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. COLLINS: Well, yes. We did have the war on cancer going back quite a ways, and I don't mean to put that down because that was incredibly ambitious, well-intentioned. Ted Kennedy had a big role in getting that war on cancer started back there. And any of us who have been involved in medical research have great reverence for Senator Kennedy and greatly miss him, but the war at that point was being declared at a time where we didn't have the right weapons to really know how to win.  What's happened in the last few years, and I can't overemphasize this, we have really moved into territory where we're finally empowered. We've got the weapons to be able to figure out how to win this war.  FLATOW: All right, Dr. Collins, we'll talk more about the war and some other topics. Our number, 1-800-989-8255, talking with Francis Collins, new hear of the NIH. Stay with us. We'll be back with your calls and questions after this break.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking with Dr. Francis Collins, who is the new head of the National Institutes of Health. Our number, 1-800-989-8255, and also we're tweeting @scifri. That's @-S-C-I-F-R-I.  Dr. Collins, there has been some criticism of your appointment to head the NIH because of your religious beliefs, and I wanted to give you an opportunity to address some of this criticism. I know that you have been addressing it. Especially, I know one of the most vociferous critics has - is Sam Harris. He's an author of \"The End of Faith\" and co-founder of The Reason Project, and he thinks that your religious beliefs stand in the way of understanding -completely understanding, things like, you know, our soul, free will, moral loss, spiritual hunger, genuine altruism, etcetera, as he writes. Do you think some of these things might stand in the way of understanding who we are and what we do without having to bring in a religious element into it?  Dr. COLLINS: Well, I know those concerns have been voiced by Mr. Harris and others, but I'd really like to reassure people that I don't think there is a need here to worry that somehow the new director of the NIH has a religious agenda. I do not.  I do think that we, as human beings, have an opportunity, when we are stepping outside of the details of daily life, to think about the big questions, and I do think it's a mistake for science to imagine that it is the only way to try to answer some of those really large questions, like why am I here anyway? What's life all about? Does God exist?  But those are not scientific questions. As the director of the NIH, it seems to me it would be utterly inappropriate for me to spend my time exploring those, or spending government resources in the scientific community addressing those kinds of issues.  So I want to reassure everybody that my agenda as the NIH director is a scientific one, not a religious one. It is odd, though, isn't it, that there's such a strong outcry from some quarters, that somehow a scientist cannot have interest in religious matters? What about Isaac Newton? You know, what about Gregor Mendel? There's a long tradition of people who made substantial advances in science who also thought that questions of a larger spiritual sort were important.  FLATOW: But when you talk to psychologists, psychiatrists or researchers and neurologists, one of their main areas of research and what they want to know about is the mind and the elements of the mind like morality and altruism, and you seem to be saying that any discussion of that has to include elements of religion there because that completes the picture.  Dr. COLLINS: I don't know if I say it has to. I do think the study of the mind is one of the great frontiers of scientific research right now. I'm enormously interested to see where neuroscience can take us in understanding these complexities of the human brain and how it works, but I do think there may be limits in terms of what science can tell us about what does good and evil mean anyway, and what are those concepts about?  Evolution has a lot to say about that, and I think we should all be thoughtful about the ways in which evolutionary psychology is illuminating those questions. I find that fascinating. But I think it's probably overreaching for science to say that they have ruled out any other important perspectives about issues like morality and about issues like the spiritual aspect of humanity.  FLATOW: So if scientists came to you with research proposals that would delve into the scientific aspects of these, you would not turn them down, saying these are really out of the purview of science?  Dr. COLLINS: Oh, heavens no. I think those are extremely important research studies, and if well-designed and subjected to peer review in the NIH way that proved them to be highly meritorious, I would love to see more of that work get done.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Portland, Dr. David McCaron(ph) is it?  Dr. DAVID McCARON: That's right, Ira. Actually, I was on the show about a decade ago.  FLATOW: Well, welcome back.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. McCARON: With you, arguing about salt and blood pressure.  FLATOW: Absolutely.  Dr. McCARON: First of all, Dr. Collins, I applaud the position about personal beliefs. It's absolutely critical that we hold those types of our lives to the same standard that we do science. So the question, though, may be even a more challenging one, and that is we're in a position now where the U. S. government is the major funder of medical research, essentially in the world, when it comes down to it.  At the same time, and an example would be the Obama administration, which I think is also to be applauded, trying to determine what is effective therapy. And we're in this conundrum, that the source of major funding is also sitting at the table determining, potentially, what is the most effective therapies for the society, setting public policy.  And to me, that's like a drug company developing a drug and then going to the FDA and appointing that scientist to chair the panel that approves the drug. And it's obviously not the people at the NIH that are setting these policies and reviewing therapies, but it is, a lot of times, principal investigators, of which I used to be one, that are getting large sums of money from NIH, and they're sometimes in a very tough position of not wanting to pass judgment on a policy that's based upon NIH research. I'll stop.  FLATOW: Okay.  Dr. COLLINS: Well, I think you're pointing to an important issue about how does the information that comes out of medical research find its way into those decisions, particularly when it comes about reimbursement for care.  I am proud to be part of the Obama administration. I'm honored to have been chosen by this president at this time to play this role, as far as trying to provide the evidence, the data, that we all need in order to make rational decisions.  Some of that will be data that finds its way into what third parties decide to do, whether they're insurance companies or the government, in terms of what they think is scientifically legitimate and therefore ought to be supported by payment. And that's not new. That's been going on a long time. In fact, people would say there's probably been a problem of insufficient data, not too much.  But recognizing that people are quite concerned about whether that information could get used in a way that deprives people to access to therapies that might have helped them, I think we have to be very careful at NIH when we do these studies, and when we publish them, to explain what we've learned from this and what we haven't.  For me, as somebody who's particularly interested in personalized medicine, the fact that we are all different from each other at the DNA level, and that may have consequences for our response to therapies, one of the things I think we need to be closely paying attention to is not to lose track of that in the process of trying to make comparisons between treatments and decide what works best. Because what works best for me might actually not work best for you because we're not quite biologically the same.  I think there are ways to identify those things when they happen, but we ought to be careful not to neglect them.  FLATOW: Thank you, David. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to another call, Stephanie(ph) in Kansas City. Hi, Stephanie.  STEPHANIE (Caller): Hi there. How are you, Ira?  FLATOW: Fine, how are you?  STEPHANIE: Fine thanks. I wanted to extend a big thank you to Dr. Collins for his research on cystic fibrosis. I have a nine-year-old little boy named Henry that has CF, and Dr. Collins' lab - am I right in saying your lab was responsible for identifying and isolating the gene that causes CF in 1989?  Dr. COLLINS: That's correct, just about exactly 20 years ago, and how's Henry doing?  STEPHANIE: Right. Well, he's doing really well, and he is the third of five kids that I have, and we've got - we're very involved with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and we have a sibling advocacy group coming to Capitol Hill next month. My 12-year-old, Henry's older brother, is going to come with me, and we're going to try to meet the politicians and see what we can do.  My kids obviously - Henry's brothers and sisters - are very keyed in to what Henry has to do every day to stay healthy. And so we thank you for that research, and I wanted to find out, with regard to diseases like cystic fibrosis, some of the orphan diseases, what your plans are, what you see kind of as the future and some of the things that maybe we could even ask for when we come to Capitol Hill.  FLATOW: All right, thanks for calling, Stephanie.  Dr. COLLINS: So thanks for the question, Stephanie, because this is one of the areas, I think, of great excitement and one of the areas I'm personally most anxious to see pushed forward.  While diseases like cystic fibrosis are considered rare, there are more than 6,000 of them, and collectively, they effect 20 million people in the United States. So these are really important for us to pay attention to. And here again, we've arrived at a juncture in the last three or four years of being much more empowered to be able to take the fundamental information that's being learned about those diseases and move that into the development of new treatments.  The CF Foundation has, in many ways, led the way in showing how that can happen with the investments they've made, working with biotech companies and academic researchers, to come up with new drug-treatment approaches to this disease, which are showing great promise.  I'm the keynote speaker, in about a month, at the CF annual meeting in Minnesota. And just looking at the data that's going to be presented there, it really is exciting to see, after two years of a pretty tough slog, that really very exciting, new, therapeutic opportunities are emerging. And we can do that, I think now, increasingly with partnerships between academic investigators who are now better empowered to get involved in therapeutic development than ever and working with the private sector, tackle a long list of rare diseases and neglected diseases of the developing world, and increasingly moving those into the common diseases as well.  There's a new program at NIH called Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases - T-R-N-D, trend - which is focused on this which I think is going to be one of the most exciting things that we should be watching in the next couple of years.  FLATOW: One of the most, I guess, talked about diseases is autism. Are you going to be spending more money on looking for the causes of autism? And also trying to tell the truth about what we know about autism versus what we keep hearing in the blogospheres all over the place?  Dr. COLLINS: Well, obviously, there's great concern about this disease, and now a disease that afflicts about one in 150 kids - and clearly an indication that that is increasing. And the causes remain very frustrating to try to determine, and people have some strong opinions about this. Is this related to environment? Is it genetics?  One of the areas of strongest investment with these dollars that have arrived at NIH from the Recovery Act is autism. And we are going to learn a prodigious amount in the next couple of years about this, both by looking at potential environmental influences, looking at early interventions to try to see what works, and by looking at potential genetic causes. Because we are now at a point where instead of looking here and there in the genome, we can sequence the entire genomes of a large number of individuals with autism and try to see - is there something there that might explain this very puzzling disease.  FLATOW: What about the future of embryonic stem cell research at NIH?  Dr. COLLINS: Well, obviously, great opportunities have arrived  scientifically and also in terms of policy with the Obama signature of the executive order back in March that opens up the possibility of federally funded investigators being able to work with a larger number of human embryonic stem cell lines than before. In addition, from my view, one of the most exciting scientific developments in the last decade has been the realization that you could take a skin cell and talk it back into becoming a so-called pluripotent, these induced pluripotent stem cells that each of us potentially could have created for us if we needed them to replace things that aren't working in applications like diabetes or Parkinson's disease or spinal cord injury. All of those are areas of great promise, but at the present time uncertainty as far as how realistic that promise is. I want to see that pushed extremely vigorously in the coming years. And I think, scientifically, we have the chance and a lot of investigators interested in plunging in and pushing this forward.  FLATOW: Talking with NIH director Dr. Francis Collins on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. Lots of people, lots - asking lots of questions. So, let's see if we can get to a few more of them. Let's go to Jamestown, New York. John(ph), hi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  JOHN (Caller): Hey. Good afternoon. Honored to speak with you, gentlemen, today. I just can't believe it. My question is this. As far as nutrition goes, I joined a group four years ago called Life Extension Foundation - a big group of scientists, a big group of doctors that believe in mainstream medicine along with alternative medicine. I've often said to my friends in discussion that we can't possibly take control of the medical disaster that we have going on in this country as far as costs scopes unless we use integrated medicine. For instance, I take for my arteriosclerosis - I'm a self-employed carpenter. I have no insurance. I think President Obama's speech the other day was actually fantastic, just wonderful. Loved it.  FLATOW: All right. Let me get an answer because we're running out of time. Nutrition\u2026  JOHN: Here's the deal: I take a Pomegranate CocoaGold and a fat enzyme instead of expensive statin drugs, atenolol, which is clinically, human-study proven to clean my vascular system and heal my endothelium. How come we're not going quickly in that direction? Thank you.  FLATOW: You're welcome.  Dr. COLLINS: So, I think lots of people are interested in these alternative medicine approaches and how they can be integrated with what you'd call sort of more the mainstream medicine approaches. The NIH has a whole center devoted to this, the National Center for Complimentary and Alternative Medicine, which has, as its goal, to apply in a rigorous way tests of these alternative therapies to see what works.  I think that's the real question is what's the data? Do these particular interventions, be they traditional drugs or be they more alternative approaches, show benefit when you apply them rigorously - not just what you hope the answer to be, but let's find out what the answer really is. And in that regard, we're going to continue to push that effort as vigorously as we can and try to give the public the information they need to make decisions about what kinds of interventions they want to choose for themselves.  FLATOW: A quick question before the break from Laura Goynoyd(ph) in Second Life. Is DNA sequencing going to become a standard part of tumor treatment -I'll just add, other kinds of treatments? How important will it be to get your DNA sequence to know what's going to work for you?  Dr. COLLINS: Oh, I think it's going to be the mainstream of medicine in another five or six years when the cost of sequencing your genome drops to $1,000 or less, it's going to be very compelling to do that. If you're interested, get that information in your medical record in a carefully controlled way so that it's private. And then, when your care provider needs to know something quickly about whether you're about to get a drug that's going to make you better or cause a side effect, that information will be there.  And for cancer, I think as soon as we can afford it every tumor ought to have its complete DNA analyzed because that's going to tell you what's the right choice of drugs for that tumor that will be smart bombs instead of the carpet bombing approach which doesn't always work as well as we want it to.  FLATOW: And then, a digitized computer database will save us money.  Dr. COLLINS: Oh, absolutely. Because if you want to know your genome sequence for a whole host of reasons for the next 20 years, it's better to just do it once, get it digitized, and have it there instantly when you need it. It's not going to change if you're talking about your inherited DNA sequence.  FLATOW: Okay. Can you picture a day when you'll carry a little thumb drive around with you\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: \u2026with your sequence in it?  Mr. COLLINS: Oh, probably something much smaller than that. But, yeah, I'm sure this kind of information is going to be very much something we all value. It's who - at a certain level of digitized information, it's who we are.  FLATOW: All right. We're going to take a break, and I'm going to hold over. Dr. Collins, if you'll stay with us a little bit longer\u2026  Dr. COLLINS: Sure.  FLATOW: \u2026and take some more of your questions. Our number: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Talking with Dr. Francis Collins, new head of NIH. Also, we're twittering, @scifri. And as you can see, folks are gathering at Second Life, asking their questions, so we'll be right back after this break. Stay with us.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking with Dr. Francis Collins, new director of the National Institutes of Health. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Carl(ph) in Chicago. Hi, Carl.  CARL (Caller): Hi. This is Dr. Carl Boccelano(ph).  FLATOW: Go ahead.  CARL: I want to let you know that I was a medical student at the University of Michigan for 1991 and 1995 and had the wonderful opportunity to have Dr. Collins give us lectures - introductory lectures as a first year medical student. And I was just - I heard the news that he was the - became the director of NIH and was very, very about that. He was able to do high-level research and yet give very introductory lectures to students in a way that kept us interested and often drew in a lot of humor between him and his co-investigators, which we always enjoyed. I was also present for one of his talks, how he, sort of, reconciled his religious beliefs and his research in medicine. And being a Catholic, I was very impressed with his thought process. And we're sad to see him go to Boston after the University of Michigan, but knew he was moving out to bigger and better things. And, once again, as an OBGYN, I talk to patients every day about cystic fibrosis strain and just want to thank him of all of his work.  FLATOW: Thank you, Carl.  Dr. COLLINS: Thanks, Carl. That's wonderful.  FLATOW: Let me see if I can get one quick call in here before we have to go because we're running out of time. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Iggy(ph) in Kansas City. Hi, Iggy. Quickly.  IGGY (Caller): Oh, hey, Dr. Collins. I have a quick question. You know, you're an evangelical Christian, my understanding, so you probably adhere to the statement: faith is belief in things not seen. So my question to you is how can you have this approach to basically fighting these dreadful diseases that had been bestowed on us by your God? Either he created these dreadful diseases and they were good or these diseases developed after the fall of man. So I'm just kind of curious to know how you can reconcile this mythological approach in rational investigation, if you wouldn't mind.  FLATOW: Thank you, Iggy.  Dr. COLLINS: Well, that's a question that's difficult to answer in a soundbite. That's one of the questions I think believers and non-believers have struggled with down through the centuries. What is the source of evil? What is the cause of human suffering? I did write about that in this book called \"The Language of God\" that was referred to in the introduction and I'd certainly refer the caller to that. But, basically, I think one argument that's been put forward is that the way in which the earth came into being and the way we came in to be creates certain possibilities of things going wrong. And if you want to have life, you also need to have life change and sometimes that means it changes in ways that causes illness. And, of course, a lot of the illness that we see around us are things we do to ourselves. If we are in bad shape because of bad choices we have made, I don't know that we should blame external forces for that. At the same time, when you see a child with cancer, you have to wonder, now, wait a minute. What's going on here?  I think there are answers to those questions. They're not easy answers. They are answers that I don't think anybody should feel complacent about, but I think they can be explored from a spiritual perspective in a way that actually increases your interest in the possibility of God rather than discounting it.  FLATOW: Dr. Collins, I want to thank you for taking time to be with us today. We've ran out of time.  Dr. COLLINS: It's a pleasure to be with you anytime, Ira.  FLATOW: Always pleasure to have you back.

I'm Steve Inskeep. For more than 50 years, scientists who study the brain have been misled by a squid. Generations of researchers have been working under a false assumption about how our brains use energy. Now, an international team has set the record straight. NPR's Jon Hamilton has the story. JON HAMILTON: Scientists still use data from squid when the estimate how much energy is consumed by brain cells in people. Squid are easy to study because their brains send some messages along nerve fibers that are so big you can see them with the naked eye. The enormous never fibers, called giant axons, have made squid the stars of educations films like this one from the 1970s. (Soundbite of film) Unidentified Man: This giant axons are about to play a vital role in the squid's life. They not only ensure that the escape response is as fast as possible, but also that all parts of the mantle contract simultaneously, an essential requirement for efficient jet propulsion. HAMILTON: Early experiments on squid axons showed that it took a lot of energy for a nerve cell to send out a message, and most scientists have assumed this was true in people, too. But a researcher named Henrik Alle didn't buy that. Mr. HENRIK ALLE (Researcher, Max-Planck Institute): I just accidentally stumbled over this issue when I was preparing tutorials for students. HAMILTON: Alle is from the Max-Planck Institute in Frankfurt. Mr. ALLE: I saw this old work. I thought, I cannot believe personally that nature would waste such energy. HAMILTON: Alle figured that nature would've made the process more efficient in mammals, whose brains send a huge number of messages. So he led a team that measured precisely how much energy was consumed by the axons in rats. And the team reports in the journal Science, that rat axons used only a third as much energy as squid axons. That probably means humans are equally efficient. But does and of that really matter? Pierre Magistretti, from the Brain Mind Institute in Lausanne, Switzerland, says it does. One reason, he says, has to do with the increasing use of fMRI and PET scans, which show the brain at work. Mr. PIERRE MAGISTRETTI (Brain Mind Institute): What you see with an fMRI or a PET scan is the amount of energy that a given brain region is consuming to carry out a certain function. HAMILTON: To fully understand what those scans mean, you have to know precisely where the energy is going. The squid model assumes most of the energy for brain communication is consumed by the brain cell sending a message. But the new research suggests that the real energy drain occurs somewhere else \u2014 probably where the message gets transferred to another cell. And Magistretti says that can be a long way from the place where the message originated. Mr. MAGISTRETTI: Imagine if you take a neuron that is in the spinal cord and controls the contraction of your feet muscle, you can imagine that this axon will be almost one meter long. HAMILTON: That's unusual though. In the brain, the distance traveled by most messages is microscopic. As a result, the new finding doesn't affect the results of most fMRI studies. But Marcus Raichle, who does a lot of brain imaging at Washington University in St. Louis, says the new research has given him something to think about. Mr. MARCUS RAICHLE (Washington University): There is always this tendency, that if you're working in an area and your experiments are working well and you're getting good data and so forth, to not think of the larger context in which this is occurring. HAMILTON: Raichle says the study is also a reminder that although we know 20 percent of a human's energy goes to power the brain, we still have a lot to learn about the processes consuming all that energy.

I'm Guy Raz. British explorer Frank Smyth almost became the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest in 1933. He missed it by 1,000 feet, as he described it, at the very boundary of life and death. At 26,000 feet, climbers reach what they call the dead zone. There's not enough oxygen to keep humans alive, and during that expedition, almost all the other climbers never made it past the summit's base camp, but Frank Smyth carried on alone. In his diary, he recounted how at one point on the ascent, he reached into his pocket to pull out a slab of Kendal mint cake. He broke it in half and turned around to give the other half to a companion, but there was no one there. Here's what he wrote. Unidentified Man: (Reading) All the time that I was climbing alone, I had a strong feeling that I was accompanied by a second person. The feeling was so strong that it completely eliminated all loneliness I might otherwise have felt. RAZ: This is a phenomenon scientists call the third man factor. John Geiger spent five years tracking down the stories of people who've experienced it. His new book is called \"The Third Man Factor: Surviving the Impossible. \" And he joins us from Toronto. John Geiger, welcome to the program. Mr. JOHN GEIGER (Author, \"The Third Man Factor: Surviving the Impossible\"): It's great to be here, thank you. RAZ: First, can you give us a clear definition of what the third man phenomenon is? Mr. GEIGER: It's a sense of an unseen being, a presence that intervenes at critical moments, when people are under great stress or in life-and-death-type struggles, to provide companionship, a sense of help, aid, encouragement, just a generalized benevolent intervention from a seemingly outside source, a being that's not seen but is felt. RAZ: You trace the term third man factor to Ernest Shackleton's almost disastrous expedition in Antarctica that began in 1914. Mr. GEIGER: Yes. I mean, it's one of the great survival stories in history.  Shackleton and his men were trapped in the ice in the Weddell Sea and were forced to abandon their ship, Endurance, which was crushed by the ice. They dragged their small boats across rotting ice for many months, and some of the men became suicidal. It was just an absolutely horrific ordeal. They finally were able to launch those boats in the South Polar Sea, and they made it to Elephant Island. Most of the men remained behind, and Shackleton took a small party and crossed over hundreds of miles to South Georgia, which is a British possession in the South Atlantic, and there was a whaling station there. He reached the island in the midst of a hurricane, this absolutely horrific crossing. They then had to cross this mountain range, which was uncharted. And it was during that final part of this absolutely unbelievable escape from Antarctica that Shackleton and two other men each felt that there was actually fourth presence, that there was what Shackleton termed a divine companion, who accompanied them on that last leg of that journey, when they really were at the point of collapse. And later on, T. S. Eliot, the great, American poet, altered the number for some reason - poetic license - altered the number from four to three in \"The Wasteland,\" you know, probably the greatest poem of the 20th century. And in \"The Wasteland,\" so it becomes: Who is the third who walks beside you? So that's where the term the third man factor comes from. It's really originally Shackleton via T. S. Eliot. RAZ: You collected stories from mountain climbers, explorers, prisoners of war, and there's one story from a survivor from the World Trade Center on 9/11, Ron DiFrancesco. He was the last one to leave the south tower, I believe, before it collapsed. Can you tell us the story? Mr. GEIGER: Well, yeah, Ron was a money-market trader, and he was above, you know, working above the point of impact, you know, found himself, like many other people, trapped above that point. Initially, he tried to go down, but the stairwell he found himself in was blocked by debris, and there was a tremendous amount of smoke coming up. So he got to this landing just above the impact point, and people were collapsed on that landing, some of them apparently unconscious. Others were sobbing, had kind of given up, I guess, and Ron was there. And he suddenly felt an intervention. He felt there was someone else joined him on the landing. He heard a voice, which gave him very specific directions. You know, Ron, you can survive this. You know, you'll get out of this. You've got to keep going down. And he literally felt like he was led, and he was led towards the flames and towards the smoke and ended up fighting his way through debris, covering his head as best he could with his arms against the flames, and fought his way down and got through this after a few minutes and found himself in a lit stairwell. Everything appeared to, like, resume to normal below the impact point. And he carried on down and was able to get past some firefighters coming down, was able to get out just before the building or just as the building was collapsing. You know, he felt very strongly that an angel - he's a practicing Roman Catholic, and he felt that an angel had intervened to save his life. RAZ: And this idea of a guardian angel, is there a sort of a religious aspect to this phenomenon? Mr. GEIGER: Oh, yes. I mean, I think that really what we're talking about is the same thing. I think that the third man factor is a manifestation of what historically and for people of faith would be a guardian angel. So there are a number of places in the Bible, of course, where guardian angels make their appearance, and often they're in very similar situations to some of the, you know, harrowing survival stories that I include in the book. So clearly, there is a religious or spiritual explanation to this phenomenon. And you know, either this book, I think, is proof of the existence of guardian angels or, you know, if you're a religious person, or if you're not, I think it shows that the guardian angel experience is based on mental processes and that, in fact, many skeptics and non-believers have also had this experience, and they attribute it to other explanations. And there certainly is some very interesting science behind this, as well. RAZ: There is actually research being done, looking at this, that it may actually be a necessary human instinct, a survival instinct. Mr. GEIGER: It certainly is looking like that. There has been some very interesting work done in Switzerland by neurologists who, using electrical stimulus, have actually provoked a third-man-type response, at least a sense of a presence. And they removed the electrical stimulus, and the presence would disappear and then, you know, place it back, and suddenly the presence returned. But in that case, what was interesting is the patient didn't feel that it was a helpful or benevolent presence. It was simply there's someone here with me now, but no sort of sense that this person had any agenda to help, and that's what's interesting. That's a difference. And certainly, you know, no science has yet been able to explain how that kind of - that sense of presence. So there is a part of our brain that seems to be involved in our self-perception, where we are in our environment, may have a role in this. But it doesn't explain how that transforms into this absolutely compelling, benevolent, you know, force for survival, and that's the part of the puzzle that's critical, I think. RAZ: John Geiger's new book is called \"The Third Man Factor: Surviving the Impossible. \" John Geiger, thanks for being with us. Mr. GEIGER: Thank you very much.

There has been some very interesting work done in Switzerland by neurologists who, using electrical stimulus, have actually provoked a third-man-type response, at least a sense of a presence. And they removed the electrical stimulus, and the presence would disappear and then, you know, place it back, and suddenly the presence returned.  But in that case, what was interesting is the patient didn't feel that it was a helpful or benevolent presence. It was simply there's someone here with me now, but no sort of sense that this person had any agenda to help, and that's what's interesting.  That's a difference. And certainly, you know, no science has yet been able to explain how that kind of - that sense of presence. So there is a part of our brain that seems to be involved in our self-perception, where we are in our environment, may have a role in this. But it doesn't explain how that transforms into this absolutely compelling, benevolent, you know, force for survival, and that's the part of the puzzle that's critical, I think.  RAZ: John Geiger's new book is called \"The Third Man Factor: Surviving the Impossible. \" John Geiger, thanks for being with us.  Mr. GEIGER: Thank you very much.

I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, host: And I'm Melissa Block. From antelope meat to crocodile boots, the illegal trade in wildlife products is a multibillion dollar business. It's a difficult trade to stop, in part, because authorities often can't tell whether a frozen hunk of meat or a skin comes from a protected animal or not. But as NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, there's a technology that could give wildlife investigators a new tool to identify what kind of animal a product came from, even from a single scale or feather. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: The key to this whole idea is DNA, DNA from animals and insects. It's stored here. This is the real bowels of the museum, isn't it? Dr. GEORGE AMATO (Evolutionary Biologist, American Museum of Natural History): It really is. You can sort of follow the pipes and wires and ducts and everything\u2026 JOYCE: George Amato is an evolutionary biologist, and he works at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. It's 19th century, a gigantic stone castle of a building. We're somewhere deep in the basement. Amato is going to show me something called the Barcode of Life Data System. The system's guts, if you will, is a storehouse of frozen animal tissue. Dr. AMATO: Everything from microbes to whales. JOYCE: In a locked room stands seven steel canisters. They look like six-foot-tall thermoses. Ms. JULIE FEINSTEIN (Collections Manager, American Museum of Natural History): And we have about 70,000 samples right now. We have a continuous influx. JOYCE: Julie Feinstein keeps everything inside those thermoses cooled with liquid nitrogen. Scientists from around the world have been sending samples here for years, from rainforests in Costa Rica or museum drawers in Chicago. Amato opens one canister to see inside. Dr. AMATO: We'll make sure that you don't either freeze your nose or your hands to the side of the vat, so\u2026 JOYCE: Each holds boxes of tiny vials, bits of butterfly wings, whale blubber, you name it. They're analyzing them to build up a reference library of DNA from different species. Dr. AMATO: We get DNA from feathers. They could be blood samples, skin samples, or for smaller organisms, we might have the whole organism. JOYCE: What Amato and his colleagues want to do now is use bits of this DNA library to curb trade in endangered wildlife. Here's how it would work: Let's say you're a customs agent who's found a hunk of meat in a suitcase. You don't know if it's a duiker antelope or hamburger. So you send a bit of it to Amato. What Amato has identified is a particular sequence of DNA in every animal that seems to be unique to every species. He calls it a DNA barcode. So a duiker antelope has a barcode that's different from other antelopes, or cows for that matter. Amato compares the DNA from the customs agent to the DNA in his library and knows right away if the meat is legal. A lot of the trade that wildlife authorities want to stop is in bush meat. It can be anything from antelope to monkey. Biologist Mitch Eaton at the U. S. Geological Survey has documented the trade in the forests of Central Africa. Mr. MITCH EATON (Biologist, United States Geological Survey): These regions are becoming more and more global. It's not just local hunting that's happening any more. The increase in pressure on these forests for economic and commercial purposes is growing very quickly. JOYCE: Eaton says wildlife investigators need a tool to figure out what's okay for local consumption and what's prohibited for trading across international borders, whether it's meat or refined products like skins. Mr. EATON: If these things are being transported as refined products or pieces of wildlife and they have no ability to tell what species it actually is, they would be able to use this technology and it takes all the guesswork out, really. Dr. AMATO: These are leather products that were confiscated by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and sent to us. JOYCE: In the DNA lab at the Natural History Museum in New York, Amato pulls down a box of handbags, briefcases, shoes. The federal Fish and Wildlife Service provided them so Amato could test his barcode technology. Because the leather goods have been processed or preserved in some way, it's hard to get clean DNA, but the barcoding still works some of the time. Dr. AMATO: This pair of boots, you can see where we've removed one of the scales to do the isolation. These boots, I think, we looked online and they sold for $4,000 a pair. I think they were supposed to be made out of Nile crocodile. I'll have to see, yeah. JOYCE: Amato's team has just described its barcode technique in the journal Conservation Genetics. Amato says they've already identified illegal imports of whale, dolphin meat and even smoked monkey. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, host: And I'm Melissa Block. Scientists say they have conducted the biggest survey ever in U. S. rivers and streams of gender-bending in fish. They found that a large percentage of male bass have acquired feminine characteristics. NPR's Christopher Joyce explains. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: Jo Ellen Hinck of the U. S. Geological Survey spent nine years catching fish to see if there was anything strange about their gender. Gender changes in male fish are not new, but its cause has puzzled scientists. Ms. JO ELLEN HINCK (Biologist, United States Geological Survey): Many of the other studies have been isolated to specific drainages or geographic regions. So our work is really the first to show the widespread occurrence of intersex in fish across the United States. JOYCE: Intersex means a male fish having immature egg cells growing in its testes. Hinck's team tested fish from 111 different sites and found the problem was worst in large and smallmouth bass, a popular species for recreational fishing. Ms. HINCK: Thirty-three percent of the smallmouth bass that we examined across our whole study were found to have intersex, and 18 percent of male largemouth bass were found to have intersex. JOYCE: In regions of the southeast, 70 to 90 percent of the fish were found to be intersex. Only in Alaska's Yukon River were fish completely free of the condition. Hinck says her results, described in the journal Aquatic Toxicology, surprised her. Ms. HINCK: When we're up with the majority of fish showing this condition, we don't feel that that's normal, and we do need to answer those questions on what is the cause. JOYCE: And that's hard to nail down. Scientists have wondered whether it's something in nature, like changes in water temperature or acidity or something genetic about some kinds of fish. But experiments in laboratories point to a certain class of chemicals, especially a group loosely called estrogenic compounds. These mimic the behavior of natural sex hormones, estrogens, in the body. Ms. HINCK: Pharmaceuticals have been implicated, other personal care products, compounds that are released from wastewater treatment plants or agricultural runoff, urban runoff. JOYCE: Chemicals in birth control pills, for example, are suspects as well as an ingredient in plastics. David Norris is an endocrinologist at the University of Colorado who's been looking back in time to see when all this started. Dr. DAVID NORRIS (Endocrinology, University of Colorado): We have an analysis of museum specimens from 50 and 100 years ago. And if you examine them, we find that there's no evidence of any intersex. JOYCE: Norris says there's some evidence that this gender-bending may hamper the ability of fish to reproduce, but there's no evidence that these fish are unsafe to eat. As for humans, he says that in the quantities measured in waterways, these chemicals apparently are not causing harm. Nonetheless, he says he'd like to see fewer of them in the environment. Mr. NORRIS: I think we have to consider reducing, as much as we can, the use of products that have these kinds of chemicals in them. JOYCE: That could be pretty difficult. Researchers keep turning up more of these sex-altering compounds. Paige Novak is an environmental engineer at the University of Minnesota. Professor PAIGE NOVAK (Environmental Engineering, University of Minnesota): In my opinion, there is not a cause. There are probably a lot of different causes in different areas. There are probably a huge number of chemicals, some of which we haven't even thought of yet, that could cause some of these problems. JOYCE: For example, Novak has just discovered that factories that make biodiesel fuel produce them. Ms. NOVAK: What we found is industries that process soy, they release large amounts of these compounds called phytoestrogens from plants. JOYCE: Laboratory studies show that plant estrogens have the same effects on fish that synthetic versions do. They even make fish less aggressive. Novak says that's no reason to limit biodiesel production. But like other scientists studying this phenomenon, she says these chemicals probably should be reduced in waterways.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Here's a puzzle for you. What do sardine populations, Wall Street and Antarctica have in common? Well, the answer is, they can all reach a critical moment \u2014 a tipping point \u2014 and change dramatically and unexpectedly. Fish populations can crash. Markets obviously can, too. And Antarctic ice shelves can melt with little warning. Those sudden changes have an enormous impact. So, it would be great to know about them before they happen. As NPR's Richard Harris reports, some scientists believe that tipping points might be predictable. RICHARD HARRIS: At first blush, a financial market and a melting ice shelf may seem to be so utterly different that there's nothing to learn about one, if you study the other. But look a little more closely and there are deep patterns. Ice can stay stable for long periods of time, but with the right trigger, it can melt down rapidly. And George Sugihara at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography says, we all know that financial markets can do the same. Professor GEORGE SUGIHARA (Biological Oceanography, Scripps Institution of Oceanography): What really sort of captures my imagination about all of this is the fact that you get similar kinds of behavior across many different kinds of systems. HARRIS: Sugihara, like colleagues around the world, has been trying to describe mathematically how tipping points occur. And he's not just interested in what a system looks like as it goes over a catastrophic tipping point. He's interested in what happens right before that moment. Prof. SUGIHARA: What's intriguing is that a lot of these things have similar precursors, or similar early signals. HARRIS: For example, in certain kinds of systems, there's an eerie quiet \u2014 the calm before the storm. Other systems behave differently. Financial markets start behaving erratically right before they reach a tipping point, he says. Prof. SUGIHARA: There are a number of papers citing an increase in volatility just prior to a large systemic event, although there's some evidence to the contrary also. HARRIS: The challenge is to look at a system that still seems to be stable and tell whether it's running headlong toward a tipping point. Sugihara is optimistic about our ability to predict that. He was among the authors of a recent report in the journal Nature that explores that possibility. And the stakes are huge. Think of possible tipping points in the global climate. A catastrophic change in Greenland ice-melting could rapidly raise sea level. A dramatic shift in rainfall patterns could plunge areas into perennial drought. Ocean circulation shifts could actually make Europe get chilly. Professor JONATHAN OVERPECK (Atmospheric Sciences, University of Arizona): These things all would make the impacts of climate change much worse if they were to occur. HARRIS: That's Jonathan Overpeck at the University of Arizona. Prof. OVERPECK: So it would be wonderful if we could see them coming. HARRIS: Overpeck says, for example, water resource managers can plan ahead if they can tell the difference between a temporary drought and a permanent new climate regime. But advance knowledge can only help so much. Say, rainfall shifted away from the Amazon rain forest, as some scientists project. The result would be that one of the most lush, diverse and productive ecosystems on Earth could turn into grassland. Prof. OVERPECK: That could occur very quickly, in the matter of just, you know, years to decades. HARRIS: If you could see that that was coming, would you still have time to do something about it? Prof. OVERPECK: Well, probably not. (Soundbite of laughter) HARRIS: And that's just one of the drawbacks about predicting ecological tipping points. Another is that it is really hard to do. Rob Jackson at Duke University says scientists have been on this quest for many decades. Professor ROB JACKSON (Biology, Duke University): Our track record in predicting tipping points, however, is weak. We missed the ozone hole, we missed the rapid melting of the North Pole in the last few years. And we missed last year's stock market crash. So, I can't help but wonder, what will we miss this year. HARRIS: Fortunately, you don't need to predict a specific catastrophe to make use of tipping point math. George Sugihara from Scripps says, for example, even if you can't predict that a particular fishery is on the verge of collapse, we know more broadly that laws that regulate fishing are pushing fish populations too close to their tipping points. And that's flirting with disaster. Prof. SUGIHARA: Fishing up to the tipping point is a really bad idea. You want to fish well below the tipping point. HARRIS: So, he says we should revisit the laws that put these fisheries at risk. Sugihara says we also need better data for all systems that are in jeopardy. Unfortunately, in some cases information is getting worse. For example, we're losing climate-monitoring satellites faster than they're being replaced. And even the financial world has paid little attention to systemic tipping points, Sugihara says. Prof. SUGIHARA: There's very little being thrown at this problem in any intelligent way. To me that's a total mystery. HARRIS: He's hoping this quiet field of research will reach its own tipping point, and finally get the attention it needs. Richard Harris, NPR News.

NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: NASA is getting ready to issue a call for proposals for what it calls its discovery class mission - relatively low cost exploration projects. Ms. ELLEN STOFAN (Planetary Geologist): They'll get all kinds of proposals to go all over the solar system - to comets, to asteroids, to the moon, to Venus. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Have you heard that anyone else is proposing a boat mission to another world? Ms. STOFAN: Not that we know of. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Ellen Stofan heads up the team with the boat proposal. I met her at her home in Virginia. She's a planetary geologist who works for a company called Proxemy Research. She says in the past space exploration has been done with spaceships that orbit planets or fly by them, or probes that land on a planet's surface and maybe drive around. So this new idea, floating in an extraterrestrial sea, has got people talking. Dr. STOFAN: You know, the overwhelming reaction I get from scientists and engineers is, oh, that's really cool. I mean, people are just instantly kind of excited and intrigued to say, could we really go do this? GREENFIELDBOYCE: The answer is yes, at least on a moon of Saturn, Titan. Besides Earth, Titan is the only place in our solar system known to have bodies of liquid on its surface. A few years ago, a spacecraft orbiting Saturn sent back radar images of the northern polar regions of Titan. The images showed evidence of hundreds of lakes, some of them pretty big. Dr. STOFAN: Think sort of the Black Sea on Earth, like Ontario, the Great Lakes. Some of them are actually that large. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That liquid isn't water, though. It's methane. On Earth, methane is a gas, but temperatures on Titan are super-super-cold, minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit. Stofan says when it's that cold, methane is a liquid, sort of like gasoline. Dr. STOFAN: And it turns out that oddly enough that methane acts just like water acts here on Earth. Methane forms clouds in the atmosphere. It rains down onto the surface and forms rivers, lakes and seas. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says imagine you were standing on one of Titan's seashores. Dr. STOFAN: The liquid that you would see would to you look like water. It would be fairly clear so the landscape wouldn't look all that alien except, of course, from the fact that there is no vegetation at those temperatures. And if you could see through the haze, you might see Saturn hanging off up in the sky, which would be quite a sight to see. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Okay, so now picture a boat floating on that weird lake. This boat is not going to look like the Mayflower. Dr. STOFAN: It's certainly not going to look like what most people conceive of a boat looking like. It'll look more like a little capsule that floats. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Sort of like the bell-shaped capsules that the Apollo astronauts came home in. The vessel will have a mast\u2026 Dr. STOFAN: But that's just to hold a camera. We won't have a sail. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But the wind would still push this craft around the lake. The probe could drift for months and months. It would have a small, nuclear-powered engine and it could shout its data directly back to Earth. Stofan says there's no danger of a shipwreck, because Titan's lakes have waves, but probably just gentle ones \u2014 unless there's a storm. Still, even that doesn't worry her. Ms. STOFAN: In fact, we'd love for that to happen. Imagine, again, to be able to return an image showing a rainy day on Titan and to see those methane raindrops falling down into the lake, and the wind might kick up a little, but nothing as violent as sort of the tropical storms and hurricanes we get here on Earth. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says eventually the ship might just run aground in a muddy beach and get stuck. Stofan says all of this is technically doable. They could launch around 2016 and be sailing on Titan around 2022, if they win the competition to get funding from NASA. Her team is busy working up their proposal. She is supposed to go on vacation next week, but she doubts it will be a totally relaxing. After all, she's going sailing with friends in Thailand. Ms. STOFAN: Every time we turn the sailboat or anchor, I'm going to be thinking about our probe. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And what it would be like to be sailing instead on Titan.

Scientists have used gene therapy to achieve full color vision in two monkeys that were born unable to tell red from green. NPR's Jon Hamilton has more. JON HAMILTON: The monkeys are male squirrel monkeys named Sam and Dalton. Jay Neitz, a researcher at the University of Washington, says female squirrel monkeys can see the full range of colors, but males, like Sam and Dalton, can't. Professor JAY NEITZ (Ophthalmology, University of Washington): For these monkeys, there's only two colors, blue and yellow. And if you mix blue and yellow to them, you just get a gray color. HAMILTON: That's because male squirrel monkeys are born without a receptor in their eyes that would let them see red and green. Neitz was part of a team that thought if they could get these monkeys to see the full spectrum, it might make it possible to do the same thing in people who are colorblind. The team developed a gene therapy technique that would reprogram some of the color receptors in the monkeys' eyes. But Neitz knew that even if the therapy worked, there was no guarantee the monkeys' new eyes would be able to communicate with their old brains. Prof. NEITZ: I went out and asked all my neuroscientist friends: If I do this in an adult monkey, will this give them color vision? And everyone said, absolutely not. Because just think about it, that you don't have any of the wires to carry the information. You don't have any of the circuitry to interpret it properly. HAMILTON: Neitz and his team tried the experiment anyway. Dalton, named after the British scientist who originally described colorblindness, got treated first. For several months, there was no change. Every day, Dalton tried to win a juice reward by touching a red or green target on a computer screen. And every day, he failed. Neitz was anxious but not surprised. Previous experiments had shown that it took about five months to reprogram a critical mass of receptor cells. Then, just about five months after his gene therapy, Dalton started hitting the target every time. Prof. NEITZ: At first we told ourselves, you know, maybe he's just guessing really well today or something. But over a few days, it became very clear that he wasn't just guessing. That floored us. HAMILTON: Later on, the other squirrel monkey, Sam, would have a similar epiphany. Neitz says both monkeys have seemed pretty pleased with themselves ever since. Prof. NEITZ: It's just like a kid that goes in, and they don't want to get wrong answers on a test. The monkeys kind of act that way. And they're very happy to be straight-A students now. HAMILTON: Scientists who study color vision are calling the story of Sam and Dalton dazzling and surprising. Gerry Jacobs, from the University of California, Santa Barbara, says it's remarkable that the technique worked at all on an adult animal. Earlier research had shown that after childhood, the brain loses much of its ability to adapt to new types of visual information. But Jacobs says color seems to be different. The adult brains of even colorblind monkeys and humans appear ready to receive new color input. Professor GERALD JACOBS (University of California, Santa Barbara): The primate is really almost an ideal place to have this happen, because they have a pathway through the retina, which in most primates is almost designed to extract color information. HAMILTON: Robert Shapley, of New York University, says what amazed him was how quickly the monkeys' brains responded once the reprogrammed cells began working. Professor ROBERT SHAPLEY (New York University): As soon as that happened, the animals were able to start doing color discrimination. I mean, it was almost no delay. That was really striking. HAMILTON: Shapley says that bodes well for people with colorblindness. Prof. SHAPLEY: There's no reason to think that these monkeys and humans are dramatically different in the way that they are interpreting color signals from the eye. HAMILTON: And researchers say gene therapy might eventually offer a way to treat a range of vision problems. The new research appears in the journal Nature. Jon Hamilton, NPR News.

It involves the construction of mobile floodgates aimed at safeguarding one of the world's most endangered cities. But some scientists say the project may not be enough to protect Venice from rising sea levels caused by climate change. NPR's Sylvia Poggioli has this report. (Soundbite of water splashing) SYLVIA POGGIOLI: Venice rose from mudflats in the middle of a lagoon which forms the largest wetland in the Mediterranean. The island city has been subject to increasing flooding due to sinking land, but also to rising sea levels. It's known as aqua alta - high water - which brings city life to a standstill for several hours. Big boats can't go under low-hanging bridges and water seeps into buildings through the sewage system. Venetians have not lived on the ground floor for decades. Sophisticated technology is now being used for what has become a full-scale emergency. (Soundbite of banging) POGGIOLI: At one of the three inlets that lead from the sea into the lagoon, a massive mechanical hammer is driving the steel and concrete piling into the lagoon bed. Elena Zambardi works for the consortium Safeguarding Venice. She says the use of pilings was invented by the visionaries who founded the city 1,300 years ago. Ms. ELENA ZAMBARDI (Safeguarding Venice): (Through translator) In Venice, for example, under the Salute Church and the Rialto Bridge, there are piles, wooden piles to consolidate the subsoil. POGGIOLI: The project acronym is MOSE, which is also the Italian word for Moses, recalling the biblical parting of the sea. Once completed in 2014, there will be 78 large, mobile floodgates at the three inlets. When not in use, they'll lay below water on the lagoon bed. When a high tide is forecast, Zambardi says, the gates will rise and shut off the sea from the lagoon. Ms. ZAMBARDI: (Through translator) And MOSE will defend Venice if the sea level rises up to 60 centimeters. POGGIOLI: But the project, which is 54 percent completed, has been hounded by controversy and, critics say, may already be outdated. The IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has forecast a sea level rise by the end of this century of between 18 and 59 centimeters. But scientists caution it could be even higher. Marine scientist Laura Carbognin has been studying the Venetian Lagoon for decades. Like many scientists, she fears the rising sea levels could mean the floodgates will be closed often and for long periods. That would upset the vital exchange between the sea and the lagoon, suffocating its delicate ecosystem. Carbognin co-authored a report that suggests another radical solution. Dr. LAURA CARBOGNIN (Marine Scientist): To complement the Moses solution, it is necessary that all the city is uplifted. POGGIOLI: She says research already suggests the feasibility of raising Venice. Dr. CARBOGNIN: Based on hydrological and geochemical data, the preliminary simulation shows that fluid injection into deep formation can uniformly raise Venice up to 30 centimeters over 10 years. POGGIOLI: Carbognin hypothesizes injections of salt water or even carbon dioxide at a depth of 600 to 800 meters below the lagoon, but she concedes much more research is needed. That would mean huge investments at a time when delays in state funding for the $6 billion plus Moses have already substantially delayed the project's completion. Sylvia Poggioli, NPR News.

I'm Robert Siegel. MADELEINE BRAND, host: And I'm Madeleine Brand. Remember when the scariest environmental villains were chemicals destroying the Ozone layer? Well, back in 1987, the most effective environmental treaty ever was passed and it eliminated that problem. But as NPR's Richard Harris reports, it may have created a new problem. RICHARD HARRIS: In the basement of the Hart Senate office building on Capitol Hill, a thirsty sapper feeds a few coins into one of the many soda machines. (Soundbite of soda machine) HARRIS: As it happens, machines like this, along with refrigerators and air conditioners, use gases called HFCs as coolants. HFCs are nonflammable and they don't hurt the Ozone. But Kert Davies at Greenpeace says when it comes to global warming, they're not so good. Mr. KERT DAVIES (Research Director, Greenpeace): These gases are tremendously powerful greenhouse gases. We call them the super greenhouse gases. They are the global warming threat that no one's really heard about. HARRIS: Molecule for molecule, they are hundreds of times better at trapping heat in the atmosphere than the most important greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. HFCs were invented as a replacement for refrigerants like CFCs, which were destroying ozone. The good news is, at the moment, HFCs are only responsible for a few percent of human-induced global warming. Samuel LaBudde from a small nonprofit called The Environmental Investigation Agency says, the bad news is global production is poised to take off to satisfy the world's growing desire for fridges and air conditioners. Mr. SAMUEL LABUDDE (Campaign Director, Environmental Investigation Agency): Right now, what's happening is that China and India are beginning to invest very, very heavily in HFC production. HARRIS: LaBudde's group started out investigating the illegal trade of banned Ozone-destroying chemicals. But they quickly realized that the perfectly legal trade in HFCs could do far more damage if the industry grows as fast as is now projected. Mr. LABUDDE: So much so that by 2050, the global warming effects of HFCs will be sufficient to cancel out all the reductions in CO2 that we're looking at getting under the Untied Nations Copenhagen Climate Talks Agreement, and things of that nature. HARRIS: Environmental groups have been trying to do something about HFCs for well over a decade. Finally, there's progress. Two small countries have proposed phasing out the chemicals by amending the treaty that protects our Ozone layer, the 1987 Montreal Protocol. Last week, the United States, Canada and Mexico agreed to support a treaty amendment that wouldn't ban HFCs entirely, but that would dramatically reduce their production. Of course, that means the air conditioning and refrigeration industries have to find something else to use. That brings us back to the soda machines in the Senate office building. (Soundbite of soda machine) HARRIS: Kert Davies from Greenpeace feeds a couple of dollar bills into a Pepsi machine. Mr. DAVIES: Bit of a robot machine, isn't it? I've never seen that before. Kind of picks it up and gives it to you. HARRIS: The robot is showy, but that's not the real point of this test machine. Mr. DAVIES: What's novel about this machine is that it's not like the old-fashioned vending machines or your refrigerator at home. The cooling is done with carbon dioxide. HARRIS: Which is a greenhouse gas, but these machines use so little that that's not an issue. The machine is not only free of HFCs, it also uses less electricity. Carbon dioxide doesn't work in refrigerators. But hydrocarbons, like propane and isobutane, do. In fact, they are in 100 million fridges worldwide. Problem solved? Mr. KARIM AMRANE (Vice President of Regulatory Policy and Research, Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute): Well, it's not as simple as it sounds. HARRIS: Karim Amrane is at the Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, a trade group. He says carbon dioxide may work in vending machines, but it would never work to run the huge air chillers in the hotel, where we meet, and neither would flammable chemicals like isobutane. Mr. AMRANE: Imagine if you had 1,000 pounds or more of isobutane in your chiller in this building, and something happened. I mean, the entire building probably will be wiped out. HARRIS: Even so, his industry knows that HFCs eventually have to go. So, they are now scrambling to find substitutes that will solve the current problem without creating yet another.

But they quickly realized that the perfectly legal trade in HFCs could do far more damage if the industry grows as fast as is now projected.  Mr. LABUDDE: So much so that by 2050, the global warming effects of HFCs will be sufficient to cancel out all the reductions in CO2 that we're looking at getting under the Untied Nations Copenhagen Climate Talks Agreement, and things of that nature.  HARRIS: Environmental groups have been trying to do something about HFCs for well over a decade. Finally, there's progress. Two small countries have proposed phasing out the chemicals by amending the treaty that protects our Ozone layer, the 1987 Montreal Protocol.  Last week, the United States, Canada and Mexico agreed to support a treaty amendment that wouldn't ban HFCs entirely, but that would dramatically reduce their production. Of course, that means the air conditioning and refrigeration industries have to find something else to use. That brings us back to the soda machines in the Senate office building.  (Soundbite of soda machine)  HARRIS: Kert Davies from Greenpeace feeds a couple of dollar bills into a Pepsi machine.  Mr. DAVIES: Bit of a robot machine, isn't it? I've never seen that before. Kind of picks it up and gives it to you.  HARRIS: The robot is showy, but that's not the real point of this test machine.  Mr. DAVIES: What's novel about this machine is that it's not like the old-fashioned vending machines or your refrigerator at home. The cooling is done with carbon dioxide.  HARRIS: Which is a greenhouse gas, but these machines use so little that that's not an issue. The machine is not only free of HFCs, it also uses less electricity. Carbon dioxide doesn't work in refrigerators. But hydrocarbons, like propane and isobutane, do. In fact, they are in 100 million fridges worldwide. Problem solved?  Mr. KARIM AMRANE (Vice President of Regulatory Policy and Research, Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute): Well, it's not as simple as it sounds.  HARRIS: Karim Amrane is at the Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, a trade group. He says carbon dioxide may work in vending machines, but it would never work to run the huge air chillers in the hotel, where we meet, and neither would flammable chemicals like isobutane.  Mr. AMRANE: Imagine if you had 1,000 pounds or more of isobutane in your chiller in this building, and something happened. I mean, the entire building probably will be wiped out.  HARRIS: Even so, his industry knows that HFCs eventually have to go. So, they are now scrambling to find substitutes that will solve the current problem without creating yet another.

Natural gas is cleaner than other fossil fuels and it's produced in the USA. This week, we're going to take a look at the role of natural gas in our energy future. NPR's Tom Gjelten is helping us. He's in the studios. Tom, good morning. TOM GJELTEN: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: Okay. Many people already use natural gas to heat our homes. What are the possibilities of doing something else with it? GJELTEN: Well, for a long time gas was not taken all that seriously. I mean, it was a nice fuel but the view was that there just wasn't enough of it to really get excited about it, and that's what changed. It now looks like we have way more natural gas in this country than we'd thought we did. This could change the whole energy picture. It's the idea that there is more supply of natural gas than we thought. INSKEEP: Were there new discoveries? GJELTEN: No. What we're talking about is actually gas that we've known has been there all along, but it's embedded in rock, shale rock, a mile below the surface of the earth. And until just a few years ago, it didn't seem practical to get the gas out of the rock. So, when we tallied gas reserves in the country, we didn't even bother to count the gas that's in that shale rock. And what's changed is that gas producers - and this is fairly recent development - gas producers have figured out how to get the gas out of the rock, and as a result there's this gas rush all over the country. Like this place I went to in Pennsylvania. Turns out there is a lot of natural gas under the farmland there. I found this gas man named Ray Walker, who's moved up to Pennsylvania from Texas a couple years ago to drill new gas wells. He's been in the gas business for about 20 years, but you get Ray talking about this shale gas, he can barely contain himself. Mr. RAY WALKER: It's the biggest deal I've ever even heard of. It's huge. GJELTEN: Mr. Walker's standing on a drilling rig about 160 feet tall. The rig serves as a giant brace for an eight-inch drill bit that's slowly turning, working its way deep down into the earth, down 6,000 feet to a layer of shale rock. (Soundbite of drilling rig) GJELTEN: The rock is part of what's called the Marcellus formation - 400 million years old, and stretching all the way from New York to West Virginia. It's where Ray Walker is finding gas. Mr. WALKER: If we were able to get a big enough chunk of Marcellus shale up to the surface and I could break it for you right here, you could strike a match to it and it would light for a little bit. GJELTEN: But he would have to break the shale, because the gas is embedded in the rock. It seeps out only where there's a crack. And the trick is to break that shale a mile underground. For that, Ray uses water. Mr. WALKER: So, if we put water in there and enough pressure, the rock has to break. And so as that rock breaks, things slip and shear and all those things start taking place. GJELTEN: And a little gas seeps out. It's called water fracturing. Ray Walker's company, Range Resources, uses it extensively, along with horizontal drilling. (Soundbite of drilling) GJELTEN: After this drill bit gets down 6,000 feet to the shale rock, an operator slowly turns the bit until it's drilling sideways through the shale. That way the pipe can penetrate more of the rock. It's this combination of water fracturing and horizontal drilling that's made it possible to produce shale gas. It's all new. Range Resources has only been in Pennsylvania for two years. Ray, a senior vice president, didn't learn these techniques back at Texas A&M in the 1980s. Mr. WALKER: What we used to think the way things worked is now all changed. The ability to produce these shale reservoirs is going to revolutionize this industry all over the world. GJELTEN: Shale gas may be the number one new energy story right now. In June, the Colorado School of Mines said the new ability to reach unconventional gas deposits means natural gas reserves in the U. S. are now 35 percent higher than they were estimated to be in 2007. Ian Cronshaw of the International Energy Agency says the production of gas in North America was heading downward as recently as two years ago. Mr. IAN CRONSHAW (International Energy Agency): Suddenly, since then we've seen this dramatic increase and now we've seen U. S. unconventional gas rise. GJELTEN: It's as if the United States were suddenly able to produce an extra million-and-a-half barrels of oil each day. Mr. CRONSHAW: That had happened in the oil industry, that would've been a headline item, but because it's in gas no one seems to pay any attention. GJELTEN: Nobody paying attention: an old lament of natural gas guys, like Robert Hefner. He's been in the business in Oklahoma for 50 years. All that time he's been claiming there's lots of natural gas in the United States. The big oil and coal companies just pooh-poohed him. Mr. ROBERT HEFNER: I once had to tell the Exxon people in front of a Congressional committee that I respectfully disagreed with every single thing they had presented. GJELTEN: But maybe now at the age of 74, Mr. Hefner has been vindicated. Mr. HEFNER: The nation now - I used to say awash in natural gas - now I say we're drowning in natural gas. GJELTEN: If Hefner is right, the implications are wide ranging. Timothy Worth, a former Colorado senator, who now heads the United Nations Foundation, says natural gas can finally challenge coal as America's top domestic energy source. Former Senator TIMOTHY WORTH (Colorado, United Nations Foundation): The coal industry has been arguing for years that we have to do everything we can to exploit this huge coal reserve. Well, the natural gas reserve is significantly larger. And what's important about it is that natural gas is much, much cleaner than coal. GJELTEN: When burned, natural gas produces half as much carbon dioxide as coal. Much of the nation's electrical power now generated by burning coal could instead come from natural gas. That would mean a significant decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. And then there are the national security considerations. Robert Hefner, the Oklahoma gas man, wants to see more American cars running on natural gas instead of the liquid kind that comes from oil. Mr. HEFNER: If we were to convert half of our existing vehicle fleet, retrofit them to natural gas, we would eliminate a little over half our oil imports. GJELTEN: There are still skeptics. If gas production is to be increased, it'll have to come from the shale deposits. The market price of natural gas has fallen sharply in recent months, and if it doesn't recover, gas companies may not be able to earn enough to justify the relatively high cost of shale rock operations. But many environmentalists see natural gas a fuel the nation can use during the transition to renewable energy sources. Christopher Flavin is president of the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental research group. Mr. CHRISTOPHER FLAVIN (President, Worldwatch Institute): Even the International Energy Agency is saying the path for oil is now downward, and suddenly we've got this very different picture for natural gas. I think it's unfortunately not fully percolated into the understanding of what's possible among policymakers. But I think that as that takes hold in the next few years, it's really going to change the game. GJELTEN: But the natural gas industry needs to be well organized if it's to make its case. In the energy world, bigness generally wins out. INSKEEP: NPR's Tom Gjelten is reporting on the possibilities of natural gas this week. And, Tom, is this industry not very big now? GJELTEN: The problem, Steve, is that the natural gas sector is actually big but it's characterized by very small independent companies. Most of them have just a few dozen employees. The question of how they can compete against big coal, big oil, is a very interesting one. I'm going to get into that tomorrow. INSKEEP: Okay. We'll be listening, thanks. NPR's Tom Gjelten.

I'm Steve Inskeep. LINDA WERTHEIMER, host: And I'm Linda Wertheimer. Today's United Nations meeting on climate change could be seen as a pep rally. The U. N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon wants to pump up enthusiasm for a climate treaty. It's supposed to be finished in December in Copenhagen, but it's in deep trouble. In a moment, we'll hear NPR's Juan Williams on the domestic politics of climate change. We start with NPR's Richard Harris. RICHARD HARRIS: Climate change is a hard problem. An effective treaty would eventually require the global economy to change directions entirely, with a shift away from fossil fuels and toward cleaner sources of energy. There's at least serious talk about starting that transition. The United States is a key player, and the House of Representatives passed a bill that is intended to move in that direction. But the issue is stalled in the Senate. Jason Grumet at the Bipartisan Policy Center says there are three main reasons for that. Mr. JASON GRUMET (Bipartisan Policy Center): The global recession, the extent to which the health care debate has now really crowded out all other political activity, and the deep mistrust that people in our Congress and across our country now have about market-based approaches to problem solving. HARRIS: The idea of creating vast new markets to buy and sell carbon emissions suddenly sounds like not such a great idea, since exotic markets in bundled mortgages nearly led to economic collapse a year ago. Grumet says given time, there are ways to solve these problems. Mr. GRUMET: The real challenge, though, is getting beyond the kind of vitriol that is now marking our larger political discussion, because if that remains, you know, I think we're going to find ourselves not making progress on any of the important issues facing the country. HARRIS: And time is running short. Congress needs to agree on a domestic climate policy before the Obama administration can negotiate a credible international deal. And it's looking like there simply won't be time to come up with a climate bill before December, when the next climate treaty is supposed to be negotiated in Copenhagen. Ms. KELLY SIMS GALLAGHER (Tufts University): But the U. S. isn't the only problem. HARRIS: Kelly Sims Gallagher at Tufts University says China is also an impediment. The Chinese government is demanding that the industrialized world make drastic cuts in its emissions before China agrees to reduce its own. Gallagher says this is not helpful. Ms. GALLAGHER: But we have to understand China's stance as a negotiating position right now. HARRIS: Countries often talk tough as a deadline approaches. She says time's up. The United States and China, which are by far the two biggest contributors to global warming, need to sit down together and start getting serious. Ms. GALLAGHER: If they don't start doing that this week, it's hard to imagine being able to have enough time to get through all of the contentious issues and come out of Copenhagen with an agreement. HARRIS: If you ask David Victor at the University of California, San Diego about the prospects of a deal by December. . . Mr. DAVID VICTOR (University of California San Diego): Well, they're looking pretty bad. HARRIS: The lack of U. S. domestic legislation is a big blow. So is the global economy. Rich countries don't have much money to offer the developing world, and money is what developing countries expect from these talks to help them cope with the consequences of climate change. So Victor is among a rising chorus of voices saying it's time to start thinking seriously about Plan B. Mr. VICTOR: I think what needs to happen between now and Copenhagen is the diplomats need to sift through this huge list of issues on which they can't agree and find the small list of items where they can agree and where if they fail to agree there's going to be a big harmful impact on climate diplomacy. HARRIS: For example, put in writing promises countries have already made so they don't back away from them. And don't expect to negotiate global emissions reduction targets. Mr. VICTOR: And then develop a very distinct game plan for the two or three years following the Copenhagen process. HARRIS: He says the worst-case scenario would be if nations lower their expectations for Copenhagen so much that nothing happens, yet everyone declares victory and goes home.

Today's United Nations meeting on climate change could be seen as a pep rally. The U. N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon wants to pump up enthusiasm for a climate treaty. It's supposed to be finished in December in Copenhagen, but it's in deep trouble. In a moment, we'll hear NPR's Juan Williams on the domestic politics of climate change. We start with NPR's Richard Harris.  RICHARD HARRIS: Climate change is a hard problem. An effective treaty would eventually require the global economy to change directions entirely, with a shift away from fossil fuels and toward cleaner sources of energy. There's at least serious talk about starting that transition.  The United States is a key player, and the House of Representatives passed a bill that is intended to move in that direction. But the issue is stalled in the Senate. Jason Grumet at the Bipartisan Policy Center says there are three main reasons for that.  Mr. JASON GRUMET (Bipartisan Policy Center): The global recession, the extent to which the health care debate has now really crowded out all other political activity, and the deep mistrust that people in our Congress and across our country now have about market-based approaches to problem solving.  HARRIS: The idea of creating vast new markets to buy and sell carbon emissions suddenly sounds like not such a great idea, since exotic markets in bundled mortgages nearly led to economic collapse a year ago. Grumet says given time, there are ways to solve these problems.  Mr. GRUMET: The real challenge, though, is getting beyond the kind of vitriol that is now marking our larger political discussion, because if that remains, you know, I think we're going to find ourselves not making progress on any of the important issues facing the country.  HARRIS: And time is running short. Congress needs to agree on a domestic climate policy before the Obama administration can negotiate a credible international deal. And it's looking like there simply won't be time to come up with a climate bill before December, when the next climate treaty is supposed to be negotiated in Copenhagen.  Ms. KELLY SIMS GALLAGHER (Tufts University): But the U. S. isn't the only problem.  HARRIS: Kelly Sims Gallagher at Tufts University says China is also an impediment. The Chinese government is demanding that the industrialized world make drastic cuts in its emissions before China agrees to reduce its own. Gallagher says this is not helpful.  Ms. GALLAGHER: But we have to understand China's stance as a negotiating position right now.  HARRIS: Countries often talk tough as a deadline approaches. She says time's up. The United States and China, which are by far the two biggest contributors to global warming, need to sit down together and start getting serious.  Ms. GALLAGHER: If they don't start doing that this week, it's hard to imagine being able to have enough time to get through all of the contentious issues and come out of Copenhagen with an agreement.  HARRIS: If you ask David Victor at the University of California, San Diego about the prospects of a deal by December. . .  Mr. DAVID VICTOR (University of California San Diego): Well, they're looking pretty bad.  HARRIS: The lack of U. S. domestic legislation is a big blow. So is the global economy. Rich countries don't have much money to offer the developing world, and money is what developing countries expect from these talks to help them cope with the consequences of climate change. So Victor is among a rising chorus of voices saying it's time to start thinking seriously about Plan B.  Mr. VICTOR: I think what needs to happen between now and Copenhagen is the diplomats need to sift through this huge list of issues on which they can't agree and find the small list of items where they can agree and where if they fail to agree there's going to be a big harmful impact on climate diplomacy.  HARRIS: For example, put in writing promises countries have already made so they don't back away from them. And don't expect to negotiate global emissions reduction targets.  Mr. VICTOR: And then develop a very distinct game plan for the two or three years following the Copenhagen process.  HARRIS: He says the worst-case scenario would be if nations lower their expectations for Copenhagen so much that nothing happens, yet everyone declares victory and goes home.

NASA has been working on new rockets and space capsules for a return by 2020. There's even talk of a lunar base. Those plans are all currently under review by the Obama administration. And at a press conference this afternoon, experts pointed out that the moon's surface still looks pretty dry despite these new findings. Jim Green is director of NASA's planetary science division.

Weavers in Madagascar spent four years making it using silk from more than a million spiders. It's 11 feet long by four feet wide. And as NPR's Christopher Joyce found out, there's nothing like it in the world. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: Yes, this is the same stuff spiders use to weave their webs, and of course, how it was made is intriguing. But it was hard just to tear your eyes away from this thing as it lay in a display case in the museum hallway. Mr. SIMON PEERS (Textile Maker): The color that you see here is the natural color of the silk. JOYCE: It is an extraordinary, radiant gold. Mr. PEERS: It is a radiant gold, exactly. It is an amazing color. JOYCE: That's Simon Peers, a textile maker who lives in Madagascar and has revived traditional forms of weaving there. Weaving spider silk is not traditional, a French missionary dreamed it up over a century ago but failed at it. The only known spider silk tapestry was shown in Paris in 1900, but then disappeared. Peers researched previous attempts. Then he teamed up with fashion expert Nicholas Godley to hire local weavers to try the near-impossible. They didn't think you were insane? Mr. NICHOLAS GODLEY (Fashion Expert): Well, they did think we were insane. And it was actually hard to find people who were willing to collect and work with spiders. I think most people are arachnophobes. I mean, I am, and they bite. JOYCE: Okay, so how do you do it? It takes a small machine, designed centuries ago, to hold the spider down. Mr. GODLEY: The spiders are harnessed before they're silked. JOYCE: Harnessed? Mr. GODLEY: Spiders are held down in a delicate way. You need people to do this who are very tactile so that the spiders are not harmed. So there's a chain of about 80 people who go out every morning at four o'clock, collect spiders, we get them in by 10 o'clock. They're in boxes, they're numbered. And then as they get silked, you know, about 20 minutes later, they get released back into nature. JOYCE: Peers picks up the thread of the story. Mr. PEERS: It's called dragline silk. So a spider can produce up to seven different types of silk. The dragline silk is what frames the web; it's the thicker silk on the outside. Also, it's extremely strong. The first panel we wove, we were quite stunned by the fact that it sounded a bit like guitar strings, pinging like metallic guitar strings. I mean, it is a very, very unusual material. JOYCE: A very careful person simply pulls the thread out of each spider and wraps it on a spindle. The main threads consist of 96 twisted silk lines. The brocaded patterns, stylized birds and flowers, are woven with threads of 960 spider silk lines. Mr. PEERS: I think everyone is as in awe and as bemused and perplexed as we are ourselves. To have it here now, looking at it in the museum, it is rather - I have to pinch myself, really. JOYCE: Peers says they never broke a single strand, yet the tapestry is as soft as cashmere. You can tell me the truth here. Did you ever wrap yourself in it? Mr. PEERS: No, I haven't dared do that. No, I've never wrapped myself in it, no. JOYCE: Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

While conservation groups support the idea of renewable energy, some local groups are concerned about putting industrial-scale solar projects on public land. NPR's Jeff Brady reports. JEFF BRADY: In the Southwest, the federal government is the largest landowner by far. In Nevada, the Feds own 85 percent of the state. The Southwest also is one of the regions in the world for producing energy from the sun. So it might seem like a no-brainer to put huge, new solar energy plants in the unpopulated desert. That is, unless you're Terry Weiner of the Desert Protective Council. Ms. TERRY WEINER (Desert Protective Council): It doesn't make any sense to slap up big industrial projects hundreds of miles from where the energy's going to be used and put these hideous transmission lines and string those for hundreds of miles. BRADY: The Department of the Interior has proposed allowing two dozen solar energy study areas on public land in states like California and Nevada and Arizona. These would be industrial facilities that would require huge amounts of land and scarce water to operate. And they wouldn't allow room for other uses on the land, such as recreation. Weiner says the U. S. should instead focus on rooftop solar panels in cities where the energy is used. She understands the climate change arguments for getting more of the country's energy from renewable sources, but Weiner says the desert is a fragile landscape that's home to endangered species. Ms. WEINER: You are destroying habitat and creatures to save the planet? BRADY: Around the Southwest, local groups like Weiner's have similar concerns, but national environmental groups have taken a slightly different point of view. They're also concerned about losing the benefits of undeveloped public land, but they're even more invested in reducing the effects of climate change. Alex Daue is with the Wilderness Society. Mr. ALEX DAUE (Wilderness Society): All of our energy has to come from somewhere. I would rather not see a single additional industrial development on the land, but if we don't develop renewables, we're just going to have more mountaintop coal mining removal or additional drilling in the Rockies. And we need solutions. BRADY: Lots of different solutions, says Daue. Rooftop solar panels alone aren't enough to supply the entire country's energy needs. Moreover, the solar industry argues that if you're going to replace big coal power plants, it's easier to do that with big solar power plants. Mr. RHONE RESCH (President and CEO, Solar Energy Industries Association): We are part of the solution, we're not part of the problem. BRADY: Rhone Resch heads the Solar Energy Industries Association, and he's a little frustrated by criticism from within the environmental community. After all, oil and gas companies lease vast tracts of public land to mine for fossil fuels that are a major contributor to climate change. Mr. RESCH: When you look at the oil and gas industry today, they have over 44. 5 million acres of public lands under lease. So, you're looking at maybe two percent of all the oil and gas lands that are currently leased are being evaluated and considered for solar. BRADY: In fact, it's even less than two percent. The Interior Department plans to set aside about 670,000 acres for the study areas. Certainly, that number could grow substantially in the future if the study areas are successful.

And then all of the sudden, the birds will appear and start displaying. (Soundbite of birds) Mr. VYN: So, what you have there is a group of males in full display. You hear the deep cooing sound of the greater prairie chickens inflating these air sacks in their necks. These brown and white chicken-like birds are shuffling forward. They'll pause in their steps, lunge their head forward, erect these feathers on their neck and reveal these big orange air sacks. (Soundbite of birds) Mr. VYN: The interaction between the males is really fascinating. They're constantly patrolling the perimeter of, you know, these territories they have on the lek. And they're getting into these really brutal fights where they'll fly at each other and somersault. (Soundbite of birds) Mr. VYN: These sounds are being made by the greater sage grouse. And they fan out this beautiful tail, these long pointy feathers. And as they display, they start swishing their wings over these stiff white breast feathers. And then they sort of, in this violent eruption, launch their chest forward. (Soundbite of birds) Mr. VYN: Sharp-tailed grouse, in their display, arc their wings outward and hunch their head forward, and then they run around sort of like wind-up toys pounding their feet on the ground. (Soundbite of birds) Mr. VYN: All of these species have undergone drastic population declines. You really do get that feeling when you're out there, like you're experiencing our country as it was.

And they fan out this beautiful tail, these long pointy feathers. And as they display, they start swishing their wings over these stiff white breast feathers. And then they sort of, in this violent eruption, launch their chest forward.  (Soundbite of birds)  Mr. VYN: Sharp-tailed grouse, in their display, arc their wings outward and hunch their head forward, and then they run around sort of like wind-up toys pounding their feet on the ground.  (Soundbite of birds)  Mr. VYN: All of these species have undergone drastic population declines. You really do get that feeling when you're out there, like you're experiencing our country as it was.  (Soundbite of birds)  MONTAGNE: Our sounds come from the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology. Thanks to NPR's Christopher Joyce for finding these recordings.

The bill is the Senate's version of an energy and climate bill the House of Representatives passed last June. Today, Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer unveils the measure, which will do nothing less than remake the entire energy economy of the country. To discuss the Senate's efforts, we turned to NPR's Christopher Joyce. Good morning. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: Chris, to start with, why now? Especially since Congress is so wrapped up in health care legislation. JOYCE: It's been on President Obama's agenda since the days when he was campaigning for president, and it was introduced into the House. The House spent months on this thing doubling in size, adding all sorts of things to make it palatable. And the Senate took it up and then had to put it off because of health care. And in the meantime, there's a lot of pressure to get something done. There's the court rulings saying that the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, can actually regulate greenhouse gases, and people really don't want that to happen. They want Congress to come up with something legislative. MONTAGNE: Okay. Well, then, tell us what's in the bill and how it differs from the House version. JOYCE: It's a cap-and-trade bill, the way the House bill was - cap-and-trade meaning there's an emissions cap over the whole country, so so much greenhouse gases can be emitted and no more. And if you live within your cap, you can trade whatever you have extra, buy and sell it to other people who are also limited. Beyond that, not a lot's come out of Barbara Boxer's office on this. She's the lead on this. She does want to make it a little tougher than the House version. They way it works is they set an emissions cap based on what was emitted by the country in 2005. And they've said, okay, over the next 10 years, we've got to bring that down 17 percent. She wants to make it tougher. She wants to make it 20 percent, which may not sound like a lot of difference, but each percentage point in these emissions limits is a battleground. There are also what's called allocations. Every industry gets a certain percentage of all these permits to emit greenhouse gases. For example, the utility industry is getting 35 percent of all the free allocations. They say, hey, we need more. We emit 40 percent of the greenhouse gases. We need 40 percent of the permits. So there's going to be a lot of haggling over that. MONTAGNE: And the other sticking points? JOYCE: Well, the Senate's a bit different from the House. In the House, you have a lot of people from urban areas. In the Senate, everybody has farm interests. So the farm interests are going to be very interested in what they're going get out of this. And they're also worried about the financial sector. All these permits become part of a big financial scheme or scam, if you will, and they're worried about the sort of subprime mortgage of the carbon market happening. MONTAGNE: Okay. Now come December, there's a global conference on climate change. It'll held in Copenhagen, Denmark. Is there a big rush to get something done by then? JOYCE: There is, from supporters and people who said, look, we really don't want to go empty-handed to Copenhagen. We'd like to go with some evidence that we're actually going to join the rest of world and have some hard, vast limits on greenhouse gas emissions. Others in the Senate are saying, look, we work on our own agenda. We don't have to do this just to make other people happy. We need to do this right. It's going to be very difficult, complicated and expensive. Let's not be held to an artificial time limit. So this could go on till next year. MONTAGNE: Well, what about the timing, generally? It's a bad time for the economy. We're talking about the remaking here, the energy economy itself, which is huge. Does the bill have a chance? JOYCE: It has a chance. Obviously, it passed in the House, it could pass in the Senate. Certainly, there are a lot of people to placate here. The Republicans are generally, as a bloc, opposed to the complicated and - what they say -expensive nature of it. But then, there's a bit of a Damocles sword hanging over, which is that if there's not a bill from Congress, that it could be very likely that the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency and the federal government will simply do it by regulation, limiting greenhouse gases, and pretty much nobody wants that. MONTAGNE: Chris, thanks very much. JOYCE: You're welcome.

Scientists working in Ethiopia have unveiled a trove of fossil bones that they say come from our oldest known ancestor. Among the bones are those of a female - who's been named Ardi. She apparently weighed about 110 pounds and stood about four feet high. She lived in trees, but could walk on the ground. As NPR's Christopher Joyce explains, Ardi pushes back human history a long way. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: Move over Lucy, that diminutive creature discovered 35 years ago in Ethiopia became the poster child for our earliest out-of-the-trees ancestors. But now comes Ardi. Ardi lived 4. 4 million years ago - that's a million years before Lucy. Scientists say that makes Ardi the closest they've come to finding the elusive common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. Anthropologists suspect that about six or seven million years ago, some kind of ape-like creature gave rise to two evolutionary lines. One led to chimpanzees and other apes, the other to hominids, who eventually became us. C. Owen Lovejoy of Kent State University, one of Ardi's discoverers says people thought the common ancestor was probably a lot like a chimp. But Lovejoy says he knows chimps and Ardi was no chimp. Dr. C. OWEN LOVEJOY (Professor of Anthropology, Kent State University): The last common ancestor was more Ardi-like than it was chimpanzee or gorilla-like. So the old attitude that the last common ancestor was chimp-like is completely wrong. JOYCE: What Lovejoy has to go on are more than 100 bones from 36 individuals, formerly known as Ardipithicus ramidus. Older Ardipithicus specimens are known but consist of just a few teeth and bones. Tim White, an anthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley is the team's field director. He brought a model of the skull to Washington to display. It's about the size of a grapefruit. When White found it, he said it was crushed. Professor TIM WHITE (Anthropologist, University of California, Berkeley): I'm pulling out a couple of pieces of wrapping here. The height of this cranium was about an inch. The face was completely missing. We had none of it. So we went back to the field. JOYCE: Over 15 years, they collected a body. Prof. WHITE: This thing has all the teeth in the lower jaw and the upper jaw and the bones of the face and the entire cranium. Unidentified Man: And the hands and feet. It was a nightmare to put it together. JOYCE: White says they also recreated the creatures' environment. Prof. WHITE: Collecting every pollen grain, every seed, every piece of wood, every shrew, every bat, every elephant, every giraffe, every horse, every monkey, all of this provides the high resolution snapshot of what Africa was like in this place our ancestors lived four and half million years ago. JOYCE: White and Lovejoy describe Ardi as a mosaic of ape, monkey and yet to evolve descendent Lucy, formerly known as Australopithecus. Ardi lived in a lush wooded environment, not the grassy savanna often associated with human ancestors. And it was no knuckle walker. It could walk on its own two feet, though those feet were still pretty monkey-like. But it probably spent most of its time in the trees. Its hands differed from the chimps as well. And then there are the teeth. The canines are small, unlike the long threatening canines chimps have. Male chimps use the canines to intimidate other males and gain access to females. Lovejoy says a male Ardipithicus probably did not need big teeth to get what he wanted. Prof. LOVEJOY: So females are picking males that are using some other technique to obtain reproductive success. And that technique probably is exchanging food for copulation. JOYCE: That, says Lovejoy, paved the way for the kind of social life humans eventually adopted. Professor ALAN WALKER (Anthropology and Biology, Penn State University) This is much more important than Lucy. JOYCE: That's Alan Walker, an anthropologist at Penn State University. He says the fossil will kick start plenty of debate among anthropologists. Prof. WALKER: As soon as everybody in the field goes to read these things and digest them, people will start the usual academic criticism. JOYCE: One who's already started is Bernard Wood, an anthropologist at George Washington University. Professor BERNARD WOOD (Anthropologist, George Washington University) What I'm not seeing is anything that really convinces me that it's the ancestor of modern humans. JOYCE: Wood says sometimes unrelated species evolve very similar traits. Bats and birds both have wings, for example. Wood says Ardipithicus could have been a twig on a very different branch from the human line. Prof. WOOD: We know if you look at the rest of the tree of life, the minority of branches reach the surface. Most of the branches never make it. JOYCE: The discoverers have published their findings in the journal Science. And they say they're ready for that debate. They've had 15 years to prepare. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

I'm Renee Montagne. Good morning. STEVE INSKEEP, host: I'm Steve Inskeep. Hundreds of people are dead following an Indonesian earthquake yesterday. And even as rescuers searched for survivors, the country was hit by another earthquake today. And these are just two of four big earthquakes over the last couple of days. The others were in Samoa and Peru. All are considered part of the Pacific Rim, which has the world's most active fault lines. NPR's Richard Harris has been looking at whether the tremors were related. RICHARD HARRIS: You've got to wonder, did the first big one trigger the others. Ross Stein at the U. S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California, says it's not a crazy idea. Dr. ROSS STEIN (United States Geological Survey): The interesting thing is, any earthquake of let's say magnitude six or larger, sends out its ripple of seismic waves, just like throwing a stone into a pond. And for a magnitude six or larger, those waves encircle the entire globe. And every single sand grain on the planet is dancing to that music. HARRIS: So when it comes to seismic waves, the world really is all interconnected. Dr. STEIN: But the tough question is, okay, you shook the region but did you trigger an earthquake, which is something else. HARRIS: That's much harder to do. In the case of this week's events, it's true that the Samoa quake and the Sumatra quake took place on opposite edges of a giant slab of Earth called the Australian Plate. Dr. STEIN: However, the plate itself as a whole doesn't move. The plate is basically a thin slab of rubber sliding over honey, and it bangs and bends on the borders but the entire plate isn't moving at once. HARRIS: So there's no expectation that a single plate-wide event could be behind this one-two punch. Stein says the quakes, along with one in Peru, all occurred in places where big quakes happen a lot. Dr. STEIN: Would you expect them all to occur in a 24-hour period? I don't know and I haven't looked at that. HARRIS: But a colleague of his down the hall has looked at whether big quakes trigger other quakes. Tom Parsons says the answer is a resounding, yes, but with a very important caveat. Dr. TOM PARSONS (Seismologist, United States Geological Survey): They tend to happened within about a thousand kilometers of their source. . . HARRIS: Which is 600 miles or so. Dr. PARSONS: Right. And in this case, the Sumatran-Samoan events are more than 10,000 kilometers apart. HARRIS: Parsons has poured through the records of all potentially damaging earthquakes over the past 30 years, magnitude seven or higher. He looked at more than 200 quakes in all to see if big quakes trigger other big quakes far away, and he simply doesn't se that pattern. So what can explain the pair of big quakes this week? Well, Parsons says there are, on average, six or seven quakes a year with magnitudes greater than seven. So it's not too likely that any of these will happen on the same day. But it certainly can happen. Parsons has a simpler explanation for the large quake near the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Dr. PARSONS: Of course, in the Sumatra area is very active at the moment because of the giant earthquake that happened there back in 2004. So if you were going to blame this most recent event on anything, I'd probably look at that big magnitude nine event that happened then as the root cause, more than the Samoa event. HARRIS: That 2004 event was the quake that caused the devastating tsunami that swept across the Indian Ocean. And ever since then, we've paid a lot more attention to big quakes, even those that strike way out at sea. Richard Harris, NPR News.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host:  This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News.

Her name is Samson. Yes, she is a female. And she hit the auction block yesterday. Now, the auction house had hoped to fetch more than $6 million for her fossilized skeleton. But it seems even in Vegas, no one was willing to bet that big. On the line is Thomas Lindgren, the co-director of natural history for Bonhams & Butterfields auctioneers. Welcome back to the program. Mr. THOMAS LINDGREN (Co-Director of Natural History, Bonhams & Butterfields): Well, happy to be here. RAZ: Describe what happened during yesterday's bidding. Mr. LINDGREN: Well, actually, we had quite a bit of interest during the entire auction. When we got to Samson, you can tell there was kind of a hush around the room as people were anticipating what may or may not happen. The bidding started at about $2. 5 million, and as we approached $3. 6 million, things really began to slow down, and we realized we might not be able to actually consummate the sale during the auction itself. There were certainly many interested parties, but we had a certain reserve price we needed to meet, and we didn't quite get there yesterday. RAZ: Mm-hmm. What was that reserve price? Mr. LINDGREN: Well, I can't really divulge what that reserve price is, but it was certainly more than $3. 6 million. RAZ: So the reserve price wasn't met, which basically means you didn't sell Samson. Mr. LINDGREN: We didn't sell her yesterday, but we're actually in negotiations with both private parties and an institution after the sale because they still are very interested in trying to bring her to a new home. We feel fairly confident that we're going to get her into a new home. It's just a matter of everyone putting their finances in line. RAZ: You were quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying that you want to be the guy who slid into home plate at the end of a grand slam at the end of the World Series of paleontology. But perhaps last night you lost that world series, right? Mr. LINDGREN: Well, you know what? I think we're in extra innings. RAZ: Ah, extra innings. All right. Mr. LINDGREN: I don't think the game is over yet. RAZ: Fair enough. So what's next for Samson now? Mr. LINDGREN: Well, she'll still be in the Guggenheim space here at the Venetian Inn. RAZ: For a few more days. Mr. LINDGREN: For a few more days. And once we've started to dismantle her, she is going to be put back into her crates and into a warehouse. RAZ: Thomas Lindgren is a veteran fossil hunter and the co-director of natural history for the Bonhams & Butterfields Auction House. Mr. Lindgren, thanks for joining us. Mr. LINDGREN: It's been a great pleasure. Thank you.  GUY RAZ, host:  A couple of weeks ago, we brought you the story of a 66-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex about to be sold on the Las Vegas Strip. Her name is Samson. Yes, she is a female. And she hit the auction block yesterday.  Now, the auction house had hoped to fetch more than $6 million for her fossilized skeleton. But it seems even in Vegas, no one was willing to bet that big.  On the line is Thomas Lindgren, the co-director of natural history for Bonhams & Butterfields auctioneers.  Welcome back to the program.  Mr. THOMAS LINDGREN (Co-Director of Natural History, Bonhams & Butterfields): Well, happy to be here.  RAZ: Describe what happened during yesterday's bidding.  Mr. LINDGREN: Well, actually, we had quite a bit of interest during the entire auction. When we got to Samson, you can tell there was kind of a hush around the room as people were anticipating what may or may not happen. The bidding started at about $2. 5 million, and as we approached $3. 6 million, things really began to slow down, and we realized we might not be able to actually consummate the sale during the auction itself.  There were certainly many interested parties, but we had a certain reserve price we needed to meet, and we didn't quite get there yesterday.  RAZ: Mm-hmm. What was that reserve price?  Mr. LINDGREN: Well, I can't really divulge what that reserve price is, but it was certainly more than $3. 6 million.  RAZ: So the reserve price wasn't met, which basically means you didn't sell Samson.  Mr. LINDGREN: We didn't sell her yesterday, but we're actually in negotiations with both private parties and an institution after the sale because they still are very interested in trying to bring her to a new home. We feel fairly confident that we're going to get her into a new home. It's just a matter of everyone putting their finances in line.

I'm Guy Raz. A few days ago, I was on the edge of the Potomac River in Maryland, coating my pants with insect repellent. Mr. JOHN KRESS (Botanist, Smithsonian Institution): Stay off, bugs. RAZ: I was following John Kress - he's a botanist at the Smithsonian Institution - through a dense forest of tulip poplars, maple trees and spice bush. We were on our way to an obscure little island just a few miles upstream from Washington, D. C. It's called Plummers Island, and it's the place where the quest to sequence the DNA of every single plant species on earth began. Mr. KRESS: Sorry, a little overgrown. RAZ: After about 15 minutes, we stop at the edge of the Potomac. The water is low, and the channel separating the mainland from Plummers Island is just a few feet wide. So John Kress leads the way as we scamper over some rocks and onto the island. Mr. KRESS: So here we are at the welcome to Plummers Island sign, the most thoroughly studied island in North America. RAZ: And that is a fact? Mr. KRESS: That is a fact. RAZ: This is the most thoroughly studied island in North America. Mr. KRESS: There's been more biologists out here looking at everything from worms to flowers to birds to mammals to snails than any other spot on the East Coast. RAZ: All on these 12 acres. Mr. KRESS: All on these 12 acres. RAZ: It's a strange little island: peaceful, serene, isolated. And yet, it sits directly under the flight path from Dulles Airport and right below the busy Capital Beltway. John Kress comes here at least once a month. Now, much of his research on plant life has taken him to more exotic places like Burma and Ecuador, places with far more biodiversity than Plummers Island. But it's here, on this tiny little patch of land in Maryland, where a microclimate creates an unusual environment. Mr. KRESS: You think of the temperate zone, the mid-Atlantic forest with oaks and maples and things. Right where we're standing right now, we're surrounded by tropical plants. The papaws are in the tropical family Annonaceae. The spicebush is in the tropical family, the Lauraceae or the Laurels. And so when I look in here, I feel like I'm in Costa Rica sometimes because it's just the sorts of things I'd see if I was in a lowland tropical forest in Central America. Of course, the big trees are not really tropical. They're the oaks, they're the maples, they're the walnuts. But when I'm here, particularly in the heat of the summer, it really feels like the tropics. RAZ: Are these native to this area? Mr. KRESS: Yeah. Yeah, they're native. RAZ: Yeah? Mr. KRESS: In fact, the papaws are probably also fruiting right now. We might find some papaw fruits around. RAZ: Can you eat it? Mr. KRESS: You can eat it. They're good. RAZ: Kress leads me up a narrow path to the highest point on the island. At the top sits an old ramshackle wood cabin. (Soundbite of door opening) RAZ: The cabin is the clubhouse for a super-exclusive fraternity called the Washington Biologists Field Club. It's been around for about 100 years, and membership is strictly limited. There are only 65 spots. And even with his distinguished record of research, John Kress didn't get in until 10 years ago. Mr. KRESS: As members pass on, we have new members, younger members. RAZ: So you can't expand. Mr. KRESS: We can never expand it. RAZ: So in order to become a member, somebody has to pass away. Mr. KRESS: That's - or leave the area and resign their membership, which is rare. RAZ: So this has got to be one of the toughest clubs in the city to get into. Mr. KRESS: I'm probably not going to comment on that. RAZ: The members are the stewards of the island. They actually owned it until a few years ago, when they donated it to the federal government. Outside the cabin, Kress fills me in on a project that could potentially revolutionize the way we understand plants. Mr. KRESS: What we were doing on Plummers Island was using it as a pilot study for something we want to take to the tropics and take to forests all around the world, which is developing a system of identification based upon the DNA of a species. This DNA marker we call a DNA bar code. And that's essentially taking a small segment of DNA that we can find in all organisms. We have to locate it on a certain part of the genome, but it's variable enough that it's different for all species on the planet. And then we can take any sort of part of a plant or take a hair or a leg of a grasshopper, grind it up, get out the DNA, sequence this little chunk of DNA and then tell what species that is. RAZ: The bar code he's talking about isn't a literal bar code like a UPC symbol on a cereal box. It's a code that's inside the plant. Mr. KRESS: The DNA is inside the trees\u2026 RAZ: I see. Mr. KRESS: \u2026inside the plants. And we extract that DNA, and then we have to sequence that DNA to actually identify the plant. So that's - we're not there yet in terms of me picking a leaf off the ground and telling you immediately from its DNA bar code what that is. We would have to take it back to the lab\u2026 RAZ: Right. Mr. KRESS: \u2026sequence it. But technology is heading in the direction where we expect what now sits on top of a desk as a DNA sequencer will eventually fit in the palm of your hand. RAZ: So like an iPhone or something? Mr. KRESS: Like an iPhone, cell phone. RAZ: Within a few years, John Kress imagines kids wandering through forests around the world with portable scanners that could analyze a sample of any plant, check it against the DNA database he's creating, and know within a few seconds what species they're looking at. But to get closer to that future, we have to get off the island and into the lab. (Soundbite of car starting) RAZ: So we drive about 30 minutes to Suitland, Maryland, home of the Smithsonian Museum Support Center. It's a giant campus where the Smithsonian stores all the stuff you don't see in the museums. And it also hosts dozens of research labs. Mr. KRESS: The affectionate name for the museum support center is The Death Star. RAZ: The scientists call it The Death Star because it's one of the cleanest places you've ever seen - spotless. Unidentified Woman: Okay. Everybody sign in. I just need a photo ID. RAZ: We're here to meet Kress' partner in the DNA barcoding project. His name's Dave Erickson. Dave is the guy who collects all the plant samples sent to him from around the world, including the samples collected on Plummers Island. Mr. DAVE ERICKSON (Botanist, Smithsonian Institution): And we take literally two hole punches out, and that's the source of all the DNA that we'll use. RAZ: Two hole punches. Mr. ERICKSON: Two hole punches. And that is more than enough DNA to do all the sequencing we're going to use. In fact, it's so much DNA that we can preserve that for whole genome sequencing down the future if we get to that. RAZ: Once the samples come in, Erickson grinds them up and sends them to a DNA extractor. (Soundbite of machine) RAZ: Eventually, the plant's DNA is analyzed and the data from the specific gene is converted into the DNA bar code. And that bar code is what goes into the DNA database at the center. Mr. ERICKSON: Anybody who wants to go to Plummers Island or, in theory, as we extend this to all plants, anywhere, collect a plant in any kind of forensic context that the technology for extracting the DNA and sequencing that is ubiquitous. So let's say there's a kid in the hospital. He's sick, he barfs up some stuff. They can recover that fragment of leaf tissue that he ate, do a DNA extraction. Because we have a reference library at this defined set of genes, they know exactly what gene I need to target and sequence. Once they do that, they can figure out what this kid ate. RAZ: Hmm. Mr. ERICKSON: Okay? So the power of the reference library is that it's the same gene. Everybody knows what it is. It's easy to recover in a lot of different environments and contexts. RAZ: Similar plant species might have very important differences, like one strain might be poisonous and one might not be. Right now, when scientists need to distinguish between two different species of plants, plants that might appear identical to the naked eye, they have to wait until those plants produce fruits or flowers, and that could take up to half a year. Back on Plummers Island, John Kress says that future when people will know instantly what plant they're looking at is still a bit far away. There are literally millions of plant species to sequence, and thousands more yet to be discovered. But at least here, on these 12 acres in the middle of the Potomac, the job is complete. Mr. KRESS: It's pretty amazing to walk through here and know that we have a DNA bar code for every plant that's out here. RAZ: Every single thing. Mr. KRESS: Everything. RAZ: If you'd like to see photos of Plummers Island and the lab at the Smithsonian's Support Center, visit our Web site at npr. org.

You just go behind the house and fill up your car, your truck, your clean, green George Jetson-style hovercraft with fuel you made from something grown nearby. It's an appealing vision, and as Adam Burke reports from southwest Colorado, an extremely difficult thing to pull off. ADAM BURKE: When farmers in the town of Dove Creek started planting sunflowers a few years back, it was primarily a decent income, not energy independence that motivated many of them. But an activist-turned-entrepreneur named Jeff Berman had floated a proposal with a green hook: he told farmers if they grew sunflowers, he'd give them a renewable fuel source. Mr. JEFF BERMAN (CEO, San Juan Bioenergy): Well, when we first came in, we were going to produce biodiesel from local, sustainably grown oil seeds and allow the farmers to use that fuel to grow the wheat and to grow the beans that they also grow here. BURKE: Berman is the CEO of a company called San Juan Bioenergy. His part of the bargain was to build a facility in town that could turn sunflower seeds into biodiesel. To do that, farmers would have to start producing sunflowers -lots and lots of them. Mr. DAN WARREN: It was very attractive to think that we could raise our own tractor fuel, sure. BURKE: Dan Warren, a third-generation farmer in Dove Creek, remembers those early meetings with Jeff Berman. Mr. WARREN: With pencil and paper you could see that there was more money involved, per acre in the sunflowers. BURKE: But farmers, they are a conservative lot. Richard Knuckles says he was skeptical even then. Mr. RICHARD KNUCKLES: The way they painted the picture, everything was just going to go smooth as molasses. Everybody was going to raise sunflowers and get rich. BURKE: Anyway, it's likely that any number of development projects \u2014 green or not \u2014 would've received enthusiasm in Dove Creek. Unemployment in the surrounding county leads the state at around 14 percent. (Soundbite of highway) BURKE: Follow the highway that runs through town and you'll see empty storefronts tucked in between the clusters of grain silos and supply stores. One of the gas stations has fresh plywood on the windows and doors. Follow the highway out of town and you'll find sunflowers flourishing in the high desert. Mr. GRANT ALLEN: When you put them in the ground, if you get hot days after that, you can almost watch them grow. BURKE: Twenty-two-year-old Grant Allen grew up in Dove Creek farming pinto beans and wheat with his dad. Five years ago he raised one of the first small pilot plots of sunflowers in the area. And now, he's scaled it up. Mr. ALLEN: I've planted 2,105,600 seeds on this field here. BURKE: On one of his 300-acre fields, the red earth is as fine and as dry as talcum powder, but the sunflowers are chest high. Bristly, green leaves and stalks scrape at our clothing as we cut across the planted rows into a massive crowd of bright, yellow faces \u2014 blooms the size of dinner plates. Mr. ALLEN: I love growing them. This right here \u2014 whenever they're bloomed out \u2014 this is what I farm for right here. BURKE:  Still, as much he loves sunflowers, Allen says it was the processing facility that had made them a viable crop. Mr. ALLEN: We farmed sunflowers on the pure hope that they were going to get their doors open and they were going to start producing. And that's what kept us going, you know? BURKE: By 2008, thousands of acres around Dove Creek were growing sunflowers. Local grain silos filled up with the sunflower seeds that San Juan Bioenergy had purchased from farmers. Jeff Berman says he'd raised $5 million through investments and loans. And a plant was under construction that would extract oil and then convert that oil to biodiesel. But at the same time, the biodiesel market was beginning to crash. And by the end of the year, federal subsidies for biofuels dried up. Here's Jeff Berman again. Mr. BERMAN: To survive, we had to make some changes. If we had insisted on building our biodiesel plant, then we would not be here. BURKE: Berman's key to survival was to focus on the part of the operation that would still work: producing food-grade sunflower oil. Now, this can't have been an easy transition for a guy looking to start a green revolution, but the company has managed to stay in business and hang on to its renewable vision. Mr. BERMAN: Now, you could all come in here now. BURKE: On a tour of the sunflower oil facility, Berman expertly guides a group through the chutes and ladders of the extraction process. Mr. BERMAN: That hydraulic press you see there pushes against it to\u2026 BURKE: Thus far, the facility's main green innovation is in the way that a waste product \u2014 in this case, sunflower hulls and pieces of plant material \u2014 is transformed into fuel. What they do is pretty cool. (Soundbite of machines) BURKE: Machines grind up this biomass and press it into little fuel pellets. It kind of looks like rabbit food. And those pellets are fed into a special gasifier. Mr. BERMAN: So, in this gasification chamber, 95 percent of this biomass turns into a gas. BURKE: And then that gas is routed to the company's generator. Mr. BERMAN: And so you can burn natural gas, or synthetic gas in our case, in a generator to produce your own power. BURKE: Berman estimates the system will produce a third of the electricity and all of the heat needed to run the plant. Now, that's will produce. It's important to note that workers are still fine-tuning the process. Meanwhile, Berman is continuing to dream. Mr. BERMAN: We plan, in our next phase of development, to build wind and solar, allowing us to create what I think is going to be the first always-on, hybrid, renewable energy system, if not in the country, in the world. BURKE: But that next phase is no sure thing at this point either. To complete the processing plant and finish paying farmers for last year's crop, Berman has been shipping sunflower seeds to the Midwest at a loss. San Juan Bioenergy has produced just 15 tankers of oil since January. And farmers like 22-year-old Grant Allen have begun to worry. Mr. ALLEN: Sunflowers could bring us farmers down as much as it could save us right now. BURKE: Here's the thing though: Jeff Berman's vision and his determination have motivated a small community to step out into uncertain territory. It's a risky place to be. But in many ways, Dove Creek is no worse off than it was five years ago when Berman first came to town. And if it turns out that San Juan Bioenergy does crack the code on sunflower power, it'll be little Dove Creek waiting for the world to catch up. For NPR News, I'm Adam Burke.

Richard Knuckles says he was skeptical even then.  Mr. RICHARD KNUCKLES: The way they painted the picture, everything was just going to go smooth as molasses. Everybody was going to raise sunflowers and get rich.  BURKE: Anyway, it's likely that any number of development projects \u2014 green or not \u2014 would've received enthusiasm in Dove Creek. Unemployment in the surrounding county leads the state at around 14 percent.  (Soundbite of highway)  BURKE: Follow the highway that runs through town and you'll see empty storefronts tucked in between the clusters of grain silos and supply stores. One of the gas stations has fresh plywood on the windows and doors. Follow the highway out of town and you'll find sunflowers flourishing in the high desert.  Mr. GRANT ALLEN: When you put them in the ground, if you get hot days after that, you can almost watch them grow.  BURKE: Twenty-two-year-old Grant Allen grew up in Dove Creek farming pinto beans and wheat with his dad. Five years ago he raised one of the first small pilot plots of sunflowers in the area. And now, he's scaled it up.  Mr. ALLEN: I've planted 2,105,600 seeds on this field here.  BURKE: On one of his 300-acre fields, the red earth is as fine and as dry as talcum powder, but the sunflowers are chest high. Bristly, green leaves and stalks scrape at our clothing as we cut across the planted rows into a massive crowd of bright, yellow faces \u2014 blooms the size of dinner plates.  Mr. ALLEN: I love growing them. This right here \u2014 whenever they're bloomed out \u2014 this is what I farm for right here.  BURKE:  Still, as much he loves sunflowers, Allen says it was the processing facility that had made them a viable crop.  Mr. ALLEN: We farmed sunflowers on the pure hope that they were going to get their doors open and they were going to start producing. And that's what kept us going, you know?  BURKE: By 2008, thousands of acres around Dove Creek were growing sunflowers. Local grain silos filled up with the sunflower seeds that San Juan Bioenergy had purchased from farmers. Jeff Berman says he'd raised $5 million through investments and loans. And a plant was under construction that would extract oil and then convert that oil to biodiesel. But at the same time, the biodiesel market was beginning to crash. And by the end of the year, federal subsidies for biofuels dried up. Here's Jeff Berman again.  Mr. BERMAN: To survive, we had to make some changes. If we had insisted on building our biodiesel plant, then we would not be here.  BURKE: Berman's key to survival was to focus on the part of the operation that would still work: producing food-grade sunflower oil. Now, this can't have been an easy transition for a guy looking to start a green revolution, but the company has managed to stay in business and hang on to its renewable vision.  Mr. BERMAN: Now, you could all come in here now.  BURKE: On a tour of the sunflower oil facility, Berman expertly guides a group through the chutes and ladders of the extraction process.  Mr. BERMAN: That hydraulic press you see there pushes against it to\u2026  BURKE: Thus far, the facility's main green innovation is in the way that a waste product \u2014 in this case, sunflower hulls and pieces of plant material \u2014 is transformed into fuel. What they do is pretty cool.  (Soundbite of machines)  BURKE: Machines grind up this biomass and press it into little fuel pellets. It kind of looks like rabbit food. And those pellets are fed into a special gasifier.  Mr. BERMAN: So, in this gasification chamber, 95 percent of this biomass turns into a gas.  BURKE: And then that gas is routed to the company's generator.  Mr. BERMAN: And so you can burn natural gas, or synthetic gas in our case, in a generator to produce your own power.  BURKE: Berman estimates the system will produce a third of the electricity and all of the heat needed to run the plant. Now, that's will produce. It's important to note that workers are still fine-tuning the process. Meanwhile, Berman is continuing to dream.  Mr. BERMAN: We plan, in our next phase of development, to build wind and solar, allowing us to create what I think is going to be the first always-on, hybrid, renewable energy system, if not in the country, in the world.  BURKE: But that next phase is no sure thing at this point either. To complete the processing plant and finish paying farmers for last year's crop, Berman has been shipping sunflower seeds to the Midwest at a loss. San Juan Bioenergy has produced just 15 tankers of oil since January. And farmers like 22-year-old Grant Allen have begun to worry.  Mr. ALLEN: Sunflowers could bring us farmers down as much as it could save us right now.  BURKE: Here's the thing though: Jeff Berman's vision and his determination have motivated a small community to step out into uncertain territory. It's a risky place to be. But in many ways, Dove Creek is no worse off than it was five years ago when Berman first came to town. And if it turns out that San Juan Bioenergy does crack the code on sunflower power, it'll be little Dove Creek waiting for the world to catch up.  For NPR News, I'm Adam Burke.

In Stockholm this morning, the Nobel committee announced the winners. Three American scientists will share the prize. NPR's science correspondent John Hamilton is here to tell us about them. Good morning. JOHN HAMILTON: Good morning. MONTAGNE: And who won? HAMILTON: Well, first up, we've got Elizabeth Blackburn, who was born in Australia and got here Ph. D. in England, but now she is a professor of biology and physiology at the University of California, San Francisco. Then we've got Carol Grieder. She spent a lot of her early life in California. Now she is a professor of molecular biology and genetics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. And then finally, we've got Jack Szostak. He was born in London, grew up in Canada, but he is now a professor of genetics at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. MONTAGNE: And what did they do that earned them this prize? HAMILTON: Well, all three of these scientists made important contributions to our understanding of these things called telomeres. And telomeres, if you imagine our DNA as like a strand, a shoelace strands. You know, these DNA strands are like shoelaces. Telomeres would be sort of like the little plastic tip, the little plastic cap at the end of our shoelaces that keeps them from unraveling. And, in fact, that's - to a certain extent that's what they do. What happens is when cells divide, you would ordinarily lose a little tiny bit of the end of the DNA strand, and telomeres seem to prevent that from happening. So they're obviously pretty important. MONTAGNE: And, okay. So far so good, I'm getting it there, of that point, John. But, you know, why is it so important? What can you do now that you know that it's telomeres doing this - keeping these strands from unraveling? HAMILTON: Well, there are at least two really important reasons to understand telomeres, and one of them has to with aging. If these telomeres are in fact controlling the sort of aging process of the cells, then mean that's what we do. We are living creatures and our cells age. The telomeres get shorter. They know that when telomeres get shorter that causes aging. They used to thing that they were really the key to all cell aging, and I think now they're realizing it's a more complicated picture, but they're very important. So the first thing is you study telomeres and the way they protect the DNA from getting lost when copies are made. And, you know, our cells are dividing making copies all the time. And if you understand that, then you would hope that you would understand why we're aging and maybe be able to affect it. MONTAGNE: You know, which gets us to the sort of the - a lot of these interesting that would you call discoveries - have practical implications. What would the one for telomeres be? I mean to prevent aging in what way? HAMILTON: Well, you might be able to slow down the aging process. If, for instance, you could keep telomeres from shorter and preserve their ability to, you know, delay the loss of little bits of DNA, you might be able to slow down the aging prospect. And that's obviously one thing that scientists are very, very interested in. The other thing has to do with cancer. And cancer cells are fascinating because they divide all the time. So you might think that with all this cell division going on, this process where you lose a little bit of DNA with each division would be especially a problem for cancer cells, but it's not. Cancer cells divide, and divide, and divide and they seem to be immortal. They never go through this aging process. And they think telomeres are a key to understanding why that's possible And so if you understood telomeres in that perspective, you might be able to find a new way to go after cancer cells.

Now, time to hear from three scientists who discovered this morning they had won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. As NPR's Jon Hamilton reports, they won for explaining a biological process that seems to play an important role in cancer and aging. JON HAMILTON: When cells divide, they lose a tiny bit of genetic information at the end of each chromosome. Dr. ELIZABETH BLACKBURN (University of California, San Francisco): The ends of chromosomes are always wearing down. HAMILTON: Elizabeth Blackburn from the University of California, San Francisco, is one of the scientists who became a Nobel winner today. Blackburn says the ends of chromosomes would eventually get worn away if they weren't protected by something called a telomere. She says it acts like the plastic tip on a shoelace, which prevents the lace ends from fraying. But where do telomeres come from? That's what Blackburn was trying to figure out in the 1980s when she was at UC Berkeley. She figured there must be an enzyme responsible for making and maintaining these genetic shoelace tips. Dr. BLACKBURN: There were some hints. And then I think there was a particular time when we really saw a particular piece of evidence there, which said very strongly to us, ah, this thing really does exist. HAMILTON: The discovery was made by Carol Greider, who was a graduate student back then. These days, Greider is a professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. She also will receive a share of the Nobel Prize. Dr. CAROL GREIDER (Johns Hopkins University) We were studying these single-celled pond animals called Tetrahymena, that happen to have 40,000 chromosomes. And we figured if you want to understand how chromosomes are replicated and how telomeres work, go to the organism that has 40,000 of them. HAMILTON: What Greider found in those organisms was an enzyme that was able to keep the ends of chromosomes in good shape. She says at first they called the enzyme telomere terminal transferase. Dr. GREIDER: But we realized, especially because we were working with this organism that was called Tetrahymena thermophila, that if you want to say Tetrahymena thermophila telomere terminal transferase, that gets to be a mouthful. HAMILTON: So Greider took a friend's suggestion and renamed the enzyme telomerase. At the time, it wasn't clear whether the system worked the same way in other species. That question was answered by Jack Szostak, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. He's the third recipient of today's Nobel Prize. Szostak took the telomere DNA from the organism Blackburn and Greider were studying and inserted it into yeast cells. He then used X-ray images to see whether the DNA was protecting yeast chromosomes during cell division. Dr. JACK SZOSTAK (Geneticist, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital): There was a moment where, you know, in sort of developing the X-ray film where, you know, just by looking at it, it was obvious that the experiment had worked and that, therefore, the telomere machinery was working in yeast. HAMILTON: That suggested the machinery would be present in all species, including humans. More recent research has confirmed that. Szostak says that when he and other scientists made those early discoveries, they were just trying to understand how cells work. But since then, it's become clear that the process they uncovered offers a new way to understand a wide range of diseases, including cancer. Szostak says cancer cells depend on telomerase. He says it seems to allow them to divide like crazy without dying the way normal cells would. Dr. SZOSTAK: The hope is that by interfering with the enzyme, maybe there will be a therapeutically useful benefit. HAMILTON: Elizabeth Blackburn from UC San Francisco says telomeres also seem to have a role in things like heart disease, diabetes and perhaps even the aging process itself. Blackburn's recent work suggests that chronic psychological stress can actually damage telomeres. Jon Hamilton, NPR News.

With today's Nobel Prizes, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences is celebrating tangible discoveries, things you use every day. One scientist is honored for inventing fiber optic communications. And two others got the nod for inventing the technology that is the basis of digital cameras. NPR's Richard Harris tells their stories. RICHARD HARRIS: Let's turn back the clock a few decades and drop in on Bell Labs in New Jersey. This is where the transistor was invented and where the laser came into being. It was a place of remarkable ideas. Willard Boyle and George Smith were part of that magical time. Smith says in October of 1969, they were trying to outsmart another part of Bell Labs to come up with a new type of computer memory. HARRIS: Bill Boyle and I frequently got together to kick around ideas, and this was one of them. The actual invention took place one afternoon. HARRIS: The idea, drawn on a blackboard, was a new kind of electronic circuit they called a Charge-Coupled Device. It could work as a new kind of computer memory. But Smith realized it had a lot more potential than that. HARRIS: It became immediately obvious that this device would also make a very good imaging device. HARRIS: CCDs can capture light and turn it into simple electronic signals, so a visual image could be converted instantly into digital form. Digital photography was born. The military was intensely interested in this for spy satellites, and the first commercial application was for digital TV cameras. Digital still cameras lagged by quite some time, Smith says, because compact memory was still hard to come by - that is until flash memory was invented. Smith knows this story intimately. HARRIS: I had a small exploratory research department at the laboratories, about 30 people, I guess. And the flash memory was invented in my department also. HARRIS: Smith and Boyle came up with dozens of inventions during their time at Bell Labs, often working together. And then, when Smith was still in his mid-50s, he simply hung up the towel. HARRIS: I retired in 1986, jumped in my sailboat, sailed around the world. HARRIS: And he took 17 years to do it, lingering especially long in the South Pacific with his sweetheart. Why, you might wonder, would a prolific and highly successful inventor just call it quits? HARRIS: If one is honest about it, as you grow older, your inventive abilities deteriorate. I have run into many people at Bell Labs when they were younger were really great and then they sort of went downhill, even though they didn't admit it. HARRIS: These days, Bell Labs is no longer seen as a place of unfettered creativity. But Smith and Boyle can see for themselves how their inventions changed the world. CCDs are not just in cameras. They are in satellites, medical devices, and notably telescopes. Peter Stockman at the Space Telescope Science Institute says they have revolutionized astronomy. HARRIS: Practically anything in the last 30 years would have been essentially impossible without CCDs. HARRIS: Hubble's incredible images are captured on CCDs and so are the images taken by telescopes all around the world. CCDs helped astronomers study the black holes that lie at the heart of galaxies and measure the age of the universe. And now, Willard Boyle and George Smith can add a punctuation mark to their careers: the Nobel Prize. Smith is still trying to find the words to describe it all.

NPR's Richard Harris is following the announcements coming out of Stockholm this morning. He's in our studios here in Washington. Richard, good morning. RICHARD HARRIS: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: And he's with us live. Okay, half this prize goes to a man who figured out how to make fiber optic cables, which carry phone calls and all kinds of other data. Who is this man? HARRIS: His name is Charles Kao. He was born in Shanghai in 1933. He went off to London to go to college and then he went to work for a place called Standard Telecommunication Laboratories, which is now defunct, in the U. K. But he realized that if you could figure out how to make nice pure glass fibers, you could send light beams down it and send energy and information down there much, much more efficiently than on wires. INSKEEP: And then the genius here, if Im not mistaken, is that you dont just have phone call or something going down a phone line, you can have thousands of signals down the same fiber optic cable. HARRIS: Absolutely. You can pack a huge amount of information in. And he  actually rather - this was in the early or mid '60s - he actually rather quickly figured out how to make these fibers pure enough that they could carry these signals a long distance. Cause, you know, obviously distance matters here. And just in a couple of years, he was able to figure out how to do that. So. . . INSKEEP: How widespread are fiber optic cables today? HARRIS: Well, the Nobel committee gave a rather astonishing statistic that said there are so much of that in the world now, that if you wrapped it around the world you could wrap it around 25,000 times. (Soundbite of laughter) INSKEEP: Oh, my God. HARRIS: (unintelligible) obviously running under the streets, it's everywhere. It's the backbone of the Internet. I mean, basically, you know, we'd be lost without fiber optics. INSKEEP: And let's talk about the other winners of the Nobel Prize. It's a split prize here and the other half is shared by a couple of guys who developed the technology thats at the heart of digital cameras, which must be almost as ubiquitous as fiber optic cables at this point. HARRIS: That's true. And this prize was shared by two scientists working together, named Willard Boyle and George Smith. They were at the famed Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey, back in the heyday of the labs when they were producing all sorts of astonishing inventions. I think this is the seventh Nobel Prize that came out of Bell Labs. . . INSKEEP: Hmm. HARRIS: . . . back in - largely from that era. So at any rate, they were brainstorming and they were trying to figure out sort of new technologies that might work. And they realized that if you take a  you could make sort of a semi-conductor chip that would essentially take light signals that would hit the chip and turn it into electrical signals. And so you have light you can turn it into electrical signals, and then all of a sudden a computer can interpret these signals. INSKEEP: Is it overstating it to say that there work is in some level behind or an ancestor of every cell phone camera, every digital camera that we use today? HARRIS: Absolutely. It's called the charge-coupled device is what they invented. The technology has evolved a little bit these days, so its in your cell phones a little bit different. But these charge-coupled devices are still in telescopes. They're in digital cameras, movie cameras, all of that kind of stuff. And one of the earliest applications actually was in spy satellites, cause back in the old days, spy satellites used to take pictures with film and then they'd dropped the film from the spy satellite, and a plane would have to go and catch this in a basket, which was obviously kind of a dicey thing to do. And obviously the military was delighted to think, wow, we could just take pictures and beam, electronically, this information back to Earth. So that was potentially one of the most important parts of this. Now it's in medical technology. It's everywhere. INSKEEP: And we've all got a spy satellite in our pocket, practically. HARRIS: Practically, we do. Yeah. INSKEEP: Richard, thanks very much. HARRIS: It's my pleasure. INSKEEP: NPR's Richard Harris is with us this morning bringing us up to date on three men who will share the Nobel Prize for Physics. You're listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR News.  STEVE INSKEEP, host:  This year's Nobel Prize in Physics goes to three men who developed revolutionary technologies that we can now take for granted.  NPR's Richard Harris is following the announcements coming out of Stockholm this morning. He's in our studios here in Washington.  Richard, good morning.  RICHARD HARRIS: Good morning, Steve.  INSKEEP: And he's with us live. Okay, half this prize goes to a man who figured out how to make fiber optic cables, which carry phone calls and all kinds of other data.  Who is this man?  HARRIS: His name is Charles Kao. He was born in Shanghai in 1933. He went off to London to go to college and then he went to work for a place called Standard Telecommunication Laboratories, which is now defunct, in the U. K. But he realized that if you could figure out how to make nice pure glass fibers, you could send light beams down it and send energy and information down there much, much more efficiently than on wires.  INSKEEP: And then the genius here, if Im not mistaken, is that you dont just have phone call or something going down a phone line, you can have thousands of signals down the same fiber optic cable.  HARRIS: Absolutely. You can pack a huge amount of information in. And he  actually rather - this was in the early or mid '60s - he actually rather quickly figured out how to make these fibers pure enough that they could carry these signals a long distance. Cause, you know, obviously distance matters here. And just in a couple of years, he was able to figure out how to do that. So. . .  INSKEEP: How widespread are fiber optic cables today?

The award went to a group of scientists who did some fundamental research into the little protein-making factories that are inside all living cells. NPRs science reporter Nell Greenfieldboyce is here to talk more about that. Good morning. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: Good morning. MONTAGNE: Well, lets get their names first. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Okay. There are three winners. Its Ada Yonath at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, Thomas Steitz at Yale University here in the U. S. and Venkatraman Ramakrishnan at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England. MONTAGNE: Obviously this is complicated research, but its quite intriguing, you know, protein-making factories. Tell us what they do inside those loving cells or how they make those cells live really. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Okay. In every cell, you have a little thing called a ribosome. And these are very complex little machines, but basically they build all the proteins we need for life. And the genetic code for different proteins, the kind of recipes for the proteins are contained in the DNA of each cell. But to make a protein, that recipe gets carried to the ribosome. The ribosome reads the recipe and then puts together a string of chemicals called amino acids in exactly the right order to make whatever protein you want to have. MONTAGNE: And this is pretty innocent, basic or long-known science. What do these Nobel winners discovered thats new? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Well, what they did is they all worked to develop a highly-detailed map of all the atoms in the ribosome. So basically, they wanted to know its structure in precise detail, because if you know the structure, then you know exactly how the ribosome works. And, you know, that sounds pretty straightforward, but the ribosome, remember, is really complicated. For a long time, people thought that figuring out a structure like this would not even be possible. It was just that complex and it took decades. MONTAGNE: And so, what? They took decades to do this? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Well, I mean, one of the researchers started working on it back in 1970s, and then, you know, work just continued up until the year 2000 when there was a publication finally of the structure of all the different atoms. But, I mean, people all over the world were doing research into this. They were sort of basically attacking the ribosome trying to figure out all its secrets. MONTAGNE: So, how is this being used? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Well, its highly practical information, because if you think about the fact that ribosomes are essential for life, that means all life, including bacterial life that can cause disease. And so, ribosomes are a good target for drugs like antibiotics. And many antibiotics actually kill bacteria by binding to bacterial ribosomes and blocking their normal function. And if you have a good map of all the atoms in a ribosome, then you can make a kind of 3D model and use that model to design new antibiotics that attack the ribosome in new ways. And thats really important because, as you know, resistance to antibiotics is a growing problem in medicine. MONTAGNE: But because this is such a basic part of life, I mean, I guess that theres more uses for it than  important as it is  than antibiotics. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Yeah. I mean, I think that taking the genetic code and using it as a blueprint to make proteins is a profoundly, profoundly important thing. Its involved in pretty much everything a living thing does. And so, who knows what will come of it. And thats the kind of research that gets you a Nobel. MONTAGNE: Nell, thanks very much. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Thank you.

S. citizens and one Israeli have won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has this story on the scientists and their work. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: Today started out with a little bad luck for Venki Ramakrishnan. He was bicycling to his job at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I came to work late because I had a flat tire, and I was just getting settled in and the phone rang. And I thought, you know, I have a lot of friends who play practical jokes. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And this had to be one of those elaborate jokes because the voice said the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences was on the line. That's what you normally hear when you're about to be told you have won the Nobel Prize. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I said, well, you have a very good Swedish accent but, you know, I have no idea who you are. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Eventually, they convinced him it was for real. Ramakrishnan was sharing the chemistry prize with two other researchers: Ada Yonath, of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel; and Thomas Steitz, of Yale University. The prize recognizes their work on ribosomes: the protein-making factories of living cells. Your body contains tens of thousands of different proteins. The recipe for each protein is encoded in the DNA of every cell. What the ribosome does is read the recipe and, like a cook, put together the right chemical pieces to make specific proteins. For a long time, scientists have wanted to understand exactly how this all happens. And for that, they would need to map the exact structure of the ribosome. That's what was done by the three scientists honored with this year's Nobel. They used a technique, called X-ray crystallography, to map the position of every one of the hundreds of thousands of atoms in a ribosome. This is something that was long thought to be a hopeless dream. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I was skeptical myself. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Thomas Cech is a molecular biologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder, who won his own Nobel Prize in Chemistry 20 years ago. He says it's hard to express just how complex the ribosome is, compared to other biochemical structures scientists have studied in the past. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Just imagine someone who had spent their life looking at ditches and then all of a sudden, you get a glimpse of the Grand Canyon. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So he says the three researchers definitely deserve the Nobel - although Venki Ramakrishnan says it feels strange that the prize he won is just limited to three people. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I mean, science is now done by massive groups of people. Even each of us have, you know, many talented people in our labs who make critical contributions. GREENFIELDBOYCE: One practical application of knowing the ribosome structure is that it could be useful for medicine. Many antibiotics actually kill bacteria by blocking the normal function of the germ's ribosomes. So, having the complete structure of the ribosome could help scientists developing new antibiotics. One of this year's Nobel winners, Thomas Steitz, actually helped co-found a pharmaceutical company to design alternative antibiotics for drug- resistant infections. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And that is looking like it's going to be very successful. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I asked him how he thought winning the Nobel Prize would change his life. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Well, to be honest, I hope it doesn't. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Do you think you're going to go to work tomorrow? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Absolutely. I have to write a grant application. It's due very shortly. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In fact, he says, working on that application is what he had been planning to do today. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

ROBERT KRULWICH: It begins with a. . . (SOUNDBITE OF BANG AND CRASH)KRULWICH: Yeah, kind of thwack against your kitchen window or the wall of your house. So you step outside and there lying in the grass is a little bird. And when you lean over and you look closely, you see it's dead. So you look away. And then maybe a day, two days later, you pass by that very spot on your lawn and the corpse is gone. D: Mm-hmm. KRULWICH: Totally gone. . . D: Yeah. KRULWICH: . . . and you didn't move it. So where did it go? Well, one possibility, says Professor Bernd Heinrich at the University of Vermont, is you have just received the services of a very remarkable pair of beetles. D: Well, they are burying beetles. They are the undertakers of the small animals in the forest: the little birds and mice, rodents. KRULWICH: So if I'm a bird lying dead on a lawn, they would know that I'm there? D: Yeah. Very shortly after you die, you're going to emit some scent that they can smell apparently for miles. KRULWICH: And because natural recycling is a very competitive business. . . D: They have to get there before the flies can get it, before a raccoon or a crow or a raven picks it up. So they work very fast. KRULWICH: And these flying beetles are - how big are they? D: You know, as big as a big bumblebee. KRULWICH: Which is not very big, if you're trying to hoist a dead starling or a dead mouse on your back and lug it off to soft ground. But when these beetles - and it's a family business, it's a mom and pop kind of arrangement, when they get you where they want you, they start to dig. INSKEEP: They bury you. They start digging underneath you, removing the dirt and throwing it to the sides, until gradually, you start to sink down. KRULWICH: So, how long does it take them to bury a whole bird? INSKEEP: You know, in a night, and you're buried totally. KRULWICH: Then, says Professor Heinrich, in a kind of, I'm not quite sure how to put this, in a sort of happy moment, the two beetles will mate. . . INSKEEP: Yep. KRULWICH: . . . which produces beetle babies safely underground. . . INSKEEP: And they build a little nest for the larvae. KRULWICH: Mm-hmm. And then the parents munch on the bird or on the mouse and they chew the food on behalf of their children. INSKEEP: The young actually beg. They're sort of analogous to birds, to a pair of birds feeing their young. KRULWICH: And after a few days, those babies mature and they become flying beetles. And they take off, refueled with bits of mouse or bird. And they rejoin the neighborhood. INSKEEP: Yes, yes. KRULWICH: And it's just this kind of finish, says Professor Heinrich, dying and then being scattered up and about everywhere that he wants when he dies. No tight coffin for me, he says. INSKEEP: You know, being sealed up, totally removed from all the natural processes that normally occur with every animal on earth. It's very - somehow frightening. It seems unnatural. KRULWICH: But I think, don't most people find that being eaten is the thing that's frightening and a little - they don't want to get eaten by a. . . INSKEEP: No, I don't find that frightening at all. I find that comforting to be part of the eco-system. KRULWICH: And he's not alone. There's an old Lee Hays song, sung by the great Pete Seeger. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IN DEAD EARNEST (LEE'S COMPOST SONG)\")M: (Singing) If I should die before I wake, all my bone and sin you take. Put me in the compost pile. . . (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)M: (Singing) . . . decompose me for a while. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)KRULWICH: You laugh, but, you know, there are a lot of people who hate the idea of being decomposed. So. . . INSKEEP: Well, yeah, I don't think it's decompose that's the emphasis here, it's the grow and the compose. To be composed into grass, to be composed into ravens, to be composed into flowers and trees, you know, that's a comforting thought to me. KRULWICH: It's not like you're looking forward to the idea, though. INSKEEP: Well, I don't really relish being eating, anything like that. I think it's just part of the cost. And giving back, I realize I have killed untold hundreds of thousands to live. All of us have because we all live off other life. And just to remove ourselves totally so that nobody else can feed on us, just somehow it seems sacrilegious to me. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IN DEAD EARNEST (LEE'S COMPOST SONG)\")M: (Singing) All that I am will feed the trees and little fishes in the seas. When radishes and corn you munch, you may be having me for lunch. . . (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)KRULWICH: But when you choose to be buried in a tight coffin, says Professor Heinrich, you do lock yourself off from the trees and the animals that you know, the critters that you live with. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IN DEAD EARNEST (LEE'S COMPOST SONG)\")M: (Singing) Worms, water, sun will have their way. . . KRULWICH: Why not share yourself with the world that you know? He asks. INSKEEP: I find that comforting to be a part of the eco-system. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IN DEAD EARNEST (LEE'S COMPOST SONG)\")M: (Singing) . . . and then excretes me with a grin, chortling, there goes Lee again.

D: They have to get there before the flies can get it, before a raccoon or a crow or a raven picks it up. So they work very fast. KRULWICH: And these flying beetles are - how big are they? D: You know, as big as a big bumblebee. KRULWICH: Which is not very big, if you're trying to hoist a dead starling or a dead mouse on your back and lug it off to soft ground. But when these beetles - and it's a family business, it's a mom and pop kind of arrangement, when they get you where they want you, they start to dig. INSKEEP: They bury you. They start digging underneath you, removing the dirt and throwing it to the sides, until gradually, you start to sink down. KRULWICH: So, how long does it take them to bury a whole bird? INSKEEP: You know, in a night, and you're buried totally. KRULWICH: Then, says Professor Heinrich, in a kind of, I'm not quite sure how to put this, in a sort of happy moment, the two beetles will mate. . . INSKEEP: Yep. KRULWICH: . . . which produces beetle babies safely underground. . . INSKEEP: And they build a little nest for the larvae. KRULWICH: Mm-hmm. And then the parents munch on the bird or on the mouse and they chew the food on behalf of their children. INSKEEP: The young actually beg. They're sort of analogous to birds, to a pair of birds feeing their young. KRULWICH: And after a few days, those babies mature and they become flying beetles. And they take off, refueled with bits of mouse or bird. And they rejoin the neighborhood. INSKEEP: Yes, yes. KRULWICH: And it's just this kind of finish, says Professor Heinrich, dying and then being scattered up and about everywhere that he wants when he dies. No tight coffin for me, he says. INSKEEP: You know, being sealed up, totally removed from all the natural processes that normally occur with every animal on earth. It's very - somehow frightening. It seems unnatural. KRULWICH: But I think, don't most people find that being eaten is the thing that's frightening and a little - they don't want to get eaten by a. . . INSKEEP: No, I don't find that frightening at all. I find that comforting to be part of the eco-system. KRULWICH: And he's not alone. There's an old Lee Hays song, sung by the great Pete Seeger. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IN DEAD EARNEST (LEE'S COMPOST SONG)\") M: (Singing) If I should die before I wake, all my bone and sin you take. Put me in the compost pile. . . (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) M: (Singing) . . . decompose me for a while. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) KRULWICH: You laugh, but, you know, there are a lot of people who hate the idea of being decomposed. So. . . INSKEEP: Well, yeah, I don't think it's decompose that's the emphasis here, it's the grow and the compose. To be composed into grass, to be composed into ravens, to be composed into flowers and trees, you know, that's a comforting thought to me. KRULWICH: It's not like you're looking forward to the idea, though. INSKEEP: Well, I don't really relish being eating, anything like that. I think it's just part of the cost. And giving back, I realize I have killed untold hundreds of thousands to live. All of us have because we all live off other life. And just to remove ourselves totally so that nobody else can feed on us, just somehow it seems sacrilegious to me. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IN DEAD EARNEST (LEE'S COMPOST SONG)\") M: (Singing) All that I am will feed the trees and little fishes in the seas. When radishes and corn you munch, you may be having me for lunch. . . (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) KRULWICH: But when you choose to be buried in a tight coffin, says Professor Heinrich, you do lock yourself off from the trees and the animals that you know, the critters that you live with. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IN DEAD EARNEST (LEE'S COMPOST SONG)\") M: (Singing) Worms, water, sun will have their way. . . KRULWICH: Why not share yourself with the world that you know? He asks. INSKEEP: I find that comforting to be a part of the eco-system. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IN DEAD EARNEST (LEE'S COMPOST SONG)\") M: (Singing) . . . and then excretes me with a grin, chortling, there goes Lee again. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) KRULWICH: Robert Krulwich, NPR News.

I'm Guy Raz. Traffic noise and other sounds of city life have taken the romance away for Australia's urban frogs. Air conditioners, jackhammers, generators, they're all drowning out the mating calls of male frogs, and as a result, frog populations are plummeting in the country's urban areas. But there's hope, at least according to a scientist at the University of Melbourne. She says some frogs have figured out a way to work around the human interference in their love lives. From Sydney, Stuart Cohen has the story. (SOUNDBITE OF FROGS)STUART COHEN: That's the sound of a male southern brown tree frog looking for a date. It's music to the ears of a female southern brown tree frog. (SOUNDBITE OF FROGS)(SOUNDBITE OF TRAFFIC)COHEN: But add the sounds of nearby traffic, and Dr. Kirsten Parris of the University of Melbourne says the message just isn't getting out. KIRSTEN PARRIS: The distance over which a male frog can be heard is cut really dramatically by traffic noise from hundreds of meters in some instances, down to maybe only 20 or 50 meters. We're quite concerned that there are frogs out there that aren't getting together because the noise we're making is getting in the way. COHEN: So some frogs have come up with an interesting strategy for making themselves heard. PARRIS: We found that it's changing the pitch of its calls. So going higher up the frequency spectrum, being higher and squeakier, further away from the traffic noise, and this increases the distance over which it can be heard. COHEN: Here's the old call. (SOUNDBITE OF FROG)COHEN: And here's the new one. (SOUNDBITE OF FROG)COHEN: Now, that might sound like a pretty simple solution, but changing their calls to cope with a noisy environment is actually quite extraordinary for frogs. And while the males have figured out how to make themselves heard above the noise of the city, Dr. Parris says it may not be what the females are looking for. PARRIS: When females have a choice between two males calling, they tend to select the one that calls at a lower frequency because, in frogs, the frequency of a call is related to body size. So, the bigger frogs tend to call lower. (SOUNDBITE OF FROG)PARRIS: And so they also tend to be the older frogs, the guys perhaps with more experience, they know what they're doing, and the women are attracted to those. COHEN: In other words, the high talkers typically don't get the girls. PARRIS: That's right. And if it's very noisy, they can only hear a few of the males that are all calling in a group. So the ones they can choose from the number is reduced. It's like if you're in a noisy cocktail bar, for example, and there are men everywhere, you can only see and hear the three that are closest to you. You either choose to go with one of them, or you spend more energy going to search the room to find someone who looks a little bit more promising. And for females, the longer the time they spend hopping around looking for mates, the more time they're exposed to predators and the more energy they use. So there's a cost to spending a lot of time searching for mates. COHEN: Frog populations in Melbourne have dropped considerably in the seven years since Dr. Parris began her research. It's not just noise that's been the culprit. Climate change has brought a decade of drought to parts of Australia. Since frogs often serve as the environmental canary in a coal mine, Dr. Parris says their demise is worth paying attention to. PARRIS: Urban habitats are expanding very quickly. At the moment, they only cover about four percent of the Earth's terrestrial surface. And I think the fact that frogs and other animals that communicate acoustically, such as birds, are struggling in urban habitats shows us that the urban habitat is not a healthy place for people, either. Noisy places tend to lead to higher stress levels amongst people, difficulty sleeping, and the quality of life is reduced. (SOUNDBITE OF FROGS)COHEN: For NPR News, I'm Stuart Cohen in Sydney.

I'm Rebecca Roberts in Washington. Neal Conan is away. Randy Olson lived most of his life as a scientist, teaching marine biology. Then he decided he wanted to act, not just think. So he quit his tenured professor gig and went to Hollywood to become a filmmaker. Ever since, Olson has been focusing on the problems that scientists have when it comes to communicating their discoveries and explaining why we should care. In a new book, he argues that in our age, scientists can't just master the substance. They also need to worry about style. So if you're a scientist, does style matter? And if you follow the sciences, how important is style to you? Our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr. org. Joining us now from NPR West is Randy Olson. His new book is called \"Don't Be Such A Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style. \" Welcome back to the program, Randy. Mr. RANDY OLSON (Author, \"Don't Be Such A Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style\"): Great to be here, thanks. ROBERTS: So what's at stake here? Why is it important for scientists to be able to connect with the general audience? Mr. OLSON: Well, let me start with a question. What is the most important issue in the entire world of science today? Some people might think it's maybe mapping the human genome. Maybe it's exploring outer space. Maybe it's curing diseases. What I would suggest is the most important issue today is the anti-science movement that has emerged in the past 10 years. And it's gotten to the point now where it's being organized in a variety of different disciplines, attacking not just evolution and global-warming science but medicine, vaccination, all sorts of different topics. And it's becoming increasingly aggressive, and I don't see that the world of science is prepared to deal with it properly. ROBERTS: So why require scientists to be the messengers? Why not rely on science journalism or science museums or people who are better-trained communicators? Mr. OLSON: Well, it radiates all the way up through the system, but the scientists really are at the core of it all, and the scientists carry the big stick at the end of the day when it comes to these things. When scientists speak, the public does listen. And the things that I'm recommending here really just work on the communication skills the scientists already have to have as part of their profession, but they really don't like to talk about this very much. And science from the very beginning consists of two parts, the doing of science and the communicating of science. And whether you've been trained that way or not, there's no getting away from it. Even the average hired laboratory technician at the end of the day still has to communicate to somebody what went on that day. And so it faces everybody in the world of science, and they have a starting point there. It's just that it's increasingly important today, particularly in today's world of information overload. ROBERTS: Do you find that your scientist friends agree with you that the communicating part is as much a part of science as the doing part? Mr. OLSON: You know what? My scientist friends do all agree with me. (Soundbite of laughter) ROBERTS: How about your scientist enemies? Mr. OLSON: You know, I don't really personally know very well any scientists that disagree with me. But there's a bunch of them, you know, out there on the blogosphere, and they like to get together and have their little rage fests and say that I'm full of nonsense, but it's happening everywhere. I'm just the messenger, and particularly with this book. It's not so much that I'm trying to foist anything on anybody. One of my friends read it and said, you know, all it seems like you're doing in the book is you're just pointing to things and saying look at this. Have you thought about this? What about this? It's just trying to get - broaden the perspective of the science community to understand some of these dynamics. ROBERTS: So if we can agree, for the purposes of this conversation, that it is important for scientists to communicate, how do they best communicate, or what common mistakes do they make that show that their communicating skills are not ready for primetime now? Mr. OLSON: I think the starting point is accepting that style is increasingly important and understanding the divide between substance and style and the fact that two different scientists can give the same data set and present it at a meeting, and one of them can change everybody's mind, and the other one can just leave everybody thinking, well, that wasn't very interesting. And this is a thought process that for me goes back 30 years. From the very beginning of graduate school, my officemates and I, we'd go to science meetings, and we would see these speakers, scientists, who we knew were doing very mediocre work, and yet they would give great talks. And all of the sudden, everybody at the meeting was walking around saying this guy's doing amazing work, and we'd think, well, not really. We've read the papers. And we began to realize there is this element of style that becomes important, how well you communicate, and then you start to see it just in the style of writing. There were some scientists that were just incredible writers, that could take fairly mediocre, uninteresting data and put it into a context that almost editorializes it. And you slowly but surely begin to realize that it's a standard part of the practice. It's just increasingly important, as I say. ROBERTS: So do you think that's part of what's happening in what you talk about as the politicization of science, that the lack of a strong message from rigorous scientists is opening the door to well-communicating pseudo-scientists? Mr. OLSON: I think so, absolutely. You know, science as a profession tends to draw people more towards the objective side of it, and so if we can look at the two parts of it: the doing of science is the objective part, the communicating is the more subjective part that involves humans, and that gets difficult and messy and much more unpredictable. And the vast majority of scientists go into science because they want to deal with that objective side, and talk to almost any scientist. This is what they live for, is really, in essence, getting away from human beings, going into their laboratory to work with all their instruments. They're going out in the field and being out with nature and studying things where you get all the noise away from you. It's wonderful. When I was a scientist, that's what I lived for was going out to field labs and working in the field. They tend to shy away from the more social elements of it, and that includes politics and communication. And as a result, the entire field of science is not that savvy when it comes to politics and communication. ROBERTS: Thank you, by the way, for not pointing that I, as a supposedly professional communicator, just made up the word well-communicating. I appreciate you overlooking that. (Soundbite of laughter) ROBERTS: The - there are people who teach scientists how to talk. I had a former life as a science journalist, and I participated in a bunch of meetings where science journalists and scientists would get together, and the scientists would say you don't go in-depth enough. And we would say you don't, you know, feature things for a lay audience enough, and we'd try to meet halfway. Where do those programs fall short? Mr. OLSON: Well, I think that there are lots of efforts underway and plenty of programs that are making a start on it, and by the way, this is a time of change right now. And the world of science has been becoming increasingly humanized over the past five decades. You know, the world of science is not the sterile, robotic world that it once was in the 1950s, and that's good. It's just that I'm advocating for it to happen a little more rapidly because I think there's a crisis looming with the attacks on science. And in terms of what is being done for training, there are some workshops and things of that sort, but a lot of what my book is about is I went and did this strange journey, going off to Hollywood, and spent 15 years in writing classes, in acting classes and looking at things from a different perspective. And I think there's some things that could be of value to the science world but only if the scientists and even the science communicators are willing to open their minds up and broaden themselves enough to consider these alternative perspectives. ROBERTS: Let's take a call. This is Alberto(ph) in St. Louis, Missouri. Alberto, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION. ALBERTO (Caller): Hi, thank you very much. ROBERTS: Sure. ALBERTO: I'm calling because I am a scientist, have been for some time now. I'm currently finishing a Ph. D. program at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, but my previous life, my bachelor's degree was from Emerson College in communications. And we were required there to take speech, speech pathology, public speaking, all these things that I have not seen as any requirements in scientific programs, and yet we ask our scientists to go out and present and speak. And I don't know why we don't require these. ROBERTS: Yeah, how about requiring public speaking in science programs, Randy Olson? Mr. OLSON: That's starting to happen, and I think - when I did my Ph. D. , we did not have one single course or workshop or anything in speaking or writing or any of these communication skills. But there's a changing of priorities, and as I say, it's the choice between these two basic elements, how much resources you put into the doing of science, how much into the communicating. And when I was a graduate student, the communications stuff was just seen as almost frivolous, something that you just learned by kind of entrainment. You looked at the better speakers and tried to emulate them. You looked at the better writers and tried to do what they did. It just wasn't held up as that important. And more importantly, it was just sort of shunned as something that was superficial, but that's got to be changing today. And there are workshops happening of that sort, but - and yet there's not enough focus on innovation in terms of dealing with these problems of communication. And there is this challenge of people that are now questioning mainstream science and how to deal with it, and it's not clear what the answers are in some of those things. But the way you find those answers is through innovation, and there is no interest/support for innovation when it comes to communicating science to broad audiences. And that's been a long-term problem. ROBERTS: Well, also - and you get at this a lot in your book - they often have if not competing agendas, at least tangential agendas, that if the scientific research is all about depth and rigor and testing and accuracy, communication has a different prerogative. You know, it has to be about it being memorable, about it being funny, about it being meaningful. And sometimes that means leaving out some of the details or, you know, making them funny in a way that is not necessarily in line of the priorities of scientific research. Mr. OLSON: Well, that's all true, but the variable that's not being talked about is the variable of time. And time is not that much of the essence in research so much. There is a tendency or tradition for research science to move very slowly to make sure that everything is maintained at 100 percent accuracy, which is very, very important. But when it comes to communication, the media environment of our country is changing so rapidly, and only a year ago, nobody was talking about Twitter. And right now - I just produced a public service announcement on ocean conservation last week, and we released it on Thursday. And I was hoping a whole bunch of blogs would cover it, and only two or three did. So I went to an event on Friday thinking it was a disappointment, and everybody was coming up to me saying wow, everybody's talking about your public service announcement. And I said I didn't see it on the blogs. They said no, on Twitter. You know, it's all over Twitter, and it didn't even dawn on me that there is this new grapevine that's emerged, a whole new dynamic in the communication of things like science. And I don't see the science communication world responding on that kind of time scale that - the same sort of thing went on with the U. S. military in Iraq a couple of years ago. They began to realize there's been this age-old tradition of the Tuesday press conference that they would hold, where they'd gather all the information, and for several days in advance, it ran through all the channels, everybody approves it. And they began to realize that in doing it that way, by the time you got there to the press conference on Tuesday, everybody else had already blogged about these things and put videos on YouTube, and the metabolism was not keeping up with the media environment that's changing today, and again, I don't see that happening in the science world. It's still a very slow and sluggish machine. ROBERTS: I - we're going to have to take a break in a second, but when we come back, I want to get a little bit further into this issue of the difference between making something simple and accessible and dumbing it down, which some of your argument has been criticized for doing. We are talking with Randy Olson. The book is titled \"Don't Be Such A Scientist. \" More of your calls in a moment, 800-989-8255. You can also send us email. The address is talk@npr. org. I'm Rebecca Roberts. It's TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) ROBERTS: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Rebecca Roberts in Washington. In his new book, Randy Olson writes: A backlash has developed against science in disciplines ranging from evolution to global warming to mainstream medicine. An entire anti-science movement has emerged that truly does threaten our quality of life. Large groups of people are fighting against hard, cold, rational, data-based science, simply saying they don't care what the science says. Communication is not just one element in the struggle to make science relevant, he writes, it's the central element. The book is titled \"Don't Be Such A Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style. \" Randy Olson is a marine biologist turned filmmaker. He wrote and directed \"Flock of Dodos\" and \"Sizzle: A Global Warming Comedy. \" Whether you're a scientist or not, does style matter? The phone number here is 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr. org. And there's a conversation going on at our Web site, npr. org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. Randy Olson, some people have interpreted your book as an endorsement of inaccuracy, that you're saying style is more important than substance. I wanted to give you a chance to respond to that. Mr. OLSON: Yeah, well, the real essence of that is this concern of people saying that it's - I'm endorsing the idea of bending the science or bending the facts. That began last spring when I gave a talk at Arizona State that was posted on iTunes, and one of my friends sent me an email saying I liked your talk, but it sounded to me like you were advocating, quote, \"bending the science\" to tell a better story. And that kind of stunned me. And I went back and listened to the talk, and in the talk, I said verbatim, you know, I would never support anything short of 100 percent accuracy. And then the same thing cropped up just a week and a half ago, when the New Scientist reviewed my book, ended up coming out, the reviewer there said the same thing, that Randy Olson advises bending the facts. There's - and same thing. I ran to the book and opened it up, and sure enough, on Page 111 in the book, what I say is: I will never, ever endorse the idea of striving for anything less than 100 percent accuracy in the making of any film related to issues in the world of science. It couldn't have been stated any more clearly than that. In fact, today, they've got a letter to the editor from me pointing that out. But there's an important thing to learn here with this, which is: How are these people getting this impression? Because this is the divide between substance and style. The substance of what I am saying both in the book and in my talks is very explicit, 100 percent accuracy. And yet they're getting the impression that I'm saying, well, don't worry too much about the facts. And that comes from a number of different things, one of which is my style, my attitude, that I use humor, and sometimes I've got a little bit of a flippant attitude and things like that. And that sends a piece of information, a signal to them that actually, you know, he's not really that concerned about accuracy, and that's part of the communication divide. And the other thing I talk about in the book in great detail is the Al Gore film, which was less than 100 percent accurate. ROBERTS: \"An Inconvenient Truth. \" Mr. OLSON: \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" exactly, which had some flaws in it. And I talk about that, and they seemed to be picking up the signal from that, just by talking about that issue, that I'm somehow endorsing the idea of going with something less than 100 percent accurate, which, how much more explicitly could I write it? ROBERTS: Because you make the point that it was an enormously successful scientific venture, despite its inaccuracy. Mr. OLSON: That's right. I think it's a very fascinating case study here of these two films - and the major element they have in common is that Laurie David was the producer of two documentaries about global warming, and the first of which aired on HBO,. And it was full of scientists and 100 percent accurate, but it was kind of dry because of all the scientists. The second one was \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" and that one had no scientists in it. And it was much more lively, it had much better style, and that one changed the course of human history. You know, I think it's unquestionably the single-most powerful and important piece of environmental media ever produced. And you're left with a dilemma there. You know, which would you prefer to have your name on between the two: the one that was popular but not that accurate or the one that was really accurate but just that wasn't that popular? Hardly anybody saw the HBO film. And I don't know the answer, necessarily, on that. I pose it as a question in the book, but people are jumping to the conclusion that I'm somehow endorsing one direction or the other. ROBERTS: Well, it also does say something about the communication skills of scientists when Al Gore is the sexy option. Mr. OLSON: That is so true, and therein lies the problem. By 2005, the science world knew that global warming a very serious problem, but they just didn't know how to communicate it, and look at what happened. A bunch of people from Hollywood had to step in and say if you're not going to communicate it, we're going to do it for you. And they deserved the Oscar, and they deserved the Nobel Prize because they did get the word out there. But unfortunately, you know, in the end, it didn't really change the public opinion polls because unfortunately, the media itself was not as persuasive as it could've been. ROBERTS: Let's take a call from Jane(ph) in Lexington, Massachusetts. Jane, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION. MARK(ph) (Caller): Hello? ROBERTS: Hi, you're on the air. MARK: Hello? ROBERTS: Hi, Jane, you're on the air. MARK: If you're talking to me, I'm not Jane. (Soundbite of laughter) ROBERTS: Oh, well, tell us who you are then. MARK: My name is Mark Courtner(ph), and I'm calling from Tulsa, Oklahoma, and as a communicator and science, science person, I have a few observations. Number one: I think when it comes to how we train scientists, engineers, mathematicians and even people in undergraduate schools of business, they get next to none, next to zero help or courses required that teach them communication skills, whether they're verbal, or whether they're written. On the other hand, those that are in communication courses, your English majors and your journalism majors, are not made to take enough basic science so that they understand the scientific principle of research. And boy, this walked up and smacked me right between the eyes when I went to graduate school - and it was a master's program, master of science program, in a college of communications. And I had had probably 25 to 30 hours worth of physical and biological sciences before I went to grad school. And all of a sudden, everything they taught you in terms of how to write and how to communicate to the general public, you have to unlearn that so that you can write it, APA scientific speak, as if it's - everything you write is going to be reviewed by a peer journal. So I think as a scientist, you have to - you know, the number one thing of communication is to figure out, first of all, who your audience is. If you're going to write on a subject, and it's going to go into a popular magazine. . . Mr. OLSON: Get to the point. ROBERTS: Yeah, well, no. . . Mr. OLSON: Jimineez(ph). This is what I deal with when I give public talks, and I hate to be rude about it, but there's a story that I tell. Each of the chapters has a little anecdote at the beginning. And I tell one in there about when I was still a professor, and Spike Lee came and talked at the University of New Hampshire. And I got up there to ask him a question, and I turned it into a five-minute speech I gave him. And I started hearing this chorus around the auditorium of all the students chanting: get to the point, get to the point. And therein lies the problem with so much science communication. Scientists want to tell everything and go on and on like that. And this is where it's so crucial in today's communication environment, and this is where things can be learned from storytelling, is that what storytelling does teach you is the ability of how to pull the information together and solve these equations into short, concise deliveries of the same, basic, overall message. And that's what's crucial. ROBERTS: But I want to get to his point about know your audience because I think it's a valuable one. Not every audience comes with the same level of scientific knowledge, the same appetite for detail, and so it's not that every scientist needs to talk on a broadcast network to the largest possible audience. Mr. OLSON: That's very true. Oh, you're asking me? ROBERTS: I'm asking you. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. OLSON: I thought we were back to him. ROBERTS: No, he's gone. The communication. . . Mr. OLSON: Yeah, absolutely. You know, in the last chapter there, I talk about the need to be bilingual, and that's the essence of what you're saying. And you need to realize that you speak one language in the academic audience, and you speak a different language to the broad audience, and they're very distinctly different. And it doesn't work to take that broad language to your scientific meeting, and you see that happen sometimes with graduate students. They get up there, and they give a very elementary, simplistic talk, and you know, it's a disaster. And conversely, it doesn't work to take all your jargon and technical stuff out to the broader audience. ROBERTS: And even within the broader audience, there are levels of interest, levels of command of the topic. You just constantly have to gauge where your target is. Mr. OLSON: Absolutely, but the real divide is realizing that the broader audience deals more with style than with substance. And if you can understand that, you can take advantage of that, and you can communicate more in their mode, one of which is that the broader audience is much more visual. And at a science meeting, you can stand up there, and you can speak pure words, with no images whatsoever, and most of the audience will actually sit there. They've got the ability to listen to you. They're trained as academics to do that. But it doesn't work with the broader audience. You have to use visual imagery and things like that to reach inside of people, and you have to show them much more than tell them. And that's one of the central divides that really becomes counter-intuitive when you've been trained as an academic in lecturing, basically, because that's what you do as a professor. You get up and you lecture audiences. ROBERTS: We have an email from Arthur(ph) in Little Rock who says: I appreciate your guest's notion of promoting style in science literature. However, isn't the overwhelming ignorance about scientific knowledge in the vast majority of Americans more to blame for the disinterest and distrust of science than the lack of luster and polished speech in the scientific community? Mr. OLSON: Well, both things are to blame, how it's communicated and the lack of knowledge of the broader audience. But I can tell you, the chance of changing the ladder on a short timescale is pretty slim. I mean, it's going to take a long time to get a more scientifically literate, broad audience. But we could change the power and the skill through which science is communicated on a very short time schedule. And that involves the, you know, the chapters of the four books, \"Don't Be So Unlikeable,\" creating more likeable voices for the science world. And the most important chapter, I think, is the third one, \"Don't Be Such a Poor Storyteller,\" because what's fascinating is that storytelling is woven into the fabric of a science career, the profession of science, and it just isn't talked about. The word is almost taboo. It's seen as, you know, storytelling - oh, you're talking about telling big fables and things like that. And yet, when you look at the way in which scientists communicated from the beginning of time - for example, a scientific paper is written in three acts in the same way that a theatrical play might be written. The first act is the introduction. The second act is the methods and the results. And the third act is the discussion. They follow the same dynamics. That first act is the exposition in a research paper. The methods and results is where everything happens. And then the third act is the synthesis and the discussion. It's all there in the science world. And another fascinating thing, when scientists write a paper, they undergo this process of editing, where they'll edit it for weeks and weeks and they'll go through 15 different drafts. And they don't really have any qualms with that word, editing. And yet, if you talked about storytelling, which is a lot of what they're doing - they're rearranging the pieces of information in the paper to put them into a more logical structure so people can follow it. But if you label that as storytelling, they get freaked out, like, oh, I don't want to do that. ROBERTS: Let's hear from Francis in Mount Shasta, California. Francis, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION. FRANCIS (Caller): Good evening. Fascinating show, and I certainly agree with some of the previous callers. ROBERTS: In what terms, Francis? FRANCIS: So I - this is a redneck area of Northern California. And what I use to engage these people, is to come to their level, and I use what I call a catch fact or an icon exploder to get their attention. And then I give them a quick 30-second commercial on the aspect of science that I think they need to hear. ROBERTS: Give me an example. Mr. OLSON: That's great. FRANCIS: Well, for some of the icon exploders I use are: Anyone who hates spotted owls hates loggers and timbering, and that gets their attention. Or if I'm in a religious crowd, I say: Jesus would not poison the poor, or a good Samaritan gives his neighbor health care. And this gets their attention, then you give them a 30-second commercial. Mr. OLSON: That is exactly what the entire book is about. Thank you very much. That - 10 years ago, I did a short film with a bunch of faculty at USC, and one of whom from the Annenberg School of Communication, Tom Hallahan, mentioned this simple little principle, which is like what you're talking about. He said, it's as simple as this, two things: arouse and fulfill. You need to arouse the interest of your audience, and then once they're interested, you need to fulfill their expectations. And that is the basics of it. And unfortunately, the science world is really good with the fulfillment side, but the arousal part is tough. And that, in a lot of ways, is the reason why scientists do need artists, quite often. Artists are the reverse. They're really good at arousing people, but sometimes they don't have the message. And the same with Hollywood. Hollywood is wonderful and powerful at arousing the interest of the public, but a lot of times they don't quite have the message there to deliver. So that's where you need these partnerships. ROBERTS: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. We have an email from George in Frazier Park, California, who says, as a volunteer editor for Wikipedia, a few months ago I attempted to simplify the Wiki article on introduction to quantum mechanics, and developed a new, more simplified article called, \"Basic Concepts of Quantum Mechanics. \" I'm a journalist. The more technical Wiki fiends were outraged at its simplicity and demanded its removal. The battle is still going on. Doesn't your guest think that most folks get their science info from Wikipedia these days, and shouldn't the articles be more inviting? (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. OLSON: Yeah. But I wonder if you couldn't just set up the basic fork-in-the-road there at the beginning of the article: Here's the version for people that want a broader version and here's the one for the aficionados, because that is the standard dilemma that run into. And, you know, I've thought in recent years, some science organization or some foundation should put together an award for courage with the simplification of science, because I've watched some of my science peers and colleagues over the years, some of whom are really good at taking global patterns or things like that that they see in the oceans and standing up and saying, here's the general pattern. And as soon as they do, there are all these what I call ankle biters that come running along and just start tearing him to pieces. Well, you know, technically, it doesn't work here, here and here. And after awhile, you get to the point where you get tired of being attacked by all those folks, and yet we need scientists who've got the courage to stand up there and simplify it, because that's the way the broader communication does work. ROBERTS: We have time for one last call. This is Don in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Don, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION. DON (Caller): Hi. Thank you for having me on. I wanted to go back to one of the basic education issues that the author mentioned. I teach in the writing across the curriculum program at MIT, which integrates writing program, lectures and the technical courses. And as your guest said, yeah, I've almost never heard anybody on the scientific or technical faculty say that communication doesn't matter. What I see, though, is that when it's going - when communications instruction is going cost technical faculty something, chiefly time, then things become a little bit more difficult. These are very important skills except, when you say, well, I need this hour, this week. And at that point, it's a much more difficult sell for us. Mr. OLSON: Right. Yeah. Absolutely. And that's - therein lies the overall large-scale issue, which is the world of scientists is going to have to wake up and realize they're being attacked in this anti-science movement, and the time is going to have to come where you're going to have to take away resources away from the doing of science and put it into this communication stuff. And I had this happened 10 years ago with some of the marine biologist friends of mine that started contacting me. And they were saying themselves, enough with the research. We've got enough data to show the way in which the oceans are being ravaged. What we need is to start convincing some of these people. And the same thing's going on with the global warming right now. Two months ago, I spoke to one of the top guys from the IPCC, who was saying the same thing. You know, why is it we've got all the science that shows us the patterns, and yet the public is not responding to this? That's where it comes back to the - the communication effort has not been powerful enough. And there are ways to get these things across, but it does involve innovation. And there are some innovative things that are happening these days. And things like, you know, there's a science film festival next week in New York City. It's the first time ever. There's now a major called the Imagine Science Film Festival, and my film \"Sizzle\" is going to be in it next Friday night, by the way. If you're in New York City, come to the screening. It'll be fun. And that's an innovation. There's also a new program that the National Academy of Science has started with Hollywood called the Science and Entertainment Exchange that I've set 20 years out here watching science groups come here and fail over and over again. This is the first time I've seen something come together that's really working, is very logical, and I think partly because it originated from within Hollywood. So, there is a slow change happening, and some innovation happening, but there's not a large-scale agenda to accept the importance of this communication. ROBERTS: Randy Olson, thanks so much for joining us. Mr. OLSON: Oh, thanks. Great to be here. ROBERTS: Randy Olson joined us from our studios at NPR West. He was a scientist, now he's a filmmaker, and his new book is called \"Don't Be Such a Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style. \" Coming up, we'll talk about evolution of monsters and how \"Where the Wild Things Are\" made it safe to love scary creatures. Tell us what monsters have stuck with you: 800-989-8255. You can also drop us email. The address is talk@npr. org. I'm Rebecca Roberts. It's TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  REBECCA ROBERTS, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Rebecca Roberts in Washington. Neal Conan is away.  Randy Olson lived most of his life as a scientist, teaching marine biology. Then he decided he wanted to act, not just think. So he quit his tenured professor gig and went to Hollywood to become a filmmaker. Ever since, Olson has been focusing on the problems that scientists have when it comes to communicating their discoveries and explaining why we should care.  In a new book, he argues that in our age, scientists can't just master the substance. They also need to worry about style. So if you're a scientist, does style matter? And if you follow the sciences, how important is style to you? Our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr. org. Joining us now from NPR West is Randy Olson. His new book is called \"Don't Be Such A Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style. \" Welcome back to the program, Randy.  Mr. RANDY OLSON (Author, \"Don't Be Such A Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style\"): Great to be here, thanks.  ROBERTS: So what's at stake here? Why is it important for scientists to be able to connect with the general audience?  Mr. OLSON: Well, let me start with a question. What is the most important issue in the entire world of science today? Some people might think it's maybe mapping the human genome. Maybe it's exploring outer space. Maybe it's curing diseases.  What I would suggest is the most important issue today is the anti-science movement that has emerged in the past 10 years. And it's gotten to the point now where it's being organized in a variety of different disciplines, attacking not just evolution and global-warming science but medicine, vaccination, all sorts of different topics. And it's becoming increasingly aggressive, and I don't see that the world of science is prepared to deal with it properly.  ROBERTS: So why require scientists to be the messengers? Why not rely on science journalism or science museums or people who are better-trained communicators?  Mr. OLSON: Well, it radiates all the way up through the system, but the scientists really are at the core of it all, and the scientists carry the big stick at the end of the day when it comes to these things. When scientists speak, the public does listen. And the things that I'm recommending here really just work on the communication skills the scientists already have to have as part of their profession, but they really don't like to talk about this very much.  And science from the very beginning consists of two parts, the doing of science and the communicating of science. And whether you've been trained that way or not, there's no getting away from it. Even the average hired laboratory technician at the end of the day still has to communicate to somebody what went on that day. And so it faces everybody in the world of science, and they have a starting point there. It's just that it's increasingly important today, particularly in today's world of information overload.  ROBERTS: Do you find that your scientist friends agree with you that the communicating part is as much a part of science as the doing part?  Mr. OLSON: You know what? My scientist friends do all agree with me.  (Soundbite of laughter)  ROBERTS: How about your scientist enemies?  Mr. OLSON: You know, I don't really personally know very well any scientists that disagree with me. But there's a bunch of them, you know, out there on the blogosphere, and they like to get together and have their little rage fests and say that I'm full of nonsense, but it's happening everywhere. I'm just the messenger, and particularly with this book. It's not so much that I'm trying to foist anything on anybody. One of my friends read it and said, you know, all it seems like you're doing in the book is you're just pointing to things and saying look at this. Have you thought about this? What about this? It's just trying to get - broaden the perspective of the science community to understand some of these dynamics.  ROBERTS: So if we can agree, for the purposes of this conversation, that it is important for scientists to communicate, how do they best communicate, or what common mistakes do they make that show that their communicating skills are not ready for primetime now?  Mr. OLSON: I think the starting point is accepting that style is increasingly important and understanding the divide between substance and style and the fact that two different scientists can give the same data set and present it at a meeting, and one of them can change everybody's mind, and the other one can just leave everybody thinking, well, that wasn't very interesting. And this is a thought process that for me goes back 30 years. From the very beginning of graduate school, my officemates and I, we'd go to science meetings, and we would see these speakers, scientists, who we knew were doing very mediocre work, and yet they would give great talks. And all of the sudden, everybody at the meeting was walking around saying this guy's doing amazing work, and we'd think, well, not really. We've read the papers.  And we began to realize there is this element of style that becomes important, how well you communicate, and then you start to see it just in the style of writing. There were some scientists that were just incredible writers, that could take fairly mediocre, uninteresting data and put it into a context that almost editorializes it. And you slowly but surely begin to realize that it's a standard part of the practice. It's just increasingly important, as I say.  ROBERTS: So do you think that's part of what's happening in what you talk about as the politicization of science, that the lack of a strong message from rigorous scientists is opening the door to well-communicating pseudo-scientists?  Mr. OLSON: I think so, absolutely. You know, science as a profession tends to draw people more towards the objective side of it, and so if we can look at the two parts of it: the doing of science is the objective part, the communicating is the more subjective part that involves humans, and that gets difficult and messy and much more unpredictable.  And the vast majority of scientists go into science because they want to deal with that objective side, and talk to almost any scientist. This is what they live for, is really, in essence, getting away from human beings, going into their laboratory to work with all their instruments. They're going out in the field and being out with nature and studying things where you get all the noise away from you.  It's wonderful. When I was a scientist, that's what I lived for was going out to field labs and working in the field. They tend to shy away from the more social elements of it, and that includes politics and communication. And as a result, the entire field of science is not that savvy when it comes to politics and communication.  ROBERTS: Thank you, by the way, for not pointing that I, as a supposedly professional communicator, just made up the word well-communicating. I appreciate you overlooking that.  (Soundbite of laughter)  ROBERTS: The - there are people who teach scientists how to talk. I had a former life as a science journalist, and I participated in a bunch of meetings where science journalists and scientists would get together, and the scientists would say you don't go in-depth enough. And we would say you don't, you know, feature things for a lay audience enough, and we'd try to meet halfway. Where do those programs fall short?  Mr. OLSON: Well, I think that there are lots of efforts underway and plenty of programs that are making a start on it, and by the way, this is a time of change right now. And the world of science has been becoming increasingly humanized over the past five decades. You know, the world of science is not the sterile, robotic world that it once was in the 1950s, and that's good. It's just that I'm advocating for it to happen a little more rapidly because I think there's a crisis looming with the attacks on science.  And in terms of what is being done for training, there are some workshops and things of that sort, but a lot of what my book is about is I went and did this strange journey, going off to Hollywood, and spent 15 years in writing classes, in acting classes and looking at things from a different perspective. And I think there's some things that could be of value to the science world but only if the scientists and even the science communicators are willing to open their minds up and broaden themselves enough to consider these alternative perspectives.  ROBERTS: Let's take a call. This is Alberto(ph) in St. Louis, Missouri. Alberto, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.  ALBERTO (Caller): Hi, thank you very much.  ROBERTS: Sure.  ALBERTO: I'm calling because I am a scientist, have been for some time now. I'm currently finishing a Ph. D. program at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, but my previous life, my bachelor's degree was from Emerson College in communications. And we were required there to take speech, speech pathology, public speaking, all these things that I have not seen as any requirements in scientific programs, and yet we ask our scientists to go out and present and speak. And I don't know why we don't require these.  ROBERTS: Yeah, how about requiring public speaking in science programs, Randy Olson?  Mr. OLSON: That's starting to happen, and I think - when I did my Ph. D. , we did not have one single course or workshop or anything in speaking or writing or any of these communication skills. But there's a changing of priorities, and as I say, it's the choice between these two basic elements, how much resources you put into the doing of science, how much into the communicating. And when I was a graduate student, the communications stuff was just seen as almost frivolous, something that you just learned by kind of entrainment.  You looked at the better speakers and tried to emulate them. You looked at the better writers and tried to do what they did. It just wasn't held up as that important. And more importantly, it was just sort of shunned as something that was superficial, but that's got to be changing today. And there are workshops happening of that sort, but - and yet there's not enough focus on innovation in terms of dealing with these problems of communication. And there is this challenge of people that are now questioning mainstream science and how to deal with it, and it's not clear what the answers are in some of those things. But the way you find those answers is through innovation, and there is no interest/support for innovation when it comes to communicating science to broad audiences. And that's been a long-term problem.  ROBERTS: Well, also - and you get at this a lot in your book - they often have if not competing agendas, at least tangential agendas, that if the scientific research is all about depth and rigor and testing and accuracy, communication has a different prerogative. You know, it has to be about it being memorable, about it being funny, about it being meaningful. And sometimes that means leaving out some of the details or, you know, making them funny in a way that is not necessarily in line of the priorities of scientific research.  Mr. OLSON: Well, that's all true, but the variable that's not being talked about is the variable of time. And time is not that much of the essence in research so much. There is a tendency or tradition for research science to move very slowly to make sure that everything is maintained at 100 percent accuracy, which is very, very important. But when it comes to communication, the media environment of our country is changing so rapidly, and only a year ago, nobody was talking about Twitter.  And right now - I just produced a public service announcement on ocean conservation last week, and we released it on Thursday. And I was hoping a whole bunch of blogs would cover it, and only two or three did. So I went to an event on Friday thinking it was a disappointment, and everybody was coming up to me saying wow, everybody's talking about your public service announcement. And I said I didn't see it on the blogs. They said no, on Twitter. You know, it's all over Twitter, and it didn't even dawn on me that there is this new grapevine that's emerged, a whole new dynamic in the communication of things like science. And I don't see the science communication world responding on that kind of time scale that - the same sort of thing went on with the U. S. military in Iraq a couple of years ago.  They began to realize there's been this age-old tradition of the Tuesday press conference that they would hold, where they'd gather all the information, and for several days in advance, it ran through all the channels, everybody approves it. And they began to realize that in doing it that way, by the time you got there to the press conference on Tuesday, everybody else had already blogged about these things and put videos on YouTube, and the metabolism was not keeping up with the media environment that's changing today, and again, I don't see that happening in the science world. It's still a very slow and sluggish machine.  ROBERTS: I - we're going to have to take a break in a second, but when we come back, I want to get a little bit further into this issue of the difference between making something simple and accessible and dumbing it down, which some of your argument has been criticized for doing. We are talking with Randy Olson. The book is titled \"Don't Be Such A Scientist. \" More of your calls in a moment, 800-989-8255. You can also send us email. The address is talk@npr. org. I'm Rebecca Roberts. It's TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  ROBERTS: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Rebecca Roberts in Washington. In his new book, Randy Olson writes: A backlash has developed against science in disciplines ranging from evolution to global warming to mainstream medicine. An entire anti-science movement has emerged that truly does threaten our quality of life. Large groups of people are fighting against hard, cold, rational, data-based science, simply saying they don't care what the science says. Communication is not just one element in the struggle to make science relevant, he writes, it's the central element.  The book is titled \"Don't Be Such A Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style. \" Randy Olson is a marine biologist turned filmmaker. He wrote and directed \"Flock of Dodos\" and \"Sizzle: A Global Warming Comedy. \"  Whether you're a scientist or not, does style matter? The phone number here is 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr. org. And there's a conversation going on at our Web site, npr. org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION.  Randy Olson, some people have interpreted your book as an endorsement of inaccuracy, that you're saying style is more important than substance. I wanted to give you a chance to respond to that.  Mr. OLSON: Yeah, well, the real essence of that is this concern of people saying that it's - I'm endorsing the idea of bending the science or bending the facts. That began last spring when I gave a talk at Arizona State that was posted on iTunes, and one of my friends sent me an email saying I liked your talk, but it sounded to me like you were advocating, quote, \"bending the science\" to tell a better story. And that kind of stunned me. And I went back and listened to the talk, and in the talk, I said verbatim, you know, I would never support anything short of 100 percent accuracy. And then the same thing cropped up just a week and a half ago, when the New Scientist reviewed my book, ended up coming out, the reviewer there said the same thing, that Randy Olson advises bending the facts. There's - and same thing. I ran to the book and opened it up, and sure enough, on Page 111 in the book, what I say is: I will never, ever endorse the idea of striving for anything less than 100 percent accuracy in the making of any film related to issues in the world of science.  It couldn't have been stated any more clearly than that. In fact, today, they've got a letter to the editor from me pointing that out. But there's an important thing to learn here with this, which is: How are these people getting this impression? Because this is the divide between substance and style.  The substance of what I am saying both in the book and in my talks is very explicit, 100 percent accuracy. And yet they're getting the impression that I'm saying, well, don't worry too much about the facts. And that comes from a number of different things, one of which is my style, my attitude, that I use humor, and sometimes I've got a little bit of a flippant attitude and things like that. And that sends a piece of information, a signal to them that actually, you know, he's not really that concerned about accuracy, and that's part of the communication divide.  And the other thing I talk about in the book in great detail is the Al Gore film, which was less than 100 percent accurate.  ROBERTS: \"An Inconvenient Truth. \"  Mr. OLSON: \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" exactly, which had some flaws in it. And I talk about that, and they seemed to be picking up the signal from that, just by talking about that issue, that I'm somehow endorsing the idea of going with something less than 100 percent accurate, which, how much more explicitly could I write it?  ROBERTS: Because you make the point that it was an enormously successful scientific venture, despite its inaccuracy.  Mr. OLSON: That's right. I think it's a very fascinating case study here of these two films - and the major element they have in common is that Laurie David was the producer of two documentaries about global warming, and the first of which aired on HBO,. And it was full of scientists and 100 percent accurate, but it was kind of dry because of all the scientists.  The second one was \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" and that one had no scientists in it. And it was much more lively, it had much better style, and that one changed the course of human history. You know, I think it's unquestionably the single-most powerful and important piece of environmental media ever produced. And you're left with a dilemma there.  You know, which would you prefer to have your name on between the two: the one that was popular but not that accurate or the one that was really accurate but just that wasn't that popular? Hardly anybody saw the HBO film. And I don't know the answer, necessarily, on that. I pose it as a question in the book, but people are jumping to the conclusion that I'm somehow endorsing one direction or the other.  ROBERTS: Well, it also does say something about the communication skills of scientists when Al Gore is the sexy option.  Mr. OLSON: That is so true, and therein lies the problem. By 2005, the science world knew that global warming a very serious problem, but they just didn't know how to communicate it, and look at what happened. A bunch of people from Hollywood had to step in and say if you're not going to communicate it, we're going to do it for you. And they deserved the Oscar, and they deserved the Nobel Prize because they did get the word out there. But unfortunately, you know, in the end, it didn't really change the public opinion polls because unfortunately, the media itself was not as persuasive as it could've been.  ROBERTS: Let's take a call from Jane(ph) in Lexington, Massachusetts. Jane, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.  MARK(ph) (Caller): Hello?  ROBERTS: Hi, you're on the air.  MARK: Hello?  ROBERTS: Hi, Jane, you're on the air.  MARK: If you're talking to me, I'm not Jane.  (Soundbite of laughter)  ROBERTS: Oh, well, tell us who you are then.  MARK: My name is Mark Courtner(ph), and I'm calling from Tulsa, Oklahoma, and as a communicator and science, science person, I have a few observations. Number one: I think when it comes to how we train scientists, engineers, mathematicians and even people in undergraduate schools of business, they get next to none, next to zero help or courses required that teach them communication skills, whether they're verbal, or whether they're written.  On the other hand, those that are in communication courses, your English majors and your journalism majors, are not made to take enough basic science so that they understand the scientific principle of research. And boy, this walked up and smacked me right between the eyes when I went to graduate school - and it was a master's program, master of science program, in a college of communications. And I had had probably 25 to 30 hours worth of physical and biological sciences before I went to grad school. And all of a sudden, everything they taught you in terms of how to write and how to communicate to the general public, you have to unlearn that so that you can write it, APA scientific speak, as if it's - everything you write is going to be reviewed by a peer journal.  So I think as a scientist, you have to - you know, the number one thing of communication is to figure out, first of all, who your audience is. If you're going to write on a subject, and it's going to go into a popular magazine. . .  Mr. OLSON: Get to the point.  ROBERTS: Yeah, well, no. . .  Mr. OLSON: Jimineez(ph). This is what I deal with when I give public talks, and I hate to be rude about it, but there's a story that I tell. Each of the chapters has a little anecdote at the beginning. And I tell one in there about when I was still a professor, and Spike Lee came and talked at the University of New Hampshire. And I got up there to ask him a question, and I turned it into a five-minute speech I gave him. And I started hearing this chorus around the auditorium of all the students chanting: get to the point, get to the point.  And therein lies the problem with so much science communication. Scientists want to tell everything and go on and on like that. And this is where it's so crucial in today's communication environment, and this is where things can be learned from storytelling, is that what storytelling does teach you is the ability of how to pull the information together and solve these equations into short, concise deliveries of the same, basic, overall message. And that's what's crucial.  ROBERTS: But I want to get to his point about know your audience because I think it's a valuable one. Not every audience comes with the same level of scientific knowledge, the same appetite for detail, and so it's not that every scientist needs to talk on a broadcast network to the largest possible audience.  Mr. OLSON: That's very true. Oh, you're asking me?  ROBERTS: I'm asking you.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. OLSON: I thought we were back to him.  ROBERTS: No, he's gone. The communication. . .  Mr. OLSON: Yeah, absolutely. You know, in the last chapter there, I talk about the need to be bilingual, and that's the essence of what you're saying. And you need to realize that you speak one language in the academic audience, and you speak a different language to the broad audience, and they're very distinctly different. And it doesn't work to take that broad language to your scientific meeting, and you see that happen sometimes with graduate students. They get up there, and they give a very elementary, simplistic talk, and you know, it's a disaster. And conversely, it doesn't work to take all your jargon and technical stuff out to the broader audience.  ROBERTS: And even within the broader audience, there are levels of interest, levels of command of the topic. You just constantly have to gauge where your target is.  Mr. OLSON: Absolutely, but the real divide is realizing that the broader audience deals more with style than with substance. And if you can understand that, you can take advantage of that, and you can communicate more in their mode, one of which is that the broader audience is much more visual.  And at a science meeting, you can stand up there, and you can speak pure words, with no images whatsoever, and most of the audience will actually sit there. They've got the ability to listen to you. They're trained as academics to do that. But it doesn't work with the broader audience. You have to use visual imagery and things like that to reach inside of people, and you have to show them much more than tell them. And that's one of the central divides that really becomes counter-intuitive when you've been trained as an academic in lecturing, basically, because that's what you do as a professor. You get up and you lecture audiences.  ROBERTS: We have an email from Arthur(ph) in Little Rock who says: I appreciate your guest's notion of promoting style in science literature. However, isn't the overwhelming ignorance about scientific knowledge in the vast majority of Americans more to blame for the disinterest and distrust of science than the lack of luster and polished speech in the scientific community?  Mr. OLSON: Well, both things are to blame, how it's communicated and the lack of knowledge of the broader audience. But I can tell you, the chance of changing the ladder on a short timescale is pretty slim. I mean, it's going to take a long time to get a more scientifically literate, broad audience. But we could change the power and the skill through which science is communicated on a very short time schedule.  And that involves the, you know, the chapters of the four books, \"Don't Be So Unlikeable,\" creating more likeable voices for the science world. And the most important chapter, I think, is the third one, \"Don't Be Such a Poor Storyteller,\" because what's fascinating is that storytelling is woven into the fabric of a science career, the profession of science, and it just isn't talked about. The word is almost taboo. It's seen as, you know, storytelling - oh, you're talking about telling big fables and things like that.  And yet, when you look at the way in which scientists communicated from the beginning of time - for example, a scientific paper is written in three acts in the same way that a theatrical play might be written. The first act is the introduction. The second act is the methods and the results. And the third act is the discussion. They follow the same dynamics. That first act is the exposition in a research paper. The methods and results is where everything happens. And then the third act is the synthesis and the discussion. It's all there in the science world.  And another fascinating thing, when scientists write a paper, they undergo this process of editing, where they'll edit it for weeks and weeks and they'll go through 15 different drafts. And they don't really have any qualms with that word, editing. And yet, if you talked about storytelling, which is a lot of what they're doing - they're rearranging the pieces of information in the paper to put them into a more logical structure so people can follow it. But if you label that as storytelling, they get freaked out, like, oh, I don't want to do that.  ROBERTS: Let's hear from Francis in Mount Shasta, California. Francis, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.  FRANCIS (Caller): Good evening. Fascinating show, and I certainly agree with some of the previous callers.  ROBERTS: In what terms, Francis?  FRANCIS: So I - this is a redneck area of Northern California. And what I use to engage these people, is to come to their level, and I use what I call a catch fact or an icon exploder to get their attention. And then I give them a quick 30-second commercial on the aspect of science that I think they need to hear.  ROBERTS: Give me an example.  Mr. OLSON: That's great.  FRANCIS: Well, for some of the icon exploders I use are: Anyone who hates spotted owls hates loggers and timbering, and that gets their attention. Or if I'm in a religious crowd, I say: Jesus would not poison the poor, or a good Samaritan gives his neighbor health care. And this gets their attention, then you give them a 30-second commercial.  Mr. OLSON: That is exactly what the entire book is about. Thank you very much. That - 10 years ago, I did a short film with a bunch of faculty at USC, and one of whom from the Annenberg School of Communication, Tom Hallahan, mentioned this simple little principle, which is like what you're talking about. He said, it's as simple as this, two things: arouse and fulfill. You need to arouse the interest of your audience, and then once they're interested, you need to fulfill their expectations. And that is the basics of it.  And unfortunately, the science world is really good with the fulfillment side, but the arousal part is tough. And that, in a lot of ways, is the reason why scientists do need artists, quite often. Artists are the reverse. They're really good at arousing people, but sometimes they don't have the message. And the same with Hollywood. Hollywood is wonderful and powerful at arousing the interest of the public, but a lot of times they don't quite have the message there to deliver. So that's where you need these partnerships.  ROBERTS: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  We have an email from George in Frazier Park, California, who says, as a volunteer editor for Wikipedia, a few months ago I attempted to simplify the Wiki article on introduction to quantum mechanics, and developed a new, more simplified article called, \"Basic Concepts of Quantum Mechanics. \" I'm a journalist. The more technical Wiki fiends were outraged at its simplicity and demanded its removal. The battle is still going on. Doesn't your guest think that most folks get their science info from Wikipedia these days, and shouldn't the articles be more inviting?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. OLSON: Yeah. But I wonder if you couldn't just set up the basic fork-in-the-road there at the beginning of the article: Here's the version for people that want a broader version and here's the one for the aficionados, because that is the standard dilemma that run into. And, you know, I've thought in recent years, some science organization or some foundation should put together an award for courage with the simplification of science, because I've watched some of my science peers and colleagues over the years, some of whom are really good at taking global patterns or things like that that they see in the oceans and standing up and saying, here's the general pattern.  And as soon as they do, there are all these what I call ankle biters that come running along and just start tearing him to pieces. Well, you know, technically, it doesn't work here, here and here. And after awhile, you get to the point where you get tired of being attacked by all those folks, and yet we need scientists who've got the courage to stand up there and simplify it, because that's the way the broader communication does work.  ROBERTS: We have time for one last call. This is Don in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Don, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.  DON (Caller): Hi. Thank you for having me on. I wanted to go back to one of the basic education issues that the author mentioned. I teach in the writing across the curriculum program at MIT, which integrates writing program, lectures and the technical courses. And as your guest said, yeah, I've almost never heard anybody on the scientific or technical faculty say that communication doesn't matter. What I see, though, is that when it's going - when communications instruction is going cost technical faculty something, chiefly time, then things become a little bit more difficult. These are very important skills except, when you say, well, I need this hour, this week. And at that point, it's a much more difficult sell for us.  Mr. OLSON: Right. Yeah. Absolutely. And that's - therein lies the overall large-scale issue, which is the world of scientists is going to have to wake up and realize they're being attacked in this anti-science movement, and the time is going to have to come where you're going to have to take away resources away from the doing of science and put it into this communication stuff. And I had this happened 10 years ago with some of the marine biologist friends of mine that started contacting me.  And they were saying themselves, enough with the research. We've got enough data to show the way in which the oceans are being ravaged. What we need is to start convincing some of these people. And the same thing's going on with the global warming right now. Two months ago, I spoke to one of the top guys from the IPCC, who was saying the same thing. You know, why is it we've got all the science that shows us the patterns, and yet the public is not responding to this? That's where it comes back to the - the communication effort has not been powerful enough. And there are ways to get these things across, but it does involve innovation. And there are some innovative things that are happening these days.  And things like, you know, there's a science film festival next week in New York City. It's the first time ever. There's now a major called the Imagine Science Film Festival, and my film \"Sizzle\" is going to be in it next Friday night, by the way. If you're in New York City, come to the screening. It'll be fun. And that's an innovation.  There's also a new program that the National Academy of Science has started with Hollywood called the Science and Entertainment Exchange that I've set 20 years out here watching science groups come here and fail over and over again. This is the first time I've seen something come together that's really working, is very logical, and I think partly because it originated from within Hollywood. So, there is a slow change happening, and some innovation happening, but there's not a large-scale agenda to accept the importance of this communication.  ROBERTS: Randy Olson, thanks so much for joining us.  Mr. OLSON: Oh, thanks. Great to be here.  ROBERTS: Randy Olson joined us from our studios at NPR West. He was a scientist, now he's a filmmaker, and his new book is called \"Don't Be Such a Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style. \"  Coming up, we'll talk about evolution of monsters and how \"Where the Wild Things Are\" made it safe to love scary creatures.

(Soundbite of opening soda can) SIEGEL: For me it was a seltzer. The main ingredient in soft drinks, carbonated water, has been around for a couple of centuries, but scientists are still trying to figure out exactly how we experience the fizz of bubbly drinks. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has this story on a new study examining cells in our tongues that respond to carbonation. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: Lots of people drink sodas every day, but Nick Ryba is not one of them. He says he probably drinks less than one carbonated beverage per week. Dr. NICK RYBA (Senior Investigator, National Institutes of Health): I'm a simple person. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. RYBA: I drink ordinary tap water normally. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But he studies how people perceive tastes and became curious about the sensations produced by liquids loaded with carbon dioxide. Dr. RYBA: When you drink a carbonated drink, you really think that you're detecting the bubbles bursting on your tongue, don't you? GREENFIELDBOYCE: But Ryba says there's some evidence that the fizzy feeling isn't just bursting bubbles. People have been asked to drink carbonated beverages inside pressure chambers, set up so that no bubbles can form. Dr. RYBA: The sensation you get is actually the same. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And that wasn't the only hint that bubbles weren't the whole story. Dr. RYBA: Another finding that was very interesting was that carbon dioxide produced strong nerve responses in taste nerves. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That intrigued Ryba, who works at the National Institutes of Health. He collaborated with Charles Zuker, who's now at Columbia University, to explore how carbon dioxide acts on the taste system. First, using mice, they confirmed that plain old club soda did generate a response in a nerve that carries signals from the tongue's taste receptor cells. Then they did similar experiments using mice that don't have specific cells required to sense different tastes, like sour or sweet. Dr. RYBA: And in particular, we found that mice that are unable to respond to sour stimuli were unable to detect carbon dioxide with their taste system. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So, these sour-sensing cells must be involved in the sensation of fizzy drinks. It turns out that these cells have an enzyme on their surface that interacts with carbon dioxide in a way that creates acidity. The cell then responds as it normally does to sour flavors. Dr. RYBA: So, that's why we think carbon dioxide causes a taste response. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The results have just been reported in the journal Science. Earl Carstens has studied carbonation at the University of California, Davis. He says when he drinks soda, he usually thinks of it as a burning or tingling sensation. And he says carbonation is known to stimulate nerves for things like touch or pain. Professor EARL CARSTENS (University of California, Davis): But this on paper says there's also a distinctive taste component that you should be aware of, too. And it's distinctly different from just regular water. There's a carbonation taste, which is probably a slightly sour - has a sour component to it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says he's not surprised that this particular acid-producing enzyme plays a role. This enzyme is blocked by a drug for altitude sickness. And it's long been known that mountain climbers taking the drug can be disappointed when they get to the top and gulp a celebratory drink. Prof. CARSTENS: They notice that when they drank beer or other fizzy drinks, the drinks no longer had a fizzy or tingling sensation, and they tended to taste like dishwater. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Carstens says it's not clear why the body's sensory system might have evolved to have a carbonation detector on taste cells. Prof. CARSTENS: I guess one reason if there's, like, rotting food that's giving off CO2 gas, you might want to be able to detect that. Otherwise, it's not entirely clear. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The deeper meaning of carbonation may be a puzzle for researchers, but for beverage manufacturers, its value is a no-brainer. Mr. JOHN SICHER (Editor and Publisher, Beverage Digest): Americans spend about $73 billion a year on sodas. GREENFIELDBOYCE: John Sicher is editor and publisher of a trade publication called Beverage Digest. He says if you look at the kind of things Americans drink. . . Mr. SICHER: The largest category is carbonated soft drinks. It's about twice the size of the second biggest category, which is beer, then bottled water and then milk. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So, even if scientists say that carbonation triggers sour tastes, pain receptors and perhaps even some kind of ancient alarm for rotting food, there must be some reason we keep reaching for fizzy drinks.

I'm Ira Flatow. Ms. SARAH PALIN (Former Republican Governor, Alaska): Sometimes, these dollars, they go to projects having little or nothing to do with the public good. Think, like, fruit fly research in Paris, France. I kid you not. FLATOW: You might remember that from last year's election, Sarah Palin mocking fruit fly research. Well, fruit flies, as you may know, are widely used in science, and neuroscience specifically, to study everything from brain tumors to addiction. And that's because, compared to people, fruit flies have a much simpler brain. It's easy to map out and understand how the parts work together. Tweaking just a few neurons can cause a fly to alter its behavior in revealing ways, and scientists are reporting in the journal Cell this week that they did just that. By manipulating a handful of fruit fly brain cells, they were able to create false memories in the flies. Why would they want to do that? Here to talk about it is Gero Miesenbock. He's professor of physiology at the University of Oxford in England. Thanks for talking with us today. Professor GERO MIESENBOCK (Physiology, Oxford University): It's a pleasure. FLATOW: Why did you do this to fruit flies? Prof. MIESENBOCK: We want to understand sort of the fundamental problem that every animal that moves about faces. Life for a fly and for you and for me is a string of choices, and to make these choices properly, we have to evaluate our options and choose the best course of actions, and we get it wrong, learn from our mistakes. This is a very, very important function of the brain. Some argue it's the most important thing that the brain does, but very little is known about how the brain does precisely that. FLATOW: You mean learning from our mistakes. Prof. MIESENBOCK: Exactly. FLATOW: And so what did you do with the fruit flies to learn about the mistakes they would make? Prof. MIESENBOCK: Well, we tried to identify the cells that tell the fly's brain that the animal has done something wrong and then store that information in memory so that it can be used when a similar situation recurs in the future and hopefully help avoid committing the same mistake again. FLATOW: So you created, basically, a false memory in the fruit fly's brain, that it had done something wrong. Prof. MIESENBOCK: Exactly. FLATOW: And how did you do that? Prof. MIESENBOCK: We developed several years ago a method that allows us to remotely control groups of neurons that are genetically defined in the brains of animals with light. And in this case, we have used this method to search for the neurons that would send so-called error signals, signals that tell the fly that something has gone wrong. The logic of the experiment was that if we managed to send the appropriate error signal while the fly was doing something, in this case smelling an odor, the flies would avoid that odor if we had hit the right neurons and turned them on. FLATOW: So how did you hit the right neurons? How were you able to modify the right neurons? Prof. MIESENBOCK: We relied on genetics to target different sets of neurons that produce the transmitter dopamine, which is probably familiar to many of the listeners as the key - a key ingredient in the development of Parkinson's Disease and also a key reward-signaling mechanism in humans. In flies, it also has something to do with reward and punishment, but its polarity is flipped. So in contrast to vertebrates, dopamine is a punishing signal in flies. And so we narrowed our search to the dopamine-producing neurons in the fly's brain - there's about 300 of them, 300 out of a total of 100,000 brain cells - and made different groups of these 300 neurons light-sensitive. And we observed that remote-controlling some groups led to learned behavior, was able to instruct memories, in other words, whereas remote-controlling different groups was not able to instruct memories. And then by elimination, we narrowed the responsible set of cells down to just a dozen. FLATOW: So you found a dozen cells. You genetically engineered these cells so that they would respond to laser light. Prof. MIESENBOCK: Yes. FLATOW: And then you shone the light on the fruit flies. Prof. MIESENBOCK: Yes. FLATOW: And so they released the dopamine, thinking that they had done something bad. Prof. MIESENBOCK: Exactly. FLATOW: And so they avoided - by shining the light on it, you created this memory, so they avoided something that wasn't even there. They thought they avoided it. Prof. MIESENBOCK: No, they avoided the odor. So the odor was the sensory cue that was paired with the error signal. So when the odor was presented again, next time without the light, the fly indicated through its avoidance that it had learned that negative association. FLATOW: Wow. And you just had to use 12 cells to do this? Prof. MIESENBOCK: Yes. It's likely that the actual number of cells that's responsible for this instructive effect is a subset of those 12 cells. There was a study published in the same issue of Cell from a different group, a professor called Waddell at the University of Massachusetts, that studied the motivational use of memory in flies. And their study also zeroed in on just the same 12 cells. So it seems that there is functional subdivision within that cluster of 12 neurons. FLATOW: Could you find other neurons to make the fruit flies do other things by just shining the light on them? Prof. MIESENBOCK: Well, obviously, all neurons do different kinds of things in the brain. So you can - by rendering different types of neurons light-sensitive, you can elicit different forms for behavior. For example, last year, my lab published a study in which we had rendered cells that express the principal sex-determination factor in the brain light-sensitive. There's about 2,000 of these neurons, and when we turned these neurons on in male flies, they started to exhibit the typical male courtship behavior. They stuck out one wing and started to sing a song that normally female flies find irresistible. Now the big surprise came when we did the same manipulation in female flies. Females obviously never go through male-specific courtship. But lo and behold, we were able to turn that circuit on artificially and make female flies behave as if they were males. So there's a latent capacity for male-like behavior wired into the female brains. FLATOW: Did you shine this in their eyes? Where did you have to shine the laser beam? Prof. MIESENBOCK: You shine it onto the entire animal. So the light is intense enough to penetrate the cuticle, the chitinous exoskeleton of the fly, and to activate whatever brain neurons are genetically sensitized to respond to the beam of light. FLATOW: Can you do this in higher forms of animals? Prof. MIESENBOCK: Yes, this entire field, which sort of originated with our first study in 2005 and the methodological papers in the years before, has really exploded in the past several years. It now even has a name. It's called optogenetics, and there's many, many different kinds of laboratory animals that are being studied using optogenetic techniques, from nematodes to flies to fish to mice and even to primates. FLATOW: So it's like a having a remote control for your TV. When you want the animal to do something, you just shine the light on them. Prof. MIESENBOCK: That's essentially, yes, what it is. It's an ability to control the function of targeted brain circuits with exquisite precision without destroying the normal function of the brain. FLATOW: And how high, you know - you know what I'm fishing for here, is the human connection. Prof. MIESENBOCK: I think the human connection is quite far off. There's so many ethical, regulatory and technical hurdles that have to be overcome. Don't forget that one of the key elements in what we do is a genetic modification. It's genetic engineering. So in the human case, that would mean gene therapy, that you would have to be infected with a virus that then delivers a light-sensitive protein to some nerve cells in the brain. And as we all know, there's significant regulatory barriers at the moment to gene therapy in humans. FLATOW: But you could do it in lower animals. Prof. MIESENBOCK: Yes, you can. And it has been done. FLATOW: Yeah, and you could do it in, I don't know, just pick an animal - a dog, a cat, something like that? Prof. MIESENBOCK: Yes, I think that there's no barrier to - there's no technical barrier to doing that in any kind of animal. FLATOW: And what would you like to study most in these animals, to do this? Prof. MIESENBOCK: For me, I mean, I think one of the hallmarks of intelligence is the ability to adapt to a changing environment and not to make the same - to keep making the same mistake many, many times. FLATOW: Right. Prof. MIESENBOCK: The - how such intelligent, adaptive behavior emerges from physical interactions of components, nerve cells that are by themselves unintelligent, I think is a big mystery, and that's a problem that I'd like to study. FLATOW: Could you work on addiction or overcoming addiction if you could find out which of the cells are involved? Prof. MIESENBOCK: Of course. I mean, what makes addictive substances so powerful is that they play just with our endogenous mechanisms of reward and punishment, right? So by manipulating these mechanisms and finding out more about how they work and how they are normally controlled, that, of course, has major implications for many more applied fields of science. FLATOW: So you say this is a whole new field that's opening now. Prof. MIESENBOCK: I do think so, yes. FLATOW: Optogenetics. We should keep an ear, an eye out for that? Prof. MIESENBOCK: Yeah. FLATOW: Yeah. And well, we - so now that you've done this fruit fly experiment, and you're, like, known as the king of the fruit flies, where do you go from here? Prof. MIESENBOCK: We would really like to understand how those 12 cells are controlled, right? I mean, what we have found is essentially the messenger. We have found the channel through which something in the fly's brain tells some other part in the fly's brain that the contents of memory should be updated, that some new information should be written into memory. But what we do not know yet is the author of the message that's being sent by those 12 cells. That's our next challenge, to try and understand what the signals are that lie upstream of these 12 dopamine-producing neurons and control their activity. FLATOW: Can you actually trace it back upstream? Prof. MIESENBOCK: We're working on it. So I - optimistically, I would say yes. I hope we are able to trace those signals back upstream. And what that should then reveal is a fundamental learning algorithm. There's a huge literature in diverse fields such as psychology, engineering, machine learning, that deals with so-called neuromorphic circuits, so circuits constructed from neuron-like components that calculate such error signals. But all of these circuits are, at the moment, just speculation. There's no biological example that has been solved, and that's quite ironic, considering that biology is the inspiration for all this sort of artificial adaptive intelligence. FLATOW: Well, we wish you good luck. Prof. MIESENBOCK: Thank you. FLATOW: Dr. Miesenbock, thank you for taking time to be with us. Prof. MIESENBOCK: My pleasure. FLATOW: Gero Miesenbock is a professor of physiology at the University of Oxford in England. We're going to take a short break and switch gears and come back and talk a little lunacy here, talk about the moon and all these - you've been hearing a lot of stuff that's been going on with space probes and whatever on the moon. We'll wrap it all up. Stay with us. We'll be right back. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow.  Ms. SARAH PALIN (Former Republican Governor, Alaska): Sometimes, these dollars, they go to projects having little or nothing to do with the public good. Think, like, fruit fly research in Paris, France. I kid you not.  FLATOW: You might remember that from last year's election, Sarah Palin mocking fruit fly research. Well, fruit flies, as you may know, are widely used in science, and neuroscience specifically, to study everything from brain tumors to addiction. And that's because, compared to people, fruit flies have a much simpler brain. It's easy to map out and understand how the parts work together.  Tweaking just a few neurons can cause a fly to alter its behavior in revealing ways, and scientists are reporting in the journal Cell this week that they did just that. By manipulating a handful of fruit fly brain cells, they were able to create false memories in the flies. Why would they want to do that?  Here to talk about it is Gero Miesenbock.

Scientists have been studying just what happens in our brains during that half second and there's a lot of activity found in the part of the brain that's the subject of our next report. It's a part of the brain called Broca's area. Now after more than a century of effort, scientists have found some clues to what happens there. NPR's Jon Hamilton has the story. JON HAMILTON: A lot of what we know about how speech works in the brain comes from a French doctor in the 19th century. His name was Pierre Paul Broca. Dr. NED SAHIN (Harvard University; University of California, San Diego): He had two patients and they both had a very strange pattern of mental problems. HAMILTON: Ned Sahin is a researcher at UC San Diego and Harvard University. Sahin has spent a lot of time pondering Dr. Broca and his two famous patients. Dr. SAHIN: They were aware of their situations. They could see and hear. They could even understand what people were asking them, but they couldn't answer back. HAMILTON: Broca suspected brain damage, so after his patients died he took a look. Dr. SAHIN: The patients both had holes in the brain and they were in roughly the same area, and so that area became known as Broca's area. HAMILTON: It lies just beneath your left temple. Somehow, this part of the brain helps us speak, but scientists haven't learned much more than that despite, lots of autopsies and studies using high tech brain scans. What they needed was a way to directly monitor the cells in Broca's area in real time. Sahin says you can do that but you have to put wires into a person's brain. Dr. SAHIN: And humans don't like wires in their head. HAMILTON: So Broca's area remained a mystery until Sahin and a team of researchers came across three very cooperative patients with epilepsy. All three were going to get surgery to remove some of the brain tissue causing their seizures. To plan that surgery, doctors had put dozens of electrodes in their brains. Sahin says the three patients agreed to play a sort of word game on a computer while they were wired up but still conscious. Dr. SAHIN: So for instance, they might see the word walk, and then the sentence frame, every day they, with a blank, or yesterday they, with a blank. And the job was to say the form of the word that was correct for that blank. HAMILTON: Meanwhile, the scientists monitored what was happening in Broca's area and precisely when it happened. Sahin says at 200 milliseconds - that's two-tenths of a second after seeing the words - a spike in brain activity suggested they were figuring out what the words meant. Dr. SAHIN: At 320 milliseconds we saw evidence of grammatical processing. And then at 450 milliseconds we saw processing for the sound form of the word queuing up what exactly to say and getting ready to say it. HAMILTON: The results show that Broca's area is involved in several major processes related to speech. Nina Dronkers works at the VA's Northern California Health Care System and treats patients who have language problems caused by brain damage. She says the new study supports what a lot of researchers already suspected. Dr. NINA DRONKERS (VA Northern California Health Care System): More and more we're thinking of Broca's area as a region that can do many different things, and the nice thing about this study is that it shows that even these different functions can emerge within an extremely short timeframe. HAMILTON: Dronkers is also intrigued by the study's finding that brain cells working on grammar, for example, seem to be in almost the same place as cells working on comprehension or speech production. Dr. DRONKERS: So they might serve one function at one point in time and another function at another point in time. HAMILTON: Scientists think Broca's area probably isn't limited to speech. It may help us process music as well. The new study appears in the journal Science. Jon Hamilton, NPR News.

I'm Scott Simon. Last month's earthquakes in Indonesia and Samoa were a brutal reminder of the force of seismic shifts. It hit close to home in the San Francisco Bay area. Twenty years ago today it had experienced a magnitude 7. 1 earthquake and 63 people died. Lives could've been saved with an earthquake early warning system, but such a system is still several years away in the United States. From member station KQED in San Francisco, Amy Standen reports. AMY STANDEN: If you ever find yourself with five seconds in front of you \u2014 five seconds before you know that a major earthquake is about to hit \u2014 Richard Allen says this is almost certainly what you should do\u2026 Mr. RICHARD ALLEN (University of California at Berkeley): The best thing you want to do is get under a table. It's that simple. Nothing else. Get under a table. STANDEN: Allen is a seismologist with the University of California at Berkeley. He spent the past decade working on a system that can warn people when a major earthquake is on its way. The system, which receives federal funding through the Department of the Interior, enters a final testing phase this fall, and researchers say it could be up and running by 2013. It's based on a network of seismic monitoring stations \u2014 some 400 of them \u2014 that are hidden around the state. (Soundbite of banging) STANDEN: This narrow concrete vault extends 100 feet into a rocky hillside above the UC Berkeley campus. Like many of these monitoring stations, it was built during the Cold War to eavesdrop on nuclear bomb tests around the world. Mr. ALLEN: So we're now at right at the very back of the vault. The seismic instrumentation is in fact underneath these silver boxes, which is, again, more thermal insulation to keep the instrumentation very stable. There are three components back there, so we record the ground motion in the vertical up-down direction, east-west direction and then north-south direction. STANDEN: These instruments are so sensitive that even turning out the lights in here could throw their measurements off. They're housed in bell jars, wrapped in layers of foam padding. When a quake hits, they record not just its strength and duration but the different kinds of energy that comprise it. Allen says these P waves and S waves, as they're called, are the key to prediction. Mr. ALLEN: The first energy is P waves. And so it travels much more rapidly through the subsurface, but has very little energy associated with it. The second type of energy is called S waves. It has a lot more energy, it does a lot of the damage, most of the damage, but also it travels more slowly. So you detect the P waves and then you say something about the S waves that are going to follow. STANDEN: When Allen and other scientists talk about earthquake early warning, they aren't talking about hours, or even minutes. They're talking about tens of seconds \u2014 or fewer, depending on your proximity to the epicenter. Mr. ALLEN: Unfortunately, our faults go right beneath the metropolitan regions. And if you're right above the earthquake, even with the early-warning system, you probably won't get a warning. But if you're 10 kilometers, 20 kilometers, 30 kilometers away, then you start to get some warning. STANDEN: In the Loma Prieta quake two decades years ago, residents in Oakland \u2014 where most of the deaths were \u2014 could have had about 20 seconds of warning, had the system been in place. But in future quakes, the warning could be as few as five or 10 seconds. Still, there are things you could do. Mr. DAVID OPPENHEIMER (United States Geological Survey): Elevators stopping at the next floor when the door is opening. STANDEN: That's David Oppenheimer with the United States Geological Survey. Mr. OPPENHEIMER: Alarms going off in schools saying, you know, duck and cover, with a voice telling you what to do. STANDEN: And how about hospitals? Mr. OPPENHEIMER: The one example that I always like to give, because people cringe, is that, you know, if somebody's performing cataract surgery on you, and obviously you would like the surgeon to remove the scalpel away from your face. STANDEN: Oppenheimer says he can imagine cell phone applications that pick up P-wave alerts and start counting down until the quake hits. Mr. OPPENHEIMER: Ten, nine, eight, shaking will arrive in five seconds. STANDEN: But what if it doesn't? Oppenheimer says false alarms, which have happened in Japan, are inevitable. It's one of the reasons that early warning hasn't always been an easy sell here in the states. Again, Richard Allen. Mr. ALLEN: I think it's fair to say that funding has been a real struggle. And there's a lot of interest immediately after an earthquake, but that interest wanes very rapidly. STANDEN: This is starting to change. Last month, the project received five million in stimulus dollars to replace old computers in the monitoring stations. Allen and Oppenheimer say the new computers can process quake data faster, adding five seconds of warning time. Still, some potential users ask if the warning is worth the investment it would take to implement it. Mr. PAUL OVERSEIR (Bay Area Rapid Transit): It depends on how much advance notice we have. STANDEN: Paul Overseir is an assistant general manager for the Bay Area Rapid Transit. He says with a few seconds' warning, trains can begin to slow down \u2014 but not by much. Mr. OVERSEIR: There's, of course, a question about whether a train doing 64 miles an hour is substantially safer than a train doing 70 miles an hour. STANDEN: Allen and Oppenheimer say they could increase warning times by adding monitors to more rural parts of the state. The price tag for such an expansion: $80 million - about the same amount, they argue, that it might cost to do earthquake-proof retrofits to just one or two large buildings.

It's called the All Sky Map, and this week, the space agency announced a discovery that could shed light on an area at the outer edge of our solar system. It's a border region that protects us from cosmic rays. Richard Fisher is the director of the Heliophysics Division at NASA, and he's here in the studio with me. Welcome. Mr. RICHARD FISHER (Director, Heliophysics Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration): Well, thanks. RAZ: Some exciting news out of NASA this week. The All Sky Map was unveiled. What is it? Mr. FISHER: Well, the All Sky Map is the output of something called the Interstellar Boundary Explorer Mission. And this is an experiment that was designed to make a picture of the boundary between our galaxy and our Solar System. And the reason there is such a thing is, if you can imagine the circumstance, where we have a solar wind, and what that means is it's a wind off our star - and if you have wanted to try and visualize this, think about standing here on Earth and you had a wind that blew straight up off the planet - and the sun blows a great, big bubble around our solar system, and it's a protective bubble. It convects magnetic field out to the edge of this, and it produces a magnetic shield around our solar system. RAZ: That shield is the heliosphere. Mr. FISHER: That shield is the heliosphere. RAZ: And it protects us from? Mr. FISHER: From cosmic radiation from the galaxy. It absorbs about 68, 75 percent of all the galactic, cosmic radiation, and we're shielded from the rest of it by the Earth's magnetic field. So here on Earth, we're pretty safe from this stuff. RAZ: So in 2008, NASA launched the IBEX, the Interstellar Boundary Explorer, the spacecraft that takes photographs way out. What did it capture? Mr. FISHER: Well, it captures an image that looks like what it would be if you were inside of a bubble, if you can imagine such a thing, and you would have to look around. You'd have to turn your head every direction in order to see all the features. And so we have a way of plotting this on a single map, and it's kind of an oval map; it's a projection. And what it shows is that there is a stripe across the inside of this bubble. The question is: what is that stripe? It's completely unexpected. What I had anticipated, and I'm kind of a traditional physicist, what I'd expected would be that we'd see it bright on one side and dark on the other because material was piling up on the side that's plowing through the galaxy, and that is visualized to a certain extent, but this other feature is - has another characteristic which is very curious, which is aligned, and it's perpendicular to what we think is the direction of the magnetic field of the galaxy. RAZ: Well, what does it tell us about our place in the galaxy? Mr. FISHER: Well, I think that what it tells us is that first of all, there's a little bit of come down to Earth and be a little bit humble because all of a sudden, expectation doesn't fit preconceived theory. RAZ: But what was the expectation? Mr. FISHER: The expectation was there would be a teardrop-shaped structure, sort of a bubble plowing into the galactic wind on one side and trailing off sort of like a teardrop on the other side. RAZ: Is it the farthest out we've ever seen? Mr. FISHER: Oh, no. We see much further out than this, but it's the first time we've seen this structure. There's been no way to visualize it previously. It isn't actually light. It's - we're detecting particles that come from that region. So it's as if you had a bank of cloud that was emitting some kind of particle, like a raindrop, only in this case, it's emitting neutral hydrogen. And so the neutral hydrogen detectors make this image for us. RAZ: So we don't actually know what this stripe does? Mr. FISHER: Well, we know it's made out of hydrogen, out of protons that recombine with electrons. We don't know the process by which it is draped over the heliosphere, and we also don't understand exactly why it has brighter spots in it. It's not just a uniform kind of stripe. It's got intensity and density in it. And what in the world makes that? That's - it's going to be fascinating to see. RAZ: Where do you go from here? I mean, how can you continue or how will you continue to study this stripe in the heliosphere? Mr. FISHER: if there are changes in it, we certainly know that the changes can come from either changes in the galactic wind blowing on us or changes in the solar wind that blows this bubble. And we can follow the solar wind pretty well, and we'll straighten out causality. What are these changes, and why are they there? I think the second thing is that it just says in previous models, we're not using the right physics, and the physicists are going to have to go back and consider what physical processes may be left out of these calculations. And my guess is that within a couple years, we'll have a pretty good explanation of this. RAZ: Richard Fisher is the director of the Heliophysics Division at NASA. Thanks so much for coming in. Mr. FISHER: Oh, thank you so much. It's a great pleasure to be here.

I'm Melissa Block in California. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris in Washington. Here's some real music to your ears. Musical training can improve your hearing. That's the conclusion of several studies presented today in Chicago before the Society for Neuroscience. The studies found that serious musicians can perceive and remember sounds better than the rest of us. As NPR's Jon Hamilton reports, it's not because they have better ears. (Soundbite of music) JON HAMILTON: Sounds come in through the ears, but they travel through our nerves and get interpreted by our brains. Nina Kraus, who directs the Auditory Neuroscience Lab at Northwestern University, says that means your hearing can change even if your ears don't. Dr. NINA KRAUS (Director, Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory, Northwestern University): Your hearing system becomes tuned by the experiences that you have had with sound throughout your life. HAMILTON: Kraus figured the hearing systems of musicians ought to be more finely tuned than those of other people. So, she tested their ability to do something that's challenging for most of us: understanding what someone is saying in a noisy room. Fifteen classically trained musicians and 16 non-musicians listened to a simple sentence. First, they heard it without any background noise. Unidentified Woman: Sugar is very sweet. HAMILTON: Then, against a backdrop of quiet conversations. (Soundbite of quiet conversations) Unidentified Woman: Sugar is very sweet. HAMILTON: And finally, competing with some pretty loud conversations. (Soundbite of loud conversations) Unidentified Woman: Sugar is very sweet. HAMILTON: Standard hearing tests had shown that the musicians' ears weren't any more sensitive than other listeners. But Kraus knew that their brains, shaped by years of training, had become very good at a similar task. Dr. KRAUS: A musician will be listening to the sound of his own instrument, even though many other instruments are playing. HAMILTON: Not unlike separating one voice from a crowd of voices. Dr. KRAUS: So we wondered, would this skill, which involves your hearing, would it transfer from the music domain into the speech domain? And resoundingly, it does. HAMILTON: Kraus says a closer look at musical brains may explain why. Tests show that sounds produce stronger electrical signals in musician's brain stems. And these signals offer a more accurate representation of pitch, timing and tone quality - three things that help us pick out a single voice in a noisy room. Another study presented at the Neuroscience meeting suggests musical training could help children who are struggling with language. Ms. DANA STRAIT (Doctoral Candidate, Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory, Northwestern University): These kids seem to be impaired in the very areas that musicians excel. HAMILTON: Dana Strait is a PhD candidate in Kraus' lab at Northwestern. She's also studied the oboe and piano for many years. Strait asked musicians and non-musicians to take a simple test. Ms. STRAIT: They were asked to click a button every time they heard a specific sound, but not click a button to other sounds that they might hear. HAMILTON: Musicians not only responded faster and more accurately, they were able to stay focused longer. Many children with dyslexia and other language problems do poorly on tests like this. Strait thinks musical training offers a way to improve their performance. Ms. STRAIT: Musical experience can change how our brain interacts with sounds. It's almost like the brain's able to better pay attention to sound and better extract meaning from sound. HAMILTON: That makes sense if you think about the brain and the hearing system as if they were muscles. Mark Jude Tramo is a neurologist at Harvard and directs the Institute for Music and Brain Science. Dr. MARK JUDE TRAMO (Director, Institute for Music and Brain Science, Harvard University): The way a tennis player is very good at arm wrestling with their tennis hand because their forearms are so strong, a musician who exercises that part of the brain is going to be able to do better on any task that involves auditory concentration.

Millions of people in the U. S. have lost the ability to see from diseases that attack the retina. Now, scientists say they have brought back some vision in people with retinal damage. One team did it using stem cells, another using electronics. NPR's Jon Hamilton has this story on research by both of those teams. It was presented in Chicago today at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience. JON HAMILTON: Doctors have gotten pretty good at fixing problems with the cornea, where light enters the eye, and they're experts at replacing the lens, which focuses that light. But it's a different story with the retina, a layer of cells at the back of the eye that transforms images of the world into nerve impulses. Robert Aramant of the University of California-Irvine says a patient with retinal damage doesn't have many options. Dr. ROBERT ARAMANT (University of California-Irvine): That is so terrible. A doctor can only say that you will probably be more and more blind, and you might be totally blind in 10, 15 years. HAMILTON: Since the 1980s, Aramant has been part of a team working to fix retinas damaged by diseases, including macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa. And for several years now, the team has been treating patients using fetal retinal cells. Their approach is to retrieve an intact sheet of retinal cells and transplant that sheet into a damaged eye. Dr. ARAMANT: And these cells develop later on to the layers of a normal retina. HAMILTON: Aramant says they've treated just 10 patients so far because of funding constraints, but he says seven of those patients got better, including one woman whose vision went from 20/800, which is nearly blind, to 20/200, which is good enough to do most daily tasks. Dr. ARAMANT: And she improved her life considerably. She actually could play a computer game, and she could write emails. She could write big letters of Reader's Digest, and she took up her hobby to paint ceramics. HAMILTON: A very different approach to restoring vision comes from scientists at a California firm called Second Sight Medical Products. Brian Mech, a vice president with a PhD in material science, says the company has created a sort of bionic eye. Mr. BRIAN MECH (Vice President, Second Sight Medical Products): The subject wears a pair of glasses that has a video camera in them, and then we wirelessly transmit the video signal to an implant that sits on the eye, and that implant then talks to an array of electrodes that are inside the eye on the retina. HAMILTON: Those electrodes do what the old retina can't anymore: send electrical signals to the brain that allow sight. You can see an animation of how the device works at npr. org. Mech says it usually takes patients' brains a while to make sense of the new signals. Mr. MECH: They learn to use the device better over time so that someone that's had it for a year will do better than they did at three months. HAMILTON: The artificial eye replaces millions of retinal cells with just 60 electrodes. Mech says that means vision is rudimentary. Mr. MECH: A very large percentage of people can find doors and move towards them, and similarly, a large number can follow a line on a floor. HAMILTON: Mech says patients tend to get emotional when they realize they can see even a little bit. Mr. MECH: A lot of crying, a lot of smiling. You know, it's a sensory input that they haven't had in a very long time, and so they're excited. HAMILTON: At the neuroscience meeting in Chicago, Second Sight presented a study showing that patients could tell which direction an object was moving. Also at the meeting, scientists presented studies showing ways to create new, light-sensitive molecules in the eye and how to use stem cells to grow specific types of retinal cells.

I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. And finally this hour, we're going to meet a man who has spent his long career trying to solve the ultimate agricultural conundrum. We sometimes think of the earth as providing us with an endless bounty of food, but the usual farming practices can't work forever. Soil is constantly washing away. What's left is losing the nutrients it needs to sustain crops. NPR's Richard Harris has this profile from a farm in Salina, Kansas. RICHARD HARRIS: When you first meet Wes Jackson, you're likely to assume he's just another good-ol'-boy farmer from the Plains. His hands are broad and strong, a plaid shirt covers his beefy belly and he sounds every bit like the native son of Kansas that he is. (Soundbite of festival) HARRIS: So, good morning. Mr. WES JACKSON (Founder Land Institute, Prairie Festival): Good morning, Harris. HARRIS: How are you? Mr. JACKSON: Richard Harris. How art thou? HARRIS: I'm well. Mr. JACKSON: Yeah. HARRIS: On this autumn day, the 73-year-old Wes Jackson is surrounded by several hundred neighbors, students and fellow travelers all here for his annual Prairie Festival. Some came from thousands of miles to gather in his barn to hear talks and think big thoughts about the future of the planet in general and agriculture in particular. Mr. JACKSON: And we have music, the barn dance. And it's sort of an intellectual hootenanny. (Soundbite of laughter) HARRIS: Jackson is part scientist, part philosopher, part farmer. More than 30 years ago, he gave up his brief career as a professor to set up this 600-acre farm on the gently rolling uplands of Kansas. He calls it the Land Institute. And it includes not only the barn and other out-buildings, but an office in a suburban-style ranch house, a lab building made partly of old telephone poles, and a comfortable, rustic home. Mr. JACKSON: Yeah, we started here in '76. And we had as our purpose, we said, devoted to a search for sustainable alternatives in agriculture, energy, shelter, waste management. HARRIS: No surprise that turned out to be a bit too much to bite off all at once. So he quickly tore down his bulky windmills and the old solar panels and focused on the topic closest to his heart. Mr. JACKSON: Trying to solve the 10,000-year-old problem of agriculture. That's the modest effort. We can go this way. HARRIS: As Jackson leads me across the dirt road in front of his farm, he explains that the 10,000-year-old problem is that agriculture in most places is based on practices that use up limited resources. Jackson is worried because vast quantities of soil are washed out of the fields and down the rivers, and the soil that's left is gradually losing its nutrients. Jackson pondered what he could to do to solve this problem. He decided the answer was right in front of him. It was the patch of native prairie on his own farm, full of grasses from ankle to shoulder height, peppered with white and purple flowers and surrounded by shrubs and cottonwood trees. Mr. JACKSON: Here is a steep, sloping bank with a lot of species diversity, featuring perennials. This is what I call nature's wisdom. HARRIS: Perennials are plants that put down strong roots 10 feet or more into the ground and hold the soil in place. Perennials live year-round, unlike annual crops that get planted every year. Here, perennials survive the harsh Kansas winter and the blazing hot Kansas summer. And in contrast to fields that get plowed every year, native prairie vegetation actually improves the soil year after year. The amazing variety of plant life in this prairie also makes it resilient against disease. Mr. JACKSON: So I thought, you know, why can't we solve this 10,000-year-old problem? The solution is to build an agriculture based on the way nature's ecosystems work. HARRIS: This turned out to be both a major plant breeding challenge and a social one. It's not easy to get farmers and the public at large to rethink what farms ideally should be, not just areas sacrificed to food production, but actually part of nature. Mr. JACKSON: All reports from the sheriff's department\u2026 HARRIS: Jackson's been spreading this word through his annual Prairie Festival for the past 31 years. Mr. JACKSON: You have come to us today from 23 states and one Canadian province, and we're very pleased to have you here. HARRIS: To make progress on the biological problem, Jackson recruited a handful of young and ambitious PhDs - plant breeders. Their mission: nothing less than to reinvent the world's most important crops. The major grains like wheat and corn are planted afresh every year, but the fields lose soil when they're plowed, and the soil that remains loses nitrogen and carbon. So Jackson decided, let's figure out a way to breed grain crops so they can be planted once and will just stay in the ground just like prairie grasses and actually replenish the soil. They can be harvested year after year. One of the scientists he brought to the Land Institute to do this is a Minnesota farm boy turned plant breeder, Lee DeHaan. Mr. LEE DEHAAN (Scientist, Land Institute): The time when I started here, they said, well, let's put the youngest guy on wheat, because maybe he can see it through. So we're not expecting that it's going to be something that's going to be real easy to do or that we'll see the results of really soon. HARRIS: DeHaan joined the institute in 2001. He leads a group of visitors on this festival weekend down to a greenhouse so they can see his perennial wheat project. (Soundbite of greenhouse) HARRIS: DeHaan's job is to crossbreed regular old wheat with other grasses that survive year-round. Eventually some of the regular wheat should pick up traits that will turn it into a perennial grass, like the native prairie grasses. Mr. DEHAAN: We decided to really go at this aggressively and make a huge population of plants that are very diverse. So that first year we made about 1,500 new plants. HARRIS: It's taken him years and years. But as we look around the greenhouse today, we see the result of his work: hundreds of plants sitting on waist-high benches that are a cross between wheat and grasses that grow year-round. He will soon plant them in the fields. He hopes that maybe - just maybe - up will sprout a wheat plant that produces a lot of grain that actually tastes something like wheat and that has the hardiness of a native prairie grass. Mr. DEHAAN: It's like scratching off lottery tickets, you know? Maybe there's something amazing in there. We'll see. But that's why we love these plant breeders, right? Because every year, it's like heading out there and who knows what you find. Maybe this is the year when you make the big breakthrough. So that's kind of the fun of it. HARRIS: DeHaan does have something to show for his work. He's had some success taking a native wheat relative that's already a perennial and hybridizing it to produce grains that are more like the wheat we actually grind into flour. They call this new kind of wheat Kernza. Other scientists at the Land Institute are working on perennial sunflowers and perennial sorghum, which in the U. S. at least, is a grain that's mostly fed to cattle. It all takes lots of time, but no matter. (Soundbite of music) HARRIS: Jackson has been hosting this barn dance for more than 30 years, but he realizes his mission to save the world's soil is just getting started. Mr. JACKSON: We don't feel so bad about talking about 50 years anymore because we're not going to solve the climate problem in 50 years. We're not going to solve the problem of too many people in 50 years. HARRIS: And those problems are all tied together, he says. They all point to a world that's living beyond its means. Jackson's goal is to create a whole new system that will let us live sustainably on the Earth. Mr. JACKSON: You start, from our point of view, with a resilient food system, and we don't have one. HARRIS: Maybe someday we will. As the silver-haired Kansan is fond of saying: If you're working on a problem you can solve in your own lifetime, you're not thinking big enough.

If you have a blue sticker on your washing machine or refrigerator or dishwasher, it's supposed to symbolize an energy efficient appliance. But so-called energy stars may not mean quite what you think. This week, the Energy Department's inspector general raised doubts about the reliability of those ratings. As NPR's Elizabeth Shogren explains, it's something consumer advocates have been questioning for years. ELIZABETH SHOGREN: Energy Star is designed to lure Americans to buy green by promising money savings, like this Lowe's commercial does. (Soundbite of Lowe's Commercial) Unidentified Man #1: With an Energy Star washing machine, you'll save roughly enough for 16 rounds of golf, 94 movie tickets or 3,382 text messages. SHOGREN: The government estimates that last year the program helped Americans cut about as much greenhouse gas pollution as 29 million cars pump out. More than 60 different kinds of products from air conditioners to light bulbs can get energy stars. So, how do they qualify? Well, the specifics vary, but generally a product should be in the top 25 percent in terms of energy efficiency. (Soundbite of refrigerators) SHOGREN: It's not always that straightforward. Mr. MARK CONNELLY (Deputy Technical Director, Consumers Union): We test as many as 24 to 32 refrigerators at a time. SHOGREN: Mark Connelly is the deputy technical director of Consumers Union, which puts out Consumer Reports. Connelly took me to a hallway full of refrigerators at his organization's labs in Yonkers, New York. Mr. CONNELLY: Unfortunately, when you go to buy a refrigerator and you see this product is Energy Star, it's only an Energy Star within a French-door refrigerator with through-the-door ice and water. So, the top mount refrigerator here will use a heck of a lot less energy than that one, even though, that one's Energy Star. SHOGREN: French-door and side-by-side models are the SUVs of refrigerators. But they can get energy stars because of the way the government rates refrigerator. French-door, side-by-side, top freezer and bottom freezer fridges each has its own criteria. Mr. CONNELLY: The government has put these things on different yardsticks. SHOGREN: Connelly says another problem with Energy Star is the government doesn't tighten its standards quickly enough. A couple years ago, 90 percent of dishwashers on the market had energy stars. Nowadays, most TVs get the blue label. Mr. DAVID KATZMAIER (CNET): They need to just be a little bit more strict with what TVs are Energy Star and which aren't. SHOGREN: That's David Katzmaier. He tests televisions for CNET, an online electronics publication. Last year, he was surprised to see that some big plasma televisions were getting energy stars. When he tested those televisions himself, the picture seemed awfully dim. Mr. KATZMAIER: You get that kind of washed-out look to the picture and that was definitely a tip-off to us. SHOGREN: Turns out, a lot of the energy that televisions use goes to make them bright. As with all Energy Star products, the government lets the manufacturers do their own testing. And Katzmaier says manufacturers were setting the default modes on televisions unusually dim to qualify for energy stars. Mr. KATZMAIER: I think that, you know, some people might turn up the brightness on their televisions and all of a sudden your TV isn't Energy Star-compliant anymore and you're really not saving any power. SHOGREN: Katzmaier says even if the new big-screen TV you have your eye on has an energy star, it probably uses more electricity than your old box television. Super-sized TVs are just one reason that even with hundreds of millions of Energy Star products in American homes, average families are using more electricity than ever. People are plugging in more appliances and electronics all the time. Energy Star wasn't designed to attack that problem. The Energy Department is already responding to the criticisms. It's setting stricter requirements for testing products. The department has already announced it will make it harder for those large-screen TVs to earn the label. And it's planning to create an energy superstar program to identify the top five percent of products. (Soundbite of Commercial) Unidentified Woman: Global warming is a problem.

I'm Joe Palca, sitting in for Ira Flatow. Evolution through natural selection is pretty straightforward in theory. But it's been tricky to document in humans. For one, it takes years to observe and it's especially hard to tease out what may be an actual shift in inherited traits from what's just background noise. To see a change, you would need to have a lot of data collected over a long period of time. Well, lucky for evolutionary biologists, just such a database exists, the data collected as part of the Framingham Heart Study. Biologists have been crunching some numbers from the study and they say there's evidence they can see natural selection at work. Joining me to talk more about it is my guest Stephen Stearns. He's the Edward P. Bass professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Thanks for joining us today. Professor STEPHEN STEARNS (Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Yale University): Thank you for having me. PALCA: And you're welcome to join our conversation by dialing 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK or if you're on Twitter, you can tweet us your question by writing the @ sign followed by SciFri. And if you want more information about what we'll be talking about this hour, go to our Web site at www. sciencefriday. com, where you'll find links to our topic. So, to start with, Dr. Stearns, maybe you can tell us a little bit about the Framingham Study because it wasn't intended to show evolutionary changes. There was a different idea, I think. Prof. STEARNS: The Framingham Heart Study is the gold standard of long-term medical studies. It was started in 1948, with the aim of trying to understand what are the environmental causes of heart disease? So, they enrolled, initially, about 5,000 people and tracked them throughout their lives. They measured them 29 times. Every time they measured them, they measured them for 80 different traits. And then they enrolled their children and their grandchildren in the study. So, it continues today. We are now more than 60 years into it and more than 14,500 people are part of it. So, it is a wonderful long-term database. It's given us too extremely important messages for the medical community. The first was the cholesterol levels are associated with heart disease; and the second is that smoking is associated with heart and lung disease. And as such, the Framingham Heart Study actually is responsible for changing the living habits of people all around the world. It's an extremely important ongoing study. PALCA: So, okay, that's a Framingham Study. Now, say, just a basic primer on evolution by natural selection and how you might be able to see that in action with the Framingham Study. Prof. STEARNS: Well, if you go back to basic principles, then natural selection will recur whenever you have a population of individuals that vary in their reproductive success, that's one condition. And for humans, that means they vary in family size. Some people have a family of one children. Some have two children and so forth. There has to be variation in the number of children. So, that will be the first condition. Then if you're interested in some particular trait like, say, cholesterol or blood pressure or something like that, people would be measured for that and you would see that varied in that trait. Some would have high cholesterols, some would have low. And then you would ask the question, does their cholesterol level actually correlate with their reproductive success? Does it have anything to do with number of children they have? And at that point if it does, then you've established the natural selection is operating. But you haven't really yet determined whether there will be any reaction to it. Because for there to be a response to natural selection, those traits have to be inherited. The children have to be like their parents. And if that's the case, then evolution will occur. PALCA: I see. And so, what where are you able to see that hints that evolution is occurring in humans from the Framingham Study? Prof. STEARNS: Well, we pretty much followed what I just laid out for you. We first went through and we determined how many children the women had in the Framingham study in the first two generations. And then we took the traits of medical significance - like cholesterol level and blood pressure and so forth. And we also added in age at first birth and menopause, because those are very interesting and important traits. And we asked how they were co-related with reproductive success. However in doing so, we first had to try to take into account all of the other things that could be influencing that had been measured in Framingham. So, what we were really looking at was the independent co-relation, say, of cholesterol level with reproductive success after taking account of things like education level and so forth to the degree that we could. The Framingham Heart Study wasn't really set up to study income and ethnicity and things like that. So, there were certain factors we couldn't build into it. But to the extent that we could, we tried to measure the biological effects independent of the cultural effects. PALCA: Right. Now, if humans are animals and natural selection was involved in the appearance of every species that we see on earth, if that theory is correct - and I know most biologists and scientists around the world think it is - why wouldn't natural selections still be at work on humans? Prof. STEARNS: Oh, that's a very good question. I think that the result that we have here is no surprise to any evolutionary biologist. It's exactly what we expected to see. I think the reason that the study has some impact is that not everybody is an evolutionary biologist. And, in particular, it's interesting that there has been kind of a long standing view in the medical community, that because medicine has been so good at dealing with childhood disease - there are very few deaths now, relatively few deaths from infant mortality, few people die as teenagers, most people survive until they start having children - that evolution therefore had stopped. But that was due to the misapprehension that evolution is the survival of the fittest. It's not. It is the survival of the reproductively most successful or the increased representation of the reproductively most successful. So, in a sense, this study is aimed at simply trying to lift the level of discussion and get everybody on the same page. PALCA: And, maybe, I guess, we haven't exactly spelled this out, but what features did you see and why would you expect, you know, as we said in the beginning of this that women might turn out to be shorter and rounder in the future based on what you've seen. Prof. STEARNS: Well, we did find that we predict they will be slightly shorter and slightly plumper. But I think the broad take home message is, natural selection seems to be broadening the reproductive options by increasing the breadth of the reproductive window. In other words, we predict that they will start having their first baby a little earlier and they will reach menopause a little bit later. We also predicted that they will have better cardiovascular health. So, natural selection actually seems to be improving things like cholesterol and blood pressure in a positive way. And that's helpful, of course. But then on the issue of why might they be a little bit plumper, I'd like to put that in perspective. You have to realize the women who go into the Framingham database, include people who are born in the 19th century. So, we have some women who are born in the 1890s and they experienced conditions both in the early part of the 20th century and then in The Great Depression that were pretty stressful. And then later on in the study - it continues on, of course, through the '70s. And in the '70s we had the jogging craze where, you know, women were doing -staying fit, so they lost weight there. And a woman has to have about 20 percent body fat before she will ovulate, menstruate and be able to conceive a child. And the reason that she needs that 20 percent body fat is that it's her security that she'll be able to make enough milk to actually take care of her baby once it's born. So natural selection, actually evolution, has set up our physiology in such a way that we don't reproduce unless we'll be able to take care of the baby. So I really think that all our study is doing is picking up that effect. We have some women in it that are quite skinny, and we have others that are kind of normal or pleasingly plump or just, you know, attractively well-rounded, if you will. And our correlation is showing that it's the ones that have a little bit more body fat, kind of a normal body fat, that are having the babies. PALCA: All right. Let's take a call now and go to Terry(ph) in Lewes, Delaware. Terry, you're on the air. TERRY (Caller): Thank you. My question is, and I guess I should preface it by saying I'm a firm believer and supporter of evolutionary theory. I'm a science teacher myself. But my question is how can you determine human reproductive success in a study that involves just three generations or whatever, when humans reproduce by choice so much more now. And personally, you know, I didn't want more than two children, but I don't think that I would have had any reason - I mean problem having many more, you know. PALCA: Interesting point. So in other words, you could have had 12, and you would have greater reproductive success as measured by this study, but you simply - I got it, okay. TERRY: But I chose not to. So\u2026 PALCA: So Dr. Stearns, how do you cope with that kind of an issue? Dr. STEARNS: Well, I'm not surprised. This paper has caused some stir, and I've had questions all week long. I think it's important to realize that the amount of variation in reproductive success that we can account for with the stuff we can measure in Framingham is only about five percent. So we're pulling out a small biological signal out of the background of a great deal of environmental and cultural noise. So that leaves 95 percent as the realm of other stuff, which can very well include free will and choice. So I think that, you know, my response basically is because the study is so long, and it involves so many people, we were able to get this biological signal out of all of that cultural background. But it's a small signal, and it leaves great scope for individual choice. PALCA: Okay. I think we have time for one more quick call. Let's go to Zach in Salt Lake City. Zach, we only have a minute or so. What's your question? ZACH (Caller): I wanted to ask, I've heard it said before that sickle-cell anemia and malaria, they correlate in some respect with increased survival and therefore increased reproductive success. I'm just wondering: How does - have you compared that data with this study, and\u2026 PALCA: Interesting. Zach, I'm going to ask Dr. Stearns to respond because we only have a second or a few seconds left. Dr. STEARNS: Zach, you're absolutely right. Malaria does act as a selective agent on sickle-cell anemia in Africa. But when you take those people and move them to an area that doesn't have malaria, and it's not acting anymore, then sickle-cell anemia is something that's bad for the people who have it, and the trait tends to disappear. So that's a very dynamic evolutionary thing that is actually currently going on all over the world. PALCA: And just very briefly, you intend to continue looking at these people in the Framingham study? Is there more you can get from this? Dr. STEARNS: Well, we have another paper in press on the men. And that - well, not in press. We have a paper in preparation on the men, and they also are under selection for decreased age at the point where they have their first child. PALCA: Okay. Dr. STEARNS: Interestingly, they aren't under as much selection as the women are for improved cardiovascular health. So there are some interesting differences. But generally speaking, there's a lot of stuff there, and there will be more papers. PALCA: Okay. Well, we'll have you back when those come out. Thank you very much for joining us. Steve Stearns is a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University. We'll be right back after a short break. (Soundbite of music) PALCA: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.

I'm just wondering: How does - have you compared that data with this study, and\u2026  PALCA: Interesting. Zach, I'm going to ask Dr. Stearns to respond because we only have a second or a few seconds left.  Dr. STEARNS: Zach, you're absolutely right. Malaria does act as a selective agent on sickle-cell anemia in Africa. But when you take those people and move them to an area that doesn't have malaria, and it's not acting anymore, then sickle-cell anemia is something that's bad for the people who have it, and the trait tends to disappear. So that's a very dynamic evolutionary thing that is actually currently going on all over the world.  PALCA: And just very briefly, you intend to continue looking at these people in the Framingham study? Is there more you can get from this?  Dr. STEARNS: Well, we have another paper in press on the men. And that - well, not in press. We have a paper in preparation on the men, and they also are under selection for decreased age at the point where they have their first child.  PALCA: Okay.  Dr. STEARNS: Interestingly, they aren't under as much selection as the women are for improved cardiovascular health. So there are some interesting differences. But generally speaking, there's a lot of stuff there, and there will be more papers.  PALCA: Okay. Well, we'll have you back when those come out. Thank you very much for joining us. Steve Stearns is a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University. We'll be right back after a short break.  (Soundbite of music)  PALCA: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.

RICHARD HARRIS: If you burn ethanol from corn in your car, the government doesn't count the carbon dioxide that comes out the tailpipe as an actual carbon emission. That's because they figure the corn plant originally took that carbon dioxide out of the air, so you're just putting it back. But 13 prominent scientists point out in Science magazine that's bad logic when it comes to many types of biofuels. Author Tim Searchinger is from Princeton University, and he offers an extreme example to make the point. INSKEEP: Even if you were to cut down the world's forests and turn them into a parking lot and take the wood and put it in a boiler, which obviously releases enormous amounts of carbon in the trees, that is treated as a pure way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and that's obviously an error. HARRIS: And that error isn't trivial. It's now enshrined in European law as well as the Kyoto climate treaty. INSKEEP: The problem is that when the world agreed to a treaty that limited the amount of carbon that goes up the smokestack, they didn't agree to limit the amount of carbon released by cutting down trees. HARRIS: As a result of this accounting error, countries trying to reduce their carbon emissions actually have an incentive to cut down forests and burn them up, or replant the area with biofuels crops. In fact, Searchinger says power plants in northern Europe are starting to chip up wood and burn it for energy in the name of reducing emissions. INSKEEP: The fundamental effect of this flaw is to make forests worth more dead than alive. HARRIS: This spring, another report in Science magazine pondered what would happen in the coming decades if biofuels carbon was never counted as an emission. Jae Edmonds, at the Pacific Northwest National Lab, says they calculated that almost all the world's forests would be chopped down by the middle of this century. M: You can't actually imagine this thing going on like this with no one noticing and no one stepping in to intervene, but the numerical experiment is instructive in that it takes the phenomena into sharp relief. INSKEEP: The good news is, it's very easily fixable. HARRIS: Again, Tim Searchinger. He says nations simply need to count all carbon dioxide coming out of tailpipes and smokestacks regardless of the source. Then if the source of the biofuel was a destructive one, like deforestation, there would be no carbon emissions credit. But if it was from a good source like plants grown on previously barren land, that would earn a carbon credit. INSKEEP: So there are substantial amounts of bio-energy we can make that do give us greenhouse gas benefits. What we don't want to do is create a false and perverse incentive simply to go clear the world's forests. HARRIS: Whether this new accounting scheme would affect the domestic biofuels industry is debatable. Bob Dinneen, president of the Renewable Fuels Association, says it shouldn't matter. M: Some of the points that have been made in the paper today, we agree with. You should never, under any circumstance, tear down a forest for the growing of a biofuel. HARRIS: But some scientists argue that the domestic biofuels industry does indirectly lead to deforestation in the tropics by raising the global price of corn, and encouraging farmers in South America to clear land to plant grain. Jae Edmonds, from the Pacific Northwest National Labs, says if we could place a cash value on preserving forests, that ends up being good for the atmosphere. M: You end up not producing quite as much biofuel, but then you don't need as much because you don't have to make up for the deforestation. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)HARRIS: Richard Harris, NPR News.

It's an experimental version of the rocket NASA is designing to replace the aging space shuttles. But the test flight is coming just days after a panel of experts told the White House that this rocket program can't do the job that it was intended to do. Maybe, they said, it should be scrapped. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: Down at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the past and the future are sitting on two launchpads. One launchpad has space shuttle Atlantis, which has been flying since 1985. The other has what NASA hopes will be the future. Mr. JON COWART (Deputy Mission Manager for Ares I-X): Yes. I'm standing right inside the gate at Pad 39B. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I caught up with Jon Cowart as he stood right in front of a skinny white rocket that's nearly twice as tall as the shuttle, 327 feet, a prototype of a new rocket called Ares I. Mr. COWART: This rocket wasn't even conceived of four years ago. And so, it's just an awesome experience to be here when you watch a rocket like this. It's just an incredible thing to be a part of. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Cowart is the deputy mission manager for Ares I-X. The X stands for experimental. This particular rocket is a mix of real rocket parts and dummy versions. For example, the crew capsule perched on top is just a mock up that's the right size and weight. No one will be on board and it's not going in to space. But the rocket is covered with over 700 sensors. They will collect data during the two minutes of powered flight as the rocket goes 28 miles up. Cowart says the lower stage will separate and parachutes will bring it down safely to the Atlantic, so a ship can recover it. Mr. COWART: And then the upper stage, once it separates, it becomes just a giant lawn dart. It's going to hit the water, you know, several hundred miles an hour about 140 miles out and break up and sink to the bottom. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Cowart says his team will learn a lot about how this tall, skinny rocket responds to the stress of liftoff. Mr. COWART: We like to use the - what's become a rather trite phrase, that we're rocket scientists, but it is what we're doing. This is really rocket science. And it's not something you do on a lark. If it was easy, everybody would be doing it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But things might soon get even harder than just rocket science. The White House recently asked a panel of 10 independent experts to review all of NASA's plans for human spaceflight. It released it's final report last week. MIT astronautics professor Edward Crawley was on the panel. He says they had no doubt that given enough time and money, NASA could successfully develop and fly Ares I. Professor EDWARD CRAWLEY (Astronautics, MIT): That's really not the central question. The central question is not whether can NASA build the Ares I, really the question is should NASA build the Ares I. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says the rocket design made sense when it was first planned\ufffd Prof. CRAWLEY: But times have changed. The budgetary environment has become much more tight, and the understanding of the costs and schedule to develop the Ares I has matured. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In short, it's taking longer to develop this rocket than people originally thought. The space shuttles are supposed to be retired next year. Crawley says, under the best of circumstances, Ares I won't be ready until 2017. That's really too late for its main mission, taking astronauts up to the space station. The space station currently only has funding through 2015. Even if the station gets money to last another five years, that would eat up part of NASA's budget and probably cause more delays for Ares I. Prof. CRAWLEY: And really the question before NASA and as framed by the committee is, are there alternatives that would deliver a capability earlier and at a lower cost, but with the same criteria for safety? GREENFIELDBOYCE: For example, private companies are developing rockets that could take crews and cargo up into orbit close to Earth, letting NASA focus on bigger rockets that could go to the moon or beyond. I asked Jon Cowart back at the launch pad if his team's morale was suffering because these questions were being raised right before their first big flight test. Mr. COWART: I would say probably it has the opposite effect. When we see these things which don't put Ares, what we consider to be, in the best light, it actually inspires us to make this rocket do better. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He said people ask him why do they test at all, if it's not clear the rocket will move forward. He tells them no matter what happens, the data will be useful for rocket science. Mr. COWART: And to borrow a quote from one of my favorite rocket designers, Wernher von Braun, one good test is worth a thousand expert opinions.

I'm Melissa Block at NPR West in California. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: I'm Robert Siegel in Washington. And now, this question: In light of the delays in producing the swine flu vaccine, are there more efficient methods of production than what's currently in use? And what's currently in use depends heavily on some low-tech, involuntary lab workers. (Soundbite of a chicken) SIEGEL: That's right, the process of making the vaccine uses chickens to make eggs. It's actually very chicken intensive. And there are some new methods in sight, but not quite in use here. Joining us to talk about his is Dr. Robert Belshe, who's director of the Center for Vaccine Development at St. Louis University. Welcome to the program, Dr. Belshe. Dr. ROBERT BELSHE (Director, Center for Vaccine Development, St. Louis University): Good afternoon. SIEGEL: And first, tell us about the tried and true egg method. Dr. BELSHE: Well, eggs turn out to be very, very susceptible to influenza. And it has to be a special egg. It has to be an embryonated egg. And a 10-day-old embryo is about the ideal culture medium for influenza. And so, vaccine manufacturers use embryonated hens' eggs to produce large quantities of influenza virus. And then they purify from that the vaccine that we use on an annual basis to prevent influenza. SIEGEL: You say embryonized - fertilized, I guess, eggs. How many does it take to make a flu shot? How many does it take to make a nasal spray vaccine? Dr. BELSHE: It takes about one egg to make one dose of the flu shot. It turns out that it's much more efficient to make the nasal spray vaccine. In fact, you can get hundreds of doses from one egg of the nasal spray vaccine. SIEGEL: And part of the process, when the country orders up a batch of vaccine, is you've got to get those roosters and hens to work. Dr. BELSHE: That's right. These are not the ordinary eggs you buy in the grocery store, which are generally not fertilized. But it requires a fertilized hen's egg. So you've got to have a rooster and a hen get together, do their thing, then the eggs have to be laid. And then they have to be incubated until about 10 days old for the ideal culture medium. SIEGEL: Well, that's the egg method. What are the alternatives that are out there? Dr. BELSHE: Well, instead of growing virus in eggs, it's possible to grow influenza virus in tissue culture. So these are cells that are selected from organs that are grown up in large quantities. And then one can grow influenza in these living cells. One of the cell lines that is very good at growing influenza is a dog kidney cell line. SIEGEL: And would large numbers of dogs be sacrificed to make a batch of flu vaccine? Dr. BELSHE: No, you don't have to sacrifice the dog in order to make the tissue culture. This tissue culture has been in existence for many, many years, and the cells can be grown essentially forever in the laboratory. And so, no animals need to be sacrificed. SIEGEL: And thinking beyond dog kidney tissue? Dr. BELSHE: Well, there are a lot of other technologies being developed for making influenza vaccine. We can make proteins in the laboratory using recombinant DNA technology. And the leading technology today is an insect tissue culture system. So it's grown up in, literally, caterpillar cells, and then produce lots and lots of protein that way. SIEGEL: Now, when you think of, say, caterpillar cells being used in that example, how many days or how much risk could you knock of the production of a quantity of flu vaccine compared to what we're doing now with the eggs? Dr. BELSHE: With the egg, it takes about two months. Tissue cultures - whether it's dog kidney or caterpillar cells - can be grown up in a matter of a few days. And so, you cut off a couple of months by going to these newer ways of manufacturing influenza vaccine. SIEGEL: Dr. Belshe, thank you very much for talking with us today. Dr. BELSHE: My pleasure.

Supporters of the bill predicted apocalyptic consequences if it does not pass. Opponents predicted dire consequences if it did. NPR's Christopher Joyce has the story on the hearing at the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: The Senate's version of a climate bill \u2014 the House already passed its own months ago - tops 900 pages and would put an extra price on fuel that emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. It would remake the energy economy, but whether for better or worse lies in the eye of the beholder. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the bill's co-sponsor, testified first before the committee and set the tone for the Democrats by invoking the J-word. Senator JOHN KERRY (Democrat, Massachusetts): We will create millions of jobs, new jobs, jobs that cannot be exported, because we will create our energy here at home. JOYCE: The idea is that making fossil fuels more expensive will curb warming and create a gigantic green job market in solar power, wind, biomass and other forms of green energy, energy that does not emit significant greenhouse gases. When Republicans on the committee described the bill, however, they use the T-word. Here's Senator Kit Bond from Missouri\u2026 Senator KIT BOND (Republican, Missouri): The businesses that will be hit with this high carbon tax will pass along these higher prices, which are disguised taxes, to every family, every small business, every farm in the United States. JOYCE: And so it went for two days: the Democrats insisting that green energy means jobs; the Republicans invoking the specter of a new form of tax, a carbon tax that would deep-six the fossil fuel industry and kill millions of American jobs. At one point, several members had their staff hold up placards with tables and charts in a visual battle of numbers, including committee chair Barbara Boxer of California. Senator BARBARA BOXER (Democrat, California): Since you held up a chart, we're going to have our little chart wars today \u2014 you hold up one, we hold up one. It's kind of equal time.

Bill Klesse, chairman of the refining company Valero Energy Corporation, is an opponent of the bill and said it would cost refiners, and eventually consumers, an astonishing $850 billion a year just in California.

Mr. KLEESE: \u2026correct, I need to correct, my people tell me I said billions and it's $850 million a year. Sen. BOXER: That's a big difference. Mr. KLEESE: It's only a few zeroes. JOYCE: Meanwhile, the overwhelming scientific evidence for the dangers of climate change didn't come up much, which led one exasperated committee member, Democrat Frank Lautenberg from New Jersey, to appeal to the world outside of Washington. Senator FRANK LAUTENBERG (Democrat, New Jersey): America, wake up, wake up; your kids are in danger. JOYCE: But even whether Americans care about climate change was a point of contention. Both sides dueled with opinion polls, saying the public either does or does not care about climate change, or does a little, but not enough to actually spend the money on it. Some witnesses did testify about the danger climate change poses to America's national security and to things like forests, wildlife, agriculture and beachfront property. But it's money and jobs that have driven the debate so far, which probably explains why Democrats who wrote the legislation named it the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act. Hearings continue today. In all, almost 60 witnesses are scheduled over three days. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host:  We turn now to a debate on climate change that certainly raised the temperature at a Senate hearing yesterday. Supporters of the bill predicted apocalyptic consequences if it does not pass. Opponents predicted dire consequences if it did.  NPR's Christopher Joyce has the story on the hearing at the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee.  CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: The Senate's version of a climate bill \u2014 the House already passed its own months ago - tops 900 pages and would put an extra price on fuel that emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. It would remake the energy economy, but whether for better or worse lies in the eye of the beholder. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the bill's co-sponsor, testified first before the committee and set the tone for the Democrats by invoking the J-word.  Senator JOHN KERRY (Democrat, Massachusetts): We will create millions of jobs, new jobs, jobs that cannot be exported, because we will create our energy here at home.  JOYCE: The idea is that making fossil fuels more expensive will curb warming and create a gigantic green job market in solar power, wind, biomass and other forms of green energy, energy that does not emit significant greenhouse gases.  When Republicans on the committee described the bill, however, they use the T-word. Here's Senator Kit Bond from Missouri\u2026  Senator KIT BOND (Republican, Missouri): The businesses that will be hit with this high carbon tax will pass along these higher prices, which are disguised taxes, to every family, every small business, every farm in the United States.

Here's a case in point from our science correspondent Robert Krulwich. ROBERT KRULWICH: Why do we call this season the fall? Well, you know why, because at this time of the year, the days get shorter and colder, the trees get kind of tired and dry, and they lose hold of their leaves. So a breeze comes by and then the leaves just fall off. That's why we call it fall. Well, that sounds logical, but it's wrong, says Peter Raven, director of Missouri's Botanical Garden. Trees don't just drop their leaves. Dr. PETER RAVEN (Director, Missouri's Botanical Garden): The tree is getting rid of them. KRULWICH: So it's like throwing the leaves off? Dr. RAVEN: Discarding them, discarding them when they become non-functional. KRULWICH: So this, it isn't really like a fall. It's more like a shove. Dr. RAVEN: Exactly. KRULWICH: And here's how it works. When the days get sufficiently short, that triggers the release of a hormone inside the tree. Dr. RAVEN: So they're chemical signals\u2026 KRULWICH: That run like messengers from leaf to leaf to leaf all over the tree, saying - and what is the message that the\u2026 Dr. RAVEN: It says, time to go. Let's part company. (Soundbite of laughter) KRULWICH: I see. Dr. RAVEN: And when the signal comes\u2026 KRULWICH: Leaf after leaf, a little layer of cells will appear. They're called abscission cells. Abscission sounds like it's related to the word - is it related with scissors? Dr. RAVEN: Yeah. Ab means away and scindere means to cut, so abscission means to cut away. KRULWICH: So if I put a leaf in front of you and I say, wait, where would we see this little line of cells\u2026 Dr. RAVEN: Right at the main stem. KRULWICH: Right at the bottom there of the leaf? Right where it's\u2026 Dr. RAVEN: Normally, yeah. Right where it hits the stem. KRULWICH: So right around this time of year, if you look at every leaf on a deciduous tree right where it connects to the branch, at the very bottom of the stem, you'll see a little, thin, bumpy line. If you had a microscope it would show you cells pushing that leaf away from the branch. So within - oh, I don't know, days, or maybe a week\u2026 Dr. RAVEN: They're joined to that parent only by a couple of thin veins going from the stem up into the leaf. So with that very slender connection, you know, they will be kicked off, but they're sort of they're ready to be kicked off, so a wind will finish up the job. KRULWICH: So you see, it's the tree that pushes the leaves off. The wind is just the garbage collector\u2026 (Soundbite of wind howling) KRULWICH: \u2026which raises the question, why are deciduous trees so determined, so programmed by evolution, to kick off their leaves? Dr. RAVEN: Let's put it this way. It's more efficient to get rid of your food production than it is to just keep it all there. KRULWICH: In other words, leaves during the spring and the summer and the early fall provide food for the tree. They're kind of like the chefs or the tree's kitchen staff. But when it gets cold and food production stops, the tree now has a choice. It can fire the staff - drop the leaves - or it can make them permanent employees. If you keep your leaves, then you don't have to grow any new ones in the spring. But a leaf in winter, that can be a problem. Dr. RAVEN: If you have the leaves sitting there during the winter and it warms up and they start photosynthesizing, you know, they get some water up and then they start operating and making food and then it freezes again. They just die. And the whole plant can be killed better than (unintelligible). KRULWICH: Because if you've kept your leaves and you can't get new ones and now they're dead, come spring you'll starve. Dr. RAVEN: It's better to shed them first, then you're not in any danger at all from freezing. KRULWICH: Which is why even though we people call this season the fall, if we can think of it from a tree's point of view, if trees could talk, they'd probably call it the get-off-me season. Dr. RAVEN: Sure. KRULWICH: okay. Dr. RAVEN: If you have talking trees, though, you've got real problem. (Soundbite of laughter) KRULWICH: Robert Krulwich, NPR News.

A replacement for the dying satellite is years away. So NASA has begun monitoring polar ice using airplanes. NPR's Jon Hamilton has more. JON HAMILTON: Punta Arenas, Chile is as close as you can get to Antarctica and still find an airport for a big jet. So for the past couple of weeks, a NASA DC-8 has been taking off from that airport and heading south. Professor SEELYE MARTIN (University of Washington; Chief Scientist, NASA's Ice Bridge Mission): There's a lot of ice down there. (Soundbite of laughter) HAMILTON: Seelye Martin of the University of Washington is the chief scientist for NASA's Ice Bridge mission. He spoke from his hotel in Punta Arenas after an 11-hour flight. Martin says that from the plane, you can't see the glaciers changing. Prof. MARTIN: But satellite radar observations and satellite altimeter observations show that these are losing a fair bit of mass. Now it's not a lot of mass. We're talking about a millimeter of sea level rise per year, but it's something to be concerned about. HAMILTON: And measurements from the DC-8 will help scientists figure out whether the process is accelerating. The NASA plane already spent several weeks taking similar measurements in Greenland during the Northern Hemisphere's summer. NASA's Thomas Wagner says Ice Bridge is an effort to continue the work of the dying satellite called ICESat. Mr. THOMAS WAGNER (NASA Scientist): The satellite's now seven years old. It was only planned to really work for about three years. HAMILTON: The lasers that it uses to measure polar ice are just about burned out. Wagner says data on Antarctica are especially important because it's been studied less than Greenland and because it's so big. Mr. WAGNER: You're talking about something the size of North America covered with miles of ice, okay? It's like over 90 percent of the world's fresh water. You're flying over one of the tallest mountain ranges in the world, and it's just little peaks, in some cases, peaking up, you know, from the ice. HAMILTON: There's enough frozen water to raise sea level dozens of feet if it melted. And Wagner says there's growing evidence that something is happening to the ice in several enormous Antarctic glaciers. Mr. WAGNER: One of these glaciers has lost nine meters of ice a year. So, the math works out so that these glaciers wouldn't be around if they continue to lose ice at this rate. HAMILTON: That suggests the melting started pretty recently, perhaps because of global warming. Scientists say the Ice Bridge mission is an imperfect fix for a lost satellite. An airplane scans only a small area, while the satellite sees big chunks of the globe. But Seelye Martin says the DC-8 carries instruments that offer much more detail about what's going on than a satellite could. And he says ICESat has already identified the regions that could trigger a rapid rise in sea level. Prof. MARTIN: It seemed important to keep an eye on these regions that are sensitive and subject to rapid change. So we wouldn't wake up in five or six years and have an oh-my-God moment - you know, what happened? HAMILTON: One of these sensitive regions is called Pine Island, though it lacks either pine or an island. It's where a massive glacier is sliding into the Amundsen Sea. Martin says a special radar on the DC-8 is allowing scientists to study the bottom of the ice, which helps them look for signs that the glacier is accelerating. Prof. MARTIN: We're also interested in the ice tongue, which is sort of the cork in a champagne bottle. It sort of serves to - sort of to help hold back the ice. HAMILTON: The tongue sticks out into a bay. Martin says if scientists can figure out how much liquid water is under the frozen tongue, they'll have a better idea whether this particular cork is about to pop. Martin says it's places like Pine Island where ice moves from land to sea that cause oceans to rise. He says that's because sea ice is like ice in a glass of water. Prof. MARTIN: As the ice melts, the level of the water in a glass isn't going to change. HAMILTON: But it's a different story with land ice. When that goes into the sea, it's like someone dropping a new ice cube into your glass. Prof. MARTIN: So the floating ice isn't going to really change the level of the water in a glass, but the addition of ice to the glass is.

Commissioner Roger Goodell and the Players Union Chief, DeMaurice Smith, were grilled by the House Judiciary Committee about the effects of concussions on pro football players. A number of former players have reported bouts with depression and dementia, which they suspect are caused by the debilitating effects of repeated collisions on the field. Dr. Donald Stein has been studying traumatic brain injuries for decades. He's a professor and researcher at Emory University's School of Medicine and he's been looking into a possible treatment for blunt force brain injuries using the hormone progesterone, which is normally associated with pregnancy. Dr. Stein joins me from Atlanta. Welcome. Dr. DONALD STEIN (Professor of Emergency Medicine, Emory University's School of Medicine): Thank you very much. RAZ: First of all, Dr. Stein, what is progesterone? Dr. STEIN: Progesterone is a naturally occurring hormone. It's actually made in both males and females. Females make much more of it than do males. Progesterone levels are often associated with fertility, because when a woman becomes pregnant, her progesterone levels increase very dramatically. One of the reasons that I believe that it remains high all during pregnancy is that it's evolved to protect the fetus during gestation, during development. And many of the processes of repair, whether it's an organ repair, a tissue repair or brain repair, many of those processes that occur in injury are very similar to the processes that occur during development. And I think that the way in which progesterone works is related to that developmental protection. RAZ: How did you discover the link between progesterone and its possible healing effects on the brain? How did you discover that in the first place? Dr. STEIN: Well, there have been these anecdotal reports in the literature -single case studies, clinical reports - that women tended to recover better than males. So I had a bunch of students at the time and we talked about, you know, do you think we ought to look at this? It's kind of interesting. And so, we decided to take a look at this in laboratory rats. And we looked at animals with frontal cortex injury, and we found that when the females were high in progesterone, they did much, much better than when they were higher in estrogen. Then when we gave it to males, initially, the outcomes were just as good as it was in the females. And that led to one thing after the other to, let's explore this systematically, at a time when I think most people thought it was completely nuts to do it. RAZ: You're still fairly early in the research process here. These still have to be tested on humans. Assuming those trials are successful, how do you envision this hormone being used? I mean, do you imagine that a team doctor, an NFL team doctor, would have vials of progesterone on the sidelines, for example? Dr. STEIN: If this works and shows substantial benefit across these large numbers of patients, what will happen, as I estimate, it would become standard in practice care in most emergency and trauma rooms around the country, and perhaps even around the world. RAZ: So what is the best, sort of best-case scenario? What's the best-case outcome for you here? Dr. STEIN: Well, I think based on what we've seen already, what we had hope to see is a dramatic reduction in mortality in moderate to severely brain injured patients, and a dramatic - compared to state-of-the-art - current state-of-the-art treatment - a dramatic improvement in functional outcome, measured not just in the short term, but over 30 days, six months and a year. The best outcome is not just to keep a very severely injured person alive, but rather to ensure that that person enjoys a quality of life as close to what they had before the injury as we could possibly make them. RAZ: And how long do you expect that to take? Dr. STEIN: I think it's not something that's going to occur overnight; probably based on the way clinical trials work, probably three years at the very, very earliest. RAZ: Dr. Donald Stein is a professor of Emergency Medicine at Emory University in Atlanta. Dr. Stein, thank you for your time. Dr. STEIN: Thank you. It was a pleasure.  GUY RAZ, host:  The National Football League faced a challenge on a different playing field this past week, in the halls of Congress. Commissioner Roger Goodell and the Players Union Chief, DeMaurice Smith, were grilled by the House Judiciary Committee about the effects of concussions on pro football players.  A number of former players have reported bouts with depression and dementia, which they suspect are caused by the debilitating effects of repeated collisions on the field.  Dr. Donald Stein has been studying traumatic brain injuries for decades. He's a professor and researcher at Emory University's School of Medicine and he's been looking into a possible treatment for blunt force brain injuries using the hormone progesterone, which is normally associated with pregnancy. Dr. Stein joins me from Atlanta.  Welcome.  Dr. DONALD STEIN (Professor of Emergency Medicine, Emory University's School of Medicine): Thank you very much.  RAZ: First of all, Dr. Stein, what is progesterone?  Dr. STEIN: Progesterone is a naturally occurring hormone. It's actually made in both males and females. Females make much more of it than do males. Progesterone levels are often associated with fertility, because when a woman becomes pregnant, her progesterone levels increase very dramatically.  One of the reasons that I believe that it remains high all during pregnancy is that it's evolved to protect the fetus during gestation, during development. And many of the processes of repair, whether it's an organ repair, a tissue repair or brain repair, many of those processes that occur in injury are very similar to the processes that occur during development. And I think that the way in which progesterone works is related to that developmental protection.  RAZ: How did you discover the link between progesterone and its possible healing effects on the brain? How did you discover that in the first place?

Patterson, ate 135 people who were building a railroad in Kenya in the late 1890s. Patterson was the British engineer who shot the lions. That incident inspired the 1996 movie, \ufffdThe Ghost and the Darkness,\ufffd in which Val Kilmer played Patterson. (Soundbite of movie, \ufffdThe Ghost and the Darkness\ufffd) Mr. VAL KILMER (Actor): (As Colonel John Henry Patterson) Everything is collapsing on me. Every morning, the ground is soaked with blood. The workers feel I brought this terror since it didn't begin till my arrival. Whatever I try, they seem to know. All the deaths are on me. SIEGEL: Well, after their man-eating days were done, the lions were stuffed and put on display at the Field Museum in Chicago where much was made of those 135 human meals. Now, a new report says the lions might not have been quite so blood thirsty as originally thought. Justin Yeakel of the University of California, Santa Cruz, is one of the researchers who wrote the report. And I asked him based on his research, how many people the Tsavo lions actually ate. Mr. JUSTIN YEAKEL (Researcher, University of California, Santa Cruz): We put the most likely estimate to be about 35, but it could also range between four and 72. Those values are just not as likely as 35. SIEGEL: Now, how on earth do you measure the number of humans consumed by two stuffed lions more than a century later? Mr. YEAKEL: Well, we used a analytical tool. Basically, we utilize the chemical signatures and their bone and hair to work back their most likely sources for those chemical signatures. Specifically, we were looking at ratios of stable isotopes which are unique among different kinds of animals and they're retained in consumers of those animals. So, if you think of each prey as a different color of paint, the predator would be mixing the paint in a certain way. And so, we were calculating the most likely contribution of each color to make that particular mix of paint that we were seeing in the two man-eating lions. SIGEL: And your conclusion is there wasn't so much representation of the human color as to justify the 135-kills number. Mr. YEAKEL: Right, and this is where things get interesting because not only did we think that, well, perhaps they weren't consuming as many humans as they reportedly did, but also perhaps the two lions had very different diets according to our analysis. So, only one of the two lions was gaining any significant nutritional benefit from humans, the other was obtaining its food elsewhere. SIEGEL: Now, I read that the period of supposedly eating 135 railway workers took place over a period of nine months. If indeed the lions had only taken up eating railway workers very recently would their hair have disclosed that? What if it been just something that they'd started doing late in life? Mr. YEAKEL: We were taking advantage of the fact that different biological tissues incorporate dietary information at different rates and over different periods of time. So, we analyzed both bone and hair tissues from the lions. Hair gives you a dietary window of about three months of so, whereas because bone turns over at a much slower rate, you can get a much longer time window. And so we estimate that to be at about six years. And since the lions are only supposed to be about seven or eight years old based on their dental records, their bone values are basically a lifetime average. The bone values and hair values were not the same. So, when you look at the isotopic values of their hair, for one lion they moved towards relying on human prey to a much higher degree. And we estimate that to be at around 30 percent. SIEGEL: So, now you and your colleagues have to write the revised screenplay for \ufffdThe Ghost and the Darkness\ufffd to get the number of kills down to\ufffd (Soundbite of laughter) SIEGEL: \ufffddown to scientific reality. Mr. YEAKEL: I don't know. I think it'd be hard to bit 135 in terms of telling a scary story. So, I think we might not be competitive on that front if we took the number 135 and changed it to 35.

I'm Michele Norris. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. The Antarctic ice sheet covers an area larger than Europe. In places, it is miles thick. If it ever melts, sea levels would rise by dozens of feet. So, NASA is spending six weeks using an airplane to take a close-up look at what's happening to the continent. Until now, Antarctica had been studied mostly by satellites. As NPR's Jon Hamilton reports, the flights are revealing a dynamic and complex world beneath the ice. JON HAMILTON: The NASA DC-8 now flying over Antarctica is equipped with technology that lets scientists see right through the ice. Mr. WILLIAM KRABILL (Glaciologist, National Aeronautics and Space Administration): As we fly along with our laser system, measuring the surface height, we can take along an ice-penetrating radar that will tell us the bottom topography. HAMILTON: NASA's Bill Krabill says that in some parts of the continent, that topography includes volcanoes and mountains. The NASA plane also carries an instrument that detects tiny changes in gravity fields to reveal liquid water beneath the ice. Krabill says the flights are letting scientists burrow down through the layers to see rivers and lakes. Mr. KRABILL: It's analogous to peeling an onion. Dr. THOMAS WAGNER (Cryosphere Program Scientist, National Aeronautics and Space Administration): It's going to be a really amazing thing, and it's going to change the way that we look at Antarctica and change the way we look at the poles overall. HAMILTON: Thomas Wagner is program scientist for NASA's Cryosphere Program, which studies the frozen parts of the Earth. He says once you get beneath the surface of a glacier, you can find some really surprising stuff happening inside the ice. Dr. WAGNER: There are these lakes that form, and they literally seem to pop and deflate, and then another lake will flow downstream and fill up another one, and we just learned about this literally in the last couple of years, and we're finding new ones all the time. HAMILTON: If the water in those lakes gets under the ice, it could act as a lubricant and speed up a glacier's movement toward the ocean, and that could speed up sea-level rise. For the same reason, Wagner says, scientists are even more curious about something going on at the place where glacial ice is carving a channel through dirt and rock. Dr. WAGNER: One of the most important unknowns right now is what is the shape of the bed under the ice, and it turns out you need to know that in a very, very precise way to make models that accurately reproduce ice flow even as we see it today. HAMILTON: The NASA flights are part of a larger effort to use airplanes in place of a dying satellite that was a major source of data on polar ice. Planes can't entirely replace a satellite tracking changes in the ice over many years, but they offer a scientific bonus in the form of all these new details about what's beneath the ice. Chris Allen from the University of Kansas is in charge of several radars on the NASA flights. He says that once the plane gets over a designated patch of ice, his radars start to produce images in vivid colors on his laptop. Professor CHRIS ALLEN (Electrical Engineering, University of Kansas): Just a first pass, we can get what the bed looks like in many instances, and the scientists on board are kind of keen on that. So they're gathering around a monitor and seeing what it looks like. HAMILTON: The radar data will be refined in the coming months. Then it will be combined with information from the lasers and the gravity meter to create a more complete picture of an Antarctica that's been hidden for millions of years. Michael Studinger from Columbia University helps run the gravity meter. Dr. MICHAEL STUDINGER (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University): We are looking at structures like you see along the coast of Norway, these kinds of deep fjords. And right now, these fjords are filled with ice in Antarctica. In Norway, where the glaciers have retreated, you can actually walk in these fjords and see the place that has been occupied by a glacier tens of thousands of years ago.

GREENFIELDBOYCE: But German babies preferred a falling melody. (Soundbite of baby crying) Wermke says this makes sense because the intonation of the German language typically has a falling melody at the end of phrases, while in French, there's a pitched rise.

Mintz says he has kids but never searched their early cries for hints of language mimicry.  Professor MINTZ: That's not what I was thinking about when they were crying. Certainly, when they were very young, that never entered my mind that that would be even a possibility.  GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says newborns must have a surprising degree of vocal control to be able to reproduce sound patterns that they probably first heard in the womb.  Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

Shrinking computers down in science is one of the great challenges and triumphs of the cyber world. But the inventors of the future are thinking even smaller. They're envisioning a different kind of machine, microscopic machines that are alive and self-replicating too. Imagine, the billboards of Times Square lit up by glowing microbes that could regenerate if one burned out, or bacteria that could tell you if you're not getting the potassium in your diet, or ones that can suck up all the arsenic from a poisoned well. Well, these cellular machines don't run software, they run DNA, and just like you can put together circuits from electronic points. They can build circuits into cells by stretching together different fragments of DNA. College undergraduates and even some high school students are doing this, and over a thousand of them gathered at MIT this past week to share their inventions at the international genetically engineered machine competition, or the iGEM. And joining us now is one of the winners of the iGEM competition and one of the judges. Catherine Goodman was a judge at this year's competition. She is also an associated editor at Nature Chemical Biology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She joins us from the studios of WBUR in Boston. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Goodman. Dr. CATHERINE GOODMAN (Nature Chemical Biology): Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here. FLATOW: You're welcome. Vivian Mullin is a member of the Cambridge University iGEM team and an undergraduate in biochemistry at Cambridge University, England. She joins us on the phone. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Ms. Mullin. Ms. VIVIAN MULLIN (University Student): Hi. Thank you so much. How are you? FLATOW: How are you? Tell us about your project. Can you sum it up for us? Ms. MULLIN: Yeah. So I'm part of the Cambridge 2009 iGEM team and our product was called Ecromite(ph). And what we were trying to do is to improve bacterial bio-sensors. So I'll just tell you all about - a little bit about what bacterial bio-sensors actually are. They are bacteria that can tell you the concentration of, like, a pollutant in water. And they can do this because inside them they have a detector which switches on at a certain concentration of the pollutant. And then the bacteria is designed to have a way of telling you whether or not the detector is on. So we were trying to improve this technology - this bacterial technology. So we developed two different parts that help you see whether your detector is on or off and also control when your detector is on or off. So our bacterial machine had a thing called a sensitivity tuner, and this actually tells a detector when to turn on and when to turn off. So you have control over what level of concentration of the pollutant you're detecting. FLATOW: And how do you know - and how does the bacteria show that it's on or off? Ms. MULLIN: Yeah, so in the past, bacterial biosensors have used, like, florescence\ufffd FLATOW: Right. Ms. MULLIN: \ufffdand other things which need technology to read the output. So, we did is that, we used something called a color generator, which basically means that bacteria changed color when the detector got switched on. FLATOW: Wow. So they light up in a different color? Ms. MULLIN: They don't exactly light up. They actually change color, like\ufffd FLATOW: Wow. Ms. MULLIN: \ufffdit's visible to the naked eye. FLATOW: So, what is - so, let's say if you put a swab of the bacteria in a polluted river, if it - if the pollution was at a certain level to trigger it, the bacteria will just change color. Ms. MULLIN: Yup, exactly. But you'd probably want to put sample of your water on a bacterial plate maybe, not the other way around. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Vivian Mullin, how would you envision something like this being used in other ways in the future? Ms. MULLIN: Well, the idea of bacterial color is really fascinating. I mean, we're trying to think of ways that color might be used in the future. But we think that making bacterial biosensor is a really good application for pigments, because bacterial biosensors, the whole point is that they're user friendly and accessible to the people who would benefit from knowing whether or not their water is polluted. And having a visible output like - that's visible to the naked eye\ufffd FLATOW: Yeah. Ms. MULLIN: \ufffdis going to be the real improvement in the design of these biosensors. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. But you could use them to sniff the air then. Could you not? Or could you ingest them and they would tell you what's - what different chemicals might be in your body by changing color when they came out? Ms. MULLIN: Yeah, all we need is a - the detector. There's a lots of different detectors already in the registry, which is the all the parts that we have to use for our project. FLATOW: Right. Ms. MULLIN: So, if you have a detector for something, then you could use our parts, the tuners and the color generators to make it a good biosensor. FLATOW: Wow. So it's almost limitless\ufffd Ms. MULLIN: Uh, yeah. FLATOW: \ufffdkinds of things you can do with this. And is it cheap to make? Ms. MULLIN: It's probably going to be - would be cheaper then using the expensive and fragile equipment that we have to use right now to detect chemical bulletins. And this is like something that's going to be pretty far out in the future. So we don't really know yet. FLATOW: Catherine Goodman, what a great contest winner. Dr. GOODMAN: Yeah, she - Vivian was actually the lead presenter of the team from Cambridge. And she did a phenomenal job, and all her colleagues were excellent, as well. So it was a really entertaining presentation. FLATOW: But it's great that she is able - I know we talk about scientists a lot - able to describe in real English what her scientific work is doing. You know, it\ufffd Dr. GOODMAN: Definitely. It's an important skill for scientists, for sure. FLATOW: Tell us about some of the other projects that stood out at the competition. Dr. GOODMAN: Well, there were a bunch. So, this was the largest - I mean, each competition has been getting larger and larger, almost exponentially, I think. And so this year, there were about 120 teams, I think. So, it's hard to narrow down, but some of the very coolest ones that made it into the finalists - aside from the Cambridge team - was a team that was on the track that I was judging, which was the manufacturing track, where you're trying to produce an actual product. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. GOODMAN: And that was the team from Imperial. And they were creating a -kind of a all-in-one drug production and delivery system to your intestine. So, they would have these bacteria that would produce a protein, and then at a separate time, the bacteria would coat themselves with a special carbohydrate coats that would make it safe for them to pass through your stomach. And then in the third step - so this team actually won the Human Practices award with another team. And so that was for considering how these bacteria are really going to be accepted by the public and\ufffd FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. GOODMAN: \ufffdif you ever wanted to have this as an actual drug. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. GOODMAN: People aren't going to want to take a bacteria. And so, the third step was that the bacteria would degrade its own DNA so that it would become inert once it was inside you. FLATOW: Yeah, that's - that actually answers a question that - a tweet came in from a M. T. Edder(ph), who wanted to know how are we building dead man switches to prevent accidents and release - of the escape of these organisms. Dr. GOODMAN: Definitely. So this, in their case, there was a specific temperature responsive-element that when you heated the bacteria up a little bit, it would trigger the degradation of the DNA. There was another project from Toronto, I believe, where they were trying to detect Toluene in the environment and degrade it. And their trigger switch was once the Toluene was -had been fully degraded, then the bacteria would sense that the Toluene was gone and kill themselves. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255. Vivian, where do you go from here? Can you go actually make products that you can sell, or you go in and license your technology to a company? Ms. MULLIN: Well, we really hope that some more experienced scientists will be pick up on our work, and maybe in the future will actually be a devise that people can use. Yeah, definitely. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Is there any one - in one area besides - or is it water pollution that you're most concentrated in? Ms. MULLIN: Well, the beauty of our parts is that they're made to be interchangeable and usable for anything. So, if you can find a detector that, like, can detect carbon dioxide, maybe, in the atmosphere or maybe in some medium other than water, then, in theory, our parts should be able to be compatible for that. FLATOW: Could you actually, let's say, detect toxic elements that might be in your body if you\ufffd Ms. MULLIN: Yeah. FLATOW: Yeah. Is that right? Ms. MULLIN: Yeah, if you had a detector for it and you were able to - like we were talking about with the Imperial team - make the bacteria able to be ingested and safe for that. FLATOW: Hmm. And so you could just watch your feces on the way out and see what color there were. Ms. MULLIN: Yes, you could. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Well, your doctor asks you that anyhow when you get checked up. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Your team collaborated with some art students, right? Was that to help visualize what you were doing? Ms. MULLIN: Yeah, that's right. We worked with Daisy Ginsberg, James King and Tuur Van Balen from the Royal College of Art. And actually, Daisy and James ran a few color workshops with us to help us, like, get out of the lab and really think about the implications of the future of color. And they actually did a parallel project called E. chromi, and they came to the jamboree and showed it off. And it was really, really fun and a good design perspective on synthetic biology. FLATOW: And part of this art project was something called the Scatalog. Ms. MULLIN: Yes, it was. You mentioned eating bacteria and then kind of seeing them come out and seeing them change color. Their idea was that the bacteria would indicate your healthiness, and so they'd be a certain color if you were healthy, but they would change color if, for example, you had low potassium levels or something. So this was a kind of the way of diagnosing yourself. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Was this art-science collaboration a common theme this year, Catherine? Dr. GOODMAN: It definitely was. There are lot of teams that were thinking about bacterial patterns and colors and how you can kind of interface with the real world. One team that really stood out in that way was the team from ArtScience Bangalore, which was, in fact, a bunch of art students that became scientists for the purpose of the competition. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. GOODMAN: And so looking at their Web site, I didn't get to see their presentation, but looking at their Web site and hearing the other judges talk about them, they just brought a really unique idea to what is this competition all about, and what is science? What is art? How can we go forward? And they had started a Web site called hackteria. org, which kind of aims to unite biological artists, which I found quite interesting. FLATOW: We're talking about science and the arts this hour, in this part of SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Catherine Goodman and Vivian Mullin. Let's see if we can get a phone call in here. Hi, Matt, in Florida. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. MATT (caller): Thank you. FLATOW: Go ahead. MATT: My question is, he's the - my father used to be a pool contractor, and what he would do is very similar to what you're describing. He would take chemicals and use them to check for certain - like, ph, solidity, stuff like that. My question is these bacteria that you're describing, do they have any negative or detrimental effect to the environment? Like, what effects they have? FLATOW: Catherine, can you handle that? Dr. GOODMAN: Yeah, I think that's a really open question right now. Certainly, the teams that produce the participate iGEM do a pretty comprehensive analysis of the safety of their particular projects. And so, like we were talking about earlier, there are some people who design in the kind of these kill switches if they were to be used in real scenarios. But other people are certainly trying to design compound bacteria that will bind arsenic or other toxic metals. And certainly before they would be employed in any real setting, a lot more discussion needs to go on. Synthetic biology is one community that's really advanced in terms of thinking about safety and ethics, and this competition is a great example of that. FLATOW: Vivian, you must have thought about this when you were designing\ufffd Ms. MULLIN: Yes. Our project, we definitely thought about it. We had fill out a risk assessment form before we even began anything to think about what the implications of what we were doing in the lab. And then just with our lab work, the strains of E. coli that we were using were disabled. So if they managed to escape into the environment, they wouldn't have been able to survive. They would be out-competed by the natural bacteria that are out there. And our lab is like a contained environment, so it was very unlikely that bacteria would actually be able to escape. And we also thought about this for the - for our project. And we understood if this is actually going to become a device that people would use in the future, there would have to be a lot of thought to put into it as to make it safe for the environment. FLATOW: Catherine, this, I understand, is working on sort of an open access -an open source model for biology. Is that correct? Dr. GOODMAN: Definitely. So the BioBrick registry this collection of gene sequences and physical DNA that is sent out to the teams is all available freely online, and that's kind of the beauty of this resource, in fact, that all the teams that all the team that are preparing for the competition can just go to the registry, see what parts are available and make use of what they need. So it's a really unique community in science. Most people kind of guard their results, but these\ufffd FLATOW: Hmm. Dr. GOODMAN: \ufffdfolks have been really collaborative. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And Vivian, how much did you know about synthetic biology before you went into this competition? Ms. MULLIN: I didn't actually know very much. I learned about it in one of lectures in my second year. The beginning of our summer was actually a two-week introduction to synthetic biology, which we attended, as well as some students from the Royal College of Art and some engineering students. So, right\ufffd FLATOW: Yeah. MS. MULLIN: \ufffdfrom the beginning, we realized that it was a really interdisciplinary subject, with designers, engineers and biologists all\ufffd FLATOW: You know, I think it's a new term to most of the public: synthetic biology. You know? We've heard about all kinds of genetic engineering and stem cell research, but I think the word - the phrase synthetic biology has not been used a lot lately, but I guess we're going to be hearing more of it. Ms. MULLIN: Hopefully\ufffd Dr. GOODMAN: Definitely. FLATOW: Well, do you think, Vivian, next year we'll be getting more of this kind of interesting stuff coming in? Ms. MULLIN: Oh, definitely. Every year, the iGEM competition produces like - well, hundreds of new projects every year, and every single one of them is really interesting and really unique. And I think that the iGEM competition has been growing massively every year. So, hopefully next year, we'll have even more teams and even more projects. FLATOW: You hope it gets tougher, Catherine, to judge, I'll bet, because the competition is so good. Dr. GOODMAN: Yeah. It's almost impossible to judge. Our judges meeting just to decide the special awards and the finalists took four hours on Sunday night. So, it's - there's a lot of amazing talent. FLATOW: And if you want to get in, how do you compete? How do you find out more about this? Dr. GOODMAN: You go to igem. org and sign up, basically. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And it could be anybody from anywhere in the world? Dr. GOODMAN: I think at the moment, most of the teams are undergraduates being advised by professors and graduate students. But this year was the first year that they had a team that was only high school students from a high school, and there was also a junior college participating. So I think it's really pretty open to the public. FLATOW: All right. Well, good luck to you, and thank you both for taking time to be with us today. Dr. GOODMAN: Thank you. MS. MULLIN: Thank you. FLATOW: You're welcome.

So the BioBrick registry this collection of gene sequences and physical DNA that is sent out to the teams is all available freely online, and that's kind of the beauty of this resource, in fact, that all the teams that all the team that are preparing for the competition can just go to the registry, see what parts are available and make use of what they need. So it's a really unique community in science. Most people kind of guard their results, but these\ufffd  FLATOW: Hmm.  Dr. GOODMAN: \ufffdfolks have been really collaborative.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And Vivian, how much did you know about synthetic biology before you went into this competition?  Ms. MULLIN: I didn't actually know very much. I learned about it in one of lectures in my second year. The beginning of our summer was actually a two-week introduction to synthetic biology, which we attended, as well as some students from the Royal College of Art and some engineering students. So, right\ufffd  FLATOW: Yeah.  MS. MULLIN: \ufffdfrom the beginning, we realized that it was a really interdisciplinary subject, with designers, engineers and biologists all\ufffd  FLATOW: You know, I think it's a new term to most of the public: synthetic biology. You know? We've heard about all kinds of genetic engineering and stem cell research, but I think the word - the phrase synthetic biology has not been used a lot lately, but I guess we're going to be hearing more of it.  Ms. MULLIN: Hopefully\ufffd  Dr. GOODMAN: Definitely.  FLATOW: Well, do you think, Vivian, next year we'll be getting more of this kind of interesting stuff coming in?  Ms. MULLIN: Oh, definitely. Every year, the iGEM competition produces like - well, hundreds of new projects every year, and every single one of them is really interesting and really unique. And I think that the iGEM competition has been growing massively every year. So, hopefully next year, we'll have even more teams and even more projects.  FLATOW: You hope it gets tougher, Catherine, to judge, I'll bet, because the competition is so good.  Dr. GOODMAN: Yeah. It's almost impossible to judge. Our judges meeting just to decide the special awards and the finalists took four hours on Sunday night. So, it's - there's a lot of amazing talent.  FLATOW: And if you want to get in, how do you compete? How do you find out more about this?  Dr. GOODMAN: You go to igem. org and sign up, basically.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And it could be anybody from anywhere in the world?  Dr. GOODMAN: I think at the moment, most of the teams are undergraduates being advised by professors and graduate students. But this year was the first year that they had a team that was only high school students from a high school, and there was also a junior college participating. So I think it's really pretty open to the public.  FLATOW: All right. Well, good luck to you, and thank you both for taking time to be with us today.  Dr. GOODMAN: Thank you.  MS. MULLIN: Thank you.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Vivian Mullin, member if the Cambridge University iGEM team, undergraduate in biochemistry at Cambridge University and Catherine Goodman, who was a judge at this years iGEM competition. She's also an associate editor at Nature Chemical Biology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It's about all the time we have for today. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2009 NPR.

EBINGER: At the start of this recent activity that started in September 2005, I had actually been doing work with scientists in Ethiopia. Most notably, Atalay Ayele and Gethahine Nurgu(ph). And we had been looking at the area and making some predictions and then the earthquake sequences started. And I came a little bit afterward and put in some seismometers so we could just record then the activity and try and actually track the magma movement. HANSEN: Now, can you explain exactly how that happens, what exactly is happening with the volcanic magma? EBINGER: But subsequent to that, we've had 12 additional periods where big, long sheets of magma have risen up and cracked open the rocks lying above. So, really, creating this new ocean floor. HANSEN: Why is this so unusual? EBINGER: It's actually not an unusual process in terms of Earth's history. This process is happening along mid-ocean ridges worldwide. But by the time a ship is mobilized, we may have missed all of this activity. Here, this is one of the few places on the surface of the earth right now where we have this process occurring. So, it's a unique study location. HANSEN: Yeah, you can see it happening. EBINGER: Yes, we can. HANSEN: So, when do you think there will be a new ocean?

And we've learned both in practice, but also just living on the bay, that that's certainly not the case. JOYCE: The EPA has now vowed to start over, to do better, but scientists first have to figure out what's actually happening in and especially under the water. That's what determines the bay's basic chemistry. WALTER BOYNTON: We've been basically making a map of what the sediments are doing to the water in Chesapeake Bay.

They act as nutrients for algae, which gorge on them and grow into huge, floating blooms. When the algae die and decompose, that sucks oxygen out of the water. And that's deadly. BOYNTON: The key issue in the bay program is reduce the amount of nitrogen and phosphorous and dirt getting into the bay. We, frankly, need to know: Where does this stuff come from?

You have to look at restoring headwater streams and rivers and things like that before you are going to see an improvement in the water quality that's coming into the bay.

Thats despite decades of promises to clean it up. Today, the federal government announced the outlines of a new effort to help restore the bay. NPRs Richard Harris explains. RICHARD HARRIS: The bay is in trouble largely because its being overwhelmed with nitrogen, phosphorus and sediments from agriculture runoff as well as from the 17 million people who live in the bays watershed. One of the biggest victims of this has been the bays once-thriving oysters. In a telephone news conference, Peyton Robertson from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said restoring the oysters is key to the new bay recovery effort. Mr. PEYTON ROBERTSON (Director, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration): We want to coordinate with Maryland, Virginia and the Potomac River Fisheries Commission to recover historical oyster bars and establish self-sustaining oyster-reef sanctuaries in 20 key tributaries throughout the bay by the year 2020. HARRIS: Ultimately, the states and federal government will need to figure out how to reduce runoff into the bay. That means paying more attention to farms, which are the single biggest sources of nutrient-laden water. But better farm practices alone wont do the job. In fact, Environment Protection Agency official Chuck Fox says agricultural runoff has actually been improving somewhat. Mr. CHUCK FOX (Senior Advisor, Environment Protection Agency): This is contrary to urban and suburban runoff loads which, in fact, are increasing in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. HARRIS: So, an effective strategy means getting states and local governments to pay more attention to new or rebuilt subdivisions and other development. Up until now, most of the bays restoration plans have been largely voluntary -loosely coordinated by Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New York, West Virginia and the city of Washington, D. C. , which are all in the bays watershed. The new plan, ordered up this spring by President Obama, will give the federal government a much bigger role. Some in the region have worried this could amount to a federal takeover of the effort. Mr. FOX: I would respectfully disagree with that characterization completely. HARRIS: Again, Chuck Fox from the EPA. Mr. FOX: It is our view that this is a new era of federal leadership, but it is also our view that we have to do this in close partnership with state and local governments, as well as those in the private sector. HARRIS: States are expected to come up with new regulations and measures to heal the bay, but if those fall short, the federal government will step in with new rules of its own. The plan is still in draft form. It is a big step up from the volunteer efforts of the past two decades. And Bill Dennison at the University of Marylands Center for Environmental Science says its a welcome one. Dr. BILL DENNISON (University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science): This is exciting times for Chesapeake Bay. Its kind of a super-sized restoration program. And I think it represents an opportunity to take the best-studied bay in the world into the best-managed bay in the world. HARRIS: One feature of the plan is that the states and federal government will review their progress every two years, and not simply wait as the restoration deadline of 2025 draws near. Dr. DENNISON: We have defined goals and measurable progress and realistic time frames. Were not talking about what were going to do in five or 10 years -outside the political life cycle of any particular politician - but were talking about what we can do in a couple years. HARRIS: Now, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation has been the regions leading advocate for restoring the bay. Roy Hoagland at the foundation says the newly unveiled plan neatly lays out all the things that need to be done, but hes not entirely happy. Mr. ROY HOAGLAND (Chesapeake Bay Foundation): What was disappointing about this federal strategy is the lack of specificity. For example, it talks about developing new regulations for better managing urban and suburban storm water. It doesnt have any details of what that better management might or might not be.

Im Michele Norris. MELISSA BLOCK, host: And Im Melissa Block. Even 3,000-year-old tombs need a little attention from time to time. For years, visitors and archeologists alike have been captivated by Egypt's most famous king, Tutankhamen, or King Tut as he's more commonly known. NORRIS: The tomb is still in pretty good shape but the elaborate paintings on the walls of the tomb's underground chambers have started to deteriorate. So Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities and a Los Angeles-based Getty Conservation Institute have teamed up to launch a five-year, multimillion-dollar restoration project. Jeanne Marie Teutonico is leading that group of specialists from the Getty. And she joins us now. Welcome. Ms. JEANNE MARIE TEUTONICO (Associate Director, Getty Conservation Institute): Thank you very much, Michele. It's a pleasure to be here. NORRIS: Now, for people who have never seen the tomb, could you do me a favor? Could you please describe it and tell me where and how it's starting to deteriorate? Ms. TEUTONICO: Well, you know, it's in the Valley of the Kings, which is on the west bank of the Nile. It's a reasonably small tomb. You go down - as you do in many of these  a long staircase. You come into an antechamber and then just adjacent to that is the actual burial chamber, which has wall paintings on four walls. And then, inside that burial chamber is still the sarcophagus that bears the one of the coffins. There were four coffins originally. NORRIS: And where do we see the deterioration? Ms. TEUTONICO: You know, it's not that significant, but you see in some of the wall paintings, you know, there is some flaking paint. They're obviously extremely dusty, you know, from years and years and years of, you know, of people coming in and out of the tomb. There are some bits of plaster that are, you know, are a bit crumbly, you know? So it's that kind of deterioration. The wall paintings are actually covered with these brown spots. In fact, they've been there since the tomb was excavated. Theyre thought perhaps to be some kind of fungus, but again, it's something that we want to make sure is not, you know, a continuing source of deterioration. NORRIS: So how do you clean or restore the tomb without changing the appearance or the way the tomb looked when it was originally excavated? Ms. TEUTONICO: Really, always, what you want to do is probably is as little as possible, you know, just to leave the artifact in a stable condition, but, you know, looking the way that, you know, it has been, you know, seen for ages and ages. In this case, the first thing you do is what you do in any conservation project is understand what you're dealing with. So, you know, extensive documentation, evaluation, study of the materials of the wall painting, the environment that they're in, the condition that they're in, what's happened to the paintings in the past because, of course, we're not the first people to touch this place. And then with all of that information, you know, design an intervention which is as minimal as possible which stabilizes this artifact and also, you know, hopefully enhances its appearance so that the visitors to the tomb will, you know, enjoy it and understand it. NORRIS: What kind of tools and techniques do you use? Ms. TEUTONICO: Well, you know, in examination, some of the tools are quite simple. We actually did the documentation here with just basic rectified photography. And then the first examination, you know, you do with your eyes and some hand-held microscopes. But then, we're of course bringing some complex, scientific instruments. Things like portable x-ray diffraction and x-ray fluorescents which are, you know, just ways of understanding the materials that the tomb is made of. And then we're using various imaging techniques. For example, various types of light to see things you can't see in normal light. NORRIS: So for all this now-wow equipment, is this a case where the best tool winds up being a toothbrush or a Q-tip, or a potato brush or something like that? Ms. TEUTONICO: Well, to tell you the truth, in the end, when it comes to the actual physical intervention, it probably will be very simple tools - brushes and Q-tips and you can even use things like bread, you know? But very. . . NORRIS: Bread? Ms. TEUTONICO: Yes. In fact, it's a good kind of absorbent material, you know, depending on what kind of dirt, you know, you want to remove. And then, you know, materials very similar to the materials that we use to actually make the wall painting. So the bells and whistles are mostly in the analysis phase and the, you know, the actual conservation part is generally quite conservative and utilizes, you know, very compatible materials and  as I said, things which are as minimally interventive as possible. NORRIS: So is this work fun or is it absolutely terrifying knowing that youre working on a priceless treasure? Ms. TEUTONICO: Its both, really. I mean, its a great privilege to do this work. Its fascinating. And again, I think the way that you try to mitigate that  what can be that, you know, the hugeness of the responsibility, or that weight that you feel when youre entrusted with something like this, is by, you know, approaching things in an extremely methodological way and making all the decisions based on knowledge. NORRIS: Thanks so much for talking to us. All the best with this. Ms. TEUTONICO: Thank you very much. NORRIS: That's Jeanne Marie Teutonico. She's leading a team of specialists from the Getty Conservation Institute. They're going to spend the next few years working to restore the tomb of Egypt's King Tut.

Theyre thought perhaps to be some kind of fungus, but again, it's something that we want to make sure is not, you know, a continuing source of deterioration.  NORRIS: So how do you clean or restore the tomb without changing the appearance or the way the tomb looked when it was originally excavated?  Ms. TEUTONICO: Really, always, what you want to do is probably is as little as possible, you know, just to leave the artifact in a stable condition, but, you know, looking the way that, you know, it has been, you know, seen for ages and ages. In this case, the first thing you do is what you do in any conservation project is understand what you're dealing with. So, you know, extensive documentation, evaluation, study of the materials of the wall painting, the environment that they're in, the condition that they're in, what's happened to the paintings in the past because, of course, we're not the first people to touch this place.  And then with all of that information, you know, design an intervention which is as minimal as possible which stabilizes this artifact and also, you know, hopefully enhances its appearance so that the visitors to the tomb will, you know, enjoy it and understand it.  NORRIS: What kind of tools and techniques do you use?  Ms. TEUTONICO: Well, you know, in examination, some of the tools are quite simple. We actually did the documentation here with just basic rectified photography. And then the first examination, you know, you do with your eyes and some hand-held microscopes. But then, we're of course bringing some complex, scientific instruments. Things like portable x-ray diffraction and x-ray fluorescents which are, you know, just ways of understanding the materials that the tomb is made of. And then we're using various imaging techniques. For example, various types of light to see things you can't see in normal light.  NORRIS: So for all this now-wow equipment, is this a case where the best tool winds up being a toothbrush or a Q-tip, or a potato brush or something like that?  Ms. TEUTONICO: Well, to tell you the truth, in the end, when it comes to the actual physical intervention, it probably will be very simple tools - brushes and Q-tips and you can even use things like bread, you know? But very. . .  NORRIS: Bread?  Ms. TEUTONICO: Yes. In fact, it's a good kind of absorbent material, you know, depending on what kind of dirt, you know, you want to remove. And then, you know, materials very similar to the materials that we use to actually make the wall painting. So the bells and whistles are mostly in the analysis phase and the, you know, the actual conservation part is generally quite conservative and utilizes, you know, very compatible materials and  as I said, things which are as minimally interventive as possible.  NORRIS: So is this work fun or is it absolutely terrifying knowing that youre working on a priceless treasure?  Ms. TEUTONICO: Its both, really. I mean, its a great privilege to do this work. Its fascinating. And again, I think the way that you try to mitigate that  what can be that, you know, the hugeness of the responsibility, or that weight that you feel when youre entrusted with something like this, is by, you know, approaching things in an extremely methodological way and making all the decisions based on knowledge.  NORRIS: Thanks so much for talking to us. All the best with this.  Ms. TEUTONICO: Thank you very much.  NORRIS: That's Jeanne Marie Teutonico. She's leading a team of specialists from the Getty Conservation Institute. They're going to spend the next few years working to restore the tomb of Egypt's King Tut.

It became known as Mighty Mouse. Now, researchers have used a similar approach to produce muscle-bound monkeys. As NPR's Jon Hamilton explains, this brings scientists a step closer to new treatments for people with diseases such as muscular dystrophy. JON HAMILTON: All of this muscle research has to do with a substance called myostatin. Normally, myostatin in the body prevents muscles from getting too big. Take it away and muscles can become huge. So, researchers have been looking for a way to block the effects of myostatin in people with muscle-wasting diseases. You could do that with regular injections of a drug. Another way is to ramp up the body's own ability to block myostatin. Brian Kaspar of Ohio State University is part of a team that's done that by putting an extra dose of genes right where they're needed. Dr. BRIAN KASPAR (Professor of Pediatrics, Ohio State University): Our approach has been to develop a one-time gene delivery, given it's a simple shot into the muscle. HAMILTON: And it works great in mice. But of course, lots of things that work in mice don't work in people. Jerry Mendell is another member of the gene team. He directs the Center for Gene Therapy at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus. Dr. JERRY MENDELL (Director, Center for Gene Therapy, Nationwide Childrens Hospital): So, we decided that the best way to test our gene therapy model was to take it to the monkey. And if it worked, it had a better chance of working in patients. HAMILTON: The team injected the right thigh muscles of six macaque monkeys. Kaspar says researchers didn't have to wait long. Dr. KASPAR: We found that muscles started to get larger in circumference. And when we measured the strength generated out of those muscles, indeed the treated muscles were significantly higher than untreated muscles. HAMILTON: The success means the team is ready to move on to people. Mendell says they want to begin with patients who have a disease called inclusion body myositis. It leaves thigh muscles so weak, people can't stand up. Dr. MENDELL: If everything works out, we should be in a clinical trial by next summer. HAMILTON: That would be a big step. But even cautious scientists have been impressed by the results in monkeys. Dr. SE-JIN LEE (Professor of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Johns Hopkins University): Certainly very intriguing, very interesting, potentially very exciting. HAMILTON: That's Se-Jin Lee of Johns Hopkins University. He's the scientist who discovered myostatin. Lee says many different groups have now found ways to manipulate the myostatin pathway and produce muscle growth in a wide range of animals. He says that bodes well for treating people. Dr. LEE: Tampering with this pathway will probably work in terms of increasing muscle growth. You know, that still is hypothesis. It definitely has not been proven, but there are more and more signs that that probably will work. HAMILTON: And not just on sick people. Athletes and bodybuilders have been following the research closely. Some of them are looking for a new kind of doping. Lee says it would be pretty hard for these would-be dopers to make drugs that block myostatin. Dr. LEE: The scary part is that that's just not true in the case of gene therapy. It's a fairly easy thing for a, you know, a small group to set up and produce, and you only need to give essentially a single injection, presumably, or a limited number of injections and it's there forever. HAMILTON: The World Anti-Doping Agency is already working on a test for this sort of doping. The new research appears in the journal Science Translational Medicine. Jon Hamilton, NPR News.

A new study confirmed that many also have difficulty with an important motor skill: handwriting. NPRs Jon Hamilton reports. JON HAMILTON: For Barbara Wagners son Austin, the trouble started when he got to first grade. Ms. BARBARA WAGNER: He would have nights where it would take three hours to do homework. HAMILTON: Austin was a bright kid. He understood the assignments. He knew the answers. Wagner says what was hard for him was writing them down. Ms. WAGNER: He doesnt actually write like you or I would write. He draws his letters. It was almost painful to watch. It took that long. HAMILTON: And Wagner says things got even worse when her son had to do written exercises in class. Ms. WAGNER: This was something that Austin used to tell me all the time. Hes like, everybody else is done. And hes like, Im not done. HAMILTON: Things got better for Austin, who is 14 now, when he was diagnosed with a mild form of autism. Thats when his school began to let him answer questions verbally or type on a keyboard. There are a lot of kids like Austin who are on the autism spectrum and have trouble with handwriting. But scientists hadnt really studied the problem much until a group at Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore set out to see whether kids with autism really did have worse handwriting than other kids. Amy Bastian says her team got two groups of children to copy a sentence, then compared the results. Dr. AMY BASTIAN (Neuroscientist, Kennedy Krieger Institute): We decided to start with a simple test, where you actually measure letters and you score letters based on some qualitative features. HAMILTON: Like how big they are, how theyre spaced and whether theyre aligned. Bastian says they tested 14 typical kids and 14 on the autism spectrum, including Barbara Wagners son Austin. Dr. BASTIAN: It was really striking how robust our findings were on this simple test. Kids really had trouble forming letters. HAMILTON: Kids with autism. Dr. BASTIAN: Yes. Yes. HAMILTON: The handwriting issue on its own can be a big deal, but Bastian says its part of a whole other aspect of autism thats now getting attention, difficulties with motor skills. For many kids on the autism spectrum, she says, its hard to hold a fork, button a shirt or even play games. Dr. BASTIAN: These are the kids that, you know, are going to get picked last for kickball. These are the kids who are clumsy, who have already difficulty relating to other kids, and the motor component probably makes things worse. HAMILTON: Bastian says a lack of motor skills may even contribute to problems these children have communicating. Dr. BASTIAN: You understand how someone else is feeling based partially on what theyre doing and how you feel when you do those same things. And so if you don't develop a normal motor sort of repertoire, then it may be harder for you to understand nonverbal communication from someone else. HAMILTON: Researchers have only been looking at motor skills in autism for a few years, but theyve already found a range of subtle problems. And Sarah Spence of the National Institute of Mental Health says that could make it easier to spot very young children with autism. Spence did a study that found these children were slower to reach some key motor milestones. Dr. SARAH SPENCE (Pediatric Neurologist, National Institute of Mental Health): Sitting up, standing on your own, walking, riding a bicycle.

JOE PALCA: Its hard to blame mission scientist Jim Bell of Cornell University for sounding a bit celebratory when he greets caller. Professor JIM BELL (Astronomy, Cornell University; Mission Scientist, Mars Pathfinder Mission): Happy sol 2082 of our 90-day mission. (Soundbite of laughter) PALCA: Sol is what scientists call a Martian day, slightly longer than an Earth day. Actually, I spoke with him earlier in the week. Today is sol 2084, nearly six Earth years on Mars for what was originally designed to be a three-month mission. Bell is the scientist in charge of the panoramic cameras, or pancams. Theyve been sending back remarkable pictures, just take a look on our Web site, npr. org. Prof. BELL: We never imagined, of course, that they would be doing this well. But for the pancams, we passed our quarter-million image mark. PALCA: Did you so crazily over-designed these that they just, you know, they were built for 90 days, but they could last a decade or have you been lucky or either  can you see any signs of wear? Prof. BELL: Its a little bit of both. I mean you cant really talk about over-designing for something that youve never built before. Sony can tell you exactly how long any of its TVs are going to last because they build millions of them. But with space vehicles, theyre one-offs, theyre one-shot deals. PALCA: Or in this case two-shot deals, because there are two pancams working on Mars: one on the rover Opportunity, the other on the rover Spirit. And its Spirit thats gone and got itself into trouble. Last April, as it was driving south, it broke through a thin layer of crusty soil.

He says the situation is challenging. One wheel on the rover stopped working years ago, now another may be in trouble. And the rovers underbelly, what Callas calls the belly pan, is perilously close to some rocks. And perhaps worst of all, every time theyve tried to move the rover, it sunk a little deeper. Sinking much further would be disastrous. Mr. CALLAS: Because if you put the belly pan of the rover on the ground, thats pretty much game over in terms of trying to get the rover out, because then you would be bearing the weight of the rover on the belly pan and not on the wheels, where you need the traction. PALCA: So after months of working on the problem, on Monday, the team will send the rover instructions to try backing out the way it came in. Managers sound hopeful, but not optimistic. Cornells Jim Bell says even if the rescue plan fails, there is still science that Spirit can do. In addition to taking pictures, its robotic arm still works. So Bells says it can do things like Prof. BELL: analysis of these salty deposits that the rover is stuck in. I mean, its a great place to get stuck if you have to be stuck somewhere. PALCA: On the other side of Mars, Opportunity is still rolling along. Its on a 12-mile trek across a sandy plain to a crater scientists want to explore. Bell says Opportunity is still making cool discoveries. Just the other day, it came across a large rock. Prof. BELL: The hope is that this is a piece of Mars that comes from somewhere else. It was thrown out by a big impact crater, and it just happens to have landed in our path. And this is kind of a free way to sample more of Mars than we have been sampling where we are.

When you eat breakfast, the microbes in your stomach are eating too. Now a new study suggests that a high-fat, high-sugar diet can produce big changes in those microbes and the changes might actually contribute to obesity. NPRs Nell Greenfieldboyce has more. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: Our guts are just teeming with microbes. Jeffrey Gordon studies them at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Dr. JEFFREY GORDON (Washington University): We have this huge collection of trillions and trillions of microbes that live in our intestines. And one of their functions is to process those components of our diet that we can't digest on our own. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says who exactly is living in your gut might affect what you get out of food. Dr. GORDON: The energetic and nutrient value of food may not be an absolute term but one that is modified in part by the microbes that live in our gut. GREENFIELDBOYCE: For example, recent studies have suggested certain types of gut bacteria are associated with obesity. Gordon wanted to explore all of this in an easy to use lab animal - the mouse. So his team took completely germ free mice and basically fed them human gut bacteria. The result was mice with microbe communities in their guts that mimic the ones found in people. Then the researchers started experimenting. The mice first ate a healthy low-fat, plant-rich mouse chow. But then they were switched to a high-fat, high-sugar diet. In less than 24 hours, the researchers saw big changes in the animals gut bacteria. Dr. GORDON: And we were quite amazed that the community really restructured itself. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Gordon says the unhealthy diet produced microbe winners and losers. Dr. GORDON: Certain members of that society of microbes became very dominant, and certain members became more diminutive. GREENFIELDBOYCE: To see if this change might mean anything in terms of weight gain, the researchers put these altered communities of bacteria into other germ-free mice. Even though these new mice ate the healthy low-fat mouse chow, they accumulated extra body fat over the course of the next two weeks. The result is reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine. It surprised John Mekalanos. Hes chair of the department of microbiology and molecular genetics at Harvard Medical School. Dr. JOHN MEKALANOS (Harvard Medical School): This paper addressed squarely the idea that the microbiota affects are ability to metabolize food in a way that might predispose us to obesity. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says the ultimate goal would be new therapies for obesity or malnutrition. But to know if thats even possible, scientists have to learn a lot more about what specific bacteria do in our gut. He says this study shows the way ahead, because it used DNA sequencing techniques to identify interesting changes in gut microbes. Dr. MEKALANOS: The tracking of the biota, if you will, using the state of the art new generation sequencing techniques, is what makes this paper particularly powerful. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Experiments using these techniques could reveal key microbial players that researchers could then try to manipulate to see what happens. Jeffrey Gordon says theyre now planning similar studies using gut bacteria communities from all kinds of people. Dr. GORDON: We could sample people living in different cultural contexts, eating different diets, and look at the affects of their communities in mice eating the same diets or even different diets. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says this will let them begin to tease out the complex relationship between human gut microbes, diet and weight gain or loss. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.  STEVE INSKEEP, host:  Could be this next story helps to explain the last few pounds youve gained. When you eat breakfast, the microbes in your stomach are eating too. Now a new study suggests that a high-fat, high-sugar diet can produce big changes in those microbes and the changes might actually contribute to obesity. NPRs Nell Greenfieldboyce has more.  NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: Our guts are just teeming with microbes. Jeffrey Gordon studies them at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.  Dr. JEFFREY GORDON (Washington University): We have this huge collection of trillions and trillions of microbes that live in our intestines. And one of their functions is to process those components of our diet that we can't digest on our own.  GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says who exactly is living in your gut might affect what you get out of food.  Dr. GORDON: The energetic and nutrient value of food may not be an absolute term but one that is modified in part by the microbes that live in our gut.  GREENFIELDBOYCE: For example, recent studies have suggested certain types of gut bacteria are associated with obesity. Gordon wanted to explore all of this in an easy to use lab animal - the mouse. So his team took completely germ free mice and basically fed them human gut bacteria. The result was mice with microbe communities in their guts that mimic the ones found in people.  Then the researchers started experimenting. The mice first ate a healthy low-fat, plant-rich mouse chow. But then they were switched to a high-fat, high-sugar diet. In less than 24 hours, the researchers saw big changes in the animals gut bacteria.  Dr. GORDON: And we were quite amazed that the community really restructured itself.  GREENFIELDBOYCE: Gordon says the unhealthy diet produced microbe winners and losers.  Dr. GORDON: Certain members of that society of microbes became very dominant, and certain members became more diminutive.  GREENFIELDBOYCE: To see if this change might mean anything in terms of weight gain, the researchers put these altered communities of bacteria into other germ-free mice. Even though these new mice ate the healthy low-fat mouse chow, they accumulated extra body fat over the course of the next two weeks.  The result is reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine. It surprised John Mekalanos. Hes chair of the department of microbiology and molecular genetics at Harvard Medical School.  Dr. JOHN MEKALANOS (Harvard Medical School): This paper addressed squarely the idea that the microbiota affects are ability to metabolize food in a way that might predispose us to obesity.  GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says the ultimate goal would be new therapies for obesity or malnutrition. But to know if thats even possible, scientists have to learn a lot more about what specific bacteria do in our gut. He says this study shows the way ahead, because it used DNA sequencing techniques to identify interesting changes in gut microbes.  Dr. MEKALANOS: The tracking of the biota, if you will, using the state of the art new generation sequencing techniques, is what makes this paper particularly powerful.  GREENFIELDBOYCE: Experiments using these techniques could reveal key microbial players that researchers could then try to manipulate to see what happens. Jeffrey Gordon says theyre now planning similar studies using gut bacteria communities from all kinds of people.  Dr. GORDON: We could sample people living in different cultural contexts, eating different diets, and look at the affects of their communities in mice eating the same diets or even different diets.  GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says this will let them begin to tease out the complex relationship between human gut microbes, diet and weight gain or loss.  Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: The whole reason to smash a rocket part into this dark crater was that scientists thought water might be lurking down there in the form of ice.

A single bluefin tuna can fetch $100,000 at market before its cut into sushi. But its been severely overfished. So, its also one of the most endangered fish in the sea. Over the weekend, the international commission that regulates fishing voted to reduce the quota for bluefin tuna. As NPRs Richard Harris reports, the new quota still allows too much fishing to assure the tunas survival. RICHARD HARRIS: Every year since its inception decades ago, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas gets together to set fishing limits for the bluefin tuna. And every year, the commission has ignored the advice of its own scientists. Its under heavy pressure from the fishing industry, particularly boats working the waters off Europe, who want to catch far more fish than the scientists say is safe. But this year, for a change, the commission suggested a quota that falls within the range of their scientists advice. And Jane Lubchenco, who heads the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says this new quota is a significant improvement. Dr. JANE LUBCHENCO (Administrator, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration): But it does not go far enough. Its insufficient to guarantee the long-term viability of either the fish, or the fishery. HARRIS: Lubchenco, as a biologist, is passionate about bluefin tuna. And Lubchenco also has a responsibility as the nations chief fishing regulator to protect the species from being fished to commercial extinction. Dr. LUBCHENCO: Bluefin tuna are spectacular creatures and we have a responsibility to ensure their survival. We also understand that the survival of the fishery depends on having healthy populations of fish. HARRIS: The latest deal establishes a new, lower fishing quota, and also puts in place new rules designed to reduce overfishing. Even so, the commission itself figures even if these rules are followed, theres only a 60 percent chance that the species will recover by the year 2023. Dr. LUBCHENCO: Thats not a high probability, but its much better than the current probability. HARRIS: The chances of a recovery are based on the assumption that fishermen will actually keep to the quotas that have been negotiated. Joseph Powers at Louisiana State University is a science adviser to the tuna commission. And he says the new quota looks okay  at least on paper. Dr. JOSEPH POWERS (Louisiana State University): If, in fact, that were perfectly implemented, then yes, you would start to begin the long recovery process. HARRIS: But the fisheries, particularly around Europe, have a dreadful track record in implementing tuna quotas. Susan Lieberman at the Pew Environment Group says some European nations do a very poor job of enforcing the quotas. Ms. SUSAN LIEBERMAN (Director, International Policy, Pew Environment Group): And theres a lot of illegal fishing going on, again, particularly in the Mediterranean. HARRIS: She says fishermen sometimes catch twice as many fish as they are allowed to under the formal quotas. So even though the tuna commission has finally paid attention to its scientists on Eastern bluefin tuna, Lieberman is still very discouraged. Ms. LIEBERMAN: I would say its not really so much a turning point, as a baby step in the right direction. I dont know if the bluefin tuna has enough time for all the little, tiny steps, but its better than nothing. HARRIS: Lieberman says the commission probably went as far as it did because conservation groups, including hers, are trying to get bluefin tuna protected as an endangered species under a treaty called CITES. The government of Monaco has made that a formal proposal. Commissioners hoped they could forestall that action if they took serious enough steps at this meeting. The U. S. government strongly supports Monacos efforts to ban bluefin tuna trade. But today, NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco was a bit noncommittal about what exactly that means. Dr. LUBCHENCO: Because the meetings have just concluded. We havent had time to consult within the U. S. government and to decide exactly what our next steps are.

Even the most well-scrubbed homes will have some dust buildup somewhere, and the reason to remove dust is not just aesthetic. As NPR's Joe Palca reports, dust has some potentially harmful stuff in it. JOE PALCA: As they used to say in Elizabethan times: How dost thou? (Soundbite of vacuum cleaner) PALCA: I tend to favor a vacuum. On the other hand, nature abhors a vacuum. But before we get into removing dust, let's talk a bit about what dust is and how it gets into your house. Dr. PALOMA BEAMER (University of Arizona): Outdoor soil particles that come in on your shoes. PALCA: Paloma Beamer is on the faculty of the University of Arizona in Tucson and something of a dustologist. Outdoor soil is one element in dust. Another is the tiny particles in air that float in when you open a window or door. And then there's the indoor component of dust. Dr. BEAMER: Like pieces of your carpet fiber or your furniture, your bedding or anything like that that starts decaying. PALCA: The indoor components also include certain bits of organic matter. Dr. BEAMER: A lot of our skin flakes and dander off your pets and other insects or bugs that might be in the home. PALCA: Now, as anyone who's looked under a sofa knows, there's dense dust and there's fluffy dust. Dr. BEAMER: So a lot of the fluffy things, I think, tend to do more when you get a lot of fibers. In my house, it comes from cat hair. PALCA: Beamer is interested in dust because it's one way people can be exposed to toxic substances. For example, for someone living near a toxic waste site, some of those chemicals can end up in house dust. The question is how much. In a recent paper in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, she calculates the proportion of dust that's from indoor sources compared to outdoor. Dr. BEAMER: The indoor percentage would be around 34 percent, and then the two-thirds from outdoor comes both from soil tracked in and the outdoor air particles. PALCA: But to understand the potential for exposure, it's also crucial to understand how dust can get into your body. Turns out, for dust, size matters. Dr. ANDREA FERRO (Clarkson University): The big thing about particles and breathing particles is the size of those. PALCA: Andrea Ferro is also a dust expert. She's at Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York. She says some of the particles are small enough that they can float in the air, and we can breathe them into our lungs. Others are larger and tend to sink more rapidly to the ground. One thing that's remarkable about dust is that it sticks around. Ferro says without vacuuming, it can stick around for a long time. Dr. FERRO: And we're finding things like DDT in many indoor dust samples. We haven't had - you know, we banned that decades ago, but it's still there. PALCA: In addition to breathing in dust though your nose, you can also swallow it. Duke University's Heather Stapleton is an environmental chemist. She says you may not be in the habit of licking the floors or carpets in your home, but some younger members of your household might be doing essentially that. Dr. HEATHER STAPLETON (Environmental Chemist, Duke University): Being the parent of a six-month-old, I can't tell you how many times I look at my son and I see him with his hands in the mouth all the time, or picking up a toy and putting it in his mouth. So it's incredibly difficult to quantify what mass of dust you're actually exposed to and any contaminants associated with that dust. But it definitely occurs. PALCA: Stapleton says it's really hard to estimate just how much exposure a person has to the chemicals in dust. But, obviously, reducing the amount of dust will reduce your exposure. Dr. BEAMER: Keeping a well-dusted home, a well-vacuumed home will reduce the dust in your home the most. PALCA: Paloma Beamer says you want to get a good vacuum, and if it has one, change the bag before it gets too full. Dr. BEAMER: I think it's important to remind yourself to not just vacuum your floor, but also your upholstered furniture. PALCA: Yeah. Oh, dear. OK. More work to do. (Soundbite of laughter) (Soundbite of vacuum) PALCA: Joe Palca, NPR News, Washington. (Soundbite of music) INSKEEP: Dusting the globe. This is NPR News.

For example, for someone living near a toxic waste site, some of those chemicals can end up in house dust. The question is how much. In a recent paper in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, she calculates the proportion of dust that's from indoor sources compared to outdoor.  Dr. BEAMER: The indoor percentage would be around 34 percent, and then the two-thirds from outdoor comes both from soil tracked in and the outdoor air particles.  PALCA: But to understand the potential for exposure, it's also crucial to understand how dust can get into your body. Turns out, for dust, size matters.  Dr. ANDREA FERRO (Clarkson University): The big thing about particles and breathing particles is the size of those.  PALCA: Andrea Ferro is also a dust expert. She's at Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York. She says some of the particles are small enough that they can float in the air, and we can breathe them into our lungs. Others are larger and tend to sink more rapidly to the ground. One thing that's remarkable about dust is that it sticks around. Ferro says without vacuuming, it can stick around for a long time.  Dr. FERRO: And we're finding things like DDT in many indoor dust samples. We haven't had - you know, we banned that decades ago, but it's still there.  PALCA: In addition to breathing in dust though your nose, you can also swallow it. Duke University's Heather Stapleton is an environmental chemist. She says you may not be in the habit of licking the floors or carpets in your home, but some younger members of your household might be doing essentially that.  Dr. HEATHER STAPLETON (Environmental Chemist, Duke University): Being the parent of a six-month-old, I can't tell you how many times I look at my son and I see him with his hands in the mouth all the time, or picking up a toy and putting it in his mouth. So it's incredibly difficult to quantify what mass of dust you're actually exposed to and any contaminants associated with that dust. But it definitely occurs.  PALCA: Stapleton says it's really hard to estimate just how much exposure a person has to the chemicals in dust. But, obviously, reducing the amount of dust will reduce your exposure.  Dr. BEAMER: Keeping a well-dusted home, a well-vacuumed home will reduce the dust in your home the most.  PALCA: Paloma Beamer says you want to get a good vacuum, and if it has one, change the bag before it gets too full.  Dr. BEAMER: I think it's important to remind yourself to not just vacuum your floor, but also your upholstered furniture.  PALCA: Yeah. Oh, dear. OK. More work to do.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Rainforests are often cut down, and coral reefs are overfished by poor people who are struggling to get by. There are hundreds of aid projects around the world that try to protect these habitats. The idea is to create other methods for the poor to make money. As NPR's Richard Harris reports, a young scientist traveled to the Central Pacific to investigate whether these programs work, and she was shocked at what she found. RICHARD HARRIS: The island nation of Kiribati has a very simple economy. People either catch fish, or they pick coconuts from their trees and produce coconut oil. Ms. SHEILA WALSH (Postdoctoral Researcher, Brown University): Most people have a little bit of land, and they have access to the coral reefs, and so they should easily be able to switch between the two; and they do, actually. HARRIS: Sheila Walsh is a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University. She says the government of Kiribati had a program that was designed to protect the fish on the reef by subsidizing the local coconut industry. Ms. WALSH: The thought was that by paying people more to do coconut agriculture, they would do less fishing and that this would fulfill two goals: One, they would reduce overfishing; and two that people would be better off. They'd have higher incomes. HARRIS: Walsh wanted to know whether this plan was working, and the government said go ahead, find out. So, as part of her graduate studies at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, she flew to Kiribati to interview fishermen. Ms. WALSH: And it turned out that, actually, the result of paying people more to do coconut agriculture was actually to increase fishing. HARRIS: How could that be? Ms. WALSH: Right. It was a bit of a surprise, and we were wondering: What's going on here? HARRIS: The answer was simplicity itself. Her study concludes that people earned more money making coconut oil, which meant that they could work less to support themselves, and they spent their new leisure time fishing. Ms. WALSH: It hit us like a bumper sticker saying, you know, a bad day fishing is better than a good day working, and I think that's sort of the story here. HARRIS: The impact on the reef was distressing. The fish population had dropped to even lower levels, putting the whole ecosystem at risk. HARRIS: It turns out that Walsh had stumbled into a universal truth about fishing. Fishermen aren't just in it for the money. Anthropologist Richard Pollnac at the University of Rhode Island says just think of those snazzy sport-fishing excursions. Professor RICHARD POLLNAC (Anthropologist, University of Rhode Island): People pay big money to go sports-fishing. HARRIS: Fishing as an occupation provides psychic benefits, as well as money. Pollnac argues not just individuals but whole cultures get hooked on the thrill of being out on the water and the gamble of coming back with either a boatload or empty-handed. Prof. POLLNAC: This type of an occupation selects for a certain type of personality, and that personality type will not be happy in many other occupations other than fishing. HARRIS: As a result, attempts to get fishermen to do something else \ufffd even something that pays better \ufffd often end in failure, Pollnac says. Prof. POLLNAC: There have been projects where they had vessel buyback programs, and almost 50 percent of the fishermen used that money to buy another boat and do another type of fishing and, in some cases, get right back into fishing. HARRIS: The track record for international projects is poorly studied, which makes Sheila Walsh's research notable. Pollnac says he can't point to any real successes. Prof. POLLNAC: A great deal of the international development money, I would argue, is basically wasted. HARRIS: This problem is not lost on Craig Leisher at the Nature Conservancy. His organization does spend money to help fishermen seek other livelihoods. But does it keep them out of their boats? Mr. CRAIG LEISHER (Policy Advisor, Nature Conservancy): Well, no. It doesn't work to get them off the water. Rarely. HARRIS: So he says the Nature Conservancy funds non-fishing jobs as a tactic to help during a transition. For example, fishermen may need a temporary source of income when a new no-fishing zone is established. Fishermen lose their fishing income for a while, until the regional fish population recovers. Mr. LEISHER: What we have found with our research is that a lot of alternative income activities are not successful in the long term, so what we do is just look for activities that can benefit communities just in the near terms, the next two or three years. HARRIS: Which brings us back to the island nation of Kiribati.

It's a camera, a camera that spent over 15 years in space. It was inside the Hubble telescope, taking astoundingly beautiful images of celestial objects. Hubble started out as a national disgrace. But as NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports, this camera turned Hubble into a triumph. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: The Hubble Space Telescope is still whizzing around the planet, but at the Air and Space Museum, you can see a full-scale model, and now, below it, is a display case. It holds something that looks a little like a black baby grand piano. This is the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2. Earlier today, Ed Weiler saw it for the first time since 1993. Mr. EDWARD WEILER (Associate Administrator, Science Mission Directorate, NASA): It was like seeing a long lost brother or sister. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So, is it fair to say that you love this thing? Mr. WEILER: Love is a many-dimensioned word. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. WEILER: Let's put it this way. Without this thing, my career would have gone a very different direction, to say the least. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Ed Weiler is now head of NASA's Science Mission Directorate. Back in 1990, he was chief scientist for Hubble, when NASA launched the telescope and made a sickening discovery. The main mirror had a flaw. The images were fuzzy. This Hubble trouble made the telescope a laughing stock. Mr. WEILER: You know, it was an intense period. I mean, we went from the top of Mount Everest at launch to the bottom of Death Valley a month later. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But Weiler says his team had hoped. They'd already started constructing a backup camera. They decided to compensate for Hubble's problem by changing four little, tiny mirrors, the size of nickels, in this replacement camera. In 1993, astronauts took it up. Mr. WEILER: The first picture came back from this, and it was perfect. It was fixed, and that was just a cathartic moment that I'll - I put up there with the birth of my two children, history, I'll never forget. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The astronauts also installed a set of corrective optics called COSTAR for other instruments. That's now on display too. But Weiler says iconic images like the famous pillars of creation came from this camera. Mr. WEILER: So in terms of our connection to the public, this is the camera that saved Hubble. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The camera returned to Earth in May after astronauts removed it so they can install a newer version. David Devorkin is a curator at the museum. He says this camera deserves to be enshrined here for our descendants. Mr. DAVID DEVORKIN (Curator, Division of Space History, Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum): They will look at this and say, well, in the late 20th century, we devoted an enormous amount of very, very high talent and resources to learning more about the universe. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He'd love to put the actual Hubble telescope right next to it. Mr. DEVORKIN: We're very, very happy to accept it if NASA decides to bring it home. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But with the Space Shuttle supposed to be retired next year, that is not likely.

Two carp species from Asia \ufffd the silver and the bighead \ufffd are invasive fish with huge appetites, and if they enter the Great Lakes, they could overwhelm the native fish. In order to halt their migration, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers built an underwater electric fence on a canal 20 miles south of Lake Michigan. But now tests have indicated that Asian carp have gotten close to the lake despite that. David Lodge performed those tests. He's director of the Center for Aquatic Conservation at the University of Notre Dame. Welcome to the program, and tell us what your sampling found. Professor DAVID LODGE (Director, Center for Aquatic Conservation, University of Notre Dame): Well, what we found is that, surprisingly, the carp seem to be much closer to Lake Michigan than anyone previously thought. Using a new approach to measuring what we call Environmental DNA in the water, we've detected the presence of carp or at least their DNA in places much closer to Lake Michigan than the traditional tools had told us. SIEGEL: You're saying you haven't actually found a carp there but you have found the DNA of these species. Prof. LODGE: That's right. I think you can think of this e-DNA, as we call it, as the equivalent for environmental protection of, say, using DNA in crime fighting to detect whether a suspect was at the crime scene. So, we don't actually have a body, but we have DNA. SIEGEL: Well, what would happen if there, indeed, were many bodies of these carp species in the lake? Prof. LODGE: We can't, of course, know what impact they'd have in the Great Lakes with certainty. But there's lots of reasons to think that they would be highly damaging. We can look, for example, to what happened in the Mississippi River and the Illinois rivers where these fish now often constitute up to 90 percent or more of what fishermen catch, where commercial fisheries have been almost destroyed with this very abundant fish that has very low commercial value. In addition, the silver carp, especially, have this unusual habit of jumping high out of the water and they've harmed many people. They're like living missiles. And because they reach weights of up to 80 to 100 pounds, a fast-moving boat and a person sitting in it collides with such a fish is likely to come out much worse for the wear. SIEGEL: Wow. They actually are a hazard, you're saying, in the water. Prof. LODGE: They are a very serious hazard for boaters. SIEGEL: Now, the carp - these Asian carp - as they get closer to the Great Lakes are coming up river. How did they get there in the first place? Prof. LODGE: Well, they were first brought to control nuisance algae and other nuisance organisms in aqua culture ponds, where the primary goal was to produce other fish. But like all sorts of other organisms introduced for fisheries and for pets and for horticulture, these fishes escaped and they have found the environment of the Midwest - the Mississippi River Basin - very much to their liking. SIEGEL: Professor Lodge, I've heard of the idea of possibly poisoning the Asian carp somehow in the water. Is that an option? Prof. LODGE: There is a plan to poison a five- or six-mile reach of the canal in order to reduce the populations immediately below the electric barrier. That plan was developed before our latest results, which suggests that the carp are above the barrier. It nevertheless remains important to conduct that poisoning, and to realize that just because there may be some carp above the barrier that the game is not over. It's not time to give up. There are lots of examples of invasions that while may initially look successful, may fail or certainly could be made to fail with effective management. We shouldn't give up at this point. SIEGEL: That's David Lodge who is director of the Center for Aquatic Conservation at the University of Notre Dame. Professor Lodge, thank you very much. Prof. LODGE: Thank you.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  Fish that have the potential to devastate the Great Lakes ecosystem may be just a few miles from Lake Michigan. Two carp species from Asia \ufffd the silver and the bighead \ufffd are invasive fish with huge appetites, and if they enter the Great Lakes, they could overwhelm the native fish.  In order to halt their migration, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers built an underwater electric fence on a canal 20 miles south of Lake Michigan. But now tests have indicated that Asian carp have gotten close to the lake despite that.  David Lodge performed those tests. He's director of the Center for Aquatic Conservation at the University of Notre Dame.  Welcome to the program, and tell us what your sampling found.  Professor DAVID LODGE (Director, Center for Aquatic Conservation, University of Notre Dame): Well, what we found is that, surprisingly, the carp seem to be much closer to Lake Michigan than anyone previously thought.  Using a new approach to measuring what we call Environmental DNA in the water, we've detected the presence of carp or at least their DNA in places much closer to Lake Michigan than the traditional tools had told us.  SIEGEL: You're saying you haven't actually found a carp there but you have found the DNA of these species.  Prof. LODGE: That's right. I think you can think of this e-DNA, as we call it, as the equivalent for environmental protection of, say, using DNA in crime fighting to detect whether a suspect was at the crime scene. So, we don't actually have a body, but we have DNA.  SIEGEL: Well, what would happen if there, indeed, were many bodies of these carp species in the lake?  Prof. LODGE: We can't, of course, know what impact they'd have in the Great Lakes with certainty. But there's lots of reasons to think that they would be highly damaging. We can look, for example, to what happened in the Mississippi River and the Illinois rivers where these fish now often constitute up to 90 percent or more of what fishermen catch, where commercial fisheries have been almost destroyed with this very abundant fish that has very low commercial value.  In addition, the silver carp, especially, have this unusual habit of jumping high out of the water and they've harmed many people. They're like living missiles. And because they reach weights of up to 80 to 100 pounds, a fast-moving boat and a person sitting in it collides with such a fish is likely to come out much worse for the wear.  SIEGEL: Wow. They actually are a hazard, you're saying, in the water.  Prof. LODGE: They are a very serious hazard for boaters.  SIEGEL: Now, the carp - these Asian carp - as they get closer to the Great Lakes are coming up river. How did they get there in the first place?  Prof. LODGE: Well, they were first brought to control nuisance algae and other nuisance organisms in aqua culture ponds, where the primary goal was to produce other fish. But like all sorts of other organisms introduced for fisheries and for pets and for horticulture, these fishes escaped and they have found the environment of the Midwest - the Mississippi River Basin - very much to their liking.  SIEGEL: Professor Lodge, I've heard of the idea of possibly poisoning the Asian carp somehow in the water. Is that an option?

Scientists do not know what killed off woolly mammoths and other animals after the last ice age - maybe the climate changed, maybe a comet struck the earth, maybe humans hunted them down. Now, a study out today in Science magazine examines some evidence the animals left behind. Here's NPR's Richard Harris. RICHARD HARRIS: After the end of the last ice age, North America was covered with large animals, even more diverse than we see in Africa today. Ms. JACQUELINE GILL (Doctoral Student, University of Wisconsin in Madison): We had, you know, the iconic mammoths and mastodons but also beaver the size of black bear, you know, giant ground sloths. There were camels and horses in North America, which is often a surprise to many people. And then, of course, their predators, right, like the American lion, the short-faced bear, the dire wolves, etc. HARRIS: Jacqueline Gill is getting her Ph. D. at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, and she's fascinated by how we came to have such diverse wildlife, and why those animals are all gone today. Ms. GILL: By about 11,000 years ago we lose about half of the animals in North America larger than the size of a German shepherd, and that's a pretty big ecological event. HARRIS: There aren't enough bones left to figure out in detail when exactly they all went extinct, but Gill and her colleagues hit upon a nifty method to track the abundance of grazing animals. The scientists study, of all things, a certain species of fungus. Spores of the fungus end up in lake sediments that date back some 15,000 years. Ms. GILL: So, the spores from this fungus are preserved in the lake, and this fungus only grows on animal dung. HARRIS: When there were lots of large animals, there was lots of dung. When the animals went away, so did the dung and the fungus that lived on those droppings. So, by studying the amount of this fungus in various layers of lake sediment, Gill and her group have pieced together a timetable that helps resolve how and when these animals died out. One of the long-held ideas had been that a climate shift caused a change in vegetation, and the new plant matter was no good for these grazing animals, so they starved. But no - Gill and company have disproved that by putting a date on the animals' decline. It was way back, more than 14,000 years ago. Ms. GILL: And this happens before some of the widespread vegetation change that we see in the areas that we studied, which suggest to us that habitat loss is actually not a cause of the decline, but possibly a consequence. HARRIS: That is, the vegetation might have changed after the browsing animals disappeared and stopped munching on it. The new dates also help eliminate other ideas that have been argued over the years. John Alroy at the University of California, Santa Barbara, says it's clear that the extinctions couldn't have been caused by a cold snap called the Younger Dryas. Mr. JOHN ALROY (University of California, Santa Barbara): These data show that the extinction happened well before that time, and there's also been a recent paper arguing that the extinction might have been caused by the impact of a comet, and that impact appears to have happened much, much later than the decline, at least this location. HARRIS: So what does that leave? Well, human beings were moving into North America at that time, so Alroy says this is more evidence that hunters played a key role in driving those large animals to extinction. Mr. ALROY: And now really the question is, exactly what did humans do to cause this large extinction? HARRIS: Jacqueline Gill at Madison is interested in that question, too, because she notes human beings are now forcing another mass extinction as we reshape habitat around the world.

Well, sometimes, what you believe can affect what you see. For example, skin color. According to a new study, you will see a biracial political candidate's skin as lighter or darker depending on whether or not you agree with his or her beliefs. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: Eugene Caruso is a researcher at the University of Chicago. He recently asked: Do people's political beliefs affect how they perceive a candidate's skin tone? Professor EUGENE CARUSO (Researcher, University of Chicago): And I guess, sort of being a social psychologist, I felt compelled to do at least one study with Barack Obama, given all the interest surrounding, you know, his campaign. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He and two colleagues took existing photos of then-candidate Obama and digitally manipulated the parts of the photos that showed exposed skin. Prof. CARUSO: So we sort of isolated the head and the hands of Obama and altered the skin tone to make it relatively lighter in tone, or relatively darker in tone. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Then they showed the altered and unaltered photos one at a time to about 200 university students. Prof. CARUSO: And essentially, we asked them to rate how well each of these photos represents who Obama really is. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The students were also asked about their political beliefs and whether they saw themselves as liberals or conservatives. Here's what the researchers found. Prof. CARUSO: Participants whose partisanship matched that of the candidate they were evaluating, so, say, liberals evaluating Barack Obama in this case consistently rated the lightened photographs as more representative of who he really was than the darkened photograph. GREENFIELDBOYCE: People who disagreed with the candidate and held conservative views did the opposite. Prof. CARUSO: That is, they rated the darkened photograph as more representative of who he really was, compared to the lightened photographs. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Caruso says they didn't have a lot of non-white students judging the photos in this study, but their patterns tended to be the same.

GREENFIELDBOYCE: The results are reported in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Keith Maddox is a psychology researcher at Tufts University who studied the social meaning of skin tone. He says the findings go with long-held cultural prejudices about things that are light as being positive and things that are dark as being negative. Professor KEITH MADDOX (Psychology Researcher, Tufts University): You know, we think about, you know, the guy wearing the black hat as the bad guy, and the guy wearing the white hat is the good guy. You know, there are all these different sorts of cultural associations like, you know, angel food cake and devil food cake. And so, that's one of the reasons I find it interesting in that it's this idea that, you know, that political affiliation or that association that you might have with somebody who agrees with you can sort of change the way you perceive them in a real, kind of a real physical sense. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says people know their existing beliefs influence how they respond to someone's ideas. But they might be surprised to learn that their beliefs can literally shape the way they see the person. Prof. MADDOX: If the brain can bias the perception of, you know, an opinion, it can bias the perception of somebody that we think of as more concrete like the, you know, the apparent physical appearance of somebody.

Attempts at a level-headed, fact-based discussion can easily be taken over by passionate emotions on either side. So why is that? Drew Westen is an Emory University professor of psychology and author of \"The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation. \" He joins us from Atlanta, Georgia. Welcome. Professor DREW WESTEN (Psychology, Emory University; Author, \"The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation\"): Thanks for having me on, Jennifer. LUDDEN: So Professor Westen, how does our brain process political messages? Prof. WESTEN: Well, you know, it's interesting to listen to the discussion we've just heard because what you tend to hear from the right are powerful, emotional phrases, and what you tend to hear from the left are rational discussions, and our brains really evolved to first hear the emotional side and second to think about it and really in many ways for good reasons because, you know, when you are - when humans were evolving, if you see a snake, if you stop and say well, let me see, what genus and species is that, you're probably dead. And if you respond first to the, you know, to the emotion, oh, it's a snake, you jump away from it. LUDDEN: So does that mean the right always has an advantage or whoever is using the most emotion in its debate? I mean, on illegal immigration, for example? Prof. WESTEN: You know, our brains evolved to integrate reason and emotion, but the right does have an advantage because they understand that these issues are emotional issues, and Democrats and the left keep returning to them as rational issues. I mean, a great example being the safety issue with immigration. You can't get to that - you don't want to even talk about that safety issue if you're a proponent of rights for illegal immigrants if you start from the point of view of let's talk about this as a safety issue. You first have to allay people's concerns about the illegal immigrants we have in this country first. And you'll notice, it was not an accident that the - your guests who are coming from the right, Ira Mehlman did a great example, it was a great example of this. He never failed to use terms like illegal aliens, which turns, I mean, it turns people into, you know, some mutant variant of E. T. LUDDEN: Right, versus the undocumented immigrant worker that the left would favor. Prof. WESTEN: Absolutely. And in fact, actually, that's a great one. Here's one where you can probably get away with undocumented workers on NPR. But in general, I've actually polled this is that it turns out that undocumented workers is actually a worse phrase to use if you want to advance the cause of doing something progressive or reasonable for the 12 million illegal immigrants we have in this country now because people hear that as - they hear that as a euphemism, or they hear - when they hear undocumented, where their mind goes to is, well, a bunch of them do have documents. What kind of documents are they? They're forged documents. And people are a lot more bothered by the idea of forgery than they are about people coming over the border to try to feed their kids. LUDDEN: Isn't that interesting? Let's move to health care now. We should note you have consulted with Georgia State Democratic Party, but a lot of the opposition to health care, to health care overhaul has been from Republicans. We've had raucous town hall meetings and tea party demonstrations. How do you analyze the Republican strategy on health care? Prof. WESTEN: Well, the Republican strategy was clear. I actually did the - I led up the messaging efforts for some nonpartisan groups back during and immediately before the presidential election. And the messaging strategy for the Republican was clear back then what it was going to be, which is - and you heard it actually from the Republican congresswoman who I think he heard on before, who talked about rationing and a bureaucrat becoming - coming between you and your physician. It's basically to tell a very, very simple story, which is that what Democrats really want is to step in between you and your doctor because they fundamentally don't believe in a free market, and they fundamentally believe that some bureaucrat in Washington knows better than you do how to spend your health care dollars and what kind of decisions you should make. It's a really, really simple, but frankly, emotionally very compelling, argument. LUDDEN: Now, what about just briefly the argument that President Obama, over on the Democratic side, somehow just can't get emotional enough about selling health care? Prof. WESTEN: It's absolutely right. I mean, the only way that you can get people - I mean, this is inherently an emotional issue because it touches, you know, it touches all of us. But part of the problem is that when you're trying to talk about an issue like this, you really have to tell a story the way the Republicans do, which is a story that has antagonists, that has protagonists. It's the kind of story that our brains really evolved to hear, and yet the president does not like to have antagonists in his stories. LUDDEN: Professor Drew Westen, you're going to stick with us a few minutes more, but we're going to take a short break right now. Professor Westen is author of \"The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation. \" This is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. I'm Jennifer Ludden. (Soundbite of music) LUDDEN: I'm Jennifer Ludden, and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Michel Martin is away. Coming up, the latest wave of immigration, not from Latin America but to it, that story in a few moments. First, though, we continue our discussion of emotion as a political force. Our guest is Emory University psychology professor Drew Westen. He's the author of \"The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation,\" and professor, thanks for staying with us. Prof. WESTEN: Happy to be here. LUDDEN: Now on Friday, President Obama's approval rating for the first time dropped below 50 percent as measured by Gallup. In her Sunday New York Times column, Maureen Dowd suggested that President Obama could learn a thing or two from Sarah Palin on how to be more visceral and connect with voters on a gut level. It sounds like you might agree. Prof. WESTEN: Well, actually, I'd go back a little further than Sarah Palin, probably back to FDR, who had the most similar circumstances to President Obama. I mean, what FDR did in a case like this, when he was facing one industry after another that was really fleecing the American public, he said to them, and he said quite famously, you know, at no time in the history of this country have so many powerful special interests focused their hatred on one man, and I welcome their hatred. And what he did then was to go on to say - systematically, he went through, and he went after every one of those industries that were endangering the financial security of Americans. He built a WPA, a work program so that people could go back to work who were out of work, and he minced no words about this being Hoover's depression. It was the Republicans' depression. It was the depression that came from unregulated greed. And President Obama just will not do that. He will not blame the recession or this great recession on anyone. LUDDEN: Though his critics claim that he keeps doing that and is doing it for too long, and people are starting to now associate the recession with him. Prof. WESTEN: Well, they're associating the recession with him because he never mentioned it. He never mentioned from the start that this was a recession he inherited. You know, you can - he has actually never once uttered the name George Bush since he's been president, and only on three or four occasions has he said I inherited this, guys. And this was something that I actually wrote about in the first week of his presidency, arguing that he was going to have a failed presidency if he didn't start branding this recession as the recession caused by Bush and the Republicans, as caused by a philosophy of unregulated greed and that if he didn't start talking about why we needed deficit spending right now, because otherwise he was going to get stuck with a $1. 2 trillion deficit that he was left with. It was going to get blamed on him. And you know, just in terms of strategies for that, FDR played offense on that. So he went right after the bankers. He ran four times in a row against Hoover. LUDDEN: And yet, we have President Obama, who really ran on the fact that he could rise above this conflict. So you're saying instead of rising above, he needs to kind of wallow in it and play it up? Prof. WESTEN: I think what he'd like to do is to not have the conflict at all and just stay out of it. And the problem is that if you're going to run on reform, if you're going to say we need big changes, you have to do two things from an emotional standpoint. The first is you have to make people concerned about what the current situation is, which they sure were back in January, and you have to make them angry towards the people who caused it. If you don't do those two things and then follow it with your message of hope, what's going to happen to you is what has happened to President Obama, which is people are now, you know, blaming the recession on him. They're basically saying, hey, you broke this up, you broke this, you own it. LUDDEN: All right. Drew Westen is Emory University professor of psychology. He is also the author of \"The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation\" and joined us from Georgia Public Broadcasting in Atlanta. Thanks so much. Prof. WESTEN: Thanks for having me on.  JENNIFER LUDDEN, host:  Two topics we've just heard about today, illegal immigration and health care, are among the hottest of hot-button political issues.

Prof. WESTEN: You know, our brains evolved to integrate reason and emotion, but the right does have an advantage because they understand that these issues are emotional issues, and Democrats and the left keep returning to them as rational issues.  I mean, a great example being the safety issue with immigration. You can't get to that - you don't want to even talk about that safety issue if you're a proponent of rights for illegal immigrants if you start from the point of view of let's talk about this as a safety issue.  You first have to allay people's concerns about the illegal immigrants we have in this country first. And you'll notice, it was not an accident that the - your guests who are coming from the right, Ira Mehlman did a great example, it was a great example of this. He never failed to use terms like illegal aliens, which turns, I mean, it turns people into, you know, some mutant variant of E. T.  LUDDEN: Right, versus the undocumented immigrant worker that the left would favor.  Prof. WESTEN: Absolutely. And in fact, actually, that's a great one. Here's one where you can probably get away with undocumented workers on NPR. But in general, I've actually polled this is that it turns out that undocumented workers is actually a worse phrase to use if you want to advance the cause of doing something progressive or reasonable for the 12 million illegal immigrants we have in this country now because people hear that as - they hear that as a euphemism, or they hear - when they hear undocumented, where their mind goes to is, well, a bunch of them do have documents. What kind of documents are they? They're forged documents.  And people are a lot more bothered by the idea of forgery than they are about people coming over the border to try to feed their kids.  LUDDEN: Isn't that interesting? Let's move to health care now. We should note you have consulted with Georgia State Democratic Party, but a lot of the opposition to health care, to health care overhaul has been from Republicans. We've had raucous town hall meetings and tea party demonstrations. How do you analyze the Republican strategy on health care?  Prof. WESTEN: Well, the Republican strategy was clear. I actually did the - I led up the messaging efforts for some nonpartisan groups back during and immediately before the presidential election. And the messaging strategy for the Republican was clear back then what it was going to be, which is - and you heard it actually from the Republican congresswoman who I think he heard on before, who talked about rationing and a bureaucrat becoming - coming between you and your physician.  It's basically to tell a very, very simple story, which is that what Democrats really want is to step in between you and your doctor because they fundamentally don't believe in a free market, and they fundamentally believe that some bureaucrat in Washington knows better than you do how to spend your health care dollars and what kind of decisions you should make. It's a really, really simple, but frankly, emotionally very compelling, argument.  LUDDEN: Now, what about just briefly the argument that President Obama, over on the Democratic side, somehow just can't get emotional enough about selling health care?  Prof. WESTEN: It's absolutely right. I mean, the only way that you can get people - I mean, this is inherently an emotional issue because it touches, you know, it touches all of us. But part of the problem is that when you're trying to talk about an issue like this, you really have to tell a story the way the Republicans do, which is a story that has antagonists, that has protagonists. It's the kind of story that our brains really evolved to hear, and yet the president does not like to have antagonists in his stories.  LUDDEN: Professor Drew Westen, you're going to stick with us a few minutes more, but we're going to take a short break right now. Professor Westen is author of \"The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation. \" This is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. I'm Jennifer Ludden.  (Soundbite of music)  LUDDEN: I'm Jennifer Ludden, and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Michel Martin is away. Coming up, the latest wave of immigration, not from Latin America but to it, that story in a few moments.  First, though, we continue our discussion of emotion as a political force. Our guest is Emory University psychology professor Drew Westen. He's the author of \"The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation,\" and professor, thanks for staying with us.  Prof. WESTEN: Happy to be here.  LUDDEN: Now on Friday, President Obama's approval rating for the first time dropped below 50 percent as measured by Gallup. In her Sunday New York Times column, Maureen Dowd suggested that President Obama could learn a thing or two from Sarah Palin on how to be more visceral and connect with voters on a gut level. It sounds like you might agree.  Prof. WESTEN: Well, actually, I'd go back a little further than Sarah Palin, probably back to FDR, who had the most similar circumstances to President Obama.  I mean, what FDR did in a case like this, when he was facing one industry after another that was really fleecing the American public, he said to them, and he said quite famously, you know, at no time in the history of this country have so many powerful special interests focused their hatred on one man, and I welcome their hatred.  And what he did then was to go on to say - systematically, he went through, and he went after every one of those industries that were endangering the financial security of Americans. He built a WPA, a work program so that people could go back to work who were out of work, and he minced no words about this being Hoover's depression. It was the Republicans' depression. It was the depression that came from unregulated greed.  And President Obama just will not do that. He will not blame the recession or this great recession on anyone.  LUDDEN: Though his critics claim that he keeps doing that and is doing it for too long, and people are starting to now associate the recession with him.  Prof. WESTEN: Well, they're associating the recession with him because he never mentioned it. He never mentioned from the start that this was a recession he inherited. You know, you can - he has actually never once uttered the name George Bush since he's been president, and only on three or four occasions has he said I inherited this, guys.  And this was something that I actually wrote about in the first week of his presidency, arguing that he was going to have a failed presidency if he didn't start branding this recession as the recession caused by Bush and the Republicans, as caused by a philosophy of unregulated greed and that if he didn't start talking about why we needed deficit spending right now, because otherwise he was going to get stuck with a $1. 2 trillion deficit that he was left with. It was going to get blamed on him.  And you know, just in terms of strategies for that, FDR played offense on that. So he went right after the bankers. He ran four times in a row against Hoover.  LUDDEN: And yet, we have President Obama, who really ran on the fact that he could rise above this conflict. So you're saying instead of rising above, he needs to kind of wallow in it and play it up?  Prof. WESTEN: I think what he'd like to do is to not have the conflict at all and just stay out of it. And the problem is that if you're going to run on reform, if you're going to say we need big changes, you have to do two things from an emotional standpoint.  The first is you have to make people concerned about what the current situation is, which they sure were back in January, and you have to make them angry towards the people who caused it. If you don't do those two things and then follow it with your message of hope, what's going to happen to you is what has happened to President Obama, which is people are now, you know, blaming the recession on him. They're basically saying, hey, you broke this up, you broke this, you own it.  LUDDEN: All right. Drew Westen is Emory University professor of psychology. He is also the author of \"The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation\" and joined us from Georgia Public Broadcasting in Atlanta. Thanks so much.

And as NPR's Joe Palca reports, it may be more controversial today than it was when it appeared on this date in 1859. JOE PALCA: The notion that species evolved from simpler forms was not a new one in 1859. There had already been several books, by then, suggesting this radical idea. Mr. JIM ENDERSBY (History of science, University of Sussex): The most famous example being a book that came out in Victorian Britain in 1844 \ufffd an anonymous best-seller. It was called \ufffdThe Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. \ufffd PALCA: Jim Endersby is a historian of science at the University of Sussex in England. He says vestiges may have captured the popular imagination, but it was lambasted by scientists for its multiple factual errors and by the clergy for its affront to religious dogma. Endersby says Darwin's book got a much more positive reception. Mr. ENDERSBY: What really impressed people with Darwin's work was not the idea itself, but the book. It was the fact that there was so much detail, so much evidence. PALCA: And it wasn't just scientists who liked the new theory. Popular history holds that the church's condemnation of Darwin was immediate and universal. Endersby says it's not that simple. For example, Endersby says Darwin sent a copy of his book to one of the leading members of the Church of England, the Reverend Charles Kingsley. Mr. ENDERSBY: And Kingsley writes back to say, you know, it's just as noble a conception of God to think that he created animals and plants that then evolved, that were capable of self-development, as it is to imagine that God has to constantly create new forms and fill in the gaps that he's left in his own creation. And Darwin is very pleased with this quote, and with Kingsley's permission he has it quoted in the next edition of \"The Origin. \" PALCA: The relationship between science and religion was changing when the first edition of \"The Origin\" appeared in 1859. Jim Secord directs the Darwin Correspondence Project at Cambridge University. Mr. JIM SECORD: Traditionally, a lot of clerics had actually been leading scientists, and part of the process of developing the idea of science being a separate career or profession in its own right was in some sense to move away from that. And that's part of where those sign of tensions really arise. PALCA: So when scientists start debating Darwin's ideas about evolution, they're keen to take the debate out of the church. Mr. SECORD: So you start seeing people say, well, let's think about this as a scientific question. That's really what it is. Leave the theology. That'll work itself out in some sort of way. PALCO: Of course, the theology doesn't always work itself out. Just look at the strong anti-evolution sentiment in certain religions in this country. Secord says \"The Origin of Species\" didn't create the rift between science and religion, but it was right there when the rift was opening 150 years ago. Mr. SECORD: These debates about science and religion, if anything, have actually increased in the last 10, 20 years. And so Darwin is really a big talking point for these kinds of questions. And I think people read Darwin and look to Darwin in some sense as a kind of fault line for these kind of continuing controversies. PALCO: In the decades following the 1859 publication, support for Darwin's theory grew in all quarters. But historian Jim Endersby believes that at least some of that support was based on a misunderstanding of Darwin's ideas. He says there is no predetermined endpoint in the theory of evolution by natural selection, no way progress is supposed to go. But Endersby says some people in England misinterpreted the idea of survival of the fittest to mean some people were meant to survive. Mr. ENDERSBY: So the English would read the book, and it's no surprise that English - that the English made Darwin a hero in England and buried him in the headquarters of the Church of England, because they read this as saying, Look, we the English are top nation because we're superior; that is why we have the largest empire the world has ever seen, that's why we had the first industrial revolution, that's why we're so rich and powerful. Thank you, Mr. Darwin - you have told us the scientific explanation for what we already know. We're the best. PALCO: They still treat Darwin as a hero in England. So maybe now that England's international stature is diminished, the English have come to a more nuanced understanding of his theory. Or not.

The correspondence shows that some climate scientists are resorting to bare-knuckle tactics as they defend the consensus view that global warming is a real and serious problem. NPR's Richard Harris has our story. RICHARD HARRIS: Scientific journals are supposed to be impartial filters that let good ideas rise to the top and bad ideas sink to the bottom. But the stolen emails show that some researchers who support the consensus view of climate change have decided that's not working well enough, so they have resorted to strong tactics - including possible boycotts - to keep any paper they think is dubious from reaching the pages of a journal. Dr. GAVIN SCHMIDT (Climate Scientist, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies): In any other field that would just be ignored. The problem is that in the climate field has become extremely politicized and every time some nonsense paper gets into a proper journal, it gets blown out of all proportion. HARRIS: Gavin Schmidt is at NASA's Goddard Institute in New York. Most of the papers he and his colleagues object to challenge the mainstream view of climate science. Schmidt says they may be wrong or even deceptive, but they are still picked up by politicians, pundits and businesses who are skeptical of climate change. But Judy Curry at Georgia Tech says this huge defensive effort by a select group of scientists seems to be getting out of hand. Curry is worried that it's damaging the free flow of ideas in the scientific literature. Professor JUDY CURRY (Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Georgia Tech): You do need gates, but when you spike the gatekeepers, you know, to keep other people out and protect certain insiders, then the gate isn't working. HARRIS: In fact, one of the world's most celebrated climate scientists says the review system has gotten so distorted it's even thwarting him. James Hansen argues the consensus view of global warming actually underestimates the risks. He's just written a book called \ufffdStorms of My Grandchildren. \ufffd In it, he writes he wanted to publish a big paper critical of the consensus view but he had, quote, \ufffdno realistic chance of publishing it in a regular scientific journal,\ufffd close quote, because he assumed the reviewers would reject it to defend their centrist point of view. That said, many of the complaints about the journal review process come from people who think mainstream science is overstating climate hazards. John Christy is at the University of Alabama at Huntsville. He accepts global warming is happening, but he says there's a lot of uncertainty about its causes and impacts. And he says he has trouble getting some of his results published. Professor JOHN CHRISTY (Director of the Earth, System Science Center, University of Alabama, Huntsville): I've done a pretty thorough study of snowfall in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. And the Southern Sierra show no downward trend in snowfall. HARRIS: That's important because snowfall is forecast to decline due to global warming. And that would seriously affect California's water supply. Christy says he's tried three times to get his paper published. So far it's been rejected, and he suspects it's because scientists are trying to stifle his message. Prof. CHRISTY: Everyone from the secretary of energy who has talked about the snowfall in the Sierra going away will not find any comfort in the fact that the trends in snowfall are essentially zero for the last hundred years. HARRIS: So is it being suppressed? Philip Mote at Oregon State University was one of the scientists who reviewed the paper. He said the science in the paper was fine. Dr. PHILIP MOTE (Oregon Climate Change Research Institute, Oregon State University): To my knowledge, there's no suppression going on. It's simply that it's not news. HARRIS: Mote himself published a paper four years ago showing that snowfall in the Southern Sierra hasn't diminished. In fact, he says there are about 10 papers on the subject, certainly not identical to Christy's but still reaching that same broad conclusion. Dr. MOTE: It's not controversial because it's already well known. HARRIS: Still, it's easy to see why Christy suspects deeper motivations. The stolen emails contain sharp personal attacks against him. He says the politics inside climate science are making life harder for him, not just in publishing papers but in getting money to do research. Mote says dissent is important in science. He doesn't agree with everything Christy says, but he says he should have a voice. Dr. MOTE: We need people like John Christy around really looking closely and saying wait is that true and publishing papers pointing things out. HARRIS: Judy Curry from Georgia Tech says the whole email episode shows that climate science could use a healthy dose of sunshine. She suggests that U. S. journals do what some in Europe have started to do, which is to make the peer review process open and public rather than left to the quiet behind-the-scenes maneuvering that is evidenced in the stolen emails.

A big reason for the vaccine shortage has to do with how it's made. It's grown in chicken eggs that have been infected with a modified form of the H1N1 virus. That process takes months. And it's taken years to find an alternative. Last week an experimental vaccine reached the Food and Drug Administration for evaluation. NPR's Joanne Silberner reports on the prospects. JOANNE SILBERNER: At a press conference recently, Thomas Frieden, head of the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention said there's a problem with the system that relies on viruses growing in eggs. THOMAS FRIEDEN: Even if you yell at them, they don't grow faster. SILBERNER: According to Bill Hall, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, the government has spent nearly $2 billion in the last five years on developing a way to make vaccines without using eggs. The goal is simple: come up with a piece of the flu virus coat, a protein that your immune system will learn to recognize to foreign, get vaccinated with it, then when someone with flu coughs on you, your immune system is already primed to fight off the virus. Coming up with a protein involves some pretty sophisticated science, says Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which has funded much of the research. One approach starts with the genetic material of the flu virus, naked DNA. ANTHONY FAUCI: You take the genes of that and you then inject the DNA directly into the muscle of the vaccine recipient. SILBERNER: You just need a segment of the DNA. Your own cells pick up the segment and manufacture a protein. No yelling at eggs and no issues with egg allergies. DNA: inserting a piece of the virus's DNA into a harmless virus that grows quickly and well - not in your body but in cell cultures - insect cells. Again, Anthony Fauci. FAUCI: Since that virus grows in those insect cells, as it grows it starts to essentially spit out large amounts of the protein that you're interested in. You then take that protein, you harvest it from the cell culture, you purify it and there's your vaccine. SILBERNER: It takes les than two months, as opposed to the five months or so it takes to develop and grow a vaccine in eggs. And there are variations on this approach. Hooking the virus's DNA into a harmless virus for direct use as the vaccine; or foregoing genetics entirely, and just building a protein out of chemicals in the lab. All of this new technology to speed up vaccine manufacture actually takes a lot of time, says Robert Couch, a vaccine expert with the Baylor College of Medicine. ROBERT COUCH: Nothing is done very rapidly in these systems, because so much time is required for developing, for evaluating safety, for doing the manufacturing systems that are optimal. SILBERNER: These are new technologies and it's likely to take regulatory agencies a long time to be assured they're safe. Couch has been advising a company called Protein Sciences, which is furthest along towards a new flu vaccine. It's using the insect cell technology and has tested its product on more than a thousand people. Last week, an FDA advisory committee gave it mixed reviews, saying the vaccine appears to be effective in 18- to 49-year-olds but needs more safety testing. Company head Daniel Adams says he'll press forward. Joanne Silberner, NPR News. INSKEEP: Here's another story we're following on this Thanksgiving Day: It is a workday in China, and Chinese officials have announced that they intend to sharply cut carbon emissions. The nation, sometimes known as the world's biggest polluter, is taking steps to cut back, and China now says it wants to fight global warming and also make its economy drastically more efficient. Chinese officials have set an ambitious goal - it's not clear how they'll reach it - but an ambitious goal that, by the year 2020, they want to find a way to use around 40 percent less energy for the same amount of economic activity. The U. S. Congress is still debating what steps, if any, Americans will take. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)INSKEEP: You're listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR News. STEVE INSKEEP, Host:  For many Americans, the most pressing health care question at the moment is how to get the swine flu vaccine. A big reason for the vaccine shortage has to do with how it's made. It's grown in chicken eggs that have been infected with a modified form of the H1N1 virus. That process takes months. And it's taken years to find an alternative. Last week an experimental vaccine reached the Food and Drug Administration for evaluation. NPR's Joanne Silberner reports on the prospects. JOANNE SILBERNER: At a press conference recently, Thomas Frieden, head of the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention said there's a problem with the system that relies on viruses growing in eggs. THOMAS FRIEDEN: Even if you yell at them, they don't grow faster. SILBERNER: According to Bill Hall, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, the government has spent nearly $2 billion in the last five years on developing a way to make vaccines without using eggs. The goal is simple: come up with a piece of the flu virus coat, a protein that your immune system will learn to recognize to foreign, get vaccinated with it, then when someone with flu coughs on you, your immune system is already primed to fight off the virus. Coming up with a protein involves some pretty sophisticated science, says Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which has funded much of the research. One approach starts with the genetic material of the flu virus, naked DNA. ANTHONY FAUCI: You take the genes of that and you then inject the DNA directly into the muscle of the vaccine recipient. SILBERNER: You just need a segment of the DNA. Your own cells pick up the segment and manufacture a protein. No yelling at eggs and no issues with egg allergies. DNA: inserting a piece of the virus's DNA into a harmless virus that grows quickly and well - not in your body but in cell cultures - insect cells. Again, Anthony Fauci. FAUCI: Since that virus grows in those insect cells, as it grows it starts to essentially spit out large amounts of the protein that you're interested in. You then take that protein, you harvest it from the cell culture, you purify it and there's your vaccine. SILBERNER: It takes les than two months, as opposed to the five months or so it takes to develop and grow a vaccine in eggs. And there are variations on this approach. Hooking the virus's DNA into a harmless virus for direct use as the vaccine; or foregoing genetics entirely, and just building a protein out of chemicals in the lab. All of this new technology to speed up vaccine manufacture actually takes a lot of time, says Robert Couch, a vaccine expert with the Baylor College of Medicine.

New research shows that sensations on the skin can help you understand speech. NPR's Jon Hamilton has the story, so listen up. JON HAMILTON: It's been clear for a long time that hearing involves more than just our ears. Bryan Gick is a professor of phonetics at the University of British Columbia. BRYAN GICK: From our brain's point of view, we can hear with our eyes. HAMILTON: Gick says that's why people in a noisy room are more likely to understand someone if they can see the speaker's lips. But Gick wanted to see whether hearing could also be influenced by our sense of touch. So, he had a graduate student round up some volunteers. They listened to a person making speech sounds - pa, ba, ta, da. Meanwhile, the graduate student stood by with a turkey baster. GICK: She would squirt a little puff of air from the turkey baster onto the neck of the perceiver. And people had very strong responses to it. HAMILTON: Unidentified Man: Pa, ba, ta, da. GICK: What we found was that the little puff of air would cause them to be more likely to report having heard a sound like pa, even if what had actually been played to them was ba. HAMILTON: Gick says what's really interesting about this, is that people don't normally use their skin to understand speech, yet they did it automatically. Gick says that suggests our brains are wired to incorporate information from other senses when we listen. GICK: From my point of view, we're whole-body perceiving machines, and we just take all of the information that comes at us in our environment and merge it into a percept of something that happened in the world. HAMILTON: That's an idea that's becoming widely accepted among brain scientists. David Ostry is a professor of psychology at McGill University in Montreal. A few months ago he did a different experiment that involved touch and hearing. DAVID OSTRY: We put small plastic tabs on the side of the cheeks, and we had a robot basically pull on the facial skin. HAMILTON: People did a better job recognizing a sound if the robot tugged their facial skin in the same direction it would have moved if they'd been making the sound themselves. Ostry says these days the big scientific question isn't whether our brains routinely integrate sensory information, but how. OSTRY: Really it's up for grabs where within the brain this kind of integration is happening. HAMILTON: Jon Hamilton, NPR News.

As NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, California has already started. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: This part of the forest is hardly pristine. A walk along a muddy trail with the Fund's Chris Kelly takes us through thick undergrowth and small trees - the kind of forest that comes up after heavy logging. CHRIS KELLY: This forest, if you look around, you see it's very dense. You almost - in some places you couldn't walk through it. It's as if you just cast out seeds on the ground in your garden and then didn't come back and weed it. As a result, you get a choked garden with skinny carrots and under-ripe fruit. JOYCE: But that's just the kind of forest the Conservation Fund is banking on - literally. KELLY: So what we're trying to do is come in and thin the forest, and leave the bigger trees to grow. And as a consequence of that thinning, they will grow bigger, faster. JOYCE: In essence, what these foresters are doing is weeding out some trees so that the remaining forest will grow faster and absorb more carbon that it does now. This is where the accounting comes in. It's tricky. If you cut down a tree, its carbon goes up into the atmosphere. So foresters here, have to prove their weeding will produce a net gain - more carbon stored in the trees that remain and grow than is released when the foresters weed. That means measuring, lots of measuring. MADISON THOMPSON: I'm Madison Thompson. I'm a forestry technician for the Conservation Fund. First things first, we're going to find how much downed wood there is within a one- tenth-acre radius. That's one of the things that we measure. JOYCE: Downed wood, meaning fallen trees, tree limbs, even big branches. When they eventually rot, they emit carbon. They're liabilities in the balance sheet. THOMPSON: Watch for the poison oak, point it out when you see it. JOYCE: Jordan Golinkoff is the fund's mathematician. He keeps the balance sheet. JORDAN GOLINKOFF: Redwoods are kind of amazing because they can grow for hundreds and hundreds of years and still be, you know, measurably increasing in size and growing. JOYCE: Most of the redwoods here are fairly young so they have a lot of growing ahead of them. LIZ FORWIN: Twenty-five. JOYCE: Twenty-five inches? FORWIN: Yeah. THOMPSON: Yeah. JOYCE: A typical 25-inch diameter redwood can store about a ton of carbon. GOLINKOFF: If I wrap the tape around this tree and measured it and I knew its height roughly, you know, I can get a volume. And then once you know the mass, carbon is roughly 50 percent of the mass of most trees. JOYCE: The fund calculates that over two years, their forest has soaked up an extra 350,000 tons of carbon. That's roughly equivalent to taking 80,000 cars off the road for a year. And Golinkoff says there are other benefits. GOLINKOFF: By managing for carbon, we're not going to be harvesting as much, and harvest disturbs the soil, harvest reduces the size of the trees. And so, in general, when we have bigger trees and less disturbance, you have - creeks like this are shaded. They stay cooler. Fish like that. Creeks like this have less sediment running into them. JOYCE: Gary Gero runs the Climate Action Reserve, which sets standards for carbon trading in California. He says once you legally limit carbon emissions, carbon banking starts to make business sense. GARY GERO: Businesses in California said, we know you are going to regulate this someday, so give us the ability to start now reducing greenhouse gas emissions and ensure that we are recognized for those reductions. JOYCE: And that, adds Gero, gives people who own forests a new option.

Republicans on the committee raised the issue of emails that were stolen from prominent climate scientists. The Republicans said the emails cast doubt on all climate science. NPR's Richard Harris reports. RICHARD HARRIS: The emails were stolen from the University of East Anglia in Britain, from one of the three labs in the world that constructs global temperature records. The private exchanges have become a goldmine for skeptics who argue that global warming is a plot rather than a real, manmade problem. At today's hearing, Republican Representative James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin said at best, official reports about global warming will now have to be reviewed. Representative JAMES SENSENBRENNER (Republican, Wisconsin): And at worst, it's junk science, and it is a part of a massive, international scientific fraud. HARRIS: And not just fraud, he said. Rep. SENSENBRENNER: There's increasing evidence of scientific fascism that's going on. And I think, as policymakers who are making decisions about the state of the American economy for the next several generations, that we ought to have accurate science. HARRIS: The president's top science adviser, John Holdren, agreed that the emails should be thoroughly investigated. At issue is whether they provide evidence of scientific malfeasance, or just bad manners. Mr. JOHN HOLDREN (Director, White House Office of Science and Technology Policy): Scientists are human and from time to time, they display defensiveness and bias and even misbehavior of some kinds. They're like any other group of human beings. They are subject to human frailties. I think the facts are not entirely in on this particular case. HARRIS: Holdren agreed that if the emails reveal inappropriate data manipulation, and that ended up in official reports, obviously, those reports would need to be corrected. Mr. HOLDREN: However this particular controversy comes out, the result will not call into question the bulk of our understanding of how the climate works or how humans are affecting it. HARRIS: Evidence from many different sources shows that the air and oceans are warming as a result of greenhouse gases that humans are putting into the atmosphere. Jane Lubchenco, a scientist who heads the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, gave a tabletop demonstration at the hearing to show how increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is also making the oceans more acidic. Those explanations didn't reassure some Republican members of the committee and Democrat Jay Inslee, of Washington State, was stunned by their skepticism. He said, somewhat sarcastically: If global warming is a fraud, it must be perpetrated by a conspiracy of scientists from all around the world.

(Soundbite of laughter) Rep. INSLEE: I just need an answer. Rep. HOLDREN: Congressman Inslee, I am not a member of any of those organizations, and I do not believe that there is a conspiracy. It would be an amazing thing indeed. HARRIS: Holdren pointed out that national academies of science from all around the world accept the reality of human-induced global warming, as do other leading science organizations and the United Nations. Inslee then noted that nobody else in the room had any other plausible way to explain why carbon dioxide is building up in the air and in the oceans. Rep. INSLEE: And yet, people are trying to gin up this controversy because - you know why? It's not because they're not intelligent, it's because they're afraid that we can't solve this problem.

Scientists fear the carp could decimate native species if they get into the Great Lakes. NPR's David Schaper reports. DAVID SCHAPER: Winter in Chicago: the wind, the cold, the snow. So, who would want to stand out on Navy Pier every morning to catch little eight to ten inch perch? People like John Calderon, that's who. Mr. JOHN CALDERON (Fisherman): Well, I'm out here all winter. I can take the cold, you know, I'm out here when there's ice here, we have to break through it just to get them, you know. SCHAPER: Why? Calderon says Lake Michigan perch taste great. But he and other fisherman worry their delicious catch may disappear if the Asian carp get into Lake Michigan. Mr. CALDERON: Oh, they'll kill all our fish because they've go to eat. They eat a lot. They're the biggest eaters of all, and I don't want them around. SCHAPER: Asian carp are voracious eaters. They can grow four feet long and weigh up to 100 pounds. They are filter feeders at the bottom of the food chain and eat constantly, consuming up to 40 percent of their body weight in plankton each day. They are prolific at reproducing, some call them the rabbits of the water. So, Asian carp can quickly starve and crowd out native species of fish. In the two decades since floodwaters washed them out of southern fish farms where they were imported to control algae, Asian carp have taken over some parts of the Mississippi River system. In the Illinois River, for example, Asian carp now make up more than 90 percent of the fish in some locations. The silver Asian carp can jump 10 feet up into the air when startled and with so many of them in Illinois, several boaters and jet-skiers have been injured by the flying fish. And they are swimming north, with Asian carp DNA recently found in water samples just eight miles from Lake Michigan.

SCHAPER: Joel Brammeier is president of the Chicago-based Alliance for the Great Lakes. Mr. BRAMMEIER: If we don't take the right steps today, we are consigning the Great Lakes to a future as carp ponds. SCHAPER: The most dramatic step yet in the fight to keep Asian carp from entering Lake Michigan is the biggest fish kill in Illinois history. Wednesday night, biologists dumped 2,300 gallons of a fish-killing chemical into a six-mile-long portion of the Chicago Sanitary and Ship canal. It killed tens of thousands of native fish, in hopes of killing any Asian carp that might be in the waterway. So, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers can turn off an underwater electric barrier on the canal for maintenance. The poisoning is controversial. Though Asian carp DNA had been detected in the shipping canal, no actual fish have been seen this close to Lake Michigan until biologists found a dead one late yesterday. John Rogner is with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. Mr. JOHN ROGNER (Assistant Director, Illinois Department of Natural Resources): We believe this will reduce or eliminate any remaining doubt of the need for this operation. We've now confirmed with a body what the e-DNA evidence has suggested that Asian carp are indeed knocking on the door of the Great Lakes. SCHAPER: Crews will continue netting dead fish this weekend and Rogner says he won't be surprised if more Asian carp are found.

I'm Joe Palca, sitting in for Ira Flatow. Well, it's an exciting time for particle physicists these days. That's because they fired up the Large Hadron Collider again. The LHC is the world's most powerful particle collider. Last week, it achieved the first collisions between the two beams of protons, and this week, they set the record for the most energetic proton beams, passing Fermi Labs' previous record. And they've actually had some collisions. That's good. Joining me now to talk more about what's next for the collider is my gust, Drew Baden. He's a professor and chairman of the physics department at the University of Maryland in College Park. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Mr. DREW BADEN (Chairman, Professor, Physics Department, University of Maryland in College Park): Thank you. PALCA: And if you want to give us a call while we're talking about the LHC, our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. If you're on Twitter, you can tweet us with your questions by writing to the @ sign, followed by scifri, and if you want more information about what we'll be talking about this hour, go to our Web site at www. sciencefriday. com, where you'll find links to our topic. So Drew Baden, for those of us, or those of our listeners who have sort of forgotten about the LHC, give us a little primer on what it's all about. Mr. BADEN: Well, it's all about basic science and doing experiments that try to figure out what the universe was like about a trillionth of a second or so right after the Big Bang, and it's been going on since people split the atom. PALCA: You mean this idea of banging things into each other. Mr. BADEN: Yeah, and trying to figure out what are the fundamental particles, what are their interactions, why the world is the way it is. PALCA: And remind us where LHC is and how big it is and what keeps the protons spinning around in a circle. Mr. BADEN: So the LHC is built at - it's a large, European physics lab called CERN. That's the European acronym, Center for European Research Nuclear. And it's right in the corner of Switzerland, straddling the border between Switzerland and France, right outside Geneva. And it's - so it's at the base of the Jura Mountains, which are a little north and west of the city. And the lab there has been - was built in the '50s, and it's a fairly decent-sized lab with decent-sized accelerators that have gotten bigger and bigger over time. PALCA: Right, and it's got this big ring that goes across the border, 17 miles in diameter, I understand. Mr. BADEN: Actually, it's 17 miles in circumference. PALCA: Circumference. Mr. BADEN: Yeah, and that's right. It's too big to be on site at the lab. So it's deep underground and straddles the border, and it's between the mountains and the lake on the plains there. And it's - the whole thing sits in a plain. It's perfectly - the ring defines a plane as perfectly flat, and it's underground about 100 meters here, 100 meters there, maybe a little bit. PALCA: Right. Mr. BADEN: But so it's deep underground. PALCA: Right, and so the idea is to take these two beams going in opposite directions around this ring, and in about eight different spots around the ring, you can bring them together so they head-on collision into one another. And then there are these detectors that look at the collisions and decide what they're seeing. Mr. BADEN: That's right, that's right. PALCA: And it was supposed to start last year. What happened? Mr. BADEN: Well, what happened, you know, is Murphy's Law\ufffd (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. BADEN: \ufffda little bit - maybe a little bit worse than Murphy's Law. But they were commissioning for - they were doing the very first stages of commissioning, where you put a beam through - it's like threading a thread through a million needles, you know, to get the beam to go all the way around. And they were threading it, and then they needed to stop. A power supply needed to be replaced or something like that, and they said, well, while we're waiting for the power supply, why don't we check out some of our magnets at high fields, which is what you need to do to accelerate at high energies, at very high energies. And oops, all of a sudden they found a problem. It blew up one of the magnet - the connections to the magnets blew up when they were testing it. PALCA: By blew up, you mean it didn't actually explode, but it sort of stopped working. Mr. BADEN: Right. It didn't explode, but what happened was that, you know, you put a lot of current through something, it heats up, they're superconducting. There's super-cooled helium. The helium gets hot, and it turns into a gas, and that sort of explodes. PALCA: Yeah, all right. Mr. BADEN: It caused a lot of collateral damage, a lot of dirt in the beam pipes, a lot of magnets had to be replaced and a lot of hang-wringing and soul-searching for, you know, is this a problem? Is this going to be a problem later on? And that's what took a year, is to go back and take a look at all of the, you know, phenomenally complex device - if you can call it a device - and you know, to - you don't want this to happen again. PALCA: Right. Mr. BADEN: And so they took a long, hard look. They found a few other problems. They took their time - better safe than sorry. PALCA: Yeah, now you're a part of this experiment. I mean, so I said physicists are excited. Are you excited? Is this an exciting time? Mr. BADEN: Oh, absolutely. PALCA: Are you heading over there? Mr. BADEN: Yeah, in fact when I hang up, I'm going to catch a cab to Dulles Airport, and I'll be there tomorrow morning - well, for me tomorrow morning. For you, it'll be - I guess I arrive around 2 a. m. PALCA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And\ufffd Mr. BADEN: And I go right to work. PALCA: And okay, so here's one of the problems with describing the results of what you're going to get from CERN because you said that we're going to be able to get some idea of the conditions a few milliseconds after the Big Bang, but it's really, really hard for the public, I think, to understand what that means and why you need this 17-mile-circumference ring to smash protons together. Mr. BADEN: Right. PALCA: So you know, give it one more shot. Mr. BADEN: Well, I can give it a try. PALCA: Okay. Mr. BADEN: And so you have to start at the beginning, and at the beginning, the universe was very, very tiny volume, I don't know, the size of a pea, maybe the size of an atom. I mean, all - it's not like\ufffd PALCA: Everything. Everything was - okay, okay. Mr. BADEN: \ufffdall the mass of the universe was in a small volume. The whole universe and everything in it was compacted, and that's quantum mechanically unstable, and it started expanding. And it expanded at a pretty furious rate, but all the matter and the energy in the universe occupies that whatever volume is in the universe, and as it expands, like any gas that expands, it cools down. It's got a bigger volume to hang out in, and it cools down. And as it cools down, like any collections of molecules, any gas, it goes through phase changes. And the name of the game is to figure out where are these phase changes and what's happening in between the phase changes. And if you really want to know - I mean, a lot of the phase changes happen in the first millisecond, but you know, we're sort of guessing because we can't look back further than we can probe. So the idea with the LHC is you take these beams, and you collide them, and at the point of collision, you have a very high energy density, which is equivalent to the universe at a particular small time after the start of it all, after the Big Bang started. And the LHC is about - the energies of the LHC, when it's at full energy, is equivalent to the universe at around maybe a trillionth of a second, to the minus-12th to the minus-13th, 14th, something around there. There's a lot of action that happens just around there, and we are pretty anxious about it because we think we're going to see a lot of new stuff that's going to be very important for us to figure out exactly what's going on with the universe. PALCA: Well, I'd like to know what's going on with the universe. Mr. BADEN: Well, and you do actually know what's going on because, you know, people do cosmology large-scale structure studies. They look up there, and they see galaxies, and the galaxies are distributed the way they are. And you kind of scratch your head and say how could the universe have started out as this big, as this very hot soup, very homogeneous soup, very smooth, end up in this very lumpy, cold universe we have now. And that's, you know, one of the big - that's one of the big open questions in physics. And what's great about what's going on now is that the high-energy physicists doing these kind of experiments cannot make a measurement and not - they can't make a measurement and not consider what happens 13. 7 billion years later. And the people who are doing the cosmology, they can't make a measurement and say, well, is this consistent with what happens in the early universe? PALCA: Yeah. Mr. BADEN: So it's all fitting together now. PALCA: It's complimentary. Mr. BADEN: And that's what makes it a really exciting time. PALCA: Cool. Let's take a quick call now and go to Michael(ph) in Arkansas City. Michael, welcome to the program. MICHAEL (Caller): Good afternoon, gentlemen. PALCA: Yeah. Mr. BADEN: Good afternoon. MICHAEL: Happy holidays. PALCA: Thanks. Mr. BADEN: Thank you. MICHAEL: I was just curious. You know, I've been listening to you talk about the collider for a couple shows, and I was just wondering if there was anything that could go seriously wrong with this experiment. PALCA: You mean like we blink out of existence, that kind of thing? MICHAEL: Yeah, like poof, we're gone. (Soundbite of laughter) PALCA: We won't know if that happens, of course, but Drew Baden, what do you think about that? Mr. BADEN: Yeah, there was a lawsuit about that. Some people said well, we're not doing our environmental impact statements correctly. You know, here's the way I look at it: The energy in the beams from the LHC is about 300 megajoules, and so you might ask what's a megajoule? But 300 megajoules is about the amount of energy your refrigerator would use in maybe four days. Now, does it sound like that kind of energy is going to make us all blink out of existence? I mean, I wouldn't - you know, I'm not so worried about that. If that was the case, if that small amount of energy - although concentrated into a very small volume - but if that small amount of energy could make you blink out of existence, we probably would have blinked a long time ago. So most people are not really worried at all about this. This is very far from something that is real and you need to worry about. PALCA: Okay. One more quick call and Janelle(ph) from Eldersburg, Maryland. Go ahead, Janelle. JANELLE (Caller): Yes, hi, thanks for taking my call. I was wondering why the circumference is 17 miles, if there's something special about that number. And also I've heard that when these particles can collide, they can create black holes, and that was a concern. I know the last caller mentioned something about poofing out of existence, but are these tiny black holes of any concern? Mr. BADEN: Right, right. Well, it's 17 miles because you need to get the beams to high energy, and the way to do that is to put them in a circle and keep adding energy to them. It's like something going around in a circle, and every time it goes past you, you give it a kick. And so that's a good trick to get it up to high energy. And the reason why you want this thing to be a very - as large as possible in circumference, in diameter, is that whenever a charged particle makes a turn, whenever it accelerates, it radiates energy away. And the bigger the turn, or the tighter the turn, the more energy it radiates away. So it's an efficiency issue. So you want to make this thing as, you know, as straight as possible, but then again if you make it too big, it would be too costly. PALCA: Well, we learned that lesson. Anyway, Drew Baden, I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. I thank you very much for that primer on LHC. Mr. BADEN: My pleasure, thank you. PALCA: Drew Baden is professor and chairman of the physics department at the University of Maryland in College Park. We're going to take a short break, and when we come back, we're heading off to Mars. So don't go away.  JOE PALCA, host:  This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.

And the LHC is about - the energies of the LHC, when it's at full energy, is equivalent to the universe at around maybe a trillionth of a second, to the minus-12th to the minus-13th, 14th, something around there.  There's a lot of action that happens just around there, and we are pretty anxious about it because we think we're going to see a lot of new stuff that's going to be very important for us to figure out exactly what's going on with the universe.  PALCA: Well, I'd like to know what's going on with the universe.  Mr. BADEN: Well, and you do actually know what's going on because, you know, people do cosmology large-scale structure studies. They look up there, and they see galaxies, and the galaxies are distributed the way they are. And you kind of scratch your head and say how could the universe have started out as this big, as this very hot soup, very homogeneous soup, very smooth, end up in this very lumpy, cold universe we have now.  And that's, you know, one of the big - that's one of the big open questions in physics. And what's great about what's going on now is that the high-energy physicists doing these kind of experiments cannot make a measurement and not - they can't make a measurement and not consider what happens 13. 7 billion years later. And the people who are doing the cosmology, they can't make a measurement and say, well, is this consistent with what happens in the early universe?  PALCA: Yeah.  Mr. BADEN: So it's all fitting together now.  PALCA: It's complimentary.  Mr. BADEN: And that's what makes it a really exciting time.  PALCA: Cool. Let's take a quick call now and go to Michael(ph) in Arkansas City. Michael, welcome to the program.  MICHAEL (Caller): Good afternoon, gentlemen.  PALCA: Yeah.  Mr. BADEN: Good afternoon.  MICHAEL: Happy holidays.  PALCA: Thanks.  Mr. BADEN: Thank you.  MICHAEL: I was just curious. You know, I've been listening to you talk about the collider for a couple shows, and I was just wondering if there was anything that could go seriously wrong with this experiment.  PALCA: You mean like we blink out of existence, that kind of thing?  MICHAEL: Yeah, like poof, we're gone.  (Soundbite of laughter)  PALCA: We won't know if that happens, of course, but Drew Baden, what do you think about that?  Mr. BADEN: Yeah, there was a lawsuit about that. Some people said well, we're not doing our environmental impact statements correctly. You know, here's the way I look at it: The energy in the beams from the LHC is about 300 megajoules, and so you might ask what's a megajoule? But 300 megajoules is about the amount of energy your refrigerator would use in maybe four days. Now, does it sound like that kind of energy is going to make us all blink out of existence?  I mean, I wouldn't - you know, I'm not so worried about that. If that was the case, if that small amount of energy - although concentrated into a very small volume - but if that small amount of energy could make you blink out of existence, we probably would have blinked a long time ago. So most people are not really worried at all about this. This is very far from something that is real and you need to worry about.  PALCA: Okay. One more quick call and Janelle(ph) from Eldersburg, Maryland. Go ahead, Janelle.  JANELLE (Caller): Yes, hi, thanks for taking my call. I was wondering why the circumference is 17 miles, if there's something special about that number. And also I've heard that when these particles can collide, they can create black holes, and that was a concern. I know the last caller mentioned something about poofing out of existence, but are these tiny black holes of any concern?  Mr. BADEN: Right, right. Well, it's 17 miles because you need to get the beams to high energy, and the way to do that is to put them in a circle and keep adding energy to them. It's like something going around in a circle, and every time it goes past you, you give it a kick. And so that's a good trick to get it up to high energy. And the reason why you want this thing to be a very - as large as possible in circumference, in diameter, is that whenever a charged particle makes a turn, whenever it accelerates, it radiates energy away. And the bigger the turn, or the tighter the turn, the more energy it radiates away. So it's an efficiency issue. So you want to make this thing as, you know, as straight as possible, but then again if you make it too big, it would be too costly.  PALCA: Well, we learned that lesson. Anyway, Drew Baden, I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. I thank you very much for that primer on LHC.  Mr. BADEN: My pleasure, thank you.  PALCA: Drew Baden is professor and chairman of the physics department at the University of Maryland in College Park. We're going to take a short break, and when we come back, we're heading off to Mars. So don't go away. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2009 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Guy Raz. Isaac Newton is best known for the laws of motion. But when he was still an obscure scientist in 1671, he published a groundbreaking study into the qualities of refracted light. Mr. JOHN LESKO (Actor): (Reading) Therefore, it comes to pass that whiteness is the usual color of light, for light is a confused aggregate of rays endued with all sorts of colors. RAZ: The words of Isaac Newton as read by actor John Lesko. Newton's study was published by the Royal Society in London, the premier scientific academy of its day. The society is about to turn 350 years old. And in celebration, leading scientists have picked 60 papers published over the course of its history and put them online in the original manuscript form. Michael Thompson is a fellow at the Royal Society and he headed up that committee that chose the papers. He is in Cambridge, England. Welcome to the program. Mr. MICHAEL THOMPSON (Royal Society): Hello. Pleased to be with you. RAZ: Tell me, how did you come up with this list of 60 papers? Mr. THOMPSON: Well, we had a small committee, altogether about 16 people, and we got our heads together. And we were trying to cover pretty well everything that had been published, which, of course, you realize is an enormous task. But we went for what we thought were intriguing and novel and also the big, solid ones. We have, for example, a paper by Stephen Hawking on black holes. RAZ: Mm-hmm. Mr. THOMPSON: Now, that's not the sort of thing you would read in the train in the morning. RAZ: Right. Mr. THOMPSON: In fact, I don't think you would read it all. It's full of mathematics. (Soundbite of laughter) RAZ: Well, let's start with the oldest paper that you chose. It's by Robert Boyle. And he was actually one of the creators of the Royal Society, right? Mr. THOMPSON: Yes, that's right. Mm-hmm. RAZ: And in this paper, he is talking about using experiments of blood transfusions from dogs. (Soundbite of music) Mr. LESKO: (Reading) Whether by this way of transfusing blood, the disposition of individual animals of the same kind may not be much altered, as whether the blood of a mastiff being frequently transfused into a bloodhound or a spaniel will not prejudice them in point of scent. RAZ: Michael Thompson, this, of course, was written in the 17th century by Robert Boyle. But to basically paraphrase what he's saying, he's saying if you take the blood from one animal and put it into another, you might be able to alter that animals behavior, you know, change a spaniel into a mastiff, for example. (Soundbite of laughter) RAZ: This was pretty sophisticated science at the time, right? Mr. THOMPSON: Well, yes. These were the sort of things they were trying out. In fact, the early years of the Royal Society's publications were full of things like this. They didn't really know which were the things, in a sense, really worth doing. And they were trying everything, looking at all sorts of curiosities. RAZ: There's another paper. This is actually a letter that Benjamin Franklin wrote that was published by the Royal Society, and he is talking about an experiment with a kite and lightning. I want to play some tape of our actor, John Lesko, this time I should note without the fake British accident. (Soundbite of music) Mr. LESKO: (Reading) The kite is to be raised when a thunder gust appears to be coming on, which is very frequent in this country. And the person who holds the string must stand within a door or window, or under some cover, so that the silk ribbon may not be wet. As soon as any of the thunderclouds come over the kite, the pointed wire will draw the electric fire from them, and the kite with all the twine will be electrified. RAZ: So, Michael Thompson, this is a famous story that every schoolchild in America learns about, Ben Franklin\ufffd Mr. THOMPSON: That's right, yes. Mm-hmm. RAZ: \ufffdyou know, tying a key to the end of a kite string. Mr. THOMPSON: Yeah. Incidentally, I just wanted to comment that, as I'm sure in the USA, the U. K. has a lot of worry these days about health and safety. RAZ: Mm-hmm. Mr. THOMPSON: And I was very amused that the Royal Society added to one of its documents that some of these experiments are dangerous and should not be repeated. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. THOMPSON: Now, he may have had this one in mind. (Soundbite of laughter) RAZ: Yeah. Michael Thompson, I want to end with Mozart because I found it curious that a description of Mozart as this young musical genius is actually in the Royal Society's collection of papers. (Soundbite of music) Mr. LESKO: (Reading) Whilst he was playing to me, a favorite cat came in, upon which he immediately harpsichord, nor could we bring him back for a considerable time. He would also sometimes run about the room with a stick between his legs by way of horse. I found likewise that most of the London musicians were of the same opinion with regard to his age, not believing it possible that a child of so tender years could surpass most of the masters in that science. RAZ: That's a very, very interesting letter written by Daines Barrington. Was this normal? Was it common to sort of write profiles on people who were thought to be geniuses because this isn't really scientific inquiry, is it? Mr. THOMPSON: Well, I suppose it was and I suppose you could argue that it is. In fact, as I say, in those days, science hadn't really settled down into its rather, well, possibly even straight-laced approach these days. It wasn't quite clear what was valid to be studied. And given that this was the great spirit of inquiry era, when it was decided to test everything by experiment and see what there was in the world, and this was just the sort of thing they were doing. You just sense the excitement, I think, really by reading some of these early volumes of the transactions. RAZ: Michael Thompson is a fellow of the Royal Society. Michael Thompson, thanks so much for taking the time. Mr. THOMPSON: Many thanks, indeed. RAZ: And before we let you go, do you like Marmite? Mr. THOMPSON: I'm not a tremendous fan of Marmite, no.

I'm Robert Siegel. Children who have trouble reading usually do a lot better if they receive intensive instruction. And now, scientists have discovered one reason why. As NPR's Jon Hamilton reports, a new study shows that intensive reading programs produce measurable changes in the structure of a child's brain. JON HAMILTON: Reading involves a lot of different parts of the brain. Some recognize letters, others apply knowledge about vocabulary and syntax and still others decide what it all means. Somehow, the brain has to synchronize all these operations. Marcel Just, who directs the Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging at Carnegie Mellon University, says that requires a really good communication system. Mr. MARCEL JUST (Director, Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging, Carnegie Mellon University): You need these sort of high-speed - I don't know what to call them - highways between brain areas to let the information flow back and forth extremely effectively. HAMILTON: If those information highways can't handle the traffic, the brain won't be able to make sense out of the text. Just wondered whether this might be part of the problem for a lot of children struggling to read. So he and a colleague named Timothy Keller used a special type of MRI to look at the brains of several dozen poor readers as young as eight. The team focused on the network of fibers that carries information around the brain. That's a kind of brain tissue called white matter. Mr. JUST: Tim Keller and I scanned these children and found that there was an area of white matter that was of lower structural quality than in the control group. HAMILTON: The control group being kids with typical reading skills. During the next school year, some of the poor readers were enrolled in programs that provided a total of 100 hours of intensive, remedial instruction. Mr. JUST: These children were really practicing how to read words, how to sound out words and read sentences over and over and over again, and that repeated remediation training is what changed not just their reading, the but changed the tissues in their brain. HAMILTON: A second round of MRI scans showed that the quality of white matter had improved in the same areas found to be lacking before the kids got intensive instruction, just as there was no change among children in standard classes. And he says: Mr. JUST: The amount of improvement in the white matter in an individual was correlated with that individual's improvement in his reading ability. HAMILTON: The finding adds to the evidence that learning involves more than just gray matter, the brain tissues that process and store information. Doug Fields works in the Child Health and Human Development section at the National Institutes of Health. He says the realization that white matter is also important for learning has led to a shift in the way many scientists view the brain. Mr. DOUG FIELDS (Researcher, Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health): By analogy we were looking at a transistor. And now we're looking at the whole network, like the Internet, and realizing for this whole network to operate, you need to have an efficient flow of information. HAMILTON: Fields says other studies have shown that white matter also changes when people learn to juggle or play a musical instrument. And, he says, white matter seems to be involved in a wide range of brain function and dysfunction. Mr. FIELDS: Psychiatric illnesses, mathematical ability, IQ. Really, the more we look, the more we find. HAMILTON: Marcel Just says there's even evidence linking autism to problems with white matter and a lack of synchrony in the brain. The new study appears in the journal, Neuron. Jon Hamilton, NPR News.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel.

It's called carbon ranching. The idea is to coax carbon dioxide out of the air and to capture it in the grass and soil of pastureland. NPR's Christopher Joyce explains. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: Marin County isn't just hot tubs and wineries. Try going up to where the cows and deer live. Dr. WHENDEE SILVER (Co-Founder/Lead Scientist, Marin Carbon Project): So in another month or so, this road becomes really challenging. JOYCE: It's not challenging now? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. SILVER: No. This is pretty good. JOYCE: Whendee Silver is steering a Jeep up a hill as steep as a ski slope. Silver is a soil scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. If soil is the Earth's skin, then Silver might as well be its dermatologist. Dr. SILVER: What we're interested in doing out here is trying to figure out how much carbon is added to the soil and how much carbon is lost. JOYCE: Soil and plants that grow in it depend on carbon. Plants mostly absorb it from carbon dioxide - essentially it's a plant food. Silver wants plants to eat more. Dr. SILVER: So this is a compost plot. HEADLEE: Silver has spread compost that were plots of pastureland; a mix of plant clippings, food waste, the kind of stuff you put on your garden. Dr. SILVER: And what that does is it increases plant growth. It actually also lowers the temperature a little bit so the soils don't get quite as hot, it doesn't stimulate as much microbial activity. JOYCE: You can see the grass is taller here, that means more carbon in the plants and more food for cows. Ranchers like that part. But those microbes, Silver mentions, are tricky. Soil is full of them and when they eat plants and animals and bugs, they emit carbon dioxide into the air. So Silver's composting has to work a delicate balance between supercharging plants but not microbes. Dr. SILVER: What we're really trying to do here is understand what makes the microbes go and what makes the plants go. JOYCE: So far, the grass in the composted plots grows so well that it captures 50 percent more carbon from the air than grass in the untouched plots. And the soil is taking up almost all the carbon in the compost \ufffd carbon that most likely would have gone up into the atmosphere if it hadn't been added to the pastureland. Silver is now measuring exactly how much that is. To do that, her team pounds plastic domes into the ground that capture the greenhouse gases seeping up from the soil. (Soundbite of pounding) JOYCE: But Silver says just the extra grass from composting could make a big dent in greenhouse gas emissions, especially in this part of California. Dr. SILVER: Grasslands, because they're in these dry regions, have really, really high root biomass, so it tends to go pretty deep. Those plants are looking for water and that's what builds that dark, organic rich soil and that carbon-rich soil. JOYCE: Silver thinks composting could work for about 30 years before the soil is saturated with carbon. And during that time, ranchers could get paid for the practice. Dr. SILVER: Hopefully, they'll be able to participate in a carbon market, where we can quantify how much carbon is being stored on the land, and they can sell that as a carbon offset. JOYCE: That idea intrigues John Wick. His back deck looks out over his grazing land where Silver is conducting her experiments, which are part of the Marin Carbon Project. Mr. JOHN WICK (Project Director, Marin Carbon Project): Now, I think about carbon in everything I'm doing, and it's completely changed my life. This whole ecosystem down there is alive. I mean, up until this point, it was just dirt to me and I - something I pushed around with my bulldozer. Mr. BOB GIACOMINI (Dairy Farmer): You know, all these things sound good, but you got to look at the cost of them all and see what the payback is. Dr. SILVER: Absolutely. Yeah. JOYCE: Bob Giacomini is a little more skeptical. Giacomini stands in a trailer above a milking room at his a dairy farm. It's noon and he's already been up eight hours. Whendee Silver is trying to persuade him to try composting to see if his pastures will grow better, as well as store more carbon. Mr. GIACOMINI: I'm certainly interested in finding that out. I mean, how much time and/or money am I willing to put forward to find that answer, you know? JOYCE: That's where the carbon market would come in. If a climate law is passed, industries will be looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprint. Paying farmers to soak up carbon in their pastures could be one way to do that. As for the time and know-how, there's a new office in the U. S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, D. C. , designed to create a market for exchanges just like that. Sally Collins runs it. Dr. SALLY COLLINS (Director, Office of Ecosystem Services and Markets): The potential for landowners is huge, so we started looking at that as a way to keep people on the land. JOYCE: Because land that stores carbon would generate extra income. Actually, measuring carbon in soil and plants isn't easy, though. Collins acknowledges that a market won't work unless the buyers and sellers know exactly what they're getting. Dr. COLLINS: We have got to figure out how to have one set of scientifically based, credible standards. JOYCE: Standards to measure exactly how much carbon stays in the soil and the grass, and even what happens to it after the microbes or the cows eat it. It sounds complicated, and it is. But as negotiators at the Copenhagen climate meeting struggle with ways to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere, storing carbon in soil and plants may start to look pretty attractive. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  As efforts to curb global warming continue in Washington and at this week's Copenhagen summit, there may be a partial solution in the fields of Marin County, California. It's called carbon ranching. The idea is to coax carbon dioxide out of the air and to capture it in the grass and soil of pastureland.  NPR's Christopher Joyce explains.  CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: Marin County isn't just hot tubs and wineries. Try going up to where the cows and deer live.  Dr. WHENDEE SILVER (Co-Founder/Lead Scientist, Marin Carbon Project): So in another month or so, this road becomes really challenging.  JOYCE: It's not challenging now?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. SILVER: No. This is pretty good.  JOYCE: Whendee Silver is steering a Jeep up a hill as steep as a ski slope. Silver is a soil scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. If soil is the Earth's skin, then Silver might as well be its dermatologist.  Dr. SILVER: What we're interested in doing out here is trying to figure out how much carbon is added to the soil and how much carbon is lost.  JOYCE: Soil and plants that grow in it depend on carbon. Plants mostly absorb it from carbon dioxide - essentially it's a plant food. Silver wants plants to eat more.  Dr. SILVER: So this is a compost plot.  HEADLEE: Silver has spread compost that were plots of pastureland; a mix of plant clippings, food waste, the kind of stuff you put on your garden.  Dr. SILVER: And what that does is it increases plant growth. It actually also lowers the temperature a little bit so the soils don't get quite as hot, it doesn't stimulate as much microbial activity.  JOYCE: You can see the grass is taller here, that means more carbon in the plants and more food for cows. Ranchers like that part.  But those microbes, Silver mentions, are tricky. Soil is full of them and when they eat plants and animals and bugs, they emit carbon dioxide into the air. So Silver's composting has to work a delicate balance between supercharging plants but not microbes.  Dr. SILVER: What we're really trying to do here is understand what makes the microbes go and what makes the plants go.  JOYCE: So far, the grass in the composted plots grows so well that it captures 50 percent more carbon from the air than grass in the untouched plots. And the soil is taking up almost all the carbon in the compost \ufffd carbon that most likely would have gone up into the atmosphere if it hadn't been added to the pastureland. Silver is now measuring exactly how much that is. To do that, her team pounds plastic domes into the ground that capture the greenhouse gases seeping up from the soil.  (Soundbite of pounding)  JOYCE: But Silver says just the extra grass from composting could make a big dent in greenhouse gas emissions, especially in this part of California.  Dr. SILVER: Grasslands, because they're in these dry regions, have really, really high root biomass, so it tends to go pretty deep. Those plants are looking for water and that's what builds that dark, organic rich soil and that carbon-rich soil.  JOYCE: Silver thinks composting could work for about 30 years before the soil is saturated with carbon. And during that time, ranchers could get paid for the practice.  Dr. SILVER: Hopefully, they'll be able to participate in a carbon market, where we can quantify how much carbon is being stored on the land, and they can sell that as a carbon offset.  JOYCE: That idea intrigues John Wick. His back deck looks out over his grazing land where Silver is conducting her experiments, which are part of the Marin Carbon Project.  Mr. JOHN WICK (Project Director, Marin Carbon Project): Now, I think about carbon in everything I'm doing, and it's completely changed my life. This whole ecosystem down there is alive. I mean, up until this point, it was just dirt to me and I - something I pushed around with my bulldozer.  Mr. BOB GIACOMINI (Dairy Farmer): You know, all these things sound good, but you got to look at the cost of them all and see what the payback is.  Dr. SILVER: Absolutely. Yeah.  JOYCE: Bob Giacomini is a little more skeptical. Giacomini stands in a trailer above a milking room at his a dairy farm. It's noon and he's already been up eight hours. Whendee Silver is trying to persuade him to try composting to see if his pastures will grow better, as well as store more carbon.  Mr. GIACOMINI: I'm certainly interested in finding that out. I mean, how much time and/or money am I willing to put forward to find that answer, you know?  JOYCE: That's where the carbon market would come in. If a climate law is passed, industries will be looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprint. Paying farmers to soak up carbon in their pastures could be one way to do that.  As for the time and know-how, there's a new office in the U. S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, D. C. , designed to create a market for exchanges just like that. Sally Collins runs it.  Dr. SALLY COLLINS (Director, Office of Ecosystem Services and Markets): The potential for landowners is huge, so we started looking at that as a way to keep people on the land.  JOYCE: Because land that stores carbon would generate extra income. Actually, measuring carbon in soil and plants isn't easy, though. Collins acknowledges that a market won't work unless the buyers and sellers know exactly what they're getting.  Dr. COLLINS: We have got to figure out how to have one set of scientifically based, credible standards.  JOYCE: Standards to measure exactly how much carbon stays in the soil and the grass, and even what happens to it after the microbes or the cows eat it.  It sounds complicated, and it is. But as negotiators at the Copenhagen climate meeting struggle with ways to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere, storing carbon in soil and plants may start to look pretty attractive.

I'm Ira Flatow. Have you seen any strange flying objects lately? Well, last week, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency - we all know that as DARPA - DARPA released 10 red weather balloons all over the country and challenged people to locate them. Oh, there was a big prize, a big one, to the first person who found all of them: $40,000. How would you like to get that kind of money for finding 10 balloons, and how would you go about finding 10 missing balloons? They could be floating anywhere, all over the country. Well, with a little help from your friends and their friends and their friends and friends and friends and friends. My next guest is the leader of the winning team that found the balloons. He's here to talk about his winning strategy and why DARPA, that secret government research agency, would be so interested in sponsoring the contests and the result. So, if you'd like to talk about it, give us a call: 1-800-989-8255. Riley Crane is the Society in Science postdoctoral fellow in the Human Dynamics Group at the Media Lab at MIT. As I say, he is the leader of the winning team. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Mr. RILEY CRANE (Postdoctoral Fellow, Society in Science, Human Dynamics Group, Media Lab, MIT): Hi, Ira. Thanks for having me. FLATOW: Wow, what a feat that - all of it in nine hours. Mr. CRANE: Yeah. It was a very exciting weekend, I have to say. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. CRANE: The whole team was together in the office up there at the Media Lab, and it was an adrenaline-filled day. FLATOW: How do - give us your strategy. How did you do this? Mr. CRANE: Well, I think that the key to our success was we sort of - there were a couple of points. We offered a recursive incentive, which allowed us not only to reward the people who actually found balloons, but we could also reward the people who helped us find those people. I think that was one of the main keys there. But I think we had another strategy which was that we built a system that allowed you to really do viral collaboration. And so, a couple of aspects of that were that we made it effortless for people to participate, and in addition to the monetary rewards, people could really watch their direct impact at influencing others to join. So we had one of the students who kept bothering me, a girl named Lanthy(ph), to know how many people she signed up. And so we realized that's actually a pretty cool feature that we should build in, so people could see how big their impact was. FLATOW: So, you virtually - you virally spread this news around through the Internet\ufffd Mr. CRANE: Exactly. FLATOW: \ufffdamong key people. Mr. CRANE: Exactly. FLATOW: And then someone told someone else. And were they Twittering? Were they doing all those kinds of things? Mr. CRANE: Well, so - we actually haven't started looking at the data, but we built in mechanisms so that people could put it out on Twitter, they could put it out on Facebook. They could simply - I mean, the sort of key to it was that when you signed up, you know, you'd go to balloon. mit. edu. Ira would sign up, and you'd get a link that was balloon. mit. edu/Ira. Now, it was in your interest to promote that link as much as possible because anybody who found our site and signed up using your link, they were directly related to you as your child. And so if any of those people that you started in a chain were able to find a balloon, then you would be compensated for helping us find them. FLATOW: And so, you spread the wealth out, too. Mr. CRANE: Exactly. FLATOW: How much did everybody get at the end of the day here? Mr. CRANE: Well, so, for the sake of complete transparency, we actually haven't started looking at the results yet because we wanted to bring in the auditing office at MIT to ensure that the database was handled in the proper way. And so those folks are hard at work, and we've had a lot of administrative support. And we hope to know as soon as possible. I know everyone's holding their breath to see if they won. And I can tell you, the results are forthcoming. FLATOW: And there was no little boy in any of those balloons? (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. CRANE: Nope. FLATOW: No. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: That didn't help. You would have gotten a lot of people looking at that point, right? Mr. CRANE: Exactly. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. I'm fascinated to know why DARPA would sponsor an event like this. Mr. CRANE: Well, we spoke to them, and sort of the challenge that they put out was, you know, it was the 40th anniversary of the Internet, which DARPA was fundamental in helping to create. And in these 40 years, a lot has happened. We've seen the Web grow up, and very recently there has been a social layer that's being added to that Web. And a lot of people have been kind of sitting around thinking, well, I like Facebook, I like Twitter, but what are the actually good for? What can you actually do with them? And so I think that they were interested in understanding how could you - how could social networking play a role in sort of timely communication and wider area team building and urgent mobilization that's required to solve a lot of time-critical, broad-scoped problems that are facing society? FLATOW: You mean like terrorism. Mr. CRANE: Well, actually, that's an interesting point. It seems that's not what this tool might be most useful for. It looks like this is more a tool that's useful when you can really rally everyone for the better good. So, things like finding missing children or, you know, imagine that a building collapses during a natural disaster and you need to rapidly find 10 people who can operate heavy machinery in a certain location. I think these are a lot of the challenges that are facing society that nobody really knows yet how to mobilize people on a large scale, and I think that's what our team was able to demonstrate, that these things are possible and that we've built the technology to try to do it. And it was a lot of fun. FLATOW: Well, it's fun. But what is fascinating also is that you, who built the technology and built the infrastructure, don't yet know how it worked. Mr. CRANE: Yeah, well, that's - there are a couple of reasons for that, actually, mostly, that this competition started as sort of a group of guys who wanted to participate in this contest. We, you know, there's a sort of funny story that - my friend Olin(ph) told me about this about four days ago - or fours days before the competition started. And so we all sort of worked day and night to get this thing done. And we're - I think that that speaks to the power of our approach, which was that - you know, I'd like to sit here and tell you that we used sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to solve the problem. But, in fact, I think the system we developed beforehand allowed us to collect the relevant information that we needed and then sort of filter through, you know, a lot of the spam and misinformation that people were spreading. And so I think it was - the team, we all did a pretty good job at doing all that. FLATOW: Yeah. Could you use this to find a person or find anything, you think, this idea that you created? Mr. CRANE: Well, I think that the power of this lies when you really have a sort of consensus, you know. I think the moment that, you know, you brought up terrorism and, I think that's what a lot of people are thinking about. But the moment that you have differing factions who would like to - who each have their own sort of role in, you know, in either finding or not finding a person, I think that's where the complication of misinformation and disinformation might prove very difficult to sort through. So in terms of finding a missing child in which sort of something that everyone can really get behind in trying to participate in, I think that's definitely a critical application that we see coming out of this. FLATOW: I see. In other words, you're saying if you were looking for Osama bin Laden or somebody like that, there would be people who would not want you to find him, so they would put disinformation into the system and upset the system. Mr. CRANE: Exactly. FLATOW: But because you have any innocuous sort of thing like finding 10 red balloons, then everybody's in on what's clearly seen as a real game, here. Mr. CRANE: Sure. And I can't say everybody. We've spoken to some of the teams afterwards. For example, the Nerd Fighters team, who actively spammed our site, so we'd like to give a shout out to them, because they sort of really tried to make it difficult for us. CONAN: Hmm. Mr. CRANE: And they were a great competitor. FLATOW: Nick in Royal Oak, Michigan. Hi. NICK (Caller): Hello. FLATOW: Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Hi, there. NICK: Yeah, I just want to shout out and say that we were one of the groups that tried to throw off, just a kind of add a real world environment to it. With i3 Detroit, we actually flew our own balloon, and it was number three, for i3 Detroit. (Soundbite of laughter) NICK: And - but we loved the idea, and we're really glad that someone actually found all the real balloons. FLATOW: Now, so you put a fake one up to throw them off? NICK: Yes, we did. FLATOW: How many people you think did that, Nick? Any idea? NICK: You know what? We tried to find a couple of sites. I want to say there were, like, around 200 false balloons, but we actually couldn't get an accurate number. We're hoping that, you know, something will be published soon. FLATOW: Two hundred false balloons, you think? NICK: I think, yeah. FLATOW: Wow, what do you say to that, Riley? Mr. CRANE: Yeah, I mean, that was really one of the interesting parts of the story, and I think that was a testament to sort of our team's strength in processing the raw data and making sense of the sort of complex patterns. I mean, like I said, I wish we had been able to get together some sort of very sophisticated tools of network analysis, all of which I think may prove effective sort of after the fact, but I think what we relied on was sort of some very straightforward checks. And while I can't disclose all of the techniques we used because, you know, of course we're scientists, and we're interested in publishing a lot of this eventually, some very straightforward things we did to sort of verify the results were, you know: Did the participant have a valid email address? Was the balloon location that they reported consistent with the geographical location that their computer said there were at? Sort of some very straightforward things, and we were sort of, you know, hit with a lot of spam and, I think, a lot of - you know, there were Photoshopped images of balloons in Providence, and it took a lot of effort on our team's part to sort through all of that. FLATOW: And you say that this is sort of proprietary, the math that you used on this? Or are you going to publish the whole thing and make it public? Mr. CRANE: No, I think once - you know, as I said, this was done as a contest by some students, and now that we've sort of collected this data set, which is really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have such a rich data set on questions pertaining to how information spreads in ad hoc networks and some of the core questions like, you know, how can we harness the power of social media, I think there are a lot of questions. And so we're moving forward to make sure that we're going to be able to have access to that data. FLATOW: Would you like to see another one of these contests? Mr. CRANE: Absolutely. I think DARPA has done an amazing job of challenging and driving a lot of innovation with their other projects involving autonomous cars and I think now getting into some networking approaches, I think. I think what this contest demonstrated is really the power of utilizing the vast resources of the human network to solve difficult challenges facing society. I hope they do it. FLATOW: It's sort of a triumph of open source, is it not, in a certain sense? Mr. CRANE: In some sense. We sort of crowd-sourced the intelligence of the United States to solve this very difficult challenge, and I think it - I would love to see DARPA, not only put more funding and research for areas like this, but also to continue these types of challenges. FLATOW: All right, Riley, thank you, very well-spoken, very well-said. Thank you very much for taking time - and congratulations. Mr. CRANE: Thank you. FLATOW: I hope you get some of that cash. Mr. CRANE: Well we've - just to make that clear, we - the entire team of Gayla(ph) and Manuel(ph), Way(ph) and Anmal(ph) and Sandy(ph), we've - none of us are going to be profiting from any of this. All of the proceeds will be going to charity for the money that's not claimed, so. . . FLATOW: There you go. Thank you very much. Mr. CRANE: Thanks a lot, Ira, appreciate it. FLATOW: And have a happy holiday season, Riley. Mr. CRANE: You, too. FLATOW: Riley Crane is a society and science postdoctoral fellow in the Human Dynamics Group at the Media Lab at MIT, the winner - $40,000, it comes to $4,000 a balloon, 10 balloons. We're going to switch gears, come right back. Stay with us - after this break. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.

We sort of crowd-sourced the intelligence of the United States to solve this very difficult challenge, and I think it - I would love to see DARPA, not only put more funding and research for areas like this, but also to continue these types of challenges.  FLATOW: All right, Riley, thank you, very well-spoken, very well-said. Thank you very much for taking time - and congratulations.  Mr. CRANE: Thank you.  FLATOW: I hope you get some of that cash.  Mr. CRANE: Well we've - just to make that clear, we - the entire team of Gayla(ph) and Manuel(ph), Way(ph) and Anmal(ph) and Sandy(ph), we've - none of us are going to be profiting from any of this. All of the proceeds will be going to charity for the money that's not claimed, so. . .  FLATOW: There you go. Thank you very much.  Mr. CRANE: Thanks a lot, Ira, appreciate it.  FLATOW: And have a happy holiday season, Riley.  Mr. CRANE: You, too.  FLATOW: Riley Crane is a society and science postdoctoral fellow in the Human Dynamics Group at the Media Lab at MIT, the winner - $40,000, it comes to $4,000 a balloon, 10 balloons.  We're going to switch gears, come right back. Stay with us - after this break.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.

I'm Michele Norris. Climate negotiators are meeting in Copenhagen to talk solutions on a global level. Meanwhile, people around the U. S. are pondering the impact climate change could have on the places where they live. Florida is one of the most vulnerable parts of the country when it comes to a rise in sea level. As NPR's Greg Allen reports, officials are beginning to plan how to cope with that. GREG ALLEN: Scientists say the sea level has been rising since the end of the last ice age. The concern now is how fast it's rising, and whether cities and natural ecosystems can adapt fast enough to avoid being devastated. Mr. CHRIS BERG (Nature Conservancy): When you hear predictions of up to three or four feet over the next century, it really makes you nervous for the future of this place. ALLEN: Chris Berg is with the Nature Conservancy in the Florida Keys. With an average elevation of just three or four feet, there are few places in America where the rising sea level is a bigger threat. We are on Big Pine Key, one of the chain's largest and most environmentally diverse islands. It's a place that's already been changed by the accelerating sea level rise. Berg takes me to a spot not far from the island's coast that used to be pine forest. Now, it's tidal wetlands \ufffd home to a few salt-tolerant plant species and the desiccated remnants of the old forest. Mr. BERG: This stump is a pine tree \ufffd was a pine tree. Now, it's an old weathered pine stump. And it's literally 100 feet or more away from the nearest living live pine. At one time, pines could live out here in what is now a mangrove marsh. ALLEN: At risk are more than a few pines. The Keys are home to many plants and animals that are found nowhere else in the world. The Nature Conservancy is working to develop special elevation maps for the Keys and other sensitive areas in Florida that will show what spots are most vulnerable and where action is needed to buy time for endangered ecosystems. It's becoming increasingly clear in Florida that more than just a few islands will be affected by the rising sea level. Mr. FRANK ACKERMAN (Senior Economist, Stockholm Environment Institute): It's like our map of the area vulnerable to 27 inches of sea level rise looks like someone took a razor to the state right above Miami and sliced off everything below that. ALLEN: Frank Ackerman is a senior economist at the Stockholm Institute who has studied what impact climate change and sea level rise will have on Florida. His model calls for a sea level rise of just over two feet by 2060. Under that scenario, Ackerman says Florida stands to lose almost 10 percent of its land area and the homes of 1. 5 million people. Mr. ACKERMAN: The vulnerable zone that's vulnerable to 27 inches turns out to include a whole lot of buildings that people would probably rather save. There's residential real estate worth $130 billion in that, half of Florida's beaches, two nuclear reactors, three prisons, 37 nursing homes, and on and on. ALLEN: Ackerman has added up the impact more powerful hurricanes, higher average temperatures and declining tourism will have on Florida. He says the cost of inaction \ufffd doing nothing to slow climate change and sea level rise \ufffd would add up to $345 billion, or five percent of Florida's total income, by 2100. In South Florida, Miami-Dade County set up a task force to look at the issue. It's adopted some recommendations, requiring greater use of hybrids, for example, but so far, it's shied away from tough decisions on zoning and development. And that worries Hal Wanless. He's chair of the geological sciences department at the University of Miami and an adviser to the county on sea level rise. In his office at the university, he brings up a map on his computer showing the impact a five-foot sea level rise would have on South Florida. Miami Beach and nearly all of the Keys are gone. Most of Miami-Dade County and much of Broward are underwater. Mr. HAL WANLESS (Chairman, Geological Sciences, University of Miami): And it's going to just become increasingly risky to live in a place like Florida. Our roads are going to have to be elevated. ALLEN: On this map, basically, Miami is an island now, from the rest\ufffd Mr. WANLESS: It absolutely is. ALLEN: In South Florida, keeping the sea at bay through the use of levees and pumps, along the lines of New Orleans or the Netherlands, is not really an option. This is a metropolitan region built on porous limestone that readily allows rainwater to soak in. Conversely, Wanless says, it also readily allows a rising water table to percolate up to the surface. Mr. WANLESS: If we have rise in sea level, it will come right up through. I remember Hurricane Betsy, in the lower areas where the storm surge came right up through the ground. It didn't necessarily just wash across the surface, it came right up through. There's no way to put a levee around South Florida and really keep the water out. ALLEN: Representatives of South Florida's four counties recently met and agreed to work together on strategies to cope with climate change and sea level rise. Miami-Dade County Commissioner Katy Sorenson says so far, communities have mostly focused on what they can do to stop contributing to global warming. Now, she says, it's time to begin thinking about how cities will adapt to the coming changes. Ms. KATY SORENSON (County Commissioner, Miami-Dad): Part of the adaptation is going to mean actually doing building codes requiring people to have a higher foundation, because if we're going to have sea level rise, we're going to have to have communities that are built - literally built up. Flooding is going to become a commonplace phenomenon. It's common enough now. But just as California is fighting wildfires now almost year-round, we're going to be fighting flooding year-round. And we're going to have to adapt to that as well. ALLEN: And the concerns are not just in South Florida. The Army Corps of Engineers recently published guidance for its staff, directing them to consider the impact a rise in sea level will have on all corps projects nationwide.

I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, host: And I'm Renee Montagne. We're reporting, this morning, on some practical problems with saving the planet. World leaders are gathering in Copenhagen, hoping to work out a deal on climate change. That's proving to be very hard, yet the real challenge comes later. Each nation has to find its own way to reduce greenhouse gases. INSKEEP: Elsewhere in today's program we hear from India. The government there will struggle to contain greenhouse emissions while India's economy grows. MONTAGNE: And Americans face their own challenges. NPR's Richard Harris reports on one possible source of more energy. RICHARD HARRIS: Nuclear power poses a major conundrum. Nobody's thrilled about nuclear waste, people fear potential accidents, and proliferation of nuclear weapons is downright scary. On the other hand, nuclear plants generate lots of power and very little carbon dioxide. And when people crunch the numbers to see how to phase out carbon dioxide emissions, they often come up with this answer. Dr. RICHARD MESERVE (President, Carnegie Institution for Science): My view is that nuclear has to play a major role. HARRIS: Richard Meserve is the president of the Carnegie Institution for Science. He used to chair the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and he served on a recent National Academy of Sciences committee looking at the future of energy in America. Dr. MESERVE: Nuclear technology is something that's there, we know how to do it, there's no technical challenge in being able to apply it, unlike many of the other technologies HARRIS: For example, there's no proven technology to capture and store carbon dioxide from coal plants. So Meserve says the challenge in nuclear isn't technology, it's money. Dr. MESERVE: These plants are very expensive at the front end. Wall Street lost a lot of money when we built our existing nuclear plants because of the long time to construct the plants in a period of very high interest rates. HARRIS: So even though there are now 26 applications pending for new reactors, most everyone seems to be too timid to take the financial plunge. Dr. MESERVE: If you have a nuclear plant with all in costs of eight to nine billion, that's bet your company proposition. HARRIS: The federal government is talking about loan guarantees and other incentives to help plants get over that hump. Some see that as a giveaway to the industry. Others see that as needed to keep nuclear in the mix. Tom Terbush at the Electric Power Research Institute says his utility-funded group is agnostic about where power should come from. But when they look at the deep carbon cuts being promised for the next decade or two. . . Mr. TOM TERBUSH (Electric Power Research Institute): That's really tough and I think one of the reasons that nuclear, among a lot of different things, but why nuclear is actually an important piece of that would be these are big, basic plants. Yes, they take a few years to build, but we know how to build them. Once you build them, a typical unit - generating unit - can probably produce enough power for nearly a million homes. So it's a big chunk. HARRIS: Terbush says every option has its challenges. You'd have to put up more than a thousand wind turbines, for example, to match the power output of a single nuclear plant. So his organization figures that nuclear needs to play a substantial role, along with every other technology that produces clean power. Mr. TERBUSH: And if you're putting all your eggs in one or two or three baskets, even if you just put all your eggs in the nuclear basket, say, that probably wouldn't get you to where you need. HARRIS: Others who look at the mix of future power options are not so sanguine about nuclear. Ellen Vanco is at an environmental group the Union of Concerned Scientists. Ms. ELLEN VANCO (Union of Concerned Scientists): While it may sound convenient or easy to just throw a few thousand megawatt nuclear power plants on the ground, it's not necessarily cost-effective. HARRIS: Her group's analysis shows that the cheapest thing to do is to reduce demand for electricity by improving efficiency. Of course, there's also a challenge in motivating tens of millions of homeowners to insulate their attics and to replace old freezers. Some hard-line environmental groups, like Greenpeace, remain staunchly opposed to nuclear power, even in the face of climate change. But the Union of Concerned Scientists, for one, is holding its nose and saying we can't afford to shut the door entirely on nuclear power. Ms. VANCO: But there's a huge difference between calling for, first, a limited number versus, as some are suggesting, 100 new nuclear power plants being built between now and 2030. HARRIS: What ultimately happens will probably depend on experience with those next few plants. Richard Meserve, of the Carnegie Institution, says he expects six to eight new plants to go into operation by 2020. Dr. MESERVE: How fast we deploy them after that will likely be driven by the experience with the early plants. Can we build them on budget? Can we build them on time? Do they work economically? HARRIS: Right now, nuclear power provides 20 percent of the nation's electricity. With no new plants, that number would gradually decline, even as the demand for clean power grows. Richard Harris, NPR News. MONTAGNE: The world's biggest economy is trying to find some way to curb their emissions. They are also trying to keep the emissions in developing nations from radically increasing as those economies grow. With that in mind, European officials made an announcement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference today. They said they'll commit more than three billion dollars per year to help poor nations fight global warming.  STEVE INSKEEP, host:  It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep.

But from 1810 to 1819, people couldn't quite figure out why the Earth became so cold. For an entire decade, the Earth cooled almost a full degree Fahrenheit. And 1816 was known as the year without a summer. Now, until recently, scientists weren't quite sure why. They pointed to the eruption of an Indonesian volcano in 1815, but that didn't explain why the previous years were also colder. Well, now, newly uncovered evidence in the icepacks of Antarctica and Greenland suggests another volcanic eruption may have caused this worldwide dip in temperatures. Jihong Cole-Dai led the research team. He's an associate chemistry professor at South Dakota State University and he explained how a volcanic eruption could cool the Earth. Professor JIHONG COLE-DAI (Chemistry, South Dakota State University): When the volcano erupts, it sends out large quantities of chemical gases. One of the gases is sulfur dioxide. When sulfur dioxide is an amasser, it's converted to sulfuric acid, which forms aerosols. These aerosol particles tend to reflect sunlight. And so, when you have large quantities, the Earth is cooler because some of the sunlight that normally would reach the surface of the earth is reflected. RAZ: But can it have an impact for an entire decade? I mean, 1810 to 1819 - all that just from a volcano? Prof. COLE-DAI: Well, usually, the aerosols can stay in the atmosphere for up to about three or four years. So, for the entire decade to be cold, if it's caused by volcanic eruptions, then one is probably not enough. RAZ: So, basically, you figured out that there had to have been at least more than one. We knew about the Indonesian eruption at Tambora but where was this volcano? Prof. COLE-DAI: We really don't know. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. COLE-DAI: Our research uses the snow and ice samples from the poles. We found the sulfuric acid in the Greenland ice has this special signature that tells us that the sulfur must have gone through the stratosphere, which is the high level of the atmosphere. The second piece of evidence we found was that the timing of the sulfuric acid at the both poles were exactly the same. So, with these two pieces of evidence, we can say that the volcano must be somewhere near the equator, or what we call the tropics, and must be large enough to cool the earth. RAZ: When you read those ice cores in the poles, how could you be so sure that what you were reading happened in 1809 versus 1815? Prof. COLE-DAI: A natural level of sulfuric acid can be found in polar snow, and it just happens that in the summertime the snow would have slightly more sulfuric acid than the winter snow. So we can see there's a pattern of high and low. And so by counting these layers, we can pinpoint the age of a snow back to the year of 1809 and 1810, and that's where we found the sulfuric acid from the volcanic eruption. RAZ: Professor Cole-Dai, as you know, negotiators from around the world are meeting in Copenhagen for the climate talks, and I'm wondering if we can learn anything from your studies. I mean, in theory, if sulfur cooled the planet before, could it somehow be used to cool the planet again? Prof. COLE-DAI: Yes. At least in theory, it is possible that if you put sulfur into the stratosphere the same way that a volcano does, it will stay in the atmosphere for a number of years, and while it's there, it would have a cooling effect on the planet. RAZ: That's Jihong Cole-Dai. He's an associate professor of chemistry at South Dakota State University. Professor Cole-Dai, thank you so much for joining us. Prof. COLE-DAI: Thank you.

Prof. COLE-DAI: A natural level of sulfuric acid can be found in polar snow, and it just happens that in the summertime the snow would have slightly more sulfuric acid than the winter snow. So we can see there's a pattern of high and low. And so by counting these layers, we can pinpoint the age of a snow back to the year of 1809 and 1810, and that's where we found the sulfuric acid from the volcanic eruption.  RAZ: Professor Cole-Dai, as you know, negotiators from around the world are meeting in Copenhagen for the climate talks, and I'm wondering if we can learn anything from your studies. I mean, in theory, if sulfur cooled the planet before, could it somehow be used to cool the planet again?  Prof. COLE-DAI: Yes. At least in theory, it is possible that if you put sulfur into the stratosphere the same way that a volcano does, it will stay in the atmosphere for a number of years, and while it's there, it would have a cooling effect on the planet.  RAZ: That's Jihong Cole-Dai. He's an associate professor of chemistry at South Dakota State University.  Professor Cole-Dai, thank you so much for joining us.  Prof. COLE-DAI: Thank you.

A new study published in the journal, Geology, shows that if CO2 levels were to soar, the changes in the world's oceans would cripple many species but might result in lobsters 50 percent bigger than normal. Now, before you make those reservations at Red Lobster or start clarifying (unintelligible) of butter, you should know that those supersized lobsters probably won't last very long. And to explain why, we're joined by the scientist who oversaw that study. Justin Ries is an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Welcome to the program. Professor JUSTIN RIES (Marine Sciences, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill): Thanks, Guy. Thanks for having me. RAZ: Explain how higher CO2 levels in the ocean actually produce bigger, much bigger lobsters. Prof. RIES: Well, we hypothesize that the lobsters had the ability to control the type of carbon that's adjacent to their shell and, therefore, that they used to build their skeletons. So when you increase CO2 in the atmosphere, you actually increase the amount of carbon in seawater so you increase the amount of material they're using to build their shell. But for most organisms, this is in the wrong form. We hypothesize that the lobsters have the ability to convert that carbon back into a form that they can use in shell building. RAZ: Justin Ries, that sounds pretty good, I guess, right? I mean, bigger lobsters means better yields for the industry, the seafood industry, maybe better prices for consumers, right? Prof. RIES: Well, it's a little more complicated than that, and the reason is because this pH control and, therefore, this control of the type of carbon they use may require them to divert energy from other physiological processes like tissue growth and reproduction. So they may be able to maintain elevated levels of calcification under CO2 acidification, but it may come at the expense of other processes. And this could be a very bad thing lobsters. Another component of this story is that if less CO2 tolerant species within the ecosystem and within the lobster's food web, like clams, for example, one of the main prey of lobsters, they had a very negative response. And if their shells become thinner and they become exploited by lobsters and crustaceans that are not able to prey on them more effectively, they're prey could ultimately - populations could decline. And even though the lobsters are building stronger shells, their populations would probably be sure to follow. RAZ: How did you do this research? I understand that you did this in a controlled environment. Obviously, you didn't do this in the ocean. Describe what you actually did. Prof. RIES: We took seawater and we bubbled it with mixed gases that were formulated at the CO2 levels that are predicted for the future. And we grew the organisms for 60 days under these future high CO2 scenarios. And then we measured how the organism's rate of calcification changed over that 60-day period. And the way we did this is we actually measure their buoyant weight, which is the standard method for measuring just the weight of the shell. RAZ: So you build these tanks and you have these each tank sort of predicts what the carbon levels will be in the ocean 100 years from now, 200 years from now and beyond. The lobsters did well; some of the other crustaceans did well. Which organisms didn't do well? Prof. RIES: That's a great question. The organisms that didn't do well generally were the coral we looked at and the mollusk clams, quahogs, the clam that you use in clam chowder, bay scallop, the American oyster and a soft clam. And actually, six of these species began to dissolve under the highest CO2 level. That means over the 60-day period, their shell weighed less at the end than at the beginning. And this suggests that given sufficient time, these organisms could lose their shell completely. Now, in general, the marine sea floor is a very tough place to live. It's rife with intense predation. And in order for you to survive on the sea floor, you need to be able to protect yourself from predation. And one of the main ways organisms do that is to build their shells. If they lose these shells, they're not going to be able to protect themselves from the highly predatory marine sea floor. RAZ: Justin Ries is a marine geologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. His new study on how rising carbon levels affect marine organisms is in the latest issue of the journal, Geology. Justin Ries, thanks. Prof. RIES: Thank you very much, Guy.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Tomorrow, the world's largest particle collider will complete its inaugural run. There are lofty hopes for the Large Hadron Collider, that it could reveal mysteries of the universe, but the collider has been marred by serious setbacks. It rumbled to life in the fall of 2008 and almost immediately broke down. This month, after a year of repairs, the collider finally began smashing together subatomic particles at record energies. Geoff Brumfiel traveled to CERN, the particle physics lab in Geneva, to check it out. GEOFF BRUMFIEL: It's the middle of the night, and I'm standing in a room that looks like mission control. There are huge flat-screen monitors lining the walls, and about a dozen people are watching those monitors really carefully. But instead of looking up, this mission control is looking down. About 300 feet below us is a detector the size of a five-story building. (Soundbite of music) BRUMFIEL: A phone rings, and Niki Saoulidou picks up. Ms. NIKI SAOULIDOU (CERN): Okay, you don't want me to wake him up or anything. BRUMFIEL: Saoulidou is running the night shift here at the detector, which is called the Compact Muon Solenoid. This is one of four experiments at the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC. The LHC is the world's highest energy particle collider. It accelerates protons around a 16-mile underground racetrack and then smashes them together. The detector's job is to record the subatomic debris from the collision so that researchers can piece together what happens when the protons break apart. At the moment, the LHC is running 24/7, and that means Saoulidou won't be going to bed. Ms. SAOULIDOU: From four in the morning until eight is my worst four hours. I really drink a lot of coffee, and I start to feel tired, but I don't mind. I enjoy doing this shift because it brings you close to the real thing. BRUMFIEL: The real thing, in this case, is the chance to find something totally new. For decades, physicists have had the same view of the universe. They call it the Standard Model, and it's just what the name suggests: sturdy, dependable but a little boring. Scientists want a change, and if their calculations are right, the energy released by the LHC's collision should create something new. That something might be a particle that helps give everything mass or maybe dark matter, which makes up much of the universe but hasn't been directly detected. There's even some who think the LHC will discover extra dimensions of space. The truth is that nobody knows. John Ellis is a theorist at CERN. Mr. JOHN ELLIS (Theorist, CERN): It'll be a little bit like watching somebody appear out of the fog. You're walking along through the fog, and then somebody comes out of the fog and you start picking out various aspects, and then eventually, you come face to face with the new physics. It's going to be very exciting. BRUMFIEL: Last September, scientists were ready to go. But just days after starting, the LHC had a major accident. A single connection, one of tens of thousands inside the collider, burned out during testing. The burnout caused massive damage that has taken over a year to fix. Again, John Ellis. Mr. ELLIS: The mood at CERN has been a bit of a roller coaster over the last year, year and a half. There was obviously a tremendous amount of anticipation and excitement ahead of the start-up last September, and then of course, there was a big depression a few days later when there was this electrical fault. Since then, I think probably the appropriate phrase is grim determination to get it right this time. BRUMFIEL: But getting it right isn't easy. The zipping protons are suspended by thousands of superconducting magnets, which must be kept freezing cold with tons of liquid helium. Everything needs to be timed to within a few trillionths of a second, or the particles won't collide. On top of it all, the LHC was built from scratch, and that makes it quirky. Mike Lamont helps keep it running. Mr. MIKE LAMONT (CERN): There are subsystems out there with personalities of their own, usually a product of their creator. BRUMFIEL: So it's got a lot of personality, in other words. Mr. LAMONT: Well, personality, I don't know. It's kind of a crankiness, I guess, if you can call that a personality trait. BRUMFIEL: The machine may be cranky, but since it started working, the researchers here have really cheered up. Today, they've come to CERN's cafeteria to lunch on fresh salad, roast veal and other French delicacies. Literally, thousands of scientists from all over the world are visiting right now, including Jim Strait. He normally works at Fermilab, America's main high-energy physics laboratory in Illinois. Mr. JIM STRAIT (Fermilab): CERN really, for this sort of stuff, is by far and away the biggest, most cutting-edge place in the world. Fermilab, where I work, is number two, and at the moment just surveying the cafeteria here, it seems like it's a long way from one to two. BRUMFIEL: This large-scale research takes people from all over the world to make it happen. Much of their time has been spent in their own laboratories working on a tiny component or a piece of software. Now that the LHC is starting up, they all get to come to CERN together. Mr. STRAIT: It's this place that is completely mobbed with geeks who are surrounded by other geeks and therefore in geek heaven, doing exactly what they want to do. You know, and the exciting thing is that we're going to learn new things about how the universe works, which is what us geeks like to do. BRUMFIEL: The mood at CERN is electric, and that's not just because the collider consumes as much electricity as the whole of Geneva. Mr. ZACH MARSHALL (Graduate Student, Columbia ATLAS): Everybody is so jazzed that the machine's actually working now. BRUMFIEL: Zach Marshall is a graduate student on a detector called Atlas. Mr. MARSHALL: But we're just waiting with bated breath because it's been so close so many times. (Soundbite of laughter) BRUMFIEL: If nothing else goes wrong, the LHC will begin colliding in earnest early next year. For NPR News, I'm Geoff Brumfiel.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. 2009 marks 150 years since the publication of Charles Darwin's \"Origin of Species. \" And as our small part of that celebration, we present an award show. It's worth considering those species who have managed to change the world from the earliest organisms that squiggled about in the sea to the magnificently sophisticated creatures that managed to invent radio. Presenting the awards, historian Christopher Lloyd, who for his new book took on the modest assignment of life, specifically the 100 most important species. And we'll give you two quick examples. Stony corals, tiny co-operative fish that constructed reefs that became islands, mountains and habitat for thousands of other creatures, they come in at number seven. And one spot ahead at number six is man. So, give us a call if you'd like to know the evolutionary standing of a particular species. And we have an email challenge for you. What do you think made the top three, the most important species in the history of the Earth? No cheating. Step away from the Internet except for your email and send us your answer, talk@npr. org is the address. Our phone number, 800-989-8255. And you can join the conversation on our Web site as well. That's at npr. org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. Later in the program, Robin Givhan of the Washington Post on Tiger Woods, sex and sexism. But first, Christopher Lloyd joins from the studios of the BBC in Tunbridge Wells. His new book is \"What on Earth Evolved? 100 Species that Changed the World. \" And it's great pleasure to have you today on TALK OF THE NATION. CHRISTOPHER LLOYD: Great to be here, Neal, thanks. CONAN: And it's nice to know we're more important than stony corals. LLOYD: Yeah, only just. I have to say, there's only two points in it, actually. But you're right, we just put them to the post. CONAN: And how do you decide which species is more important comparative to another? LLOYD: Well, to be honest I wanted to write about 100 different species of which humans were one, so that we could see where we fit in really with the rest of the natural world. And so that we don't always look at the past from a human perspective. And I thought as a bit of fun at the back, having written the biography as all these amazing different living things with their incredible stories, that I would take upon myself the challenge of ranking them in an order of impact of one to a hundred. And I chose five criteria. One is their impact on evolution, another is their impact on human history, another the impact on the environment, so the land, the sea, the sky. Then, how pervasive they are, their global reach. And finally, how long have they actually survived? How many millions of years? CONAN: So, that a relatively recently arrival would get marked down, like man? LLOYD: Well, that's right, actually. And, yeah, Homo Sapiens we do worst when it comes to longevity. So, you know, at about 160,000 years, compared with that shark that you mentioned at the start, the euphagy(ph) who may have been around for about 400 million years, we kind of don't do well on that score. CONAN: . . . on that score. So, even though they came in 38 compared to our six. LLOYD: They did come in 38 but they are amazing survivor, sharks, it has to be said. So their story is truly awesome. CONAN: And you've divided them rather neatly into 50 species that predate Homo Sapiens and 50, well, you talk about those first 50 as engaged in natural selection. The next 50 after man, artificial selection. LLOYD: Yeah, funny enough, that's a little bit the way that Darwin approached it in his book \"On the Origin of Species. \" He started off with artificial selection, actually, which he called domestication. And the way in which we have changed different species or those species have changed us and actually you can look at it both ways. CONAN: Mm-hmm. LLOYD: Over the last 10,000 since we started farming is absolutely remarkable. And this is something that really struck Darwin and he believed there were some selective pressures at work that may have been in place long before humans existed. And that really gave him the clue to come with the idea of natural selection, which is, of course, what dominates the first half of this particular study - the first 50 species that evolved in the wild. CONAN: And it's interesting, you do engage in the discussion of did man domesticate grains or the other way around? LLOYD: Yeah, it's really interesting actually, particularly when you look at things like narcotics, some things like that, things that have a stimulating effect on our minds. And one of the chapters is on those, and if you look at, you know, different parts of the world where different types of plants grow, you'll find different characteristics of human culture beginning to come out. For example, in the Western hemisphere, the traditional narcotics that grow are things like cocaine and stimulants like coffee. And in the Eastern hemisphere, you'll find that the traditional plants are opiates, which are much more relaxing. And you can find different attributes of human culture coming out. And you begin to wonder which actually - whether the tail is wagging the dog, see what I mean. CONAN: Mm-hmm. LLOYD: Are we reflections of the plants that grow in our neighborhoods rather than the house just being always in control? CONAN: If you'd like to engage into the conversation: 800-989-8255. Email us talk@npr. org. Christopher Lloyd is our guest. His book, \"What on Earth Evolved? 100 Species That Changed The World. \" And let's start with Ruth(ph). Ruth with us from Chattanooga. RUTH: Yes, hello. LLOYD: Hello, Ruth. RUTH: You were asking what we thought one of the top three would be. And my guess would be stromatolites would be in the top three because they gave us oxygen in our atmosphere. LLOYD: I have to say Ruth you are absolutely on the nail. So, I will be crowning you now in our award ceremony. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)RUTH: Well, thank you. LLOYD: I'm hugely, hugely impressed. Where did you say? Chattanooga. That must be a very special place. RUTH: Well, I'm staying here taking care of my mother for a time. I actually live in Louisiana, but I grew up in Chattanooga. LLOYD: Fantastic. Well, maybe one day I'll get there and then I'll be able to sort of give you a free copy of the book because you're absolutely right. They actually come at number three and the species is cyanobacteria, which are a type of bacteria that live, as you know, on these rocky structures called stromatolites. And they really began to colonize the earth about 2. 8 billion years ago and were the first photosynthetic organisms. So they gave birth to our oxygenated atmosphere. And. . . CONAN: And still a few left off the coast of Australia, much beloved by nature documentaries. LLOYD: Yes, indeed. In Shark Bay and there are some of the them under the seas off Bermuda and various other places. But I mean, those billions of years ago, the whole world was peppered with these structures. And they - it's extraordinary to think that the early atmosphere on the Earth had no oxygen in it and that actually it was primitive forms of life that gave us the oxygen. How amazing is that when you think, you know, we think we're so special and important, but actually we depend on all these other living things and we really depend on those stromatolites, cyanobacteria. So thank you, Ruth, for pointing that out and you're absolutely there with number three. RUTH: Thank you. I plan on getting this book. This sounds fascinating. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)LLOYD: Well, I hope you enjoy it. CONAN: Thanks very much, Ruth. RUTH: Thank you. CONAN: Bye, bye. Let's go next to, this is Vitus(ph). Vitus with us from Tucson. VITUS: Hey, how are you? CONAN: Very good. LLOYD: Fine and well. VITUS: I wanted to say that it occurs to me that perhaps the human race has been colonized by yeast, since we grow them to create alcohol in vast numbers. . . CONAN: Well, it's interesting. . . VITUS: . . . we're really just their slave. CONAN: We mentioned that man came in at six and the stony corals at seven and yeast comes in, I think, right in there. LLOYD: You've got it, Vitus, absolutely, number eight. So, they're there in the top 10. And yeast have got a fascinating story to tell. I mean, they are amazingly powerful and influential in nature. But for human history, it's yeast of course who has given us the opportunity to create alcoholic drinks, but yeast also creates natural preservatives within fruit and yeast has colonized all areas of the world. Tiny microscopic fungus, but with a tremendously big impact. So, you're absolutely right. They're not in the top three, but they're in the top 10, so you're very close to the money, Vitus. Thank you. VITUS: Well, thank you for writing the book. I'm going to get it. CONAN: Okay. LLOYD: All right. CONAN: Thanks very much. It was interesting as you were going through those mind altering things in coca, as you would expect, opium - coca - cocoa rather, coffee and tea. But ergot comes in very strong. LLOYD: Yeah. Look, it's a fascinating one because it's actually the base for a drug called LSD and was only discovered really that - in the 1940s by a chap called Albert Hoffman. And he accidentally synthesized LSD which is made out of ergot, which is a parasitic fungus that attacks rye. And he ingested some of it, just out of curiosity, and then he took a bike ride home and it was the most weird bike ride you'll ever, ever read about. You can read about it in \"The Story of Ergot. \" But he did make it home, but only thanks to somebody who was with him. And then, of course, he describes in great detail in his diary the experience he had as a result. So it's thought, actually, that ergot isn't - ergot poisoning is something that gave rise to dancing fever, even could have been responsible for the madness that's supposed to have gripped the Salem witches in those Salem witches trials, or even in medieval times in Europe, dancing fever, which broke out across Germany because of poisoned rye, parasitic ergot. And even right back in ancient Greece, some of the ceremonies the Greeks indulged in are thought to have been - their stupor was induced by ergot that was infecting the rye around, and they made drinks out of it. So it has a really interesting, long history that predates the synthesis of LSD, but, of course, in the modern age has become to be really quite significant. CONAN: Here's a tweet from triangleman, who answers our quiz. And he proposes for the top three: cockroaches, E. coli and fruit flies. LLOYD: Well, that's very interesting. Fruit flies are absolutely there, in at number 15. So I think that's an excellent guess. Fruit flies are incredibly great survivors and have been really, really very important in our understanding of genetics and diseases, because many of the genes in a fruit fly are very similar to the genes in humans. And the way that fruit flies are able to breed and so on has allowed scientists to understand how genetics work in a way they never would have done without fruit flies. And, of course, they spread diseases with their legs because they crawl over dung and then they fly elsewhere, and so they've been a very great impact. E. coli actually isn't in the list. I think it's in one of my 30 species that nearly made it. I think its influence has been. . . CONAN: Honorable mention, I think. LLOYD: An honorable mention. Exactly. We've got to have that list, very important. But it's a very recent kind of - recently come onto the radar, I think, in terms of, certainly, human perception. And the other one the gentlemen mentioned was. . . CONAN: Cockroaches. LLOYD: Cockroaches. Well, they belong to the kind of beetle family, and I had to - a bit of a dilemma when it came to beetles because you probably know they are amongst the most diverse living things, and there are hundreds of thousands, millions of species of beetles. And I had to choose one, and I actually chose the dung beetle, which has an amazing history going back to ancient Egypt, where they were venerated as being a reflection of the gods because they would roll up balls of dung. And they sort of represented the passage of the sun over the course of a day and then the dying of the sun at night, which, when it went to the underworld, as it were. And so on Egyptian hieroglyphics, you find these dung beetles, but they have an incredible ecological role to play because they really regenerate the soil. They sort of plant their eggs inside the dung, and they use that dung in a very kind of sustainable way, really. So a tremendous amount of agriculture that we depend on and the fertility of the soil is down to the work of dung beetles and other organisms. But cockroaches, I know in the States, there's a - is a big thing. Over in the U. K. here, we tend to be more paranoid about spiders than we are about cockroaches. So there may be a cultural reason why it isn't in the list, OK. So. . . CONAN: I recommend you rent an apartment in the city of New York and then come back to me in a couple of years. LLOYD: Yeah, exactly. I've heard the stories already, but you're right. CONAN: We're talking with Christopher Lloyd. His book is \"What On Earth Evolved? \" It's a tour of the 100 species who managed to claw their way up the evolutionary ladder. We're taking your calls at 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. We've identified one of the top three: cyanobacteria. Two more left to go. Well, let's get the drum roll ready. I'm Neal Conan. Stay with us. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan, in Washington. In the evolutionary game, it's hard not to think of humans as the cream of the crop. Well, we're number six in Christopher Lloyd's book \"What On Earth Evolved. \" The bacteria that live in our gut, lactobacillus, rank higher in terms of longevity and global reach. He's talking with us today about the range of species that have survived and evolved, some splendidly, since the dawn of time, and 100 have really changed history. Fifty before man he's chosen, 50 after man. That's everything from the terrifying, sea scorpions and slime mold, to the delicious, like coffee and grapes. Give us a call if you'd like to know which - if you think you know the top three. We've identified one of them, cyanobacteria - 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. And let's see if we can get another caller in. This is Nema(ph), Nema calling from San Francisco. NEMA: Hey, how you doing? CONAN: Good. Go ahead, please. NEMA: Good. Well, I actually have to say I think one, at least one of the two have to be insects. I know. . . CONAN: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. You're trying to categorize. Is it bigger than a bread box is your next question. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)NEMA: But I actually took a - I used to be a biology major, and I remember they were talking about the influence of certain inspects because they were able to fly, and they were able to. . . CONAN: I'm afraid we're going to need a little more specificity than that. NEMA: More specificity. Dang. I guess I really don't have - I guess I want to say maybe group hymenoptera. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)CONAN: Hymenoptera. All right. NEMA: Yeah. CONAN: I'm not sure what hymenoptera are, but Christopher Lloyd, do you know? LLOYD: I'm not exactly sure. You know, you tell us, Nema, what do you mean exactly? NEMA: I think they're a classification of ants, so to speak. LLOYD: Ah, right. Well, ants, that's great, because that puts it into everyday language for all of us. And ants are certainly there in the list, Nema, but they're not there in the top three. Let's just see if we - Neal, you can find ants as quickly as I can. Let's see where it is. CONAN: Okay, well, they're - ant is number 25. LLOYD: Thank you very much. There we are, number 25. And so Nema, that is a very good comment. I mean, ants have colonized the world. They have changed ecosystems. They are incredibly sophisticated, with models of society. In fact, you can find almost every type of human society in an ants nest. You've got soldier ants. You've got worker ants. You've got slaves. You've got kings and queens. You know, you've got so many different things that evolved probably 100 to 120 million years ago, all there represented in the natural world, which is why it's so fascinating to connect human history with natural history because we can learn so much about ourselves. So ants are absolutely in there, a really good suggestion, and thanks for the call, Nema. CONAN: Appreciate it. NEMA: All right. Thank you. CONAN: And here's an email from Rick in Laramie, who suggests rhizobium, the N-fixing bacteria, he says, and also the ever-worthy wine grape. LLOYD: Well, and this is Nick, is that right? CONAN: Rick. LLOYD: Sorry, Rick. Well, I am incredibly impressed, Rick. You are - you know, you have got our number four. So rhizobia comes in at number four, and that is a terrific guess because I often give lectures and things about this way of looking at natural and human history, and seldom do people come up with rhizobia. But you're absolutely right. This is a type of bacteria that fertilizes the soil, and it lives in a sort of symbiotic relationship with legumes - that is, clover and beans and other things. And it depends on those legumes because the legumes feed it sugars from their photosynthesis, but in return, the rhizobia fix the nitrogen from the air, turn it into fertilizer and fertilize the plants. So they live absolutely in lock-step with each other, and the rhizobia fertilize the soil, and that's absolutely vital for other plants and for all living things, ultimately, in the food chain. So rhizobia go right to the top of the list, number four - excellent, excellent guess. CONAN: And he also guessed the grape, which does awfully well, too. LLOYD: Yeah, the grape does awfully well, too. Let's have a look. The grape - I'm flicking through my list here. . . CONAN: I'm flipping through, too. LLOYD: . . . seeing if we can - number 73, rate for the grape. I mean, it's got a fantastic story, but it's really only risen to particular prominence, I guess, since about 500 B. C. or so. CONAN: Well, we're mostly talking about the repeal of prohibition in this country, but. . . LLOYD: Yeah, sure, OK. Well, I take that all back, of course. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)CONAN: Okay, let's go next to Jonathan, Jonathan with us from Homer in Alaska. JONATHAN: Yeah, hi. I've got a few guesses here, but just to give you a glimpse of why we might make number six, got so interesting in the book, listening here, I asked my girlfriend to iPhoned it on Amazon, and it's already in the mail and on the way to Alaska here already. So. . . LLOYD: Terrific. Well, I hope you enjoy it, Jonathan, thanks for your support. JONATHAN: Oh, it sounds great. This is fantastic. Thanks for writing the book. LLOYD: It was such fun to write. JONATHAN: Oh, good. Well, so, the top three - I think - I've got to give my girlfriend credit for this one, but the pollinators. Bees have got to be up there pretty high, and then I like corn because we're reading Michael Pollan's book. CONAN: Well, we all like corn. JONATHAN: And then I want to know where viruses fit in there, probably bubonic plague or something like that. CONAN: Well, according to his book, right at the beginning. JONATHAN: Oh, yeah. Viruses begin the whole story, you know. And there's this increasing hypothesis that life on Earth was begun by genetic replicators that were the ancestors of today's viruses, the RNA world. So I give them really kind of pride of place in the story of life on Earth, and each group of species I've prefaced with a narrative. So you can read about the story of life on Earth right from the beginning, from the first replicators, which may have been ancestors of viruses, right through to the present day, as well as look at the biographies of all the species. But your girlfriend has come up with some terrific suggestions, and I'm very happy to say that everything she suggested is very much in the list of the 100. So bees come in at 33, and that's only just a little bit ahead of corn, which we have a habit of calling maize over here. But that comes in at number 35. And viruses, well, the top virus in the list is number nine, and that is influenza. Now, that may not come as too much of a surprise, but influenza has had a dramatic effect on human history. Some of you may know that the Spanish flu, at the end of the first world war in 1918, actually killed twice as many people as soldiers that died in World War I. CONAN: Just on that same list, though, we have an email from Jeff in Riverside that says - Riverside, Missouri: Is penicillin on the list? LLOYD: It is, and that is number 10, Jeff. So this is great. We've got some terrific suggestions. We all seem to be on the right wavelength, which is great. So it comes in at number 10. I mean, it's had a meteoric impact, I should say, since the 1940s, when it was introduced during World War II. Before that, penicillin, you know, has been very successful, but didn't have much of an impact on human history. But, of course, in the last 50, 60, 70 years, penicillin has transformed the prospects of humanity, and in some ways is responsible - or for a great part - is responsible for the growth of populations from two or three billion back in 1940 to approaching seven billion today. So that's a huge deal. CONAN: Jonathan, thanks very much for the call. JONATHAN: Thank you. LLOYD: Thanks, Jonathan. And thank your girlfriend. CONAN: And let's go next to Matthew, Matthew with us from Summit Lake in Wisconsin. MATTHEW: Yeah, hi, there, gentlemen. LLOYD: Hi, Matthew. MATTHEW: How's everything going today? I think that the author gave me an idea when he was talking about soil fertility with the dung beetle. I'd have to think that the earthworm would be very important in the evolution. LLOYD: My goodness, and who are we talking to, Neal? This is. . . CONAN: Matthew. LLOYD: Matthew, you - where's the drum roll? Have we got the drum roll and the cymbals? That's it. Well done, Neal, excellent. Ba-doom! You've got it, Matthew. Absolutely. At number one in the 100 species is the earthworm. MATTHEW: Hey, how about that? OK. LLOYD: So, well, that is brilliant. Thank you very much. MATTHEW: I'd also like to give out a shout out to the ginkgo. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)LLOYD: Steady on, one thing at a time. CONAN: There you go. LLOYD: So the earthworm gets the number one spot. CONAN: But why the humble earthworm? LLOYD: Well, you know, earthworms, there are a lot of reasons, but the ancestors of today's earthworms evolved about 600 million years ago at the bottom of the sea. And they evolved in a way, the template for all animal body designs - and I know this is going to sound a little bizarre, but in many ways, humans are a kind of elaborate form of earthworm - or worm, at least. If you think about it, we eat our food through our mouths. It goes through a hole in our bodies, comes out the other end, and we have a three-layer system for our body design where the organs press between our guts and our skin and then this outer layer of skin. And this is exactly the same template as worms have, and they are the kind of pioneers of animal body design. So they really get a big tick in the impact on evolution. They then survived spectacularly well through five mass-extinction events. And one of them, 252 million years ago, wiped out, you know, 96 percent of marine species and 75 percent of land species but didn't touch the earthworm because they bury in the ground. They're not fussy about what they eat. And generally speaking, when life gets tough, it's great to be small, and it's great to be able to hide. Earthworms do that. And then when it comes to human history, you know, there could have been no human civilizations without earthworms because they ventilate the soil, they fertilize the soil, because the excrement kind of provides all the right ingredients for soil fertility, and even things like the Egyptian pyramids, they wouldn't have been built without earthworms. And I know that sounds really odd, but, you know, it was only thanks to the earthworms plowing up the soil when the farmers - so the farmers could leave their fields and then go and build the pyramids for the pharaohs over three months while the earthworms got on with the plowing. And funnily enough, the earthworm happened to be Charles Darwin's kind of favorite species. He wrote his last book all about earthworms, and it was amazing to see it come out top of the list because literally, I did all the scoring and I pressed it all in my spreadsheet, and there it was, the earthworm, yeah. CONAN: Number one. All right. We should mentioned an emailer named Jonathan also got worms. He also mentioned another species: horses. LLOYD: Horses. Yeah, well, horses absolutely are on the list. And I tell you that the story of the horse and how it's become so successful in a world of sort of seven billion humans is absolutely fascinating. But the horse comes at number 58. And I was surprised in a way it didn't come a little higher, because if you think about it, the horse and humans have had such a shared destiny. You know, we take horses into war with us. We - horses have plowed our fields. They provided transport, and so on. But on some of the other criteria, they don't score quite as highly. They have, you know, horses are already domesticated perhaps four or 5,000, 6,000 years ago, compared with something like an elephant. Elephants have got much more longevity. They also possibly have a greater ecological impact. And elephants are the only lumberjacks of the natural world, and they can clear forests to create light so that forests can renew themselves. And their dung provides the seeds around which termites build their nests. And these are impacts that are really important but don't belong horses. So by having a kind of balance of different criteria, you create some quite interesting kind of orderings in the rankings. So elephants actually come a little higher than horses. But horses are there, and they're really significant. CONAN: And speaking of forests, there is a species of which I had never heard called lepidodendron. . . LLOYD: Yeah. CONAN: . . . which is - I perhaps put in Irish. But I'm sure it's got an apostrophe there after the O. But anyway, this was a species of tree which vanished a long time ago, and only flowered at the very top and once in its life. LLOYD: That's absolutely right. And to think about it, actually, bamboos only flower once in their life. So it is a sort of ancient habit of some plants. But the lepidodendron tree was amazingly successful. It was the first really, really successful tree that evolved about 320, 350 million years ago. And it would - there were like giant telegraph polls. So they would shoot up incredibly quickly in a race to try and get to a light. And because they didn't have any branches or leaves on their trunks, but only at the top, they could grow incredibly densely. So they're the most densely packed forests. And then therefore when they die, they would fall over and they'd all fall over on top of each other and they'd never properly rot because there were layers and layers of these trees in the forests and the air could never really get to them. So as the sediment built up and as the forests were flooded, as the seas rose and things, all these deposits of these trees got pressed and mashed up in the geological process of the earth, and have become for us the most valuable commodity, really, over the last 200 or 300 years to man, and that is coal. So most of the coal deposits, the best coal deposits, actually, are the ancient remains of lepidodendron trees. CONAN: So think about West Virginia or Kentucky or parts of Wyoming covered. . . LLOYD: You've got it. CONAN: . . . in all these trees. LLOYD: Absolutely. CONAN: We're talking with Christopher Lloyd. His new book \"What on Earth Evolved? : 100 Species That Changed the World. \" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And let's go to Ed, Ed with us from Traverse City in Michigan. Hi, Ed. ED: Good morning - good afternoon, gentlemen. CONAN: Hi, Ed. LLOYD: I would like to weigh or guess perhaps ocean's buffet of plankton or indoor algae. LLOYD: Well, Ed, that is terrific. You know, we've got the number one spot that was sorted out, and number three, and you have seem to zoomed in on number two. CONAN: Congratulations there, Ed. LLOYD: So I'm absolutely - the quality of your listeners, Neal, is really awesome. I'm incredibly impressed. And algae. . . CONAN: TALK OF THE NATION listeners come in at number 14. LLOYD: They probably - yeah, we may be given, I have to give them an honorary place, wont' we, in the table? You're absolutely right. Number 14. So you've just knocked the mosquito out now. CONAN: And a good thing, too. You've swat it right out of there. LLOYD: Oh, yeah, and a good thing. You got it. We've swatted it away. And now NPR listeners. So algae come in at number two. Very ancient organisms dominate the ecosystem in the sea, but - and on water, responsible for emitting a gas called dimethyl sulfide, which is vital for cloud formation. And thanks to the ability for water vapor to condense around the particles of dimethyl sulfide, we get more and more clouds than we would have done. And that has allowed the earth to become much cooler because it reflects the sun rays away from the ground. And therefore, even though the sun's temperature has risen by 25 percent over the period of life on earth, the actual temperature the earth has dropped dramatically, making conditions for life on earth much, much more favorable. CONAN: Mm-hmm. LLOYD: And we have to thank algae for that. The other thing is that there's a tremendous potential for algae in the future to be able to be farmed in a way that procreates biofuels in a sustainable basis, to absorb carbon dioxide, turn it into biofuels, and that would be an ideal material for being able to power aircraft in the future. And there's a lot of research going on over in Boeing and so on to try and find algae - ways of farming algae in order to power transportation in the next hundred years. So it'll be an interesting one to watch. Maybe we'll that number one. CONAN: Ed, thanks very much for the call. LLOYD: Sure. I have a quick question for us before we cut off? CONAN: If you make it very quick. LLOYD: What affected the red tide when I was kid growing up in Newport, Rhode Island? Red tide would come in. Was that dead algae or an algae plum? LLOYD: Yeah, probably was an algae plum, actually. I mean, there are red algae and there are green algae and there are brown algae. So there are various different types. So my guess is it would have been one - probably the red algae, yeah. CONAN: All right, Ed. OK: OK. Thank you. CONAN: Thanks very much for the call. And it's interesting. Algae, of course, are a non-flowering plant. But you come to the conclusion that on your list, though we've not talked about all that many flowering plants, that they are, in fact - they make up quite a number of the nominees. LLOYD: They do, Neal. Actually, I was surprised at the end when I counted it all up - 32 out of the 100 species that changed the world are flowering plants. And they evolved, the first flowering plants may be about 180 million years ago, but they've had such a dramatic impact on people. That's what's one of the most amazing things, because we, you know, we depend, of course, on plants. But flowering plants have so many ingenious ways of pollinating, of fruiting, of intoxicating, of poisoning. You know, so you look through everything from the things we're familiar with, like corn or rice or coco or - chocolate, rather - and coffee and tea and roses and lotus flowers. They're all flowering plants and they're amazingly well - and others that evolved before humans, like the durian fruit, which is a huge fruit that evolved in the age of dinosaurs. It's probably the smelliest thing living on the planet, you know, and bamboo and all sorts of other things. It's just incredible, the variety and the utility to which flowering plants are put, so they've - their impact has been truly immense. CONAN: Well, thank you so much for your time today. We appreciate it. LLOYD: It's a real pleasure, Neal. Thank you. CONAN: Christopher Lloyd is the author of the book \"What on Earth Evolved? : 100 Species that Changed the World,\" with us today from the studios of the BBC at Tunbridge Wells. If you'd like to read more about the evolutionary marvel the earthworm, you can read an excerpt about it at our Web site. Just go to npr. org and click on TALK OF THE NATION. LLOYD: If you think Tiger Woods has been dragged through the tabloid mud, Robin Givhan says that's nothing compared with the women whose names have been linked with his. She joins us next. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, Host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. 2009 marks 150 years since the publication of Charles Darwin's \"Origin of Species. \" And as our small part of that celebration, we present an award show. It's worth considering those species who have managed to change the world from the earliest organisms that squiggled about in the sea to the magnificently sophisticated creatures that managed to invent radio. Presenting the awards, historian Christopher Lloyd, who for his new book took on the modest assignment of life, specifically the 100 most important species. And we'll give you two quick examples. Stony corals, tiny co-operative fish that constructed reefs that became islands, mountains and habitat for thousands of other creatures, they come in at number seven. And one spot ahead at number six is man. So, give us a call if you'd like to know the evolutionary standing of a particular species. And we have an email challenge for you. What do you think made the top three, the most important species in the history of the Earth? No cheating. Step away from the Internet except for your email and send us your answer, talk@npr. org is the address. Our phone number, 800-989-8255. And you can join the conversation on our Web site as well. That's at npr. org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. Later in the program, Robin Givhan of the Washington Post on Tiger Woods, sex and sexism. But first, Christopher Lloyd joins from the studios of the BBC in Tunbridge Wells. His new book is \"What on Earth Evolved? 100 Species that Changed the World. \" And it's great pleasure to have you today on TALK OF THE NATION. CHRISTOPHER LLOYD: Great to be here, Neal, thanks. CONAN: And it's nice to know we're more important than stony corals. LLOYD: Yeah, only just. I have to say, there's only two points in it, actually. But you're right, we just put them to the post. CONAN: And how do you decide which species is more important comparative to another? LLOYD: Well, to be honest I wanted to write about 100 different species of which humans were one, so that we could see where we fit in really with the rest of the natural world. And so that we don't always look at the past from a human perspective. And I thought as a bit of fun at the back, having written the biography as all these amazing different living things with their incredible stories, that I would take upon myself the challenge of ranking them in an order of impact of one to a hundred. And I chose five criteria. One is their impact on evolution, another is their impact on human history, another the impact on the environment, so the land, the sea, the sky. Then, how pervasive they are, their global reach. And finally, how long have they actually survived? How many millions of years? CONAN: So, that a relatively recently arrival would get marked down, like man? LLOYD: Well, that's right, actually. And, yeah, Homo Sapiens we do worst when it comes to longevity. So, you know, at about 160,000 years, compared with that shark that you mentioned at the start, the euphagy(ph) who may have been around for about 400 million years, we kind of don't do well on that score. CONAN: . . . on that score. So, even though they came in 38 compared to our six. LLOYD: They did come in 38 but they are amazing survivor, sharks, it has to be said. So their story is truly awesome. CONAN: And you've divided them rather neatly into 50 species that predate Homo Sapiens and 50, well, you talk about those first 50 as engaged in natural selection. The next 50 after man, artificial selection. LLOYD: Yeah, funny enough, that's a little bit the way that Darwin approached it in his book \"On the Origin of Species. \" He started off with artificial selection, actually, which he called domestication. And the way in which we have changed different species or those species have changed us and actually you can look at it both ways. CONAN: Mm-hmm. LLOYD: Over the last 10,000 since we started farming is absolutely remarkable. And this is something that really struck Darwin and he believed there were some selective pressures at work that may have been in place long before humans existed. And that really gave him the clue to come with the idea of natural selection, which is, of course, what dominates the first half of this particular study - the first 50 species that evolved in the wild. CONAN: And it's interesting, you do engage in the discussion of did man domesticate grains or the other way around? LLOYD: Yeah, it's really interesting actually, particularly when you look at things like narcotics, some things like that, things that have a stimulating effect on our minds. And one of the chapters is on those, and if you look at, you know, different parts of the world where different types of plants grow, you'll find different characteristics of human culture beginning to come out. For example, in the Western hemisphere, the traditional narcotics that grow are things like cocaine and stimulants like coffee. And in the Eastern hemisphere, you'll find that the traditional plants are opiates, which are much more relaxing. And you can find different attributes of human culture coming out. And you begin to wonder which actually - whether the tail is wagging the dog, see what I mean. CONAN: Mm-hmm. LLOYD: Are we reflections of the plants that grow in our neighborhoods rather than the house just being always in control? CONAN: If you'd like to engage into the conversation: 800-989-8255. Email us talk@npr. org. Christopher Lloyd is our guest. His book, \"What on Earth Evolved? 100 Species That Changed The World. \" And let's start with Ruth(ph). Ruth with us from Chattanooga. RUTH: Yes, hello. LLOYD: Hello, Ruth. RUTH: You were asking what we thought one of the top three would be. And my guess would be stromatolites would be in the top three because they gave us oxygen in our atmosphere. LLOYD: I have to say Ruth you are absolutely on the nail. So, I will be crowning you now in our award ceremony. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) RUTH: Well, thank you. LLOYD: I'm hugely, hugely impressed. Where did you say? Chattanooga. That must be a very special place. RUTH: Well, I'm staying here taking care of my mother for a time. I actually live in Louisiana, but I grew up in Chattanooga. LLOYD: Fantastic. Well, maybe one day I'll get there and then I'll be able to sort of give you a free copy of the book because you're absolutely right. They actually come at number three and the species is cyanobacteria, which are a type of bacteria that live, as you know, on these rocky structures called stromatolites. And they really began to colonize the earth about 2. 8 billion years ago and were the first photosynthetic organisms. So they gave birth to our oxygenated atmosphere. And. . . CONAN: And still a few left off the coast of Australia, much beloved by nature documentaries. LLOYD: Yes, indeed. In Shark Bay and there are some of the them under the seas off Bermuda and various other places. But I mean, those billions of years ago, the whole world was peppered with these structures. And they - it's extraordinary to think that the early atmosphere on the Earth had no oxygen in it and that actually it was primitive forms of life that gave us the oxygen. How amazing is that when you think, you know, we think we're so special and important, but actually we depend on all these other living things and we really depend on those stromatolites, cyanobacteria. So thank you, Ruth, for pointing that out and you're absolutely there with number three. RUTH: Thank you. I plan on getting this book. This sounds fascinating. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) LLOYD: Well, I hope you enjoy it. CONAN: Thanks very much, Ruth. RUTH: Thank you. CONAN: Bye, bye. Let's go next to, this is Vitus(ph). Vitus with us from Tucson. VITUS: Hey, how are you? CONAN: Very good. LLOYD: Fine and well. VITUS: I wanted to say that it occurs to me that perhaps the human race has been colonized by yeast, since we grow them to create alcohol in vast numbers. . . CONAN: Well, it's interesting. . . VITUS: . . . we're really just their slave. CONAN: We mentioned that man came in at six and the stony corals at seven and yeast comes in, I think, right in there. LLOYD: You've got it, Vitus, absolutely, number eight. So, they're there in the top 10. And yeast have got a fascinating story to tell. I mean, they are amazingly powerful and influential in nature. But for human history, it's yeast of course who has given us the opportunity to create alcoholic drinks, but yeast also creates natural preservatives within fruit and yeast has colonized all areas of the world. Tiny microscopic fungus, but with a tremendously big impact. So, you're absolutely right. They're not in the top three, but they're in the top 10, so you're very close to the money, Vitus. Thank you. VITUS: Well, thank you for writing the book. I'm going to get it. CONAN: Okay. LLOYD: All right. CONAN: Thanks very much. It was interesting as you were going through those mind altering things in coca, as you would expect, opium - coca - cocoa rather, coffee and tea. But ergot comes in very strong. LLOYD: Yeah. Look, it's a fascinating one because it's actually the base for a drug called LSD and was only discovered really that - in the 1940s by a chap called Albert Hoffman. And he accidentally synthesized LSD which is made out of ergot, which is a parasitic fungus that attacks rye. And he ingested some of it, just out of curiosity, and then he took a bike ride home and it was the most weird bike ride you'll ever, ever read about. You can read about it in \"The Story of Ergot. \" But he did make it home, but only thanks to somebody who was with him. And then, of course, he describes in great detail in his diary the experience he had as a result. So it's thought, actually, that ergot isn't - ergot poisoning is something that gave rise to dancing fever, even could have been responsible for the madness that's supposed to have gripped the Salem witches in those Salem witches trials, or even in medieval times in Europe, dancing fever, which broke out across Germany because of poisoned rye, parasitic ergot. And even right back in ancient Greece, some of the ceremonies the Greeks indulged in are thought to have been - their stupor was induced by ergot that was infecting the rye around, and they made drinks out of it. So it has a really interesting, long history that predates the synthesis of LSD, but, of course, in the modern age has become to be really quite significant. CONAN: Here's a tweet from triangleman, who answers our quiz. And he proposes for the top three: cockroaches, E. coli and fruit flies. LLOYD: Well, that's very interesting. Fruit flies are absolutely there, in at number 15. So I think that's an excellent guess. Fruit flies are incredibly great survivors and have been really, really very important in our understanding of genetics and diseases, because many of the genes in a fruit fly are very similar to the genes in humans. And the way that fruit flies are able to breed and so on has allowed scientists to understand how genetics work in a way they never would have done without fruit flies. And, of course, they spread diseases with their legs because they crawl over dung and then they fly elsewhere, and so they've been a very great impact. E. coli actually isn't in the list. I think it's in one of my 30 species that nearly made it. I think its influence has been. . . CONAN: Honorable mention, I think. LLOYD: An honorable mention. Exactly. We've got to have that list, very important. But it's a very recent kind of - recently come onto the radar, I think, in terms of, certainly, human perception. And the other one the gentlemen mentioned was. . . CONAN: Cockroaches. LLOYD: Cockroaches. Well, they belong to the kind of beetle family, and I had to - a bit of a dilemma when it came to beetles because you probably know they are amongst the most diverse living things, and there are hundreds of thousands, millions of species of beetles. And I had to choose one, and I actually chose the dung beetle, which has an amazing history going back to ancient Egypt, where they were venerated as being a reflection of the gods because they would roll up balls of dung. And they sort of represented the passage of the sun over the course of a day and then the dying of the sun at night, which, when it went to the underworld, as it were. And so on Egyptian hieroglyphics, you find these dung beetles, but they have an incredible ecological role to play because they really regenerate the soil. They sort of plant their eggs inside the dung, and they use that dung in a very kind of sustainable way, really. So a tremendous amount of agriculture that we depend on and the fertility of the soil is down to the work of dung beetles and other organisms. But cockroaches, I know in the States, there's a - is a big thing. Over in the U. K. here, we tend to be more paranoid about spiders than we are about cockroaches. So there may be a cultural reason why it isn't in the list, OK. So. . . CONAN: I recommend you rent an apartment in the city of New York and then come back to me in a couple of years. LLOYD: Yeah, exactly. I've heard the stories already, but you're right. CONAN: We're talking with Christopher Lloyd. His book is \"What On Earth Evolved? \" It's a tour of the 100 species who managed to claw their way up the evolutionary ladder. We're taking your calls at 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. We've identified one of the top three: cyanobacteria. Two more left to go. Well, let's get the drum roll ready. I'm Neal Conan. Stay with us. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan, in Washington. In the evolutionary game, it's hard not to think of humans as the cream of the crop. Well, we're number six in Christopher Lloyd's book \"What On Earth Evolved. \" The bacteria that live in our gut, lactobacillus, rank higher in terms of longevity and global reach. He's talking with us today about the range of species that have survived and evolved, some splendidly, since the dawn of time, and 100 have really changed history. Fifty before man he's chosen, 50 after man. That's everything from the terrifying, sea scorpions and slime mold, to the delicious, like coffee and grapes. Give us a call if you'd like to know which - if you think you know the top three. We've identified one of them, cyanobacteria - 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. And let's see if we can get another caller in. This is Nema(ph), Nema calling from San Francisco. NEMA: Hey, how you doing? CONAN: Good. Go ahead, please. NEMA: Good. Well, I actually have to say I think one, at least one of the two have to be insects. I know. . . CONAN: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. You're trying to categorize. Is it bigger than a bread box is your next question. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) NEMA: But I actually took a - I used to be a biology major, and I remember they were talking about the influence of certain inspects because they were able to fly, and they were able to. . . CONAN: I'm afraid we're going to need a little more specificity than that. NEMA: More specificity. Dang. I guess I really don't have - I guess I want to say maybe group hymenoptera. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) CONAN: Hymenoptera. All right. NEMA: Yeah. CONAN: I'm not sure what hymenoptera are, but Christopher Lloyd, do you know? LLOYD: I'm not exactly sure. You know, you tell us, Nema, what do you mean exactly? NEMA: I think they're a classification of ants, so to speak. LLOYD: Ah, right. Well, ants, that's great, because that puts it into everyday language for all of us. And ants are certainly there in the list, Nema, but they're not there in the top three. Let's just see if we - Neal, you can find ants as quickly as I can. Let's see where it is. CONAN: Okay, well, they're - ant is number 25. LLOYD: Thank you very much. There we are, number 25. And so Nema, that is a very good comment. I mean, ants have colonized the world. They have changed ecosystems. They are incredibly sophisticated, with models of society. In fact, you can find almost every type of human society in an ants nest. You've got soldier ants. You've got worker ants. You've got slaves. You've got kings and queens. You know, you've got so many different things that evolved probably 100 to 120 million years ago, all there represented in the natural world, which is why it's so fascinating to connect human history with natural history because we can learn so much about ourselves. So ants are absolutely in there, a really good suggestion, and thanks for the call, Nema. CONAN: Appreciate it. NEMA: All right. Thank you. CONAN: And here's an email from Rick in Laramie, who suggests rhizobium, the N-fixing bacteria, he says, and also the ever-worthy wine grape. LLOYD: Well, and this is Nick, is that right? CONAN: Rick. LLOYD: Sorry, Rick. Well, I am incredibly impressed, Rick. You are - you know, you have got our number four. So rhizobia comes in at number four, and that is a terrific guess because I often give lectures and things about this way of looking at natural and human history, and seldom do people come up with rhizobia. But you're absolutely right. This is a type of bacteria that fertilizes the soil, and it lives in a sort of symbiotic relationship with legumes - that is, clover and beans and other things. And it depends on those legumes because the legumes feed it sugars from their photosynthesis, but in return, the rhizobia fix the nitrogen from the air, turn it into fertilizer and fertilize the plants. So they live absolutely in lock-step with each other, and the rhizobia fertilize the soil, and that's absolutely vital for other plants and for all living things, ultimately, in the food chain. So rhizobia go right to the top of the list, number four - excellent, excellent guess. CONAN: And he also guessed the grape, which does awfully well, too. LLOYD: Yeah, the grape does awfully well, too. Let's have a look. The grape - I'm flicking through my list here. . . CONAN: I'm flipping through, too. LLOYD: . . . seeing if we can - number 73, rate for the grape. I mean, it's got a fantastic story, but it's really only risen to particular prominence, I guess, since about 500 B. C. or so. CONAN: Well, we're mostly talking about the repeal of prohibition in this country, but. . . LLOYD: Yeah, sure, OK. Well, I take that all back, of course. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) CONAN: Okay, let's go next to Jonathan, Jonathan with us from Homer in Alaska. JONATHAN: Yeah, hi. I've got a few guesses here, but just to give you a glimpse of why we might make number six, got so interesting in the book, listening here, I asked my girlfriend to iPhoned it on Amazon, and it's already in the mail and on the way to Alaska here already. So. . . LLOYD: Terrific. Well, I hope you enjoy it, Jonathan, thanks for your support. JONATHAN: Oh, it sounds great. This is fantastic. Thanks for writing the book. LLOYD: It was such fun to write. JONATHAN: Oh, good. Well, so, the top three - I think - I've got to give my girlfriend credit for this one, but the pollinators. Bees have got to be up there pretty high, and then I like corn because we're reading Michael Pollan's book. CONAN: Well, we all like corn. JONATHAN: And then I want to know where viruses fit in there, probably bubonic plague or something like that. CONAN: Well, according to his book, right at the beginning. JONATHAN: Oh, yeah. Viruses begin the whole story, you know. And there's this increasing hypothesis that life on Earth was begun by genetic replicators that were the ancestors of today's viruses, the RNA world. So I give them really kind of pride of place in the story of life on Earth, and each group of species I've prefaced with a narrative. So you can read about the story of life on Earth right from the beginning, from the first replicators, which may have been ancestors of viruses, right through to the present day, as well as look at the biographies of all the species. But your girlfriend has come up with some terrific suggestions, and I'm very happy to say that everything she suggested is very much in the list of the 100. So bees come in at 33, and that's only just a little bit ahead of corn, which we have a habit of calling maize over here. But that comes in at number 35. And viruses, well, the top virus in the list is number nine, and that is influenza. Now, that may not come as too much of a surprise, but influenza has had a dramatic effect on human history. Some of you may know that the Spanish flu, at the end of the first world war in 1918, actually killed twice as many people as soldiers that died in World War I. CONAN: Just on that same list, though, we have an email from Jeff in Riverside that says - Riverside, Missouri: Is penicillin on the list? LLOYD: It is, and that is number 10, Jeff. So this is great. We've got some terrific suggestions. We all seem to be on the right wavelength, which is great. So it comes in at number 10. I mean, it's had a meteoric impact, I should say, since the 1940s, when it was introduced during World War II. Before that, penicillin, you know, has been very successful, but didn't have much of an impact on human history. But, of course, in the last 50, 60, 70 years, penicillin has transformed the prospects of humanity, and in some ways is responsible - or for a great part - is responsible for the growth of populations from two or three billion back in 1940 to approaching seven billion today. So that's a huge deal. CONAN: Jonathan, thanks very much for the call. JONATHAN: Thank you. LLOYD: Thanks, Jonathan. And thank your girlfriend. CONAN: And let's go next to Matthew, Matthew with us from Summit Lake in Wisconsin. MATTHEW: Yeah, hi, there, gentlemen. LLOYD: Hi, Matthew. MATTHEW: How's everything going today? I think that the author gave me an idea when he was talking about soil fertility with the dung beetle. I'd have to think that the earthworm would be very important in the evolution. LLOYD: My goodness, and who are we talking to, Neal? This is. . . CONAN: Matthew. LLOYD: Matthew, you - where's the drum roll? Have we got the drum roll and the cymbals? That's it. Well done, Neal, excellent. Ba-doom! You've got it, Matthew. Absolutely. At number one in the 100 species is the earthworm. MATTHEW: Hey, how about that? OK. LLOYD: So, well, that is brilliant. Thank you very much. MATTHEW: I'd also like to give out a shout out to the ginkgo. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) LLOYD: Steady on, one thing at a time. CONAN: There you go. LLOYD: So the earthworm gets the number one spot. CONAN: But why the humble earthworm? LLOYD: Well, you know, earthworms, there are a lot of reasons, but the ancestors of today's earthworms evolved about 600 million years ago at the bottom of the sea. And they evolved in a way, the template for all animal body designs - and I know this is going to sound a little bizarre, but in many ways, humans are a kind of elaborate form of earthworm - or worm, at least. If you think about it, we eat our food through our mouths. It goes through a hole in our bodies, comes out the other end, and we have a three-layer system for our body design where the organs press between our guts and our skin and then this outer layer of skin. And this is exactly the same template as worms have, and they are the kind of pioneers of animal body design. So they really get a big tick in the impact on evolution. They then survived spectacularly well through five mass-extinction events. And one of them, 252 million years ago, wiped out, you know, 96 percent of marine species and 75 percent of land species but didn't touch the earthworm because they bury in the ground. They're not fussy about what they eat. And generally speaking, when life gets tough, it's great to be small, and it's great to be able to hide. Earthworms do that. And then when it comes to human history, you know, there could have been no human civilizations without earthworms because they ventilate the soil, they fertilize the soil, because the excrement kind of provides all the right ingredients for soil fertility, and even things like the Egyptian pyramids, they wouldn't have been built without earthworms. And I know that sounds really odd, but, you know, it was only thanks to the earthworms plowing up the soil when the farmers - so the farmers could leave their fields and then go and build the pyramids for the pharaohs over three months while the earthworms got on with the plowing. And funnily enough, the earthworm happened to be Charles Darwin's kind of favorite species. He wrote his last book all about earthworms, and it was amazing to see it come out top of the list because literally, I did all the scoring and I pressed it all in my spreadsheet, and there it was, the earthworm, yeah. CONAN: Number one. All right. We should mentioned an emailer named Jonathan also got worms. He also mentioned another species: horses. LLOYD: Horses. Yeah, well, horses absolutely are on the list. And I tell you that the story of the horse and how it's become so successful in a world of sort of seven billion humans is absolutely fascinating. But the horse comes at number 58. And I was surprised in a way it didn't come a little higher, because if you think about it, the horse and humans have had such a shared destiny. You know, we take horses into war with us. We - horses have plowed our fields. They provided transport, and so on. But on some of the other criteria, they don't score quite as highly. They have, you know, horses are already domesticated perhaps four or 5,000, 6,000 years ago, compared with something like an elephant. Elephants have got much more longevity. They also possibly have a greater ecological impact. And elephants are the only lumberjacks of the natural world, and they can clear forests to create light so that forests can renew themselves. And their dung provides the seeds around which termites build their nests. And these are impacts that are really important but don't belong horses. So by having a kind of balance of different criteria, you create some quite interesting kind of orderings in the rankings. So elephants actually come a little higher than horses. But horses are there, and they're really significant. CONAN: And speaking of forests, there is a species of which I had never heard called lepidodendron. . . LLOYD: Yeah. CONAN: . . . which is - I perhaps put in Irish. But I'm sure it's got an apostrophe there after the O. But anyway, this was a species of tree which vanished a long time ago, and only flowered at the very top and once in its life. LLOYD: That's absolutely right. And to think about it, actually, bamboos only flower once in their life. So it is a sort of ancient habit of some plants. But the lepidodendron tree was amazingly successful. It was the first really, really successful tree that evolved about 320, 350 million years ago. And it would - there were like giant telegraph polls. So they would shoot up incredibly quickly in a race to try and get to a light. And because they didn't have any branches or leaves on their trunks, but only at the top, they could grow incredibly densely. So they're the most densely packed forests. And then therefore when they die, they would fall over and they'd all fall over on top of each other and they'd never properly rot because there were layers and layers of these trees in the forests and the air could never really get to them. So as the sediment built up and as the forests were flooded, as the seas rose and things, all these deposits of these trees got pressed and mashed up in the geological process of the earth, and have become for us the most valuable commodity, really, over the last 200 or 300 years to man, and that is coal. So most of the coal deposits, the best coal deposits, actually, are the ancient remains of lepidodendron trees. CONAN: So think about West Virginia or Kentucky or parts of Wyoming covered. . . LLOYD: You've got it. CONAN: . . . in all these trees. LLOYD: Absolutely. CONAN: We're talking with Christopher Lloyd. His new book \"What on Earth Evolved? : 100 Species That Changed the World. \" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And let's go to Ed, Ed with us from Traverse City in Michigan. Hi, Ed. ED: Good morning - good afternoon, gentlemen. CONAN: Hi, Ed. LLOYD: I would like to weigh or guess perhaps ocean's buffet of plankton or indoor algae. LLOYD: Well, Ed, that is terrific. You know, we've got the number one spot that was sorted out, and number three, and you have seem to zoomed in on number two. CONAN: Congratulations there, Ed. LLOYD: So I'm absolutely - the quality of your listeners, Neal, is really awesome. I'm incredibly impressed. And algae. . . CONAN: TALK OF THE NATION listeners come in at number 14. LLOYD: They probably - yeah, we may be given, I have to give them an honorary place, wont' we, in the table? You're absolutely right. Number 14. So you've just knocked the mosquito out now. CONAN: And a good thing, too. You've swat it right out of there. LLOYD: Oh, yeah, and a good thing. You got it. We've swatted it away. And now NPR listeners. So algae come in at number two. Very ancient organisms dominate the ecosystem in the sea, but - and on water, responsible for emitting a gas called dimethyl sulfide, which is vital for cloud formation. And thanks to the ability for water vapor to condense around the particles of dimethyl sulfide, we get more and more clouds than we would have done. And that has allowed the earth to become much cooler because it reflects the sun rays away from the ground. And therefore, even though the sun's temperature has risen by 25 percent over the period of life on earth, the actual temperature the earth has dropped dramatically, making conditions for life on earth much, much more favorable. CONAN: Mm-hmm. LLOYD: And we have to thank algae for that. The other thing is that there's a tremendous potential for algae in the future to be able to be farmed in a way that procreates biofuels in a sustainable basis, to absorb carbon dioxide, turn it into biofuels, and that would be an ideal material for being able to power aircraft in the future. And there's a lot of research going on over in Boeing and so on to try and find algae - ways of farming algae in order to power transportation in the next hundred years. So it'll be an interesting one to watch. Maybe we'll that number one. CONAN: Ed, thanks very much for the call. LLOYD: Sure. I have a quick question for us before we cut off? CONAN: If you make it very quick. LLOYD: What affected the red tide when I was kid growing up in Newport, Rhode Island? Red tide would come in. Was that dead algae or an algae plum? LLOYD: Yeah, probably was an algae plum, actually. I mean, there are red algae and there are green algae and there are brown algae. So there are various different types. So my guess is it would have been one - probably the red algae, yeah. CONAN: All right, Ed. OK: OK. Thank you. CONAN: Thanks very much for the call. And it's interesting. Algae, of course, are a non-flowering plant. But you come to the conclusion that on your list, though we've not talked about all that many flowering plants, that they are, in fact - they make up quite a number of the nominees. LLOYD: They do, Neal. Actually, I was surprised at the end when I counted it all up - 32 out of the 100 species that changed the world are flowering plants. And they evolved, the first flowering plants may be about 180 million years ago, but they've had such a dramatic impact on people. That's what's one of the most amazing things, because we, you know, we depend, of course, on plants. But flowering plants have so many ingenious ways of pollinating, of fruiting, of intoxicating, of poisoning. You know, so you look through everything from the things we're familiar with, like corn or rice or coco or - chocolate, rather - and coffee and tea and roses and lotus flowers. They're all flowering plants and they're amazingly well - and others that evolved before humans, like the durian fruit, which is a huge fruit that evolved in the age of dinosaurs. It's probably the smelliest thing living on the planet, you know, and bamboo and all sorts of other things. It's just incredible, the variety and the utility to which flowering plants are put, so they've - their impact has been truly immense. CONAN: Well, thank you so much for your time today. We appreciate it. LLOYD: It's a real pleasure, Neal. Thank you. CONAN: Christopher Lloyd is the author of the book \"What on Earth Evolved? : 100 Species that Changed the World,\" with us today from the studios of the BBC at Tunbridge Wells.

I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, Host: NPR's Joe Palca explains. JOE PALCA: David Kingsley studies how a small fish about three or four inches long, called the stickleback, adapted. Kingsley is a biologist at Stanford University. DAVID KINGSLEY: We'd like to know what is it that's happened at the DNA level, the genetic level, in order to allow these organisms to colonize and then thrive in new environmental conditions. PALCA: Turns out, the genetic changes aren't in genes that make things in the body. They're in bits of DNA that turn on and off the genes that makes things in the body. For example, consider how sticklebacks adapted to different predators. In a lake full of hungry trout, the successful stickleback will have lots of spines. KINGSLEY: The sticklebacks would raise the spines. It's like trying to eat a pin cushion. PALCA: But in other places, trout aren't the problem. KINGSLEY: One of the other things that tries to eat sticklebacks are insects. PALCA: Those must be big insects. KINGSLEY: There's lots of insects in Canada that are bigger than sticklebacks. PALCA: Yikes. KINGSLEY: Insects eat sticklebacks by grabbing onto the dorsal and the pelvic spines. PALCA: And then burrowing in from the side. So the successful stickleback in an environment with lots of insects will have fewer spines for insects to grab on to. Kingsley looked at the fish with fewer spines and found something interesting: They still had the gene that makes the protein that makes the spines. KINGSLEY: What's changed is not whether the gene exists, but where and when the gene is expressed. PALCA: Geneticist Sean Carroll at the University of Wisconsin sees a similar phenomenon in fruit flies. In this week's print version of Science, he describes how one of these regulatory elements has caused fruit flies living at high altitudes to be darker than flies in the lowlands. SEAN CARROLL: And that's occurred by a small number of mutations that have accumulated fairly recently in fruit flies living in East Africa. PALCA: Once upon a time, the dogma was genes coded for proteins and proteins made the tissues, and enzymes and hormones that make us. But recently, Carroll says there's been increased interest in these regulatory elements; segments of DNA that don't actually code for proteins, but control the expression of the genes that do. CARROLL: If we take a big picture of our genome, our DNA, only about one- and-a-half percent of the three billion letters in our DNA code for proteins. And we think that several more percent is involved in doing just this - of controlling how those genes that encode proteins are being used. PALCA: In fact, those controlling bits of DNA have already helped explain some inherited conditions. Take lactose intolerance. People who can't digest milk as adults have the same protein coding gene as people who can. David Kingsley says what's changed is a regulatory element that decides when to switch off that gene. KINGSLEY: You either only express that during the nursing period or you continue to express it into adulthood. And that simple change in how long is the milk digestion enzyme expressed is enough to make the difference between somebody who can enjoy ice cream or get sick when they try to eat it. PALCA: Joe Palca, NPR News, Washington. ROBERT SIEGEL, Host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, Host:  NPR's Joe Palca explains. JOE PALCA: David Kingsley studies how a small fish about three or four inches long, called the stickleback, adapted. Kingsley is a biologist at Stanford University. DAVID KINGSLEY: We'd like to know what is it that's happened at the DNA level, the genetic level, in order to allow these organisms to colonize and then thrive in new environmental conditions. PALCA: Turns out, the genetic changes aren't in genes that make things in the body. They're in bits of DNA that turn on and off the genes that makes things in the body. For example, consider how sticklebacks adapted to different predators. In a lake full of hungry trout, the successful stickleback will have lots of spines. KINGSLEY: The sticklebacks would raise the spines. It's like trying to eat a pin cushion. PALCA: But in other places, trout aren't the problem. KINGSLEY: One of the other things that tries to eat sticklebacks are insects. PALCA: Those must be big insects. KINGSLEY: There's lots of insects in Canada that are bigger than sticklebacks. PALCA: Yikes. KINGSLEY: Insects eat sticklebacks by grabbing onto the dorsal and the pelvic spines. PALCA: And then burrowing in from the side. So the successful stickleback in an environment with lots of insects will have fewer spines for insects to grab on to. Kingsley looked at the fish with fewer spines and found something interesting: They still had the gene that makes the protein that makes the spines. KINGSLEY: What's changed is not whether the gene exists, but where and when the gene is expressed. PALCA: Geneticist Sean Carroll at the University of Wisconsin sees a similar phenomenon in fruit flies. In this week's print version of Science, he describes how one of these regulatory elements has caused fruit flies living at high altitudes to be darker than flies in the lowlands. SEAN CARROLL: And that's occurred by a small number of mutations that have accumulated fairly recently in fruit flies living in East Africa. PALCA: Once upon a time, the dogma was genes coded for proteins and proteins made the tissues, and enzymes and hormones that make us. But recently, Carroll says there's been increased interest in these regulatory elements; segments of DNA that don't actually code for proteins, but control the expression of the genes that do.

As for men, all we can say is: this is something you know, even if you never talk about it. Breaking the silence, our science correspondent, Robert Krulwich. ROBERT KRULWICH: May, can you hear me? Professor MAY BERENBAUM: Hi. Yeah, can you hear me? KRULWICH: Yeah, I can. Oh boy. Okay. My friend, Professor May Berenbaum, studies insects at the University of Illinois, and she has a friend. Prof. BERENBAUM: My colleague, Arthur Zangerl - Z-A-N-G-E-R-L. KRULWICH: Is this the guy who goes to Holland to study wild parsnips? Prof. BERENBAUM: Yeah, exactly. KRULWICH: Okay. So while Arthur was passing through the airport looking for the parsnips in Amsterdam, he saw something in the men's bathroom. Prof. BERENBAUM: Yeah. KRULWICH: The urinals? What is that. . . Prof. BERENBAUM: That each urinal had a little figure of a fly. It looked - a very realistic fly. KRULWICH: So it's a picture of a fly engraved into the porcelain. Prof. BERENBAUM: Exactly. Yes. It looks very realistic. KRULWICH: And where was it? Prof. BERENBAUM: Just to the left, I think, of the drain. KRULWICH: Well, why would they put a fly to the left of a drain? Prof. BERENBAUM: I'm not an expert on urinal structures. KRULWICH: No problem. I found an expert. Professor RICHARD THALER (University of Chicago Business School): So, I don't remember when I saw my first fly in the urinal, but. . . KRULWICH: To be fair, Richard Thaler is not really a urinal art expert; he's a professor of behavioral finance at the University of Chicago Business School. Prof. THALER: Yes. KRULWICH: And he's noticed that fly-bearing urinals are now showing up in more airports and more schools, in more football stadiums all over the world. Prof. THALER: They have been spotted in Moscow and Singapore, JFK. . . KRULWICH: In the new terminal in JFK. And the reason, says May, is because when you emblazon a fly into a urinal, that fly changes human behavior. Or at any rate, the behavior of human males. Prof. BERENBAUM: Having a target - let's see, how do we say? Reduces spillage. KRULWICH: Spillage, yes. That's the term. And spillage in this case would mean what, in the most delicate way you can muster? Prof. BERENBAUM: Misdirected stream? KRULWICH: Misdirected stream, huh. Why would a fly engraving cause men to redirect their stream? Prof. BERENBAUM: Apparently there is a deep-seated instinct to aim at targets in males. KRULWICH: Okay, Richard, you're a male. You agree with her? Prof. THALER: Well, sure, you know. KRULWICH: But doesn't everybody? Certainly everybody with boys knows this. Julie Power, for example, co-founded a blog called Mothers to Work. And she has boys. . . Ms. JULIE POWER (Mothers to Work): Two boys. KRULWICH: Is misdirected stream a problem in your home? Ms. POWER: Yes, it is a problem, Robert, I have lived with, yes. KRULWICH: But in your blog you said you kind of have dealt with the problem, at least for a while. Ms. POWER: What I did was I took a big - I took a red Sharpie and I wrote aim in big red letters on the toilet. KRULWICH: You mean in the bowl? Ms. POWER: In the bowl, on the back of the bowl. KRULWICH: A-I-M? Ms. POWER: A-I-M, like aim here. And then I did a big red circle around it. KRULWICH: And will the boys aim at the circle? Ms. POWER: Yes, they will aim, yes. KRULWICH: So a fixed target is the key or. . . Prof. THALER: Another friend of mine claims that Cheerios are really perfect. You throw one in the middle of the bowl and the boys will aim. KRULWICH: Or for the older boys, there's the middle of the night option. Mr. DOUG KEMPEL (Urinalfly. com): Men evidently hate to turn on the light at night because it blinds them, for whatever reason it is. KRULWICH: That's why Doug Kempel, who runs a business called Urinalfly. com, is about to launch what he calls. . . Mr. KEMPEL: Glow-in-the-dark fly. KRULWICH: Glow-in-the-dark fly? Mr. KEMPEL: That's right. KRULWICH: Drawings you can paste into the toilet and because they glow, you know where to go. Mr. KEMPEL: Yes, that's correct. KRULWICH: But what I don't get is, why is it always a fly? I mean, why not a duck or why not a mammal? Mr. KEMPEL: I don't know. What do you want to pee on? That's kind of the big question. KRULWICH: Well, somebody must've decided that flies have a special attraction. Prof. THALER: I think that the Amsterdam guy really started it. And apparently he's an economist. Mr. AAD KEIBOOM (Deputy Director, Schiphol Airport): No, no, no. KRULWICH: No, no, no. The man who invented etching flies into urinals was not an economist, says Aad Keiboom, deputy director at the Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. The guy was named Jos Van Bedoff. He was a maintenance man at the airport, and he died in the early '90s. But he got the idea when he was a kid way back in the '60s. Mr. KEIBOOM: Yeah, when he was in the army for his military service. KRULWICH: As a soldier, he would, as soldiers often do, go the bathroom. Mr. KEIBOOM: Then he noticed one day that someone had made a dot in the urinal, just a small dot. KRULWICH: But because of that dot, that bathroom was much, much cleaner. So years later he kept that thought in his head and proposed, well, not a dot but a teeny fly. The airport adopted his idea and it worked fabulously. Prof. BERENBAUM: Eighty percent. Spillage on the men's room floor was reduced by 80 percent. KRULWICH: Wow. Is that right? Mr. KEIBOOM: Oh, yeah, yeah. KRULWICH: Yeah, but why did he choose a fly? 'Cause that's your act of genius right there. Mr. KEIBOOM: Because his idea was, and that's what he told me, that that is the animal where men would like to aim for. And if you have him, then you have him really good then he can't fly away anymore. So that's why he came up with the fly. KRULWICH: So guys like flies because we can't beat flies. Well, says May Berenbaum, maybe, but then how do you explain that 100-plus years ago in Britain they put a very different insect into their bowls - with a stinger? Prof. BERENBAUM: In the late 19th century, in fact, Victorian urinals often had little pictures of bees. And this is hilarious if you're an entomologist, because the scientific name, the genus name, of the honeybee is Apis. (Soundbite of laughter) KRULWICH: Some things just can't be explained.

CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: Sinornithosaurus was petite as dinosaurs go - think of a turkey with teeth. It ran with a tough crowd, though. It was cousin to the oh- so-scary velociraptor of \"Jurassic Park\" fame. Paleontologist David Burnham from the University of Kansas and a Chinese colleague were puzzled by a 125- million-year-old Sinornithosaurus in a museum, specifically, by its upper teeth. DAVID BURNHAM: And we finally realized we're looking at the outside of these teeth and they're grooved. And we both look at each other and, you know, what? Why would an animal have grooved teeth? JOYCE: It turns out some venomous snakes and lizards use grooved teeth to deliver poison. Burnham thinks this dinosaur did, too. Besides the teeth, another clue was a cavity in the jawbone where, he suggests, a venom gland could have been. He also found a channel leading from the cavity to ducts near some of the teeth. These teeth are about three inches long. Unlike the hypodermic-type teeth of a viper, they're farther back, where our premolars would be. That's much the same as rear-fanged snakes and lizards living now. Burnham says the teeth and jaw of the animal were too frail for a grab-and-gulp strategy like big carnivores. Instead, it might have employed a grab-and-hold technique, like the Gila monster of the American Southwest. BURNHAM: They grab onto you and they don't let go. So they just get a vise grip on your hand or whatever they can grab from you, and that's enough to get the venom into your tissues. JOYCE: The animal essentially chews the venom into the wound. Burnham describes sinornithosaurus in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. He can't tell what kind of venom the creature might have had. But if it were like the rear-fanged venomous animals alive today, he thinks it would immobilize rather than kill, so its prey could be eaten more leisurely. BURNHAM: They lived in these forests, most probably lived in trees, or hunted from trees anyways. And so anything that they could get a hold of, perhaps a small lizard or mammal as well, would be just fine. JOYCE: The debut of a new kind of dinosaur, especially one so radically endowed, usually brings out skeptics. Paleontologist Tom Holtz of the University of Maryland says he's not convinced yet.

Snarling roads, air traffic, Christmas shopping, and for many of you your holiday travel plans, even if you don't live anywhere near the East Coast. The weather forecasters had it right this time. The Washington Post on Saturday simply said, it will snow all day. But predicting winter weather is a tricky science, and when a promised storm doesn't happen - or worse, when one blows in without warning - the local weatherman often takes the blame. So how accurate could a weather forecast actually be? In a moment, Tom Kierein, meteorologist for Washington, D. C. 's NBC affiliate, joins me to talk about the science behind our favorite complaint: the weather report. But then we want your stories. If you were stuck in an airport yourself or waiting for a parent or sibling or crawling along an interstate, and are you now way behind on your holiday shopping, how did the big storm change your holiday plans? Call us: 800-989-8255. Or you can drop us an email - from the airport if you need to: talk@npr. org. On the line with me now from his home in Maryland is Tom Kierein. I know you've had a very long weekend, Tom, so thanks for being on TALK OF THE NATION. Mr. TOM KIEREIN (Meteorologist): Oh, happy to do it. I love snow. And this is certainly been, nearly an historic event for Washington. It was an historic event. The snow we had on Saturday was the most snow we've had from a single December storm since we've been keeping records way back in the late 1880s. ROBERTS: So, did you get it right? What was your forecast on Friday? Mr. KIEREIN: On Friday, I was saying we were going to get a foot, but we ended up with about double that. So the - and it all depends on the track of the area of low pressure that brought in the moisture off the Atlantic, not only the track, but how deep that pressure system got. And the track just changing 50 miles one way or another can make a dramatic difference in the amounts of snow. So the track of that storm was actually about 50 miles closer to the coastline than we had anticipated on Thursday night and into Friday when I was doing my forecast. So that's why things changed. And in addition, Rebecca, it had to do with the size of the snowflakes, believe it or not, you know? And snowflakes are so beautiful, if you've ever seen one under a microscope, you know, you wonder how could something so exquisitely beautiful cause so much trouble? But actually, these were tiny, little, dry snowflakes, almost like the powder that you get in the Colorado Rockies, you know, that's great skiing type of snow. And we rarely get that type of snow here. So when it did pile up, it piled up very quickly. I mean, normally, we're used to these snowflakes the size of dinner plates that just kind of. . . ROBERTS: Right. Mr. KIEREIN: . . . plop down and land and sort of stack up on each other and press down to the ground. But this sort of just, sort of, very gently built on top of each other. It was half air, I think, when we were taking measurements. ROBERTS: Yeah. It was terrible snowman snow. Mr. KIEREIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. And not good for, yeah, right - snowball fights or any of that. It - but it has sort of turned that way. In fact, the depth of the snow now is about half of what it was on Saturday. That's how fluffy and dry it was. It all just sort of compressed on down, and it has been melting. ROBERTS: So why does it seem that weather predictions are less accurate in the winter? Mr. KIEREIN: Well, winter is the most challenging time to do a weather forecast. And, well, first of all, at the outset, no one can predict the future. We can't. . . ROBERTS: Isn't that your job? (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. KIEREIN: We can only approximate what might happen in the future. And trying to predict what's going to happen in the atmosphere - which, really, is an ultimate wilderness. It's like trying to predict what a wild animal is going to do. But with our advances in our knowledge and the use of all of our wonderful technology, we have actually gotten to the point where we're able to predict the storms, even in the wintertime, with about 70, 80 percent accuracy. So that's just about a nearly passing grade on exam. But it's because of the unpredictable nature of the movement of low pressure when it encounters ocean air masses and land air masses, and that's where we live on the East Coast. We constantly have this battle between the marine environment, as well as the land environment. Sometimes the land environment will win out and sort of push that low pressure farther to the east. Sometimes the ocean environment wins out and pushes that low pressure farther to the west. So we're looking at some very fine, minute changes that can make an enormous difference in the outcome. ROBERTS: So when you talk about that 70, 80 percent accuracy, what timeframe do you mean? Mr. KIEREIN: Well, in a - usually about 48 hours in advance when we have gotten, to this point, certainly, with our advances in the science. That means within 24 to 48 hours in advance that we're within several inches of what we were predicting. So on Friday morning I was saying we were going to get eight to 12 plus. I put a little plus in there and said, well, there is a small chance, if storm track changes, that it would go higher than that. But - and you've probably heard us talk about models, which are nothing more than the solutions to mathematical equations that we can use to actually model the atmosphere. And we plug in all the numbers into the equations, and then the computers do all the calculations. And we have several different models that have different biases and such that we look, OK, at a whole ensemble of different models and say, all right, let's take the average or one of, you know - some of them have a certain bias to the east or some have a certain bias to the west. So it's a matter of really looking at, OK, is the general consensus of all the model output putting the storm in this position? And then we sort of go with that. ROBERTS: So is there an advance in modeling or technology or research that would make forecasts more accurate? Or is it just so inherently changeable and chaotic that there's going to be a point beyond which you can't possibly know? Mr. KIEREIN: Well, that's a great question. We only got samplings of what the atmosphere is doing once per hour at several hundred sites around the United States and some isolated ocean sites. So we only get, like, one freeze frame per hour of what the atmosphere is doing. Of course, the atmosphere is constantly moving and changing. So it's like looking at one frame of a movie and trying to decide what the whole movie is about. So if we could get constant samplings of the atmospheric conditions real time, all of the time and then plug those numbers in running calculations of the models all the time - see, we can run the models every six hours. If we could run them, say, every 20 minutes, then we could reach a point where we could get very, very good with accuracy. But we're still, I think, years away from that. And certainly, it's feasible to do it, sampling from space, and we have the technology. It's a matter of spending the money to do it. ROBERTS: We've talked about don't blame the weatherman for the bad weather, but I imagine in your years of experience, you have taken a fair amount of flack. Mr. KIEREIN: Oh, absolutely. It comes with the job, and I completely understand it because so many plans are disrupted. And people plan their lives based on what the forecast is going to do for outdoor events and weddings and trips and vacations. And I totally understand that. And so that comes with the job. ROBERTS: OK. Tom, can you hang on and answer a quick question from Steve in Provo, Utah? Mr. KIEREIN: Sure. ROBERTS: Steve, you're on the air. STEVE (Caller): Hi. Thanks. There's an old saying around here: big snow, little snow, little snow, big snow, meaning that if the flakes are small, you get a lot of snow. If the flakes are big, you get a little bit of snow. Seems to work, except that sometimes it starts out with big flakes and then goes to little flakes. I'm wondering if there's any meteorological explanation for this. Mr. KIEREIN: Well, it has to do with the amount of available moisture in the atmosphere. Usually, of course, you get the smaller flakes when the atmosphere is very dry. And, of course, you have that in mountain environments. Of course, Provo is a spectacular place for that kind of powder. And you usually have dry conditions there on the lee side of Sierra Nevada and all the way, you know, to the western slopes of the Rockies. You get pockets of some very dry air. They're, of course, sort of a semi-arid region, anyway. So whenever you get that moisture coming in off of the Pacific Ocean, what - a lot of times, most of it will sort of precipitate out over the Sierra Nevada. By the time it crosses the mountains and gets into the desert regions, in the arid regions to the east of Sierra Nevadas, a lot of that moisture's gone. But there - sometimes, there's so much moisture coming in from the Pacific that it eventually does make it all the way there. And there, with the dry air in place, that moisture falls into to the dry air and it makes those flakes much smaller. Now, if you've got a storm that is coming from farther to the south of where you're located, and maybe that storm will pick up some moisture of the Gulf of Mexico, then it's going to be a wetter storm, and that's when you get sort of - some of those bigger, fatter flakes. So it maybe, initially, it may start as big, fat flakes, because there is sort of more moisture. But eventually, that moisture is sort of zapped out of that particular storm system. And then it's -only that gets left is some of the, you know, lighter amounts of moisture in the upper elevations of the atmosphere. Then you get the smaller flakes on top of the big ones. ROBERTS: Tom Keirien is a meteorologist for NBC's Washington, D. C. affiliate. He joined us from his home in Maryland. Thank you so much for being with us. Mr. KIEREIN: Sure. Happy to do it. Stay warm. ROBERTS: Yeah. Good luck shoveling. Mr. KIEREIN: All right. ROBERTS: Of course, you don't actually have to be digging snow to be feeling the pain of this storm. Passengers flying in an out of the East Coast are backed up for days. Go ahead and tell us your story. How has this weather affected your holiday plans? 800-989-8255. Or send us email: talk@npr. org. Let's hear from Linda in Tucson, Arizonan. Linda, you're not in snow country. LINDA (Caller): No. I sure am not. I do work in reservations for an American-based airline. ROBERTS: Oh. So you were busy this weekend? LINDA: Oh, yeah, we were busy. And we just want to let you now that when our planes get backed up and we can't get them out, we do really work our hardest at getting the people out on the flights that we have. And we take no joy in getting delayed. We really want to get to where they're going. But I talked to a lady yesterday, an older lady who had been delayed and been going from one gate to another gate to another gate to try to get New York. And if I could have gone to Chicago and bring her home with me, I would have done that because she was just so exhausted. ROBERTS: Well, how - that's an excellent question. How do you figure out -especially at a time of year like this where so much travel is heavily booked, who can get the few remaining seats if you've got a whole, you know, hundreds of people stuck and such a limited supply? LINDA: Right. As soon as a seat comes open, I grab it. ROBERTS: And who do you determine gets it if you got a whole line of people wanting it? LINDA: I am working with the person that I'm on with - the phone with. When a flight is delayed - anytime a flight is delayed, a passenger needs to get on the phone and call reservations because we can help them better than the gate agents or the people at the airport. We - not that we can help them better, but we can help them faster sometimes. ROBERTS: So even if they're standing in the airport, they should call the 800 number? LINDA: Yes, they should. They should. Because we can go ahead and look for a new flight for them, a new solution for them. We try to work with them and try to get them to maybe a different airport as close to their destination as we can get them to. We really try to bend over backwards and try to get them there because we understand their situation, and it's really important to get them there. ROBERTS: Linda, thank you so much for calling in and for the advice. LINDA: Thank you. ROBERTS: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Let's hear from Robert in Charlotte, North Carolina. Robert, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION. ROBERT (Caller): Hello. How are you doing? ROBERTS: Good. ROBERT: That's good. First of all, I just wanted to thank the weatherman because I thank God that he forecasted right there on the nose. I thank God for the state troopers that was out there on 81 southbound in Virginia. ROBERTS: Oh, you were on the road? ROBERT: Yes. I was on at that time. And I thank God for the paramedics came out, and I thank God for the National Guard. They came out, because it was a crisis. ROBERTS: Did you see a lot of wrecks? ROBERT: Oh, yes. It was a crisis. It was - I've been driving 12 years and, you know, when I - my wife called me and said, honey, you better come on and get home. I was in Vermont at the time, and I was traveling down 81 south, when I finally got on 81. And I said, well, there's no problems, you know. I ran through snow, you know, it's no problem, you know? On 43,000 pounds. I can make it. And, boy, I tell you, when I got - and past Winchester, Virginia, it started getting dark, started getting all cloudy, and I got worried. You know, I was like this stuff is really coming. And I got on in past the - well, what you call Shenandoah Valley. That's when it started coming down and. . . ROBERTS: Oh. ROBERT: . . . and I got a little ways on down. And this was like a blizzard. This stuff was coming down so fast it covered the road in less than an hour and a half, I'd say, two hours. The whole road. . . ROBERTS: Oh, Robert, I do not envy you. (Soundbite of laughter) ROBERT: And there was thousands and thousands of cars backed up - thousands. There was UPS trucks running off the roads. There was FedEx trucks running off the roads. They couldn't get out - they couldn't get up the hills and the mountains. You know, on 81, they got these little valleys, and you go up and you go down, you go up and you go down. ROBERTS: Right. ROBERT: And there were so many cars getting stuck. And we were in traffic just like - just waiting in traffic for hours. ROBERTS: Well, stay safe out there, Robert. Thank you so much for calling in. Let's take a call from Andy in Baltimore. Andy, how are the roads where you are? ANDY (Caller): Hi. Actually, we did really well. We had family fly in from around the country. They came in midweek. We all piled in the vehicles on Saturday or early evening, and all of our family lives pretty close to the highways. And Maryland State Highway Administration did a killer job with the roads. They were great. There was one passable lane on the highway that was, you know, down with the black top in the evening. I mean, the snow is still falling, but they were on top of it. We got 22 and a quarter inches at our house. So - and they were able to keep up with it. They did an excellent job. It took a little longer than normal, but we made it. No problem. ROBERTS: I'm glad to hear it. Thanks, Andy. Let's take a quick call from Dana in Yarmouth, Massachusetts. DANA (Caller): Hi. ROBERTS: Hi, Dana. DANA: Hi. Well, in answer to your question, how it affected my holiday plans. . . ROBERTS: Yup. DANA: . . . it soured me even more on Christmas. (Soundbite of laughter) ROBERTS: Bah humbug to you, Dana. DANA: Absolutely. (Soundbite of laughter) DANA: Well, I think Scrooge would love Christmas these days, but that's beside the point. My - you know, I mean, it made me wish it was the Fourth of July instead of Christmas that was coming up. It just seems like, you know, when all you can do is wiping off the cars, shovel the driveway, you know, struggle what the plow did - well, I do appreciate plow work, though. I do appreciate them making the roads passable. But it's just a pain. I don't know. I just am sour on this time of year, and if I could, I'd move to Costa Rica or California. (Soundbite of laughter) DANA: I'll. . . ROBERTS: Well, try to find some Christmas cheer up there in Massachusetts, Dana. Thank you for calling in. We have an email from Tim in Charlottesville, who says, we've grown so accustomed to wrong weather predictions, we were caught off guard. He didn't pay attention to the weather predictions, but was stunned and happy to see 22 to 28 inches building up. Thank you everyone for calling and writing. And we couldn't get to all of your stories, but dig yourselves out or fix your travel plans if you need to. And tomorrow, Neal Conan is back with a look inside Iran, their nuclear ambitions and their continuing political protests. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Rebecca Roberts in Washington.  REBECCA ROBERTS, host:  But now, if you live anywhere from North Carolina to New England, you might still be digging out from the storm that dumped up to two feet of snow on us this weekend. Snarling roads, air traffic, Christmas shopping, and for many of you your holiday travel plans, even if you don't live anywhere near the East Coast.  The weather forecasters had it right this time. The Washington Post on Saturday simply said, it will snow all day. But predicting winter weather is a tricky science, and when a promised storm doesn't happen - or worse, when one blows in without warning - the local weatherman often takes the blame. So how accurate could a weather forecast actually be?  In a moment, Tom Kierein, meteorologist for Washington, D. C. 's NBC affiliate, joins me to talk about the science behind our favorite complaint: the weather report.  But then we want your stories. If you were stuck in an airport yourself or waiting for a parent or sibling or crawling along an interstate, and are you now way behind on your holiday shopping, how did the big storm change your holiday plans? Call us: 800-989-8255. Or you can drop us an email - from the airport if you need to: talk@npr. org.  On the line with me now from his home in Maryland is Tom Kierein. I know you've had a very long weekend, Tom, so thanks for being on TALK OF THE NATION.  Mr. TOM KIEREIN (Meteorologist): Oh, happy to do it. I love snow. And this is certainly been, nearly an historic event for Washington. It was an historic event. The snow we had on Saturday was the most snow we've had from a single December storm since we've been keeping records way back in the late 1880s.  ROBERTS: So, did you get it right? What was your forecast on Friday?  Mr. KIEREIN: On Friday, I was saying we were going to get a foot, but we ended up with about double that. So the - and it all depends on the track of the area of low pressure that brought in the moisture off the Atlantic, not only the track, but how deep that pressure system got. And the track just changing 50 miles one way or another can make a dramatic difference in the amounts of snow. So the track of that storm was actually about 50 miles closer to the coastline than we had anticipated on Thursday night and into Friday when I was doing my forecast. So that's why things changed.  And in addition, Rebecca, it had to do with the size of the snowflakes, believe it or not, you know? And snowflakes are so beautiful, if you've ever seen one under a microscope, you know, you wonder how could something so exquisitely beautiful cause so much trouble? But actually, these were tiny, little, dry snowflakes, almost like the powder that you get in the Colorado Rockies, you know, that's great skiing type of snow.  And we rarely get that type of snow here. So when it did pile up, it piled up very quickly. I mean, normally, we're used to these snowflakes the size of dinner plates that just kind of. . .  ROBERTS: Right.  Mr. KIEREIN: . . . plop down and land and sort of stack up on each other and press down to the ground. But this sort of just, sort of, very gently built on top of each other. It was half air, I think, when we were taking measurements.  ROBERTS: Yeah. It was terrible snowman snow.  Mr. KIEREIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. And not good for, yeah, right - snowball fights or any of that. It - but it has sort of turned that way. In fact, the depth of the snow now is about half of what it was on Saturday. That's how fluffy and dry it was. It all just sort of compressed on down, and it has been melting.  ROBERTS: So why does it seem that weather predictions are less accurate in the winter?  Mr. KIEREIN: Well, winter is the most challenging time to do a weather forecast. And, well, first of all, at the outset, no one can predict the future. We can't. . .  ROBERTS: Isn't that your job?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. KIEREIN: We can only approximate what might happen in the future. And trying to predict what's going to happen in the atmosphere - which, really, is an ultimate wilderness. It's like trying to predict what a wild animal is going to do. But with our advances in our knowledge and the use of all of our wonderful technology, we have actually gotten to the point where we're able to predict the storms, even in the wintertime, with about 70, 80 percent accuracy. So that's just about a nearly passing grade on exam.  But it's because of the unpredictable nature of the movement of low pressure when it encounters ocean air masses and land air masses, and that's where we live on the East Coast. We constantly have this battle between the marine environment, as well as the land environment. Sometimes the land environment will win out and sort of push that low pressure farther to the east. Sometimes the ocean environment wins out and pushes that low pressure farther to the west. So we're looking at some very fine, minute changes that can make an enormous difference in the outcome.  ROBERTS: So when you talk about that 70, 80 percent accuracy, what timeframe do you mean?  Mr. KIEREIN: Well, in a - usually about 48 hours in advance when we have gotten, to this point, certainly, with our advances in the science. That means within 24 to 48 hours in advance that we're within several inches of what we were predicting. So on Friday morning I was saying we were going to get eight to 12 plus. I put a little plus in there and said, well, there is a small chance, if storm track changes, that it would go higher than that.

So it's a matter of really looking at, OK, is the general consensus of all the model output putting the storm in this position? And then we sort of go with that.  ROBERTS: So is there an advance in modeling or technology or research that would make forecasts more accurate? Or is it just so inherently changeable and chaotic that there's going to be a point beyond which you can't possibly know?  Mr. KIEREIN: Well, that's a great question.

I'm Robert Siegel. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. We all know the idea that time flies when you're having fun but some scientists wondered if the reverse is true. Could you be tricked into thinking you had fun if you were made to believe that time had flown by? NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce explains. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: Fun isn't the only thing that can make time seem to speed up. So does drinking coffee or being on an adrenaline rush. Aaron Sackett is a psychology researcher at the University of St. Thomas in Minneapolis. He wondered whether people's experiences, their sense of having fun or not, might be affected just by how fast time seems to be going by. He wanted to test this but he knew he couldn't change the actual speed of time itself. Dr. AARON SACKETT (Psychology Researcher, University of St. Thomas): What we had to do instead is focus on speeding up or slowing down the perceived, or felt, passage of time from an individual's perspective. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They did this by lying to people. University students would come into the lab. Their cell phones would be turned off, watches taken away, supposedly so they could concentrate on a little task. They were told to read a text and underline all words with double letter combinations, like apple or mammal. Sackett says everyone was going to be doing this task for exactly 10 minutes. Dr. SACKETT: But that's not what we told them. We told half of our participants that they were going to be spending less time than that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They were told: you'll do this for five minutes. The other volunteers were told: you'll do this for 20 minutes. So you can imagine everyone's surprise later on when someone came in and said okay time's up. Dr. SACKETT: For participants who thought that they had only been doing this task for five minutes, what they're thinking is: My gosh, those five minutes seemed to last forever. It felt more like, say, maybe 10. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Meanwhile, the people who thought they'd been working for 20 minutes. Dr. SACKETT: They're thinking, geez, those 20 minutes really breezed by. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Then Sackett and his colleagues asked people how much they enjoyed this mundane task, and guess what. Dr. SACKETT: People who thought that they spent 20 minutes on this 10-minute task, for whom those 20 minutes, in their mind, flew by, rated the task as much more enjoyable, as more fun, and just overall more positively than did participants who felt as though time dragged by. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The team did some additional experiments to make sure this effect was real. To see if fun things could be made even more fun, the researchers had people pick their favorite song. As they listened, a little clock on the music player counted the seconds. But this timer was secretly rigged \ufffd either sped up or slowed down. Dr. SACKETT: When we instigated this sense that time flew by while they were listening to the song, they rated it even more positively than they otherwise would have. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The sense of time flying by also seemed to make annoying things less annoying. For example, the researchers misled people about how long they'd be listening to some unpleasant sounds. Dr. SACKETT: When time dragged by there people hated it and rated it really negatively. But in the time-flies condition, they just sort of slightly disliked it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The question is, why? Sackett suspected that when people were surprised by the way time flew, they just assumed that they must have been having fun. Here's how he tested this theory. He again did that same experiment with people underlining certain words. But this time he had people wear earplugs. Then it was casually suggested to some of them that earplugs might affect a person's sense of time. It turned out that for those people, there was no time-flies effect. Dr. SACKETT: It was like they no longer needed to make that attribution that time was flying, I must have had fun. Instead they said to themselves, well, time was flying because I had earplugs in. GREENFIELDBOYCE: A report on these studies is being published in the journal Psychological Science. Larry Sanna is a psychology researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He says these time-flies studies are clever and novel but it's not clear yet if the findings will have any practical applications. Mr. LARRY SANNA (Psychology Researcher, University of North Carolina): Does this have implications for marketing? Does it have implications when you're going to the dentist and, you know, wish that time would move faster? Does it have implications for people who just like to live their life at a faster pace? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Here's one implication. We're often sad when a holiday or a vacation is over all too soon. It seemed to fly by so fast. But, of course, this research suggests that is actually part of why we remember having enjoyed it. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

I'm Michele Norris. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. During the holiday season, we see a lot of images that cannot be found in nature: flying reindeer, sugarplum fairies and geometrically incorrect snowflakes. Well, one scientist has gotten tired of the snowflake problem. NPR's Jon Hamilton talked with him about his efforts to correct the record. JON HAMILTON: Thomas Koop is a chemist who thinks ice crystals are masterpieces of natural beauty. Unfortunately, he says. . . Professor THOMAS KOOP (Bielefeld University, Germany): This beauty is sometimes corrupted. HAMILTON: By artists, especially at this time of year, when a blizzard of snowflake images sweeps through advertisements and store displays and greeting cards. Koop, who is a professor at Bielefeld University in Germany, says the problem is that many of these images show ice crystals with five sides or eight sides. In other words, he says, they are scientific abominations. Prof. KOOP: Since I'm a chemist, I know what the crystal structure of ice typically is. And therefore, I know that there's no way of having pentagonal or octagonal ice crystals. And therefore, such snow crystals shouldn't exist in nature - and they don't. HAMILTON: Koop says snowflakes can assemble ice crystals into all kinds of complex shapes, but the crystals themselves will usually have six sides. Prof. KOOP: The reason is because the molecular building blocks are water molecules. So there's only a certain way they can fit together. And what comes out is that they are always in a six-cornered shape, even at the tiniest molecular scale. HAMILTON: Actually, water molecules occasionally form ice crystals with three or 12 sides, either half or double the usual number, but never five or eight. Koop says he'd been pretty much ignoring this season's predictable onslaught of fake snowflakes until he saw a wintry ad for the online version of the scientific journal Nature. Prof. KOOP: And that was entitled: For Anyone Who Loves Science. But all the snow crystals depicted in that advert were octagonal. HAMILTON: Koop responded with a letter that offers a sort of snowflake manifesto. It calls for a campaign to melt away faux flakes. And it asks people to spend part of their holidays discussing the true beauty of science preferably over a mug of hot punch. Koop's letter appears in the printed version of the journal Nature.

Dr. ROLAND KANAAR (Erasmus University, Holland): And in two weeks in, I was sent to the University of California, Berkeley. PALCA: There was technique scientists at Berkeley had developed that Roland needed to learn for his graduate research. When he got to Berkeley, he went to work in a lab in Stanley Hall.

Carol Greider was hot on the trail of an enzyme that was crucial for cells to keep dividing. Finding it would be a major breakthrough. So there was Roland slaving away in the lab. . . Dr. KANAAR: For the four months I was there, I worked every day. PALCA: And every day or almost every day, he would check on Greider's work. Dr. KANAAR: Except I didn't work one day. Of those four months, I skipped Christmas Day in 1984. PALCA: And it was Christmas Day, 1984 - 25 years ago - that Greider had the eureka moment, the first proof that she had found her enzyme. It was a moment so important that it won Greider a share of this year's Nobel Prize in Medicine. And Roland missed it. He wasn't the only one. Greider was alone in the lab that day.

There are hundreds of these homegrown scientists, and many do highly specialized research on DNA sequencing and experiments with live bacteria. Jason Bobe is the co-founder of a group called DIYbio. DIY stands for do it yourself. And his group promotes exchanges between these citizen scientists. Mr. JASON BOBE (Co-Founder, DIYbio): These tools that have been only accessible to institutional scientists and big government labs, like DNA sequencing, they're cheap enough that now, individuals can start asking questions about things that may not be of interest to an academic scientist. And I think that we can have a renaissance in discovery. RAZ: And so, are most of the people who are sort of these citizen scientists, I mean, are they actual scientists, or are they amateurs? Mr. BOBE: It's actually a wide range of different types of people. There are quite a few graduate students and professional scientists who moonlight as a citizen scientist. And we're actually starting to see groups in various cities setting up laboratory space that's a shared laboratory. They sort of pull their resources like clay potters have done with kilns or woodworkers have done with expensive lathes. RAZ: Hmm. So I want to ask you about some of the projects that researchers are working on. I want to ask you about one in particular called the BioWeatherMap. I guess it involves taking cotton swabs to the buttons of crosswalks. Can you tell me about it? Mr. BOBE: We first initially chose crosswalk buttons to actually identify what bacteria are moving through a city because they're laid out already in a grid. And if you were to go back and swab those crosswalk buttons over time, say, once a week or once a month, you could actually see the temporal and geographic variation of bacteria in a city and more or less see how the bacteria move through cities over time like weather patterns. RAZ: That's incredible. That's absolutely fascinating. Have you started to get any data so far from the project? Mr. BOBE: The crosswalk buttons have failed. We have been unable to actually extract DNA from crosswalk buttons. We don't know why. We think it may be because the sunlight is actually a good disinfectant and many of them are stainless steel buttons, and it hasn't been a really good source. But we actually have been able to amplify DNA from a variety of just about every surface in the household: dollar bills, used toothbrushes, doorknobs, ATM buttons. So what we're doing now is basically building a list of surfaces and environmental samples that we want to start probing and saying, hey, what lives there? Is it stable throughout the year, or does it change? RAZ: It sounds a little bit like the age of wonder, you know, the scientific romantic age at the end of the 18th century where there was that kind of do-it-yourself ethic as well. Mr. BOBE: Right. It's actually - in some sense, we're returning to some of the roots of biology, where scientists had laboratories in their parlors. You know, it was parlor science. It was something that didn't actually happen often in institutional settings; it was something that happened at home. RAZ: Jason Bobe, is it easy to get all the chemicals and the materials you need to do research like this? Like, if you want to work on DNA, is that something you can just order online, you know, relatively cheaply? Mr. BOBE: You can, and it depends what you're looking for. A lot of the things that people are doing today are actually kits, kits that are designed for, say, high school biology teachers. So for example, the New York City DIYbio group actually bought what's called a bacterial transformation kit, and what this kit actually allowed them to do was to insert a jellyfish gene into a bacteria called E. coli, and this actually makes the E. coli glow. RAZ: Now, of course, when I hear E. coli, when people listening to this story hear E. coli, they think that's not safe. Mr. BOBE: That's right. RAZ: I mean, how dangerous is this? I mean, these are people doing these experiments at home. They're not in controlled labs. They're not in university settings. I mean, should we be worried? Mr. BOBE: Well, E. coli's been used since about 1922. It's a particular type of E. coli that is safe and generally recognized as safe. Now, there are a lot of questions, thinking on a long-term basis, that as biotechnology is domesticated and there is, you know, more powerful techniques and experimentation available to individuals about which types of activities are best left to the institutions and which types of activities can actually be adopted by an entrepreneur in a garage. RAZ: Right. Mr. BOBE: And there are really clear lines, some that are obvious, you know, like, you know, dangerous organisms should obviously be left to institutional settings, you know, dealing with pathogens and things like that. We need to find some way to structure this access in a way that we can mitigate risks and promote innovation and allow people to explore their curiosity. RAZ: That's Jason Bobe. He's the co-founder of DIYbio. It's a group that promotes exchanges between citizen scientists. He joined me from member station WBUR in Boston. Jason, thanks so much. Mr. BOBE: Thanks.

James Peret, a mechanical engineer, thought that was both wasteful and expensive. So he came up with the Vegawatt. It's a small generator that sits out back, behind the restaurant's kitchen door, and it turns that grease into energy, energy to power the restaurant. Now, all this month, we've been looking at some of the clever inventions of 2009, and James Peret joins me to talk about his. Welcome to the program. Mr. JAMES PERET (Founder, Owl Power Company): Thank you. RAZ: So how does it work? How does your machine work? Mr. PERET: Well, our machine filters out all of the food crumbs, the beer-battered shrimp and onion rings and the gunk that you mentioned earlier. It heats it up to a point where the engine, which is a standard diesel engine or an industrial diesel engine, can utilize the oil. Diesel engine turns a generator head, which produces electricity, which then is fed back into the restaurant. The diesel engine also produces a lot of heat, and the restaurant can use that to produce hot water or for space heating. There's an added benefit there. So we've harnessed that for the restaurant. Our overall efficiency is actually around 70 percent. RAZ: So presumably, that could save them a lot of money in energy bills. Mr. PERET: Oh, exactly. We can save them, you know, 10,000, $20,000 a year. RAZ: Now, how many restaurants are using the Vegawatt so far? Mr. PERET: Right now, we have three locations in place. We have orders for an additional three. RAZ: And these are restaurants that do mostly fried foods? Mr. PERET: These are all types of restaurants. You know, oil is a very expensive resource for a restaurant. They want to get as much life out of it as possible. And now we have a device that we can sell to restaurants, where restaurants are very motivated to put all of their oil into the device because they own it, and they get the benefit of it. RAZ: Now, I've heard about people using used vegetable oil to run their cars. Is this basically the same principle? Mr. PERET: It's a quantum leap from that principle. Biodiesel is a chemical conversion of vegetable oil into a transesterified product. We don't undergo a chemical conversion. Instead of altering the chemistry of the fuel, we alter the engine so that it inherently can burn the raw fuel. RAZ: So, now, I guess one of the added benefits that you would get from the machine is that you would always have this wonderful smell of French fries wafting from the back of the restaurant. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. PERET: You do have that wonderful smell of French fries, but unfortunately, standing next to the system, usually, they're located in dumpster corrals. So it smells like dumpster. RAZ: Like dumpster and French fries and tempura shrimp? Mr. PERET: It really depends on the menu options of the restaurant of what the dumpster smells like. RAZ: I think you should market this to funnel-cake makers. (Soundbite of laughter) RAZ: That's James Peret. He is the inventor of the Vegawatt. It's a generator that turns the used oil from a restaurant's deep fryer and sends it right back into the restaurant as electricity. He joined us from his home in Massachusetts.

A team of researchers found that the plume of hot and molten rock that feeds the volcano rises from a depth of more than 400 miles below the earth's surface. And the reservoir that holds that molten rock, well, it's 20 percent larger than we once knew. University of Utah geophysicist Robert Smith led that team and joins us from member station KUER in Salt Lake City. Welcome to the program. Professor ROBERT SMITH (Geology and Geophysics, University of Utah; Geophysicist): Thank you. Glad to be here. RAZ: Can you put this supervolcano into a perspective for us? I mean, how have its past eruptions compared to, you know, a volcano like Mount St. Helens? Prof. SMITH: Well, recall that Yellowstone National Park, of course, is the quintessential geology park with hot springs and geysers. They derive their heat from magma from an active volcanic system that has been in the Yellowstone area active for about two million years. In the two-million-year span, there's been three giant eruptions. And these, you know, occurred, well, two million years, 1. 3 million and 640,000 years ago. And in between these eruptions and since the last one, there's been smaller eruptions, many much bigger than those of Mount St. Helens. RAZ: Now, Professor Smith, presumably, you and your team could not start digging underground to find this magma chamber and actually measure it because you wouldn't be speaking to us now, how did you actually figure this out? Prof. SMITH: Well, we use a method called seismic tomography, which is similar to a CAT scan of a human body. RAZ: Mm-hmm. Prof. SMITH: And we measure the speed of earthquake-produced waves that propagate through the earth. And we record them on a large array of seismographs at the surface. And when a seismic wave, just like a sound wave I'm talking to you is a seismic wave, if it's speeded up or slowed down by the rock material, and hot rock produces generally lower speeds of sound than cold rocks, and so what we then do is record, you know, literally thousands of earthquakes and do a computer reconstruction of where they were slowed down or speeded up. And from that, we can construct an image. We're illuminating a body just like turning on a light or like taking a CAT scan or an X-ray. RAZ: Now, there are two components to this, right? I mean, there's the magma chamber, which is 20 percent larger. Prof. SMITH: Right. RAZ: But then there's this volcanic plume that is about 400 miles below the earth's surface, below - actually below the town of Wisdom, Montana, which is, what, about 100 miles from Yellowstone? Prof. SMITH: Yeah, that discovery we've made in the sense that most people had originally implied that plumes in the earth, they're just vertical features like boiling water in a teapot. And what we found is, in fact, it's tilted because the Earth's mantle is moving at a few centimeters per year, and it's tilted because the hot material is caught in the wind of the mantle. I'd like to use the analogy you see smoke rising, and when it gets into a breeze, it gets slightly tilted by the breeze. Well, that's what's happening in the Earth's mantle beneath the Yellowstone area. RAZ: So, any reaction from the folks in Wisdom, Montana? I mean, are they sort of preparing to become a vacation destination in the next million years or so?

Some say they hold the potential for medical miracles. Others claim it's a moral abomination to use them. Either way, human embryonic stem cells captured headlines in the past decade in a way few areas of scientific research have before. NPR's Joe Palca looks at the policies under three presidents. JOE PALCA: Embryonic stem cells have remarkable properties. They can grow indefinitely in the lab, and they can turn into any cell type in the body. But to get them, you must destroy an embryo. Scientists first showed that it was possible to grow human embryonic stem cells in 1998. Under normal circumstances, other scientists would have rushed in to study the new cells. But there was a problem. Because of congressional restrictions, federal money couldn't be used for research that harms an embryo. President Bill Clinton interpreted that to mean scientists could use federal money to study embryonic stem cells once they were growing in the lab, provided they used private money to create them. But before President Clinton's decision took effect, George W. Bush became president. One of his first acts as president was to put that decision on hold so he could reconsider it. In August 2001, the new president decided that despite his finding the research morally troubling. . . President GEORGE W. BUSH: I have concluded that we should allow federal funds to be used for research on these existing stem cell lines where the life and death decision has already been made. PALCA: The existing stem cell lines turned out to be a dozen or so lines that had already been made using non-federal dollars. They were made from embryos that would have been discarded by fertility clinics. The decision pleased no one. Scientists were upset by the restrictions. Critics of the research were upset the president had allowed any federal money to be spent on embryonic stem cells. Both sides went to work to change the policy. A bipartisan Congress voted to ease federal restrictions. President Bush vetoed the legislation. Congressional opponents continued to push for a total ban on the research. And states got into the fray. In California, voters authorized spending $3 billion over 10 years for embryonic stem cell research Candidate Barack Obama promised to ease the Bush administration's restrictions, a promise President Obama made good on in March. President BARACK OBAMA: Today, with the executive order I am about to sign, we will bring the change that so many scientists and researchers, doctors and innovators, patients and loved ones have hoped for and fought for these past eight years. We will lift the ban on federal funding for promising embryonic stem cell research. (Soundbite of applause) PALCA: Of course it wasn't really a ban, just restrictions. But the scientists attending Mr. Obama's speech were clearly jubilant. So where does all the political to-ing and fro-ing leave the research? Dr. LEN ZON (Stem Cell Researcher, Children's Hospital in Boston): Well, I think we're in to an exciting period of time. PALCA: Len Zon is a stem cell researcher at Children's Hospital in Boston. He says there's a lot of exciting basic research being done with embryonic stem cells, but using them to treat patients? Dr. ZON: I think that's still a ways off. Although there are some initial studies that the FDA is considering, I think we still need to figure out how to make these cells in a more efficient and effective way, and I think that's going to take still awhile. You know, you have to remember the stem cell field is only 10 years old at this moment. PALCA: Zon points out it's frequently two decades or more before new medical technologies find their way into patients. More immediate, Zon thinks, is finding new drug therapies using a technique made possible by a Japanese researcher named Shinya Yamanaka. He found a way to take ordinary skin cells and turn them into cells that behave just like embryonic stem cells, but without destroying an embryo. The new technique gives scientists unprecedented abilities. For example, they can take cells from a patient with a disease and convert them into these embryonic stem cell-like cells that can grow indefinitely in the lab. Zon thinks this will change the way scientists understand diseases. Dr. ZON: I think that it's going to be possible in certain cases to alter the disease itself with chemicals. PALCA: And if a particular chemical can repair diseased cells in the lab, then it may be possible to turn that chemical into a drug to treat patients. But even though these new cells offer great promise, Zon says research using cells derived from human embryos is still essential. Dr. ZON: Because these new stem cells from the skin have to be compared to a golden standard and the golden standard is the embryonic stem cells. PALCA: So for the time being, at least, scientists will continue to do research on embryonic stem cells now in a more permissive environment. Joe Palca, NPR News, Washington.

President BARACK OBAMA: Today, with the executive order I am about to sign, we will bring the change that so many scientists and researchers, doctors and innovators, patients and loved ones have hoped for and fought for these past eight years. We will lift the ban on federal funding for promising embryonic stem cell research.  (Soundbite of applause)  PALCA: Of course it wasn't really a ban, just restrictions. But the scientists attending Mr. Obama's speech were clearly jubilant. So where does all the political to-ing and fro-ing leave the research?  Dr. LEN ZON (Stem Cell Researcher, Children's Hospital in Boston): Well, I think we're in to an exciting period of time.  PALCA: Len Zon is a stem cell researcher at Children's Hospital in Boston. He says there's a lot of exciting basic research being done with embryonic stem cells, but using them to treat patients?  Dr. ZON: I think that's still a ways off. Although there are some initial studies that the FDA is considering, I think we still need to figure out how to make these cells in a more efficient and effective way, and I think that's going to take still awhile. You know, you have to remember the stem cell field is only 10 years old at this moment.  PALCA: Zon points out it's frequently two decades or more before new medical technologies find their way into patients.  More immediate, Zon thinks, is finding new drug therapies using a technique made possible by a Japanese researcher named Shinya Yamanaka. He found a way to take ordinary skin cells and turn them into cells that behave just like embryonic stem cells, but without destroying an embryo.  The new technique gives scientists unprecedented abilities. For example, they can take cells from a patient with a disease and convert them into these embryonic stem cell-like cells that can grow indefinitely in the lab. Zon thinks this will change the way scientists understand diseases.  Dr. ZON: I think that it's going to be possible in certain cases to alter the disease itself with chemicals.  PALCA: And if a particular chemical can repair diseased cells in the lab, then it may be possible to turn that chemical into a drug to treat patients. But even though these new cells offer great promise, Zon says research using cells derived from human embryos is still essential.  Dr. ZON: Because these new stem cells from the skin have to be compared to a golden standard and the golden standard is the embryonic stem cells.  PALCA: So for the time being, at least, scientists will continue to do research on embryonic stem cells now in a more permissive environment.  Joe Palca, NPR News, Washington.

Only eight are known to exist and four of them were at a zoo in the Czech Republic. They've been shipped to Kenya, where scientists hope they'll get down to the business of breeding. Nick Wadhams was there when the animals arrived in Nairobi. NICK WADHAMS: It is 3:30 in the morning at Nairobi's main airport when a 747 jet lands with eight tons with an extremely rare animal - two male and two female northern white rhinoceros - packed in wooden crates and lying on straw. These rhinos are headed to the Old Pejeta Conservancy near Mount Kenya to see if the climate and the terrain will encourage them to get breeding. Amish Curry directs the Back to Africa program, which helps return zoo animals to the wild. He prowls the tarmac, directing trucks, tractors and a giant crane - the animals come off the plane. Mr. AMISH CURRY (Director, Back to Africa Program): The trip went very well. They're all relaxed; all, in fact, very settled; but obviously we want to get them on the road as soon as possible and reduce their stress. So, the trucks are waiting now and we're going to load two onto a truck with a crane, fasten them down and get out of here. WADHAMS: When no one is looking, I climb atop one of the crates and peek in. A dank, musty stink rises from the rhino which is lying down and asleep. From this angle, it looks like a giant, one-ton slug. (Soundbite of clicking) WADHAMS: It takes three hours for a staff of dozens to place the crates on two flatbed trucks, and we're off on a 200-mile journey north, to the shadows of Mount Kenya. (Soundbite of truck engine) WADHAMS: The rhinos were sent to Kenya in a desperate effort to save their subspecies, which was hunted to extinction by poachers in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. No northern whites have been seen in the wild since 2005. Dana Holeckova is the Czech zoo director who pushed for the relocation. Unlike other rhinos, northern whites breed poorly in captivity. That might have to do with the small zoo enclosures where they live, and these animals will be released into a fenced off, 1000-acre slice of the conservancy. Ms. DANA HOLECKOVA (Zoo Director): In captivity, we bred successfully and (unintelligible) rhino. But of the white rhinos, they are bred only seldom and nobody knows why. And I'm sure (unintelligible) this program. (Unintelligible). The possibility to start is right here. It's more and more better. And this is why this is the last chance for survival, the last chance for the normal breeding, the last chance for the rhino (unintelligible). WADHAMS: Hours later, it's time at last to release the rhinos into their new pens. Journalists scurry around a crate that dangles and sways from chains held by a rusty crane. Scientists have high hope for this rhino - a nine-year-old female named Fatu, who is in perfect health. When handlers open her crate door, Fatu panics. (Soundbite of rhino snorting) WADHAMS: She wheezes and snorts for her mother, who has already been offloaded. Jan Szarek, Fatu's keeper, who flew in from the Czech Republic, coaxes her out with lullabies and a crust of brown bread. (Soundbite of rhino snorting) WADHAMS: It is panicky media saturated scenes like this that some scientists fear. Some rhino conservation groups refuse to back the project because of its costs - well into the hundreds of thousands of dollars and because they thought the trip might kill the animals. All in their pens at last, the rhinos seem calm. That's partly thanks to Barry White, a British rhino handler who helped get the animals used to their crates in the Czech Republic and came along for the journey. She's been dubbed The Rhino Whisperer for her way with the animals. Ms. BARRY WHITE (Rhino Handler): They do love a lot of fuss and attention and -like horses really, and they really respond to it. So, it's been a lot of what we've been doing really - just making a big fuss of them over the last month. Yeah, rhinos respond well to love and being scratched. So, the whole name of the game is to make them as chilled out as possible. And, so, yeah, that's what I'm doing. WADHAMS: Whatever she did, it seems to have worked. After the frenzy is over, a rhino named Suni snuffles around his pen munching hay and checking out photographers on the other side of a wooden fence. The question now is whether the females of his own species will express the same interest in him. For NPR News, I'm Nick Wadhams at Old Pejeta in Kenya.

I'm Robert Siegel. And now the final installment of our occasional series Shifting Ground about America's changing landscape. This is the story of a widow, a farm and a final request. Independent producer David Baron spent two years following one landowner's efforts to use her own death as a way to preserve the land she loves. DAVID BARON: Joan Graham has been on this earth 80 years. And in that time, she's acquired a number of things: Two artificial hips, two husbands whom she outlived, a 157-acre parcel of Michigan woods and farmland and a passion for the outdoors. Ms. JOAN GRAHAM: I just like the earth. I like the smell of it, and I like green, and I like trees. BARON: She plants trees around her farmhouse. Ms. GRAHAM: This is a tulip tree. BARON: She tends them. Ms. GRAHAM: Those are walnut trees. BARON: So she wasn't happy when, a few years ago, trees started coming down on the lot across the road. Ms. GRAHAM: It's going to be a subdivision. I hate to think of what it's going to look like. BARON: To protect her land, Joan Graham decided to bequeath it to a local conservation group. The group promised not to develop the property after she's gone. But then she thought, why should she have to go? So she made the following request: When she dies, she wants to be buried on her property beneath an oak. Ms. GRAHAM: They have deep taproots. Well, wouldn't it be nice if that oak tree would ever reach my remains, and the tree would take nourishment from that? And it's kind of like, well, I never died, really. I just morphed into a tree or something. BARON: But her request to the conservation group, the Six Rivers Regional Land Conservancy, didn't end there. Donna Folland is the group's executive director. Ms. DONNA FOLLAND (Executive Director, Six Rivers Regional Land Conservancy): She said that she would like to share it. She would welcome others who would want to be buried there. BARON: On the farm. Ms. FOLLAND: On the farm, yeah. BARON: Had you ever had a property owner make this request to you? Ms. FOLLAND: No. No. It was brand new. BARON: And it was not exactly uncontroversial. Joan Graham's proposal was to turn a portion of the farm into a highly unusual cemetery: an environmentally friendly one with no embalming, no fertilized lawn, just bodies interred in biodegradable caskets or shrouds with rocks and trees as grave markers. Donna Folland brought the idea to her board. Ms. FOLLAND: The first reactions varied from, oh, that sounds lovely - just an immediate warming to it - to people who thought it was pretty kooky, like maybe we shouldn't be engaged with crazy ideas like that. BARON: But the more Folland thought about the idea, the more excited she grew. You see, one of the challenges of conservation is getting the public to feel invested in protecting land. Folland realized that burying bodies on the farm would make the land sacred, a place people would always want to preserve. But was this plan legal? How would she do it? Mr. THOMAS LYNCH (Funeral Director): Hey, Donna. Ms. FOLLAND: Nice to meet you. I'm Donna. Mr. LYNCH: Tom Lynch. Pleasure - have a seat. Ms. FOLLAND: Thanks. BARON: For advice, she sought out a prominent Michigan funeral director, Thomas Lynch. They sat in his office, a formal room with dark wood and subdued light. Mr. LYNCH: So you want to take a natural field. . . Ms. FOLLAND: Mm-hmm. Mr. LYNCH: . . . woods and just say, let's put our dead in here. And by doing so, we're sort of upping the conservancy ante. Ms. FOLLAND: Mm-hmm. Mr. LYNCH: Because once people are buried there, they're disinclined to put, you know, a bookstore there. Ms. FOLLAND: Yes, I believe so. Mr. LYNCH: That makes good sense. BARON: Lynch said no laws barred the idea. Bodies don't have to be embalmed, for instance. But any cemetery would have to meet state regulations. Donna Folland came away energized, but cautious. Ms. FOLLAND: It's not something that I would be able to do on my own and that our conservancy certainly would want to do. We need other partners to be in the lead with certain details. BARON: She contacted an organization called the Green Burial Council. It's trying to jumpstart a movement toward more environmentally-friendly cemeteries in the U. S. The group's founder, Joe Sehee, came to Michigan, met with Joan Graham on her farm and agreed to help with the project. Mr. JOE SEHEE (Founder, Green Burial Council): It's a beautiful gift that Joan is giving to a lot of people. Her last act on earth could be incredibly meaningful and could do a lot of wonderful things for a lot of years. BARON: Sehee said what the land conservancy needed was a partner in the cemetery business, and he had an idea. Mr. SEHEE: Based on our preliminary research, it seems like one of the most promising possibilities is a partnership with the township. Mr. MIKE NOLAN (Attorney, Metamora Township): Joan, my name is Mike Nolan. I'm the attorney for Metamora Township. In the room with me is. . . BARON: With Joe Sehee on the phone, the conservancy's Donna Folland sat down with local officials last year. She provided some background. Ms. FOLLAND: This is a photograph of part of the area where the burial ground is proposed to be in. BARON: Then Joe Sehee made a pitch: What if the township operated the burial ground as an annex to its existing cemetery? He argued the new green cemetery would help protect the land and it could bring revenue to the town. Mr. SEHEE: If we use the figure of $3,300 per plot, we see $2. 3 million coming from that. BARON: The presentation didn't go over well. Township officials declined to speak on tape, but they weren't sold on the concept. Bodies buried in the woods? What if a loved one visiting a grave tripped over a fallen log? Who'd be liable? And Donna Folland says officials were skeptical of the finances. Ms. FOLLAND: I could see their side of things. I mean, I think we have to show them more than theoretical numbers that it, you know, was going to work. So they were not interested in taking on that responsibility. BARON: Donna Folland kept looking for partners. She courted private cemetery operators. Some seemed interested at first, but they too weren't sure in the end that they could make the concept work as a business. Now, more than two years since Joan Graham made her request, Donna Folland says fulfilling it has proved surprisingly difficult. Ms. FOLLAND: The details are a lot more complicated than I ever expected. BARON: But Donna Folland hasn't given up and neither has Joan Graham. Ms. GRAHAM: I'm determined to go ahead with it. BARON: Though, she has changed tactics slightly. She threw a party this fall -an afternoon of wine and hayrides and singalongs by the barn. (Soundbite of party) Unidentified Man #1: (Singing in foreign language) Unidentified Woman #1: (Singing in foreign language) BARON: It was a harvest festival, but with another purpose. You see, even if Joan Graham can't make a formal green cemetery a reality, she can establish a tiny, private one. So, that's the plan now, in essence, a family plot up the hill by the woodlot. At the party she recruited volunteers. Ms. GRAHAM: I wouldn't mind if other people joined me up there as long as they're willing to be a flower or a tree. BARON: Her friends were charmed. Unidentified Woman #2: I'm going to be a candidate. I am. BARON: And among the most enthusiastic volunteers was Donna Folland from the land conservancy. Ms. FOLLAND: If there was a place for me, that would be good. I would like that for myself. BARON: After two years trying to sell the concept of green burial, she says she's sold on it herself.

I'm Michele Norris. MELISSA BLOCK, host: And I'm Melissa Block. A new federal rule has angered fishermen in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. The rule, which took effect today, is a ban on fishing for red snapper. That's one of the most popular saltwater fish. Federal agencies and environmental groups say that in the South Atlantic, the red snapper is in trouble. And along with the ban, officials propose temporarily closing a huge area to virtually all fishing. NPR's Greg Allen has the story. GREG ALLEN: To people who don't fish or live in the Southeast, it might seem like a lot of fuss over one species. But in fishing communities like St. Augustine, Florida, the red snapper is more than just a fish. It's the reason thousands of anglers come here each year to fish on their own or to go out with charter boat captains like Robert Johnson. Captain ROBERT JOHNSON: In all honesty, I can tell you that snapper fishing is better today than it was 10 years ago. ALLEN: Robert Johnson has fished for red snapper here, off the eastern coast of Florida, for nearly 30 years. When his charter business slows down, he also fishes for them commercially. He just returned from a day trip where he and his mate used hook and line to catch nearly 100 red snapper, now packed on ice. Johnson reaches into a cooler and pulls one out. Capt. JOHNSON: He's probably 24, 25 inches, about six, seven pounds. That's about an average size snapper. We do catch 20 and 30-pound fish, though. ALLEN: That's a key point. Red snapper can live to 50 years old and grow to 20 pounds or more. Fish that old and big are very rare, though, a clear indication, scientists say, of how much they've been overfished. Today, the National Marine Fisheries Service estimates the population of red snapper off the Atlantic Coast is just three percent of what it was 60 years ago. Because of that, the service has put in place a six-month interim ban on fishing for red snapper with an option to extend it further. Regional administrator for the National Marine Fisheries Service in the Southeast is Roy Crabtree. He says the science leaves little doubt the population of red snapper in the South Atlantic has been severely depleted. Dr. ROY CRABTREE (Regional Administrator, National Marine Fisheries Service): I think the only real debate is the extent of the overfishing. But I don't believe there is a whole lot of scientific debate about whether the stock is undergoing overfishing or overfished. ALLEN: Robert Johnson and others in the recreational fishing industry question the methodology used to estimate the red snapper population. Their doubts are supported by the National Research Council, which has called into question the government's process for estimating catches and fish populations. Johnson believes that while red snapper have been overfished, limits on catches have done a lot in recent years to help rebuild the species. Capt. JOHNSON: They still keep claiming we're fishing at eight times the sustainable rate, and I just don't see that being true. If that was the case, then we would see the stock in our catch per unit effort, the amount of fish we're catching per trip would fall. It would not be consistently the same over the last 10 years and it definitely wouldn't be getting better. ALLEN: For Robert Johnson, there's a lot at stake. He says at least 60 percent of his customers come out to fish for red snapper or other bottom species like grouper, also now off-limits. And even more alarming than the red snapper ban is another proposal now being considered. It would close some 10,000 square miles of the Atlantic, from North Carolina to Florida, to virtually all fishing. Johnson says that will likely put him and the two dozen other charter captains here in St. Augustine out of business and take a toll on the restaurants, hotels and others in town who benefit from the influx of anglers. Holly Binns with the Pew Environment Group's campaign to end overfishing in the Southeast says people who want to fish will still have other options. Ms. HOLLY BINNS (Pew Environment Group): I think it's important to keep in mind that 80 percent of what recreational fishermen caught in the waters off the coast of these four states last year will still be open for fishing. ALLEN: Binns concedes, however, that communities in areas like St. Augustine that depend on red snapper will be the hardest hit. That's something Dave Workman already knows. Mr. DAVE WORKMAN (Owner, Strike Zone): I can get sentimental real quick about this. My father started taking me fishing at six years old. It was a big deal. I mean, it's a legacy. And they're talking about completely shutting down fishing completely. ALLEN: Workman owns the Strike Zone, a fishing outfitter in Jacksonville that carries everything from reels and tackle to kayaks. He says customers have already stopped buying fishing tackle, and he expects business to get much worse once the red snapper ban goes into effect. Like others in the industry, Workman thinks the government has greatly underestimated the ban's economic impact. Mr. WORKMAN: The total amount is - it'd be $3 million for the state of Florida. And they said 10 percent of that will be the tackle retailers. That's $300,000. Between my two stores, it'll cost more than that in the yearly sales. ALLEN: A group called the Recreational Fishing Alliance has filed a lawsuit seeking to block the red snapper ban from taking effect on January 4th as planned. Federal regulators may decide whether to approve the larger area ban when it meets in March. Meanwhile, a bipartisan group in Congress from coastal districts is working on a bill that would require federal regulators to consider the impact on local economies before ordering fishery closings in the future.

A new federal rule has angered fishermen in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. The rule, which took effect today, is a ban on fishing for red snapper. That's one of the most popular saltwater fish. Federal agencies and environmental groups say that in the South Atlantic, the red snapper is in trouble. And along with the ban, officials propose temporarily closing a huge area to virtually all fishing.  NPR's Greg Allen has the story.  GREG ALLEN: To people who don't fish or live in the Southeast, it might seem like a lot of fuss over one species. But in fishing communities like St. Augustine, Florida, the red snapper is more than just a fish. It's the reason thousands of anglers come here each year to fish on their own or to go out with charter boat captains like Robert Johnson.  Captain ROBERT JOHNSON: In all honesty, I can tell you that snapper fishing is better today than it was 10 years ago.  ALLEN: Robert Johnson has fished for red snapper here, off the eastern coast of Florida, for nearly 30 years. When his charter business slows down, he also fishes for them commercially. He just returned from a day trip where he and his mate used hook and line to catch nearly 100 red snapper, now packed on ice. Johnson reaches into a cooler and pulls one out.  Capt. JOHNSON: He's probably 24, 25 inches, about six, seven pounds. That's about an average size snapper. We do catch 20 and 30-pound fish, though.  ALLEN: That's a key point.
