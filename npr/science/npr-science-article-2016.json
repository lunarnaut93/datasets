It's called dark matter. Physicists are certain that dark matter makes up most of the mass of the universe. They are sure that, even though they can't seem to find it. NPR's Joe Palca, the reporter of our series \"Joe's Big Idea,\" has been asking what makes scientists certain. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: One reason scientists are so sure dark matter has to exist is that they can see the effect it's having on the way stars and galaxies are moving. Without something providing the gravity to hold the stars in as the galaxy rotates, the stars would fly off into space, like a bunch of dishes flying off a spinning Lazy Susan. Richard Gaitskell is a physicist at Brown University. RICHARD GAITSKELL: If you look at a typical galaxy and count up all the stars in the galaxy, which is perfectly possible for us to do this day, you find that the speed at which that galaxy rotates is simply too fast to be held together by the mass of those stars alone. PALCA: Gaitskell says if you calculate how much gravity is needed to hold a galaxy together. . . GAITSKELL: (Laughter) You find that 90 percent of the matter of that galaxy has to be some other dark material, which is why we don't see it in our telescopes. PALCA: Once scientists were convinced dark matter had to exist, they quickly realized dark matter couldn't be something familiar, like clouds of interstellar soot. So they looked for something more exotic using giant particle accelerators and sensitive detectors and found nothing. GAITSKELL: It cannot be a conventional particle that we already know about. That, of course, makes it so fascinating - is because it has to be new physics. PALCA: Gaitskell says most scientists are now convinced that what makes dark matter so devilishly hard to pin down is it just doesn't interact with anything, even though there's a lot of it all around us all the time. And I mean a lot. Gaitskell says, right now, if you stick out your hand. . . GAITSKELL: (Laughter) You've probably got about 100 million dark matter particles going through your hand (laughter) every second. PALCA: And none of them, not one, will leave any trace. GAITSKELL: You could have your hand out for a century and still not have a single dark matter particle interact with it. PALCA: But Gaitskell says theory predicts, at some point, one of these particles will interact with something. The question is. . . GAITSKELL: Can we build an instrument that is sensitive enough to actually get the first signal? PALCA: More than a dozen teams around the world are trying. Gaitskell leads one of the efforts. It's called LUX, the Large Underground Xenon experiment, 815 pounds of liquid xenon in a tank festooned with detectors in an abandoned gold mine in South Dakota, waiting for a dark matter particle to have one of those rare interactions. So far, nothing. A much bigger detector is planned for later in this decade. I asked Gaitskell if it ever gets frustrating to keep coming up empty. Wouldn't he prefer to work on something with a higher chance of success? No, he said. GAITSKELL: Even a small chance at ushering in this new generation of our understanding of both cosmology and, at the same time, fundamental particle physics - that's too good an opportunity to pass up. PALCA: Well, you can't blame a guy for trying. Joe Palca, NPR News. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   Scientists are still trying to educate themselves about a substance they cannot see.

The container is called the MoonArk, and it's part of Google's Lunar X Prize, a competition to send a robot to the moon. WESA's Irina Zhorov has the story from Pittsburgh. IRINA ZHOROV, BYLINE: The Ark is a sort of portrait of humanity, with more than 200 artists and designers contributing. Lowry Burgess is a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and the MoonArk project lead. He holds up one of his contributions, a vile full of red liquid. A drop will go in the ark. LOWRY BURGESS: And this is human blood, and that's all artists' blood. ZHOROV: Thirty-three artists' blood, all mixed together. Some of the artists are pretty famous, he says, but he won't name-drop. He's doing the same thing with a mixture of water from some of the world's rivers. There are hundreds of items in the ark. Burgess says each one is like a word in a poem. BURGESS: A poem is like a bell. Every word in a poem brings rings and makes all the rest of the words ring. So in this, everything that's there is making something else ring. So the totality is meant to hum together. ZHOROV: Yes, this is conceptual art, where the idea is more important than any traditional aesthetic. Or you can think of it as a time capsule with its contents open to interpretation. Burgess sees it as a cultural outpost in space, waiting to be discovered. BURGESS: We're desperately hoping that whoever opens it is perhaps a little more evolved than we are. ZHOROV: Unlike some earlier space art, like the Golden Records on the Voyager craft floating beyond the solar system, the Ark will stay in one place. But Mark Baskinger, one of the artists on the project, says the point is not to conquer. MARK BASKINGER: We think it should be different than sticking a flag in the soil and claiming territory. And maybe we're leaving breadcrumbs for someone else to find their way back here. It's an attempt to communicate forward in time. It's an attempt to communicate outward. ZHOROV: Other artists are just interested in the collaboration. Some don't really care about space or who finds it. Some of the artists are prone to over-intellectualizing, but some will let themselves get a little emotional. Dylan Vitone's contribution includes ordinary text messages between him and his wife. DYLAN VITONE: You know, cynical me is critiquing the way we broadcast our life. The sentimental me is kind of celebrating this thing that's really important for me and trying to give it more meaning than it actually has. ZHOROV: A copy of the Ark will stay here on Earth to be exhibited. In space, weight is money, so the team has had to be innovative with materials. The Ark's four chambers will weigh less than six ounces. I pick up one of the aluminum outer shells. It's so light, it almost feels flimsy, but it's designed to last hundreds of years. BURGESS: It's funny. You touched this, and your fingerprints are on it. Your fingerprints are actually going to go to the moon. ZHOROV: Suddenly, the moon is personal. My fingerprints are just a simpler form of self-expression than the other items on the MoonArk. For NPR News, I'm Irina Zhorov.

And what they saw happen in the U. S. in 2015 was just weird. It was hot, and there were all kinds of extreme weather events. And as NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, all that heavy weather was getting extensive. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: December was a fitting end to a strange weather here. JAKE CROUCH: This is the first time in our 121-year period of record that a month has been both the wettest and the warmest month on record. JOYCE: Jake Crouch is a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. He says the rest of the year was very wet and hot, too, the second-hottest on record. The cause - a warming climate and a super-strong El Nino. El Nino is a weather phenomenon out of the Pacific Ocean that hits every few years and affects weather globally. Together, climate and El Nino pushed the average temperature in the U. S. up over its 20th-century average by 2. 4 degrees. NOAA scientist Deke Arndt puts that in perspective. DEKE ARNDT: And if we all went home and reset our thermostat to 2. 4 degrees higher in our homes for a year, we would certainly feel the difference. JOYCE: And when the atmosphere is warmer, it holds more moisture, leading to record snows in the Northeast last February and March and record rain in the South and Midwest. Arndt says scientists expect more of the same. ARNDT: The fact is we live in a warming world, and a warming world is bringing more big heat events and more big rain events to the United States. JOYCE: All this weather led to 10 extreme events that each did at least $1 billion in damage. These include a drought, flooding, severe rainstorms, big wildfires and winter storms - a wider variety of costly weather events than usual. Insurance companies are paying for most of this damage. Surprisingly, payouts this year were lower than the previous few years. That, says Mark Bove, is due mostly to luck. Bove is a meteorologist at Munich Re, which insures insurance companies for their losses. He says no serious hurricanes hit the U. S. this year, but he says that's not likely to last. Moreover, he's noticing a trend that's been going on for years and likely will continue. MARK BOVE: We seem to be seeing more extreme precipitation events. When it rains today, it seems to rain harder and heavier. JOYCE: But even as the rain gets harder, Bove says people don't seem to be taking notice. BOVE: We tend to not build buildings to withstand the storms that we already see, let alone how they might change in the future. JOYCE: And that will mean higher costs in a future where weather appears to be more unpredictable than ever. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

It's one of the bat species that's been hardest hit by the white-nose syndrome. That's a deadly fungal disease. North Country Public Radio's Brian Mann reports that some environmental activists say the government should be doing more. BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: White-nose syndrome exploded on the landscape here in northern New York in 2007. Federal biologists say the disease killed six million bats as it spread across much of the U. S. and Canada. Dan Ashe, who heads the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, says by labeling northern long- eared bats as threatened, biologists will now be able to do more to protect the caves where they hibernate and part of the forest where they live in the summer. DAN ASHE: And then it allows us to provide protections to maternity trees - so protecting that vulnerable life stage when the bats are having pups and when the pups cannot fly. MANN: Northern long-eareds were once one of the most common bats in the country. Found from North Carolina to Montana and Wyoming, they're voracious hunters and play a big role controlling insects. Some environmentalists say Ashe's agency should've gone farther, adding these animals to the endangered species list, the highest protection allowed by federal law. MOLLIE MATTESON: The species, by any sensible measure, clearly deserves endangered status. It's dying at rates of 90 percent to 100 percent. MANN: Mollie Matteson is with the Center for Biological Diversity in Vermont, where some of the biggest bat die-offs occurred. She says these new regulations still allow risky development by wind farms, loggers, and oil and gas companies. MATTESON: The Fish and Wildlife Service has now basically opened the door for any and all kinds of activity that may affect this bat and its habitat. MANN: Dan Ashe, head of the Fish and Wildlife Service, thinks these regulations will prompt companies to work more cautiously in forests where northern long-eared bats live. He says biologists will monitor how well the new rules are protecting crucial habitat. ASHE: Certainly, in the future, I could see a potential that its status would change to endangered. And so the meantime, people shouldn't, you know, be relaxing. We should be working with the wind industry, and the oil and gas industry, and utility industry and others to put in place durable protection. MANN: It's unclear just how effective regulations like this will be in saving northern long-eared bats. After all, it's that deadly fungal disease that's pushing them to the brink and scientists still have no way of stopping it. White-nose syndrome is now in 26 states, turning up this winter in Nebraska. It's expected to keep spreading until it reaches the West Coast. For NPR News, I'm Brian Mann in Northern New York.

Some have been sitting there for years. But a national push to address the backlog has given the issue a sense of urgency. To find out what kind of progress has been made, we reached out to Becca O'Connor. She's vice president for public policy at the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, one of the groups spearheading the effort. Becca, thanks so much for being with us. BECCA O'CONNOR: Thanks for having me. It's my pleasure. MARTIN: Explain why these kits were not being tested. O'CONNOR: So 10 or 15 years ago, the DNA technology wasn't in the same place where it is today, first of all. We now are able to pull much more out of a rape kit through DNA testing than we may have been able to in the past. And beyond that, there was also a different mentality around these crimes. You know, for many people, the belief was that these were stranger-perpetrated crimes, where you have someone leap out of the bushes, and we know better now. And we have more of a push and an inclination to test, even in acquaintance cases because we know that these are serial offenders that are likely to strike again. MARTIN: How much does it cost to process a rape kit? O'CONNOR: The average is between $400 and $1,200. MARTIN: So it's a big hit for cities, especially if they have a big backlog. O'CONNOR: It can be, but it depends on what exactly they're planning to test out of that kit. But it's something that, you know, cost is outweighed by the benefit, we believe. MARTIN: So even if there was no value to the specific case, you're saying that there is still value in testing a kit because of another crime that that perpetrator might commit. O'CONNOR: Exactly. And over time, the other thing that's evolved, of course, is the CODIS, a national database run by the FBI which holds offender samples. And so as that's grown, we have more, basically, things to check against. MARTIN: And are there examples of finding someone - a perpetrator who committed another crime because of a positive ID with a rape kit? O'CONNOR: Absolutely. So for instance, there's a woman named Natasha Alexenko who's a survivor with whom I work, where she learned, only after they finally tested her kit years later, that the individual who assaulted her had committed other crimes. MARTIN: There's been federal legislation to address the backlog as far back as 2000. So why is it still a problem? O'CONNOR: You know, we talk about the backlog in this generic terminology. And it's important to point out that, you know, for the Department of Justice and others, a backlogged kit is one that is sitting at a crime lab and waiting to be tested. And as we've been talking about, we know that many of these kits never make it to that stage. They sit in evidence rooms. So there's this education that needs to happen. That said, we do have this challenge of creating a system where victims feel comfortable coming forward and submitting themselves to these exams in the wake of what's likely the worst trauma of their lives. If I'm a survivor and I'm seeing headlines that say that my kit is likely going to sit and collect dust somewhere, where's my incentive to come forward? I think that's one of the things that we're seeing shift as more and more states step up to the plate and do what needs to be done to clear their backlogs. MARTIN: As you mentioned, there is some movement here. Some states have really taken this on. Last week, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey announced he's forming a task force to find and test old kits. Kentucky is pressing ahead with a bill that requires rape kits to be tested within 30 days of collection, I believe. I imagine this is encouraging news to you. O'CONNOR: It absolutely is. And what's really, really encouraging, as I talk to lawmakers across the country and in the federal government, is that people are starting to have these aha moments and realizing that, first of all, it's OK to raise your hand and say - we may have a problem here, and we want to get to the bottom of it. You know, there's no finger-pointing at this point. What's really been amazing, even in just the three years that I've been working on this issue, is the shift and the desire to be proactive rather than just reactive to the issue.

Researchers released the final report of an investigation of unmarked graves at the now closed Dozier School for Boys. For more than a century, the reform school in Florida's panhandle was notorious for abuse and beatings. Some boys died there. And after a three-year investigation, a team from the University of South Florida says it's been able to identify only some of the remains found at the school. NPR's Greg Allen joins us from Tallahassee, where the researchers delivered their report to the governor today. And Greg, this is a story that's gotten a lot of attention, especially after many of the men who were sent there as boys have told their stories of horrific beatings. The school was closed in 2011. What new did we learn today? GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Well, I'll get there, Robert, but a little background first that, you know, these stories were told by a group called the White House Boys. They took their name from a small white building on the old Dozier School campus where they say these beatings were administered. And dozens of these men have come forward over the years with similar stories of how they received a hundred lashes or more from a leather strap that was weighted with metal they say. The White House Boys say that some children died as a result and that some of those are the people who are buried in those unmarked graves at the school. Those stories are what lead a forensic anthropologist from the University of South Florida, Erin Kimmerle, to ask the state of Florida for permission to conduct the search for graves at the school. After exhuming bodies and conducting a DNA analysis, Kimmerle says her team has positively identified the remains of seven boys buried on the school grounds and presumptively identified 14 others using other means. SIEGEL: But researchers say that 55 sets of remains were found there. What happens to the remains of the boys who haven't been identified? ALLEN: Well, Kimmerle says her team is committed to working with the families to identify the rest of the remains if possible, and the work will continue. One problem is finding the families of the boys who died there. The earliest deaths that they've found were around 1914 and boys are known to have been buried at the school into the 1960s. But records of who the boys were who died at the Dozier School are hard to find. The White House Boys and researchers say deaths there were often not reported. Some of the White House Boys were on hand for the final report today and they were asking the state for remembrance of some sort to record what happened there. Here's one of the White House Boys, Bill Price. BILL PRICE: There should be a memorial put up in front of that White House building letting people know what happened, what the state of Florida allowed to happen, and that it should never happen again. SIEGEL: Greg, does this conclude the search for remains or are the researchers confident that they have found all those who were buried at the school even if they haven't identified them all? ALLEN: Well, I think the search is over. The forensic anthropologist in charge, Erin Kimmerle, says, though, that she can't say if they've found all the bodies that were buried there or if there are more out there. She says they ran down every lead they could find, they've done all they can do. But from looking over archives and news accounts, researchers say there's about a hundred boys who were known to have died at the school over more than a century, and in the end they found only 55 graves. So that's led many of the White House Boys to believe there are more graves out there on that 1,400-acre campus. But unless new information comes out where the graves might be, Kimmerle says her team's work is over. SIEGEL: And what about the remains, where will they be reinterred? ALLEN: Well, that's something of a sore point here. The White House Boys are adamant that the remains should not be interred at the old Dozier School, they should be far away and they should not be interred at the nearby town of Marianna or even in that county there. Many feel the town was complicit in the mistreatment of the boys who were held at the school. Some officials and business leaders from Marianna, though, were on hand today here in Tallahassee to express interest in the future of the 1,400-acre property. One that I talked to said the town was willing to acknowledge its past, to apologize and to move on, and some of the White House Boys told me that they now are ready to do the same thing - to move on.

It's the earliest known evidence of human warfare. The site was uncovered in 2012, and Cambridge University professor Robert Foley is among the scientists who have been studying the discovery. Welcome to the program. ROBERT FOLEY: Thank you very much. SIEGEL: The site is in northern Kenya. What exactly did your team uncover? FOLEY: What we found is an area that's about a hundred meters by 20 or 30 meters. And in that area, we found 27 skeletons or partial skeletons or fragments of skeletons. And what we saw at first was just the back of somebody's skull just peeping through the ground. And Marta Lahr, who's the director of the project - she exposed the skeleton, and then it became clear that there were other skeletons around. Some of these had clear signs of having died violently. SIEGEL: Was there any sign of the implements with which they might have met their demise? FOLEY: Yes. So the traumas we were able to see basically fall into three categories. So one is what you'd think of as a blunt instrument. Were talking, here, probably wooden - big wooden, heavy clubs. And these have been used to completely smash the skulls. Then we have some where the clubs may have actually had inserted in them small, little stone blades to make them really more unpleasant. And then the third type were little stone blades or tips - probably arrowheads, which were projectiles. And these were actually embedded into one of the skulls so that clearly, we can say, well, they were both clubbed to death and probably shot with projectiles. SIEGEL: And were these, by the way, all males skeletons, or could you tell? FOLEY: No, no. It's men and women and children. SIEGEL: And what are the theories behind what might've produced this result? FOLEY: Our interpretation that this was the product of some sort of intergroup conflict, you know? Whether you want to call it warfare or not, it is a matter of definition. But it's lethal conflict between two groups. Now, the reason we say that is that the skeletons we found were not buried. I mean, they're not in graves. They haven't been interred. They're lying where they died, and that's an extraordinarily unusual - I mean, it's unusable the find something like that. So we're interpreting this as being one group ambushing, attacking, taking by surprise in conflict with another one. SIEGEL: And how does this find altar our understanding of life 10,000 years ago in Northern Kenya? FOLEY: Well, the really critical thing is that the people involved were hunter-gatherers, and I think many people in anthropology and archaeology would say that warfare is something that really starts seriously once people have settled down, once they're in permanent settlements, they start to have livestock, they start to have crops. And those are things that need to be defended or they're things that you can steal. What we see here is a hunter-gatherer group also engaging in warfare. So it tells us that the conditions under which human societies will fight each other are broader, are more diverse than previously thought. SIEGEL: Do you come away from this study - or I guess you're still in the midst of it. But do you find yourself thinking that perhaps we humans are more innately aggressive than you might've thought before? FOLEY: Well, I think the key thing is that we have evidence for it, you know? Thinkers, philosophers, scientists speculated on this forever. So it's always been out there as a possibility. Do I think that we're less pleasant than I did - probably not. I mean, I don't think we're specifically violent and aggressive, and nor are we specifically peaceful and all-loving at all. I mean, I think the key thing about human nature is that we have the capacity for both. And our survival depends enormously on being able to cooperate. I mean, that's what makes groups exist. But under certain conditions, we are also very violent and can be aggressive and murderous in our activities. So I think it's wrong to characterize humans as either warlike or peaceful. We're both.

And these were actually embedded into one of the skulls so that clearly, we can say, well, they were both clubbed to death and probably shot with projectiles. SIEGEL: And were these, by the way, all males skeletons, or could you tell? FOLEY: No, no. It's men and women and children. SIEGEL: And what are the theories behind what might've produced this result? FOLEY: Our interpretation that this was the product of some sort of intergroup conflict, you know? Whether you want to call it warfare or not, it is a matter of definition. But it's lethal conflict between two groups. Now, the reason we say that is that the skeletons we found were not buried. I mean, they're not in graves. They haven't been interred. They're lying where they died, and that's an extraordinarily unusual - I mean, it's unusable the find something like that. So we're interpreting this as being one group ambushing, attacking, taking by surprise in conflict with another one. SIEGEL: And how does this find altar our understanding of life 10,000 years ago in Northern Kenya? FOLEY: Well, the really critical thing is that the people involved were hunter-gatherers, and I think many people in anthropology and archaeology would say that warfare is something that really starts seriously once people have settled down, once they're in permanent settlements, they start to have livestock, they start to have crops. And those are things that need to be defended or they're things that you can steal. What we see here is a hunter-gatherer group also engaging in warfare. So it tells us that the conditions under which human societies will fight each other are broader, are more diverse than previously thought. SIEGEL: Do you come away from this study - or I guess you're still in the midst of it. But do you find yourself thinking that perhaps we humans are more innately aggressive than you might've thought before? FOLEY: Well, I think the key thing is that we have evidence for it, you know? Thinkers, philosophers, scientists speculated on this forever. So it's always been out there as a possibility. Do I think that we're less pleasant than I did - probably not. I mean, I don't think we're specifically violent and aggressive, and nor are we specifically peaceful and all-loving at all. I mean, I think the key thing about human nature is that we have the capacity for both. And our survival depends enormously on being able to cooperate. I mean, that's what makes groups exist. But under certain conditions, we are also very violent and can be aggressive and murderous in our activities. So I think it's wrong to characterize humans as either warlike or peaceful. We're both. SIEGEL: Professor Foley, thank you very much for talking with us today. FOLEY: It's a pleasure. SIEGEL: That's Cambridge University professor Robert Foley on the discovery of the site of the remains of an ancient conflict in Kenya. It's the earliest-known evidence of human warfare.", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

This past weekend, one zoo did just that with a lion, and Sidsel Overgaard paid a visit. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: (Foreign language spoken). SIDSEL OVERGAARD, BYLINE: It's a cold day, and the brightly-colored snow suits worn by Danish children makes it easy to pick them out of the crowd here at the Odense Zoo.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Foreign language spoken). OVERGAARD: The student points out the many similarities between the lion's anatomy and our own.

He was nice enough to go to the studios at BYU to give us the bottom line on this vitally important question. Professor Evans, thanks so much for speaking with us. RICHARD EVANS: Thanks for having me, Michel. MARTIN: So you've studied a whole range of catastrophic events - for example, hurricanes and blackouts. So is it true? Are more babies born after a storm? EVANS: Yeah, that's what we found in our study that we did early in the 2000s. There was some old studies on the New York City blackout of 1965, and then even some stuff about the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. And so we had different severities, different geographic locations over a long time period. We thought it was a great laboratory to test whether there was this fertility effect. MARTIN: So what is the fertility affect? EVANS: All right. So the result that everybody loves is that with kind of low-level, low-severity storm advisories, we actually found an uptick in births 9 months later. So it was about a 2 percent increase with tropical storm watches. The story there is if the lights go out and there's no TV, it kind of sets the table for romance. And you get births 9 months later. But the other thing we found that is also intuitive, but no one had ever detected this before - was that with the most severe storm warnings - so a hurricane warning - you get almost an equal decrease in births 9 months later. And the story there is if you're running for your life, you can't make babies. MARTIN: What about snowstorms? EVANS: So I think the blizzard that's hitting East Coast right now is more like a low-severity storm advisory in the sense that, for the most part, people are not being asked to evacuate. And so people are going to be in their houses this weekend, and they're going to be riding out this storm. And the storm may knock-out television and electricity. And that seems to be the conditions that generates more babies. And I think it kind of touches a broader topic, especially the research about the Oklahoma City bombing, that when there are events that bring people together and make people think about their longevity not just for romance reasons - just for, like, your own existential reasons, people turn more towards fertility and preserving the species. MARTIN: Before I let you go, can I ask, though - I understand that you don't really focus on this subject anymore, that you are, you know, doing other things. You have a number of sub-specialties that you sort of focus on. However, is this like one of those roles that you can't get away from? I mean, for example - I mean, is this the thing that people really want to talk to you about? EVANS: So I have other things that people really want to talk to me about, but this is one that keeps coming back and I can't get away from. And it's just this topic that is irresistible by the press. You get hurricanes and sex, and I am the guy for that, either fortunately or unfortunately. I mean, I do macroeconomics and tax policy.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: Some election days are more momentous than others - for example, today in Sierra Leone. The West African nation is attempting to elect a legitimate government after a decade of brutal civil war in the first multiparty election there in 25 years. VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Today, we're talking about reconciliation. Now, when we talk about forgiveness, we usually mean forgiving minor violations. It's one thing to forgive someone who says something offensive or steals your purse or accidentally crashes a car into yours. But could you forgive a neighbor who kills your father or cuts off your hand? Could you continue to live next door to that person? Could you go back to being just neighbors? OEINDRILA DUBE: I was always fascinated by this question of how we can restitch the fabric of society in the aftermath of war. VEDANTAM: This is Oeindrila Dube. She is an assistant professor of political science and economics at New York University. And here is the question she set out to answer. Can there really be reconciliation after atrocities on the scale seen in Sierra Leone? DUBE: Over 50,000 people were killed. Thousands more were raped and amputated. And a lot of this violence was actually neighbor-on-neighbor. So when a conflict like this came to an end, you could find yourself living next door to someone who was responsible for amputating you or for hurting your family members. And, you know, the question that I really wanted to ask is how does a community move on from something like this? UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #1: (Reading) I was a small boy when the war entered my village. VEDANTAM: This is Nyumah. He's from a small village in eastern Sierra Leone. UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #1: (Reading) Everyone packed their bags and began to flee to Guinea. We met the rebels on the road. They looked at me keenly and said, no. They would not let me pass. I was captured. While I was with them, they also captured my friend by the name of Sahr. I knew Sahr very well. We grew up together. VEDANTAM: And here is Sahr, Nyumah's childhood friend. UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #2: (Reading) This war really destroyed me. When the rebels invaded, they captured me in the bush and my father too. VEDANTAM: You're hearing two producers read subtitles from a documentary made by a nonprofit group called Catalyst for Peace. The rebels asked Nyumah to do something terrible. It was part of a systematic pattern they were using to turn friend on friend, neighbor on neighbor and destroy the social ties that held communities together. UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #1: (Reading) They commanded me to beat him up. I refused and said, this is my friend; I won't do it. VEDANTAM: But the rebels weren't making a request. They were issuing a command. A rebel fighter raised his gun and aimed it at Nyumah. UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #1: (Reading) Then they shot me. VEDANTAM: The bullet pierced Nyumah on his right side, just at the hip. Nyumah felt he had no option. He turned on his childhood friend. UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #1: (Reading) I beat him. VEDANTAM: The rebels handed Sahr a knife. UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #2: (Reading) They gave me a knife and told me to kill my father. But I told them I wouldn't kill my own father. VEDANTAM: The rebels handed the knife to Nyumah. At gunpoint, they ordered him to kill Sahr's father. Fearing for his own life, Nyumah took the knife. He slit the throat of his friend's father. UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #1: (Reading) But in my mind, I thought my friend would not blame me. I was forced to do it. VEDANTAM: After the war was over, a nonprofit group named Fambul Tok began to organize reconciliation ceremonies in different villages. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"FAMBUL TOK\")UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: Fambul Tok is Creole for family talk. And it's an old tradition. It's as old as Sierra Leone itself. DUBE: There is an actual reconciliation ceremony that takes place which is a two-day event where people from these 10 villages in this community come to participate. VEDANTAM: Oeindrila was working with another nonprofit group called Innovations for Poverty Action, which was active in Sierra Leone. When Oeindrila heard about Fambul Tok's work, she was immediately intrigued. Steeped in tradition, the reconciliation ceremonies call for community members to confront one another in a public setting, admit to wrongdoing and seek forgiveness from people they have hurt. DUBE: And in this ceremony, where there's a bonfire, around this bonfire, victims actually testify to the atrocities they experienced. Perpetrators admit to crimes and seek forgiveness. But a very important component is no one is prosecuted or otherwise punished for participating. VEDANTAM: Nyumah and Sahr attended a Fambul Tok gathering. By now, they were young adults. DUBE: One of the boys who stepped forward and testified talked about the experience that he had during the war when he, his friend and his father were taken into the backwoods by the rebel groups. VEDANTAM: People clustered around a bonfire. Sahr stepped forward to speak. UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #2: (Reading) The man that did this to me is here. I saw him. The man that beat me and killed my father is here. The man who did this to me is here. He is right there. This is the man. VEDANTAM: Sahr points to Nyumah. DUBE: At the time that he said, the person who did this, he's here in the audience, he became quite emotional. And he actually approached the other boy seemingly in a kind of moment of anger. And one of the others in the village stepped forward, pulled him back a little bit to ensure that they didn't actually engage in some sort of, you know, physical tussle. So there was a very tense moment where they were very close to each other. And the boy who had actually committed this crime then admitted. UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #1: (Reading) They gave me a knife to kill his father. I took that knife and cut his father's throat. But what I did was not my choice. Please forgive me. DUBE: And then the boy whose father had been killed said. . . UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #2: (Reading) I have accepted, and I have agreed to forgive him. DUBE: So this was one of the most, you know, kind of striking examples that has always stayed with me. And there are many other accounts like this. Sometimes they're not always so easily resolved. There's more tension that flares up as accounts are being told. And emotions are on high. So this is the type of account that takes place. VEDANTAM: When we come back, we'll tell you more about what happened to Nyumah and Sahr and also examine the counterintuitive effects of the reconciliation ceremonies in Sierra Leone. DUBE: Going through these memories of war in a short, intense fashion can actually reopen some old wounds. VEDANTAM: Stay with us. This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. We're talking with Oeindrila Dube today. She's an assistant professor of political science and economics at New York University. Oeindrila finds that traditional forgiveness ceremonies after brutal atrocities can achieve the kind of reconciliation between neighbors that many of us might consider impossible. The ceremonies don't just affect the individuals involved. They have a big impact on community ties and cohesion - what researchers would call social capital. DUBE: You know, what we find is that the reconciliation process was inordinately successful in healing the community. So we've talked about forgiveness in this particular anecdote. But when we look at the data, we find that it actually fostered forgiveness on a widespread level. We have these measures from the psychology literature that we use to gauge affect toward former combatants. And we find that, you know, people report nine months or up to 31 months later, after these bonfire ceremonies, that they have forgiven their perpetrators to a greater degree. But they don't just feel differently. They're actually behaving differently as well. There are more friendships in the community. People say they rely on each other more for help. They participate more in civic associations like PTAs and village development committees. They also contribute more to their communities. They give more to families in need. They spend more time and resources building schools and health clinics. They have really changed the community orientation of their behavior. VEDANTAM: So you find that there's this extraordinary effect as much as almost two-and-a-half years after these ceremonies - that the ceremonies have brought people together. People are cooperating more. People are not just cooperating with the perpetrators, but in general displaying all kinds of other ways in which social capital and social cohesion has increased. But you also are finding that there's a potential downside. Can you talk about that? DUBE: What we find is that, you know, this process of talking about the past is actually painful and personally difficult for people, as manifest in worsened psychological well-being in these communities. So we have, you know, three different measures that we look at - measures of anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder and depression. And we find that all three outcomes are actually worse in the communities that have gone through this process. And we think this is consistent with the idea that going through these memories of war in a short, intense fashion can actually reopen some old wounds. VEDANTAM: But when you've forgiven someone, and you've made the effort to forgive someone, you would think that has a healing effect on you - that you basically, yes, you are reminded of the terrible thing that happened, but you have found a way to master it. Why is that not happening? DUBE: It's complicated to think about how forgiveness translates into, you know, personal psychological well-being. On the one hand, it might have this healing effect. On the other hand, these war memories are so potent and so powerful, and now they have been re-invoked. So you might feel better toward the person. You might be able to forgive the person for the things that they have done but at the same time be coping with these traumatic events. We think that it's the way in which these memories are brought up in this kind of short, intensive manner without follow-up for dealing with the negative images and feelings that actually lead to this worsening of the psychological outcomes. VEDANTAM: Say a little bit more about that. You're saying that there's something about this process - this very dramatic process - that might be good for social cohesion but not so much for individuals. DUBE: The reconciliation process allows people to collectively acknowledge what's happened and allows them, in a sense, to be able to move on. Prior to going through this process, you know, many people avoided certain places and certain activities on account of the fact that they knew that the perpetrator - the person who was responsible for either hurting them or hurting their family members - would be present in those areas. After going through this public acknowledgment and this process of, you know, confronting what's happened, many people have been able to, you know, find closure in that event in a sense, and now are ready to interact with other members of the community. This is a sense in which reconciliation can serve as a powerful force for societal healing. But at the same time, these negative consequences on the individual psyche are still there. And I think the question now is how can we harness these very powerful societal benefits and conduct the reconciliation process in a way that mitigates the psychological impact? It may be possible, for example, to couple these types of programs with ongoing counseling so that people are able to better cope with the negative memories that are re-invoked. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if you have a sense on why it is there has been this persistent view - maybe this is just a layman's perspective - but there's been this persistent view that forgiving other people is psychologically healthy for you. That idea that it's not just good for the perpetrator but it's actually good for the person who's doing the forgiving is such a widespread view. And I don't think your study basically says the two things can't go together, but it says the two things don't automatically go together. DUBE: That's exactly right. So in fact there's been work in the psychology literature that shows that forgiveness is a positive psychological force. But, you know, one has to think about the positive benefit that comes from that and weigh that against some of the negative benefits that comes from re-invoking these memories. VEDANTAM: And I'm wondering in terms of your recommendations -so when you think about this, do you think this is - it's one study, probably would have to be replicated again in maybe a different context to see if the same result holds up - but are there implications that you think we can draw from this study in how we're thinking about reconciliation in other contexts? DUBE: Absolutely. So, you know, every reconciliation process has some elements that are unique. But this one has all of the core elements. So, you know, this is a context in which victims are sharing their accounts, in which perpetrators are admitting to crimes, in which no one is prosecuted. In that sense, it has the core elements that we think of as common to a wide range of reconciliation programs. So, you know, I do think this is something that applies to a wide range of conflicts - not just Sierra Leone, not just civil wars in Africa, but any context in which, you know, people have gone through tremendous acts of violence and now are at a point where they need to find a way of re-stitching together the fabric of society. VEDANTAM: I wanted to know what happened to Nyumah and Sahr. They reconciled more than five years ago. What happened afterwards? Did Nyumah and Sahr remain friends? Anthony Mansaray at Innovations for Poverty Action helped Oeindrila work on the reconciliation project evaluation. He recently tracked down Nyumah and Sahr. A few weeks ago, he went to their hometown in Kailahun district in eastern Sierra Leone. Anthony found that Nyumah and Sahr have not only stayed in touch, but they have remained friends. DUBE: The friend who killed the father now occasionally helps the boy whose father was killed doing some farming and some other activities because he's not able to do this very well given the injury to his leg. VEDANTAM: We don't know the personal psychological effects the reconciliation ceremony has had on Nyumah and Sahr. What we do know is that Nyumah helps Sahr plant cassava. They attend church together. Sometimes they joke with one another. They are, after all, old friends. HIDDEN BRAIN is produced by Kara McGuirk-Alison, Maggie Penman and Max Nesterak.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Thousands of children under the age of 15 have been directly involved in the conflict in Sierra Leone. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: The United Nations Refugee Agency says it believes soldiers loyal to the former military regime are holding many civilians as hostages. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  For more than a decade, the West African nation of Sierra Leone was ravaged by a brutal civil war. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: The fighting was triggered by the refusal. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) RENEE MONTAGNE, BYLINE: In the struggle for control of the West African nation since last month's brutal rebel attack on the capital, Freetown. . . VEDANTAM: Children as young as seven were given machetes and machine guns and forced to become killers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: From systematic amputation of limbs to mass rape, murder and enslavement of the civilian population. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: Some election days are more momentous than others - for example, today in Sierra Leone. The West African nation is attempting to elect a legitimate government after a decade of brutal civil war in the first multiparty election there in 25 years. VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Today, we're talking about reconciliation. Now, when we talk about forgiveness, we usually mean forgiving minor violations. It's one thing to forgive someone who says something offensive or steals your purse or accidentally crashes a car into yours. But could you forgive a neighbor who kills your father or cuts off your hand? Could you continue to live next door to that person? Could you go back to being just neighbors? OEINDRILA DUBE: I was always fascinated by this question of how we can restitch the fabric of society in the aftermath of war. VEDANTAM: This is Oeindrila Dube. She is an assistant professor of political science and economics at New York University. And here is the question she set out to answer. Can there really be reconciliation after atrocities on the scale seen in Sierra Leone? DUBE: Over 50,000 people were killed. Thousands more were raped and amputated. And a lot of this violence was actually neighbor-on-neighbor. So when a conflict like this came to an end, you could find yourself living next door to someone who was responsible for amputating you or for hurting your family members. And, you know, the question that I really wanted to ask is how does a community move on from something like this? UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #1: (Reading) I was a small boy when the war entered my village. VEDANTAM: This is Nyumah. He's from a small village in eastern Sierra Leone. UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #1: (Reading) Everyone packed their bags and began to flee to Guinea. We met the rebels on the road. They looked at me keenly and said, no. They would not let me pass. I was captured. While I was with them, they also captured my friend by the name of Sahr. I knew Sahr very well. We grew up together. VEDANTAM: And here is Sahr, Nyumah's childhood friend. UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #2: (Reading) This war really destroyed me. When the rebels invaded, they captured me in the bush and my father too. VEDANTAM: You're hearing two producers read subtitles from a documentary made by a nonprofit group called Catalyst for Peace. The rebels asked Nyumah to do something terrible. It was part of a systematic pattern they were using to turn friend on friend, neighbor on neighbor and destroy the social ties that held communities together. UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #1: (Reading) They commanded me to beat him up. I refused and said, this is my friend; I won't do it. VEDANTAM: But the rebels weren't making a request. They were issuing a command. A rebel fighter raised his gun and aimed it at Nyumah. UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #1: (Reading) Then they shot me. VEDANTAM: The bullet pierced Nyumah on his right side, just at the hip. Nyumah felt he had no option. He turned on his childhood friend. UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #1: (Reading) I beat him. VEDANTAM: The rebels handed Sahr a knife. UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #2: (Reading) They gave me a knife and told me to kill my father. But I told them I wouldn't kill my own father. VEDANTAM: The rebels handed the knife to Nyumah. At gunpoint, they ordered him to kill Sahr's father. Fearing for his own life, Nyumah took the knife. He slit the throat of his friend's father. UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #1: (Reading) But in my mind, I thought my friend would not blame me. I was forced to do it. VEDANTAM: After the war was over, a nonprofit group named Fambul Tok began to organize reconciliation ceremonies in different villages. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"FAMBUL TOK\") UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: Fambul Tok is Creole for family talk. And it's an old tradition. It's as old as Sierra Leone itself. DUBE: There is an actual reconciliation ceremony that takes place which is a two-day event where people from these 10 villages in this community come to participate. VEDANTAM: Oeindrila was working with another nonprofit group called Innovations for Poverty Action, which was active in Sierra Leone. When Oeindrila heard about Fambul Tok's work, she was immediately intrigued. Steeped in tradition, the reconciliation ceremonies call for community members to confront one another in a public setting, admit to wrongdoing and seek forgiveness from people they have hurt. DUBE: And in this ceremony, where there's a bonfire, around this bonfire, victims actually testify to the atrocities they experienced. Perpetrators admit to crimes and seek forgiveness. But a very important component is no one is prosecuted or otherwise punished for participating. VEDANTAM: Nyumah and Sahr attended a Fambul Tok gathering. By now, they were young adults. DUBE: One of the boys who stepped forward and testified talked about the experience that he had during the war when he, his friend and his father were taken into the backwoods by the rebel groups. VEDANTAM: People clustered around a bonfire. Sahr stepped forward to speak. UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #2: (Reading) The man that did this to me is here. I saw him. The man that beat me and killed my father is here. The man who did this to me is here. He is right there. This is the man. VEDANTAM: Sahr points to Nyumah. DUBE: At the time that he said, the person who did this, he's here in the audience, he became quite emotional. And he actually approached the other boy seemingly in a kind of moment of anger. And one of the others in the village stepped forward, pulled him back a little bit to ensure that they didn't actually engage in some sort of, you know, physical tussle. So there was a very tense moment where they were very close to each other. And the boy who had actually committed this crime then admitted. UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #1: (Reading) They gave me a knife to kill his father. I took that knife and cut his father's throat. But what I did was not my choice. Please forgive me. DUBE: And then the boy whose father had been killed said. . . UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER #2: (Reading) I have accepted, and I have agreed to forgive him. DUBE: So this was one of the most, you know, kind of striking examples that has always stayed with me. And there are many other accounts like this. Sometimes they're not always so easily resolved. There's more tension that flares up as accounts are being told. And emotions are on high. So this is the type of account that takes place. VEDANTAM: When we come back, we'll tell you more about what happened to Nyumah and Sahr and also examine the counterintuitive effects of the reconciliation ceremonies in Sierra Leone. DUBE: Going through these memories of war in a short, intense fashion can actually reopen some old wounds. VEDANTAM: Stay with us. This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. We're talking with Oeindrila Dube today. She's an assistant professor of political science and economics at New York University. Oeindrila finds that traditional forgiveness ceremonies after brutal atrocities can achieve the kind of reconciliation between neighbors that many of us might consider impossible. The ceremonies don't just affect the individuals involved. They have a big impact on community ties and cohesion - what researchers would call social capital. DUBE: You know, what we find is that the reconciliation process was inordinately successful in healing the community. So we've talked about forgiveness in this particular anecdote. But when we look at the data, we find that it actually fostered forgiveness on a widespread level. We have these measures from the psychology literature that we use to gauge affect toward former combatants. And we find that, you know, people report nine months or up to 31 months later, after these bonfire ceremonies, that they have forgiven their perpetrators to a greater degree. But they don't just feel differently. They're actually behaving differently as well. There are more friendships in the community. People say they rely on each other more for help. They participate more in civic associations like PTAs and village development committees. They also contribute more to their communities. They give more to families in need. They spend more time and resources building schools and health clinics. They have really changed the community orientation of their behavior. VEDANTAM: So you find that there's this extraordinary effect as much as almost two-and-a-half years after these ceremonies - that the ceremonies have brought people together. People are cooperating more. People are not just cooperating with the perpetrators, but in general displaying all kinds of other ways in which social capital and social cohesion has increased. But you also are finding that there's a potential downside. Can you talk about that? DUBE: What we find is that, you know, this process of talking about the past is actually painful and personally difficult for people, as manifest in worsened psychological well-being in these communities. So we have, you know, three different measures that we look at - measures of anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder and depression. And we find that all three outcomes are actually worse in the communities that have gone through this process. And we think this is consistent with the idea that going through these memories of war in a short, intense fashion can actually reopen some old wounds. VEDANTAM: But when you've forgiven someone, and you've made the effort to forgive someone, you would think that has a healing effect on you - that you basically, yes, you are reminded of the terrible thing that happened, but you have found a way to master it. Why is that not happening? DUBE: It's complicated to think about how forgiveness translates into, you know, personal psychological well-being. On the one hand, it might have this healing effect. On the other hand, these war memories are so potent and so powerful, and now they have been re-invoked. So you might feel better toward the person. You might be able to forgive the person for the things that they have done but at the same time be coping with these traumatic events. We think that it's the way in which these memories are brought up in this kind of short, intensive manner without follow-up for dealing with the negative images and feelings that actually lead to this worsening of the psychological outcomes. VEDANTAM: Say a little bit more about that. You're saying that there's something about this process - this very dramatic process - that might be good for social cohesion but not so much for individuals. DUBE: The reconciliation process allows people to collectively acknowledge what's happened and allows them, in a sense, to be able to move on. Prior to going through this process, you know, many people avoided certain places and certain activities on account of the fact that they knew that the perpetrator - the person who was responsible for either hurting them or hurting their family members - would be present in those areas. After going through this public acknowledgment and this process of, you know, confronting what's happened, many people have been able to, you know, find closure in that event in a sense, and now are ready to interact with other members of the community. This is a sense in which reconciliation can serve as a powerful force for societal healing. But at the same time, these negative consequences on the individual psyche are still there. And I think the question now is how can we harness these very powerful societal benefits and conduct the reconciliation process in a way that mitigates the psychological impact? It may be possible, for example, to couple these types of programs with ongoing counseling so that people are able to better cope with the negative memories that are re-invoked. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if you have a sense on why it is there has been this persistent view - maybe this is just a layman's perspective - but there's been this persistent view that forgiving other people is psychologically healthy for you. That idea that it's not just good for the perpetrator but it's actually good for the person who's doing the forgiving is such a widespread view. And I don't think your study basically says the two things can't go together, but it says the two things don't automatically go together. DUBE: That's exactly right.

Scientists have been doing forensic work to learn what set this huge storm in motion. And as NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, they say they think the trail starts with the weather pattern called El Nino. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: El Nino starts in the tropical Pacific. Every few years, the ocean there gets unusually warm. This year is one of the biggest El Ninos ever. Heat and moisture from it have been swept up into the tropical jet stream and carried eastward. Climate scientist Michael Mann at Penn State says the warm, wet air was carried along like a wave in a rope. MICHAEL MANN: If you flick it like El Nino is doing in the Pacific, you're going to generate this long wave disturbance that can have impacts way downstream. JOYCE: The jet stream carried it to the southern tier of the U. S. Normally, that means wet and warm weather, but we got a blizzard instead. And here's why. Last December, just southwest of Alaska, a big, low-pressure system formed in the upper atmosphere. It was kind of like throwing a rock into the polar jet stream, another big stream of air blowing toward the East. JEFF WEBER: So this kind of buckled the polar jets. JOYCE: Jeff Weber is a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado. He says when that polar jet buckles. . . WEBER: Instead of keeping all the cold air locked up to the north, it starts being able to bring that colder air farther down south, and that's exactly what happened for this storm. JOYCE: To make matters worse, it also emits a very moist air from the Atlantic Ocean, which has been especially warm this year as well. When cold air met wet air, the result was the massive blizzard that swept the East. So El Nino apparently got this thing rolling. Will it do something like this again in future years? Climate scientists can't say for sure, but Penn State's Michael Mann says it depends on the oceans, and they are changing. MANN: A lot of climate change is actually going into the oceans, and its changing the behavior of the oceans in a way that affects weather patterns around the globe. JOYCE: And that's the leading edge of climate research now - finding out how a warming climate is changing global weather and El Nino's role in that. Now, if ocean waters are getting warmer - and they are - and El Nino is created by unusually warm waters, you might think we'd see more big El Ninos. Climate scientist Heidi Cullen at the research organization Climate Central says it's too soon to say that with any certainty. And, she says, even if they do get stronger, El Ninos are only one part of a very complex weather world. HEIDI CULLEN: It's never just an El Nino signature that we experience when we experience any individual winter or any individual weather event. JOYCE: Yes, scientists say a warming climate makes some things more likely - heat waves, droughts, big blizzards. But when it comes to your local weather, the deck is still full of wildcards.

Gorillas don't have them. Chimpanzees don't have them, nor do any of our other evolutionary relatives. In fact, with the arguable exceptions of elephants and manatees, humans are the only mammal with that little section of bone on the lower portion of the jaw that juts out past the teeth, and scientists don't know why. Well, James Pampush has co-authored a paper in the most recent issue of the journal Evolutionary Anthropology. The article is appropriately titled \"The Enduring Puzzle Of The Human Chin,\" and he joins us now from the studios of Duke University to talk about it. Welcome to the program. JAMES PAMPUSH: Thank you for having me. SIEGEL: In this article, you round up quite a few possible theories that scientists have proposed, and then you seem to poke holes in each of them. So I wanted to start with the theory that this might be - the chin - might be an adaptation that helps us to speak. What's the idea there? PAMPUSH: When you open your jaw and when the tongue moves, those muscles - they strain the front of the jaw. When bone is strained, it begins to accumulate small cracks. And so in order to deal with that, you want to add extra bone so that when the strains are put into it, it distributes more. SIEGEL: You don't buy that. PAMPUSH: I don't think that speech necessarily generates more strain there than other types of behaviors with the mouth that lots of other animals do without chins. SIEGEL: One possible theory for why we have chins is that the chin can help humans attract mates. PAMPUSH: Yeah. We run into another kind of interesting problem in that typically what happens when there's a feature that's being sexually selected in an organism, we see it develop in only one sex. So you might take the red cardinal as an example. We only see male cardinals that are red. And so it's really strange then that if chins are one of these features that is sexually selected for, that both men and women have chins. SIEGEL: We do speak commonly of somebody taking it on the chin or leading with one's chin. Both of those phrases suggest that the chin is kind of a liability. But in each case, it does prevent you from getting hit in the throat, which would be a lot worse, so there could be some protective value of a chin. PAMPUSH: Yeah, this is something that actually gets mentioned to me a lot. SIEGEL: (Laughter) Yes. This bothers you a great deal (laughter). PAMPUSH: Well, there's a couple of good reasons to suspect that that's not the reason that we have chins. First, human beings would have to be hitting each other so often or must be the clumsiest animals alive for as long as necessary to generate that kind of adaptation. And secondly, the chin is actually really bad in terms of preventing your jaw from breaking. SIEGEL: The conclusion to your article - it sounds very profound. You say perhaps understanding the chin will reveal some unexpected insight into what it means to be human. PAMPUSH: Well, if you're looking across all of the hominids, which is the family tree after the split with chimpanzees, there's not really that many traits that we can point to that we can say are exclusively human. Big brains - Neanderthals had larger brains than us. All those animals all walked on two legs. The one thing that really sticks out is the chin. SIEGEL: Yeah. PAMPUSH: And perhaps it will tell us really what gave us that last little step into becoming atomically modern that left those other human-like creatures behind. SIEGEL: Well, James Pampush, thank you very much for talking with us. PAMPUSH: Well, thanks for having me. SIEGEL: James Pampush is a postdoctoral associate at Duke University. His article in the journal, Evolutionary Anthropology is titled \"The Enduring Puzzle Of The Human Chin. \"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CHIN UP\")DEBBIE REYNOLDS: (Singing) Chin up, chin up.

But in each case, it does prevent you from getting hit in the throat, which would be a lot worse, so there could be some protective value of a chin. PAMPUSH: Yeah, this is something that actually gets mentioned to me a lot. SIEGEL: (Laughter) Yes. This bothers you a great deal (laughter). PAMPUSH: Well, there's a couple of good reasons to suspect that that's not the reason that we have chins. First, human beings would have to be hitting each other so often or must be the clumsiest animals alive for as long as necessary to generate that kind of adaptation. And secondly, the chin is actually really bad in terms of preventing your jaw from breaking. SIEGEL: The conclusion to your article - it sounds very profound. You say perhaps understanding the chin will reveal some unexpected insight into what it means to be human. PAMPUSH: Well, if you're looking across all of the hominids, which is the family tree after the split with chimpanzees, there's not really that many traits that we can point to that we can say are exclusively human. Big brains - Neanderthals had larger brains than us. All those animals all walked on two legs. The one thing that really sticks out is the chin. SIEGEL: Yeah. PAMPUSH: And perhaps it will tell us really what gave us that last little step into becoming atomically modern that left those other human-like creatures behind. SIEGEL: Well, James Pampush, thank you very much for talking with us. PAMPUSH: Well, thanks for having me. SIEGEL: James Pampush is a postdoctoral associate at Duke University.

People in Flint have lots of questions for the government officials who let corroded lead pipes pollute the water. Perhaps the biggest is this. HATTIE COLLINS: When are you going to fix it? And I mean fix it right. CORNISH: That's Hattie Collins. Our co-host, Ari Shapiro, met her while she was distributing bottled water at Triumph Church in Flint. And so Ari set out to answer her question - when will there be clean water? ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: There is now an 18-wheeler parked in front of the church, massive truck. This is from Columbus, Ohio? COLLINS: And we're getting another one today at 11:45 from Columbus, Ohio. Then at 4:30, we're getting five more semi-trailers. SHAPIRO: Those trucks are all full of donated water bottles. Hattie Collins is overseeing a team of church volunteers that hands out literally thousands a day. COLLINS: Right. All this water will be gone today. SHAPIRO: Can you do that day after day for months or years? COLLINS: As long as they send the water, yes. We'll be here to pass it out. SHAPIRO: To figure out how long Hattie Collins will have to keep passing out this water, you have to start by measuring the scale of the problem. Flint is a city of close to 100,000 people. How many of those people have lead pipes leading to their homes? That's the question Marty Kaufman sent out to answer. MARTY KAUFMAN: We jumped on this right away. SHAPIRO: He's a professor of Earth and Resource Science at the University of Michigan in Flint. For a couple of weeks now, he's been officially contracted to work with the city. But back in October, he went to the city and said show me your records. Where are the lead pipes? KAUFMAN: We were taken aback when they showed us a big file drawer that had 45,000 cards. SHAPIRO: Forty-five thousand handwritten index cards saying which pipes were lead, which were copper, and so on. KAUFMAN: One of the big problems is that they were written in pencil, so they smeared quite a bit, too. SHAPIRO: Kaufman realized a bunch of handwritten notes in smeared pencil would never work, so he asked city officials - is there any other place with this information? And it turned out there was - parcel maps showing city blocks divided into little squares of property. KAUFMAN: On these particular maps that the city water department had, there was a code affixed to many of the parcels that indicated what type of service line was running into the house. SHAPIRO: And were these just big sheets of paper? What were they? KAUFMAN: Yes. I can show you one. We have one in the other room. SHAPIRO: Will you show us? Let's do it. We walked down the hall into the room where a black and white map is laid out on a table. Wow. KAUFMAN: This is what we're talking about. SHAPIRO: So this is, like, one yard by maybe a yard-and-a-half, and this is a neighborhood in Flint. KAUFMAN: It is. And you can see where they've labeled what type of service connection they have into the house. Here's one that says L and C. That's a lead and copper connection right there. SHAPIRO: The city scanned 240 of these maps into a computer and Kaufman's team methodically knitted them together, inputting the data about what the pipes are made up of at each place. When we visited on Friday, they were just completing the project. So what you have on the screen now is a map of Flint, the entire city. And it is basically, stitched together, all of those specific, individual maps that you found in the city's archives. KAUFMAN: That's correct. SHAPIRO: But this is just one step. The information in these maps is from the 1980s. Nobody knows how accurate they are, and they have big blank areas. KAUFMAN: Ultimately, anytime you make a map you have to field-check your information. SHAPIRO: In other words, compare the map to the real world. And that brings us to Professor Laura Sullivan of Kettering University. We asked her when Flint will have clean water. And she says over time, the inside of the corroded lead pipes will rebuild a protective film. That'll make the water safer, but it's not a long-term solution, and nobody actually knows how long the film will take to rebuild. LAURA SULLIVAN: We've never encountered a situation where the pipes in a city are corroded to the extent that these are. SHAPIRO: Dr. Sullivan has work has worked on clean water projects all over the world, from South America to sub-Saharan Africa. Suddenly, her expertise is needed here in her hometown of Flint. The state appointed her to a committee that is trying to fix the water. And she says it's tricky because trying to fix the pipes could knock off that protective film that's starting to rebuild. SULLIVAN: The fact is we have to replace all of those pipes. The practical reality is we can't do that all in two weeks. We can't do that all in even a month. And while I don't want to say we're going to stall or delay, but we surely shouldn't rush. SHAPIRO: And beginning to end, do you have any idea whether it's a one-year, a five-year, a 15-year process? SULLIVAN: I don't. I mean, I wish I could say. What I can tell you is I firmly believe that the light is shining so brightly on the city of Flint right now that if there were any entity that had any negative or malicious reason to slow things down, there's no way they could do that. And if there's any entity that has the ability to make things right, they're being empowered to do that. SHAPIRO: But at the same time, I think the takeaway for somebody saying - when is this going to be fixed, when will I be the stop using filters and bottles? - your explanation makes 100 percent sense, and yet the answer seems to be a shrug. Like, who knows? SULLIVAN: And I get that. And so one of roles that I feel like I have is as I'm figuring this stuff out, as I'm learning about this stuff is that everybody else is learning about that stuff, that nobody's in the dark going forward. And that, you know, next week, we'll know so much more than we know right now. And not only that, but these - there are now opportunities for the unemployed and the underemployed in Flint to be a part of this, to have jobs in assisting with this. So what we plan on doing is taking care of this as quickly as possible, and involving Flint and taking care of Flint. Not saying oh, it's your problem, you have to take care of it, but saying everything you need to take care of it, we'll provide. But this is your city and you have control of the city, and we're done having emergency managers telling you what to do. We're going to help you heal your city. SHAPIRO: You have worked all over the world in developing countries on water issues. How weird does it feel (laughter) to be having this conversation about your own city, the place you call home? SULLIVAN: You know, when I go into a community that I'm not a part of, my goal is to try and win of the trust of people I've never met, right? In this situation, I was meeting people I never met before from walks of life I would never have crossed, but they were really very much like me. And so this is more like fighting for my family than it is trying to help people that deserve something better, right? This is more like feeling horribly hurt because the people who I've been standing with are horribly hurt. SHAPIRO: Well, Dr. Laura Sullivan, thank you so much for talking with us. SULLIVAN: It's been a pleasure. Thank you.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. Flowers, candy, sappy love songs, yup, Valentine's Day is just around the corner. This week, we're going to talk about the social science of romance. We'll tell you how to save cash on an engagement ring. ANNE BOWERS: Turns out that the circumstances that surround the ring matter a great deal in about how much people are wanting to pay for it. VEDANTAM: And why it will be good for your marriage to buy that cheaper ring. DANIEL PINK, BYLINE: The more money a couple spent on the wedding or the ring, the more likely they later were to split up. VEDANTAM: We'll also explore the relative merits of a guitar case or a gym bag as props in an experiment on attraction. MESHELLE FOREMAN SHIELDS: He's going to be like the Pied Piper. They're going to be following him wherever he goes. VEDANTAM: Anne Bowers is a professor at the University of Toronto. She studies how consumers determine how much to pay for wedding-related purchases. BOWERS: I was looking at how people sell wedding dresses, and what I noticed about how people sell wedding dresses is that it is a lot about the day, how happy their marriage was, how beautiful their wedding was. And they show a lot of photos that have nothing to do with the dress itself and a lot about the experience that they had. And I wanted to look at how that impacted sales, but it's hard to do that statistically, so I switched to looking at engagement rings. VEDANTAM: She looked at online sales of engagement rings. BOWERS: And if you've ever shopped for an engagement ring, you know that people buy engagement rings based on four things - cut, color, clarity and carats. But it turns out that the circumstances that surround the ring matter a great deal in about how much people are wanting to pay for it. So I looked at about 1. 5 million eBay transactions, and then I also ran an experiment of about 600 people, and I found that people really want a ring they perceive as pure and not tainted. And by tainted, I mean from a failed relationship. VEDANTAM: In the experiment, Bowers offered the volunteers identical rings but different scenarios. BOWERS: The first condition was a store condition where they said, we have excess inventory, and so we're selling the ring. Then we also had a happy marriage condition where the person said, I'm really happily married, but I work with my hands, and so I never wear this ring, and that's why I'm selling it. And finally, we had a ring where they said, I'm selling this because I got divorced, and I'm never wearing it, and you can have the ring for that. And those were the only things that differed. The ring itself was a . 7-carat diamond ring with an original purchase price of $3,500. VEDANTAM: Anne Bowers asked people how much they would be willing to pay for the ring and how authentic they thought the ring was. BOWERS: So on average, people priced the divorced ring at about $550, and they priced the happy marriage ring at about $780 and the store ring at about $820. But the interesting thing was it kind of reversed when you asked them about how likely they thought the ring was to be fake. And they found that the divorced ring, they thought that was much less likely to be fake than the ring from the store of the happy marriage. VEDANTAM: The most interesting thing is that people were actually aware of this bias. BOWERS: And it's funny. I ask people in the experiment, you know, why did you price the way that you priced? And people would say things like, I know I shouldn't believe this, I know it's just a ring, but it doesn't matter. I wouldn't be OK with this. It just feels wrong. And they can't really articulate why because they do know it's just a piece of metal, but it becomes really important in these settings. VEDANTAM: And that's true even for people who really ought to know better. BOWERS: This project has been going on for some time. And I actually got engaged and married during the process. And I said to my husband, I said, Brian, you know, you've got to go, and you've got to get a used ring. It's where all the value is. And he said, I can't do it. I don't care what your research is. I can't do it. VEDANTAM: I asked Anne how she could be so sure her fiance actually hadn't bought the tainted ring and taken advantage of the discount that came with it while telling her that it was brand new. BOWERS: That's a good point. That's a good point. And he is a very rational, strategic person, so he may have just known about the story. It's going to be an interesting dinner tonight. That's all I can say. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Anne Bowers at the University of Toronto. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Speaking of getting engaged, it isn't only lovebirds who are happy on Valentine's Day. A major source of happiness when it comes to romance is in setting up other people. I recently had a conversation with NPR's David Greene about this topic. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)DAVID GREENE, BYLINE: You know, matchmaking is something that far predates the Internet. It's something that has been in every country and every culture for as long as we know. But now as computers and algorithms and websites, like OkCupid and Tinder and match. com, take over the job of setting up matches, there's new research that this might come at a price. NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam is here to explain that price. What is it, Shankar? VEDANTAM: The price is really to matchmakers, David. I recently came by research by Lalin Anik at Duke University. Along with Michael Norton, she finds that matchmaking is a significant source of happiness for many people. So here's what the researchers did. They examined the happiness of people who reported they like to play matchmaker and did it a lot against the happiness levels of people who didn't. And they find that, in general, matchmakers are happier than non-matchmakers. GREENE: I love that we actually don't care about talking about the people who actually matched. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). GREENE: We're talking about the happiness of the matchmakers. But couldn't it be that just happy people tend to be the matchmakers, they decide to do this? VEDANTAM: That's right. So this is just a correlation. We don't know what's causing what. So to sort this out, the researchers ran a series of experiments where they had volunteers play matchmaker in a lab. And they find the act of making matches increases happiness. They also find that when volunteers are given a chance to make unusual or unexpected matches, they experience greater boosts in happiness. And this probably explains why if you are single, your matchmaker friends keep trying to introduce you to people with whom you have absolutely nothing in common. GREENE: Because they really want to accomplish something by finding that unlikely duo that could come together. VEDANTAM: That's exactly right. GREENE: Well, Shankar, if people were sort of relied on these matchmakers to make these unexpected, unusual matches because it makes them happy, is that sort of going away because computer algorithms are now, you know, not really finding those unusual duos? VEDANTAM: That's exactly right, David. Many of these computer algorithms are designed to match people who are similar to them so people actually can go to these websites and say, I want someone who has exactly the same interests and personality and characteristics that I do. And so the computers are finding matches. They're not finding unusual connections. And as I read the study, David, I realized that we have lots and lots of websites for single people to find partners. What we might really want is a website for matchmakers so that they can continue to make these really unusual matches. I'm not sure it would increase the happiness levels of single people. It would probably increase the happiness levels of matchmakers. GREENE: And a few single people who would find these unexpected matches. VEDANTAM: Yes, I can tell that you're a matchmaker at heart, David. GREENE: I am. Great to be matched with you this morning in the studio. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). GREENE: Take care, Shankar. Thanks. VEDANTAM: Thanks, David. When we come back, Dan Pink returns for another round of Stopwatch Science. We'll share some interesting research about what makes couples compatible and why it might be less about chemistry and more about vocabulary. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Hey, listeners. We're doing an episode on traffic, and we are looking for nightmare stories. Do you suffer through rush hour, had a bad experience driving in a different city or a country? What about road rage? Give us a call, and tell us your story at 661-77-BRAIN. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Back now for another round of Stopwatch Science, I'm Shankar Vedantam. I'm joined as always by Daniel Pink, our senior Stopwatch Science correspondent. Welcome, Dan. PINK: Thank you, Shankar. VEDANTAM: On Stopwatch Science, Dan and I give one another 60 seconds to summarize interesting social science research. As we approach the 60-second mark, our producers Kara and Maggie will bring up the music to drown us out just like they do at the Oscars. Our topic today is love. Dan Pink is widely known as the love guru. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: And so, Dan, I can't wait to see what you have discovered for Stopwatch Science. We're going to give you insights into why we love, who we love and also, once Dan stops laughing, how to make love last. PINK: The only person laughing harder at that is my wife. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) All right, love guru, if you're ready, your first 60 seconds starts now. PINK: OK, now this February 14, millions of Americans are expected to pop the question. But which of the resulting marriages are likely to last? In October, two Emory University economists tackled that question. They surveyed more than 3,000 people, controlled for a bunch of demographic and social variables and found - and I'm quoting the paper's abstract now - \"that marriage duration is inversely associated with spending on the engagement ring and wedding ceremony. \"VEDANTAM: Wow. PINK: In other words, the more money a couple spent on the wedding or the ring, the more likely they later were to split up. Now the researchers found only a correlation. They don't say that a lavish ceremony or a 6-carat diamond causes divorce, not at all. And the correlation wasn't perfect in all cases. However, the economists did find a tight connection between cheap celebrations and longer marriages. And that's intriguing especially in a world where a multibillion-dollar wedding industrial complex urges young people to declare their love by breaking the bank. VEDANTAM: That is really interesting, Dan. Of course, what this means is that wedding planners, jewelers and florists will never sponsor HIDDEN BRAIN ever again. PINK: (Laughter) Although, I should point out as the love guru that you do have a sponsor that's a mattress company. So that's. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter) All right, here's my theory on why it is the researchers found what they did. If you are deeply, truly, madly in love with someone, you might not actually need a big ring. . . PINK: Interesting. VEDANTAM: . . . Or a big ceremony to prove your love. On the other hand, if you're kind of, sort of, maybe, possibly in love with this other person, you might actually use the ring or a lavish ceremony to compensate for this hole in your heart. PINK: Whoa, hole in the heart, it's an interesting argument. You have a some kind of emotional deficit, and you cure it with what economists call signaling. VEDANTAM: Exactly. PINK: Could be - they actually had a much more pedestrian reason for it. They said that expensive weddings cause people to go into debt, debt causes stress in a marriage, and marriages with stress are more likely to break up, more pedestrian. I think I like the hole in the heart theory a lot better. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: Speaking of a hole in my heart, I'll have a hole in my heart if you go over your time. VEDANTAM: Oh. PINK: Your 60 seconds starts right now. VEDANTAM: All right, psychologists and economists have long known about an interesting phenomenon called the endowment effect. Basically, when something comes into my possession, I think of it differently than before I owned it. So I might be willing to pay $10 for a mug, but once I own the mug, I want $20 to part with it. Thomas Wallsten and Colette Nataf at the University of Maryland recently applied this idea to the dating market. They find that when they offered men and women profiles of potential partners, people demonstrated the endowment effect. They were willing, for example, to spend $4 to buy the contact information of a man or a woman, but they wanted $10 to sell the contact information to someone else. Curiously, the researchers found that women are especially prone to this bias. There was one guy for whom women, on average, were willing to spend $3. 97 to buy his contact information, but they wanted $23. 50. . . PINK: Whoa. VEDANTAM: . . . To sell the contact information to someone else. Now since the endowment effect is primarily about loss aversion, meaning people care more about losses than about gains, it suggests that women may experience more loss aversion when it comes to potential dating partners than do men. Now I don't know what the moral of the story is, Dan. Maybe, you know, find someone who is as unwilling to part with your phone number as you are unwilling to part with theirs. PINK: (Laughter) I'm just hoping my contact information is worth more than three or four bucks. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: Do you think there's - you know, inevitably, on a study like this, one could offer an evolutionary explanation for the reproductive strategies of women and men being different. Is that what's going on here? VEDANTAM: You know, I think the authors speculate that that might be at play. I have to say that I myself am skeptical about that because I feel like it's really difficult to disentangle what biology is telling us to do from what culture and our social norms are telling us to do. But speaking of biological and cultural imperatives, Dan. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . Your next 60 seconds starts right now. PINK: If you're like me, Valentine's Day always brings to mind two words, assortative mating. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: That's the term scientists use to describe when living creatures, including human beings, mate with those who are like themselves. Over the last half century, there has been an upsurge in assortative mating in the U. S. In particular, people with college degrees or beyond are now much more likely to marry other people with college degrees or beyond than they were back in the mid-20th century. So what does this mean for America? Well, four economists, led by Jeremy Greenwood of the University of Pennsylvania, analyzed data from hundreds of thousands of U. S. households between 1960 and 2005. Using some complicated math, they made a startling discovery. Had the U. S. more or less maintained the marriage patterns of 1960 when people were more likely to marry those with different levels of education, income inequality today would be about 21 percent lower. Put another way, one explanation for rising inequality is that marriage is becoming more socially stratified. You know, marriage is a private choice, of course. But what this research tells us is that private choices can have public consequences. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering, Dan, is it possible that the researchers are seeing these findings because the number of women, especially who are graduating from college, is very different today than it was 50 years ago? Could we be seeing this merely because more women are college graduates, and therefore, more people who are college graduates are going to be marrying one another? PINK: Yeah, not merely because, but that's a big part of it. And you add that to the fact that there are more women in the labor market, and that there are increasing returns in the labor market to education. And what you have is you have these very, very positive trends that create another trend that is less positive because you have the well-educated marrying the well-educated and pulling away. The solution, to my mind at least, is to make sure we raise all boats. So speaking of boats, you need to hop in your canoe. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: . . . For 60 seconds of paddling that begins right now. VEDANTAM: All right, I take back what I said about Dan being the love guru because he clearly knows very little about romance. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Everyone knows the most important words when it comes to Valentine's Day are not assortative mating but language style matching. James Pennebaker at the University of Texas Austin and colleagues at Wayne State University, Texas A&M and Northwestern University recently analyzed transcripts of conversations between dating couples and also instant messages exchanged by the couples. They find that when couples use the same kinds of language or mimic one another's sentence constructions, they are more likely to hit it off. That could mean being interested in a second date. It could mean sticking in a relationship over the long-term. Now we don't know what's causing what. It's possible that when people are attracted to one another, they start using similar language. It's also possible similar language somehow drives attraction. The clear implication of the study is that when you peer into your date's eyes over that candlelit dinner on Valentine's Day. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . Make sure you transcribe the conversation. . . PINK: Of course. VEDANTAM: . . . And analyze it for clues. When your date asks you what you are writing, say that you are testing him or her for pronoun, preposition and article compatibility. PINK: You know what, that's actually how I met my wife. (LAUGHTER)PINK: No, that's fascinating. It's so consistent with other research showing the power of mimicry not only as something that we can fake but something that we do naturally when we have an affinity with somebody. VEDANTAM: That's exactly right. All right, so there you have it. Find someone who loves your phone number and will never part with it. If you marry someone who comes from the same social and educational background as yourself, remember that it can have big societal consequences. If you want your next date to go successfully, match your date's pronouns, prepositions and conjunctions. Finally, buy your fiancee a cheap ring, get married at City Hall. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . And say, darling, Dan Pink told me to do it this way. PINK: All right, so I've gone from the love guru to the divorce doctor. VEDANTAM: I guess we just broke up, Dan. PINK: Yeah, hurts me, I have a hole in my heart. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: All right, thank you so much, Dan. PINK: Shankar, always a pleasure. Happy Valentine's Day. VEDANTAM: Happy Valentine's Day to you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: I'm joined by my friend, Meshelle, the indie-mom of comedy, for a segment that we call Mad Scientist. Welcome, Meshelle. SHIELDS: Thank you, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Meshelle, I'm going to give you the outlines of a research study, and you have to figure out what the study found. SHIELDS: Wow, no way. VEDANTAM: Are you ready to put on your lab coat and your. . . SHIELDS: I am so ready to put on this fictitious lab coat. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHIELDS: So glad it's fictitious. VEDANTAM: All right, so there's a man who walks around the city in France. He's pretending just to be a guy on a street, but in reality, he's running an experiment. He stops a series of women, and he says the following thing to each of them. He says, hello, my name is Antoine. I just want to say that I think you're really pretty. I have to go to work this afternoon, and I was wondering if you would give me your phone number. I'll phone you later, and we can have a drink together someplace. Here's the catch, Meshelle. When Antoine goes up to some of the women, he's holding a guitar case. When he goes up to others, he's holding a big sports bag, a gym bag, all right? So some of the women think that Antoine is a musician. Others might be led to believe that he is an athlete of some kind or he's into physical fitness. The question is, does carrying the guitar case or the gym bag make any difference to whether the women give him their phone number, and which one, do you think, makes a difference? SHIELDS: Wow, that is so interesting, Shankar. I'm sitting here - my head was spinning as you were describing the actual study. I was just like, OK, where is he going? I'll tell you this much. I think that with the guitar, he's only going to draw a certain kind of person, and I think those people are kind of far and few in between. I think with the gym bag, everybody wants someone who they deem is healthy or cares about their health. And even if he's not a professional athlete, I think he's going to get a little more rhythm, if you will, with the gym bag because he's going to look like he cares about his body, and he cares about his health. I think the women that see him with the guitar are going to be a very different kind of woman. But he's in France, so. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHIELDS: He's in France. How did I forget that? VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHIELDS: Oh, my gosh. This changes everything, Shankar. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHIELDS: He's in France. This dude is going to be racked up with numbers with the guitar. What? The French don't care about fitness. They eat baguettes all day. If you eat a lot of bread, clearly you're not preoccupied with health and wellness. So I - you know, I'm going to take that back. He's in France. He's going to kick all kinds of you know what with the guitar. He's going to get every woman he meets, and the study will show that the French have a proclivity for artists and particularly those who can - and if it's acoustic, geez Louise. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHIELDS: If it's acoustic, he's going to be like the Pied Piper. They're going to be following him wherever he goes. I'll go with that. I'll go with he's going to get more women because it's France, he's an artist, and they're really into that. VEDANTAM: All right, this was a study by Nicolas Gueguen and his colleagues Celine Jacob and Lubomir Lamy, and they find that more women share their phone numbers with Antoine when he is carrying. . . SHIELDS: Dun, dun, dun (ph). VEDANTAM: . . . The guitar case. SHIELDS: Thank you very much. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHIELDS: Thank you very - it took me a second to get there, Shankar. But when I thought about the country. . . VEDANTAM: I have to say that your reasoning process was fascinating. SHIELDS: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: I don't know whether the same results would be found in the United States. So your theory is that this is actually not being driven by gender differences between men and women. SHIELDS: No. VEDANTAM: These are cultural differences. . . SHIELDS: Cultural. VEDANTAM: . . . That might be unique to France. SHIELDS: Absolutely. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: That was Meshelle, the indie-mom of comedy. Go online to find her new album, \"Funny As A Mother. \"SHIELDS: And I'm - and if there's any French listeners, please disregard, you know, my remarks about you guys not caring about your health. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHIELDS: I just did a little, you know, informal, you know, just data collection in my brain, and I thought of baguettes, and I thought of croissants, and I thought - I mean, there's so much bread there.

SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Flowers, candy, sappy love songs, yup, Valentine's Day is just around the corner. This week, we're going to talk about the social science of romance. We'll tell you how to save cash on an engagement ring. ANNE BOWERS: Turns out that the circumstances that surround the ring matter a great deal in about how much people are wanting to pay for it. VEDANTAM: And why it will be good for your marriage to buy that cheaper ring. DANIEL PINK, BYLINE: The more money a couple spent on the wedding or the ring, the more likely they later were to split up. VEDANTAM: We'll also explore the relative merits of a guitar case or a gym bag as props in an experiment on attraction. MESHELLE FOREMAN SHIELDS: He's going to be like the Pied Piper. They're going to be following him wherever he goes. VEDANTAM: Anne Bowers is a professor at the University of Toronto. She studies how consumers determine how much to pay for wedding-related purchases. BOWERS: I was looking at how people sell wedding dresses, and what I noticed about how people sell wedding dresses is that it is a lot about the day, how happy their marriage was, how beautiful their wedding was. And they show a lot of photos that have nothing to do with the dress itself and a lot about the experience that they had. And I wanted to look at how that impacted sales, but it's hard to do that statistically, so I switched to looking at engagement rings. VEDANTAM: She looked at online sales of engagement rings. BOWERS: And if you've ever shopped for an engagement ring, you know that people buy engagement rings based on four things - cut, color, clarity and carats. But it turns out that the circumstances that surround the ring matter a great deal in about how much people are wanting to pay for it. So I looked at about 1. 5 million eBay transactions, and then I also ran an experiment of about 600 people, and I found that people really want a ring they perceive as pure and not tainted. And by tainted, I mean from a failed relationship. VEDANTAM: In the experiment, Bowers offered the volunteers identical rings but different scenarios.

The ring itself was a . 7-carat diamond ring with an original purchase price of $3,500. VEDANTAM: Anne Bowers asked people how much they would be willing to pay for the ring and how authentic they thought the ring was.

BOWERS: That's a good point. That's a good point. And he is a very rational, strategic person, so he may have just known about the story. It's going to be an interesting dinner tonight.

VEDANTAM: (Laughter) All right, here's my theory on why it is the researchers found what they did. If you are deeply, truly, madly in love with someone, you might not actually need a big ring. . . PINK: Interesting. VEDANTAM: . . . Or a big ceremony to prove your love. On the other hand, if you're kind of, sort of, maybe, possibly in love with this other person, you might actually use the ring or a lavish ceremony to compensate for this hole in your heart. PINK: Whoa, hole in the heart, it's an interesting argument. You have a some kind of emotional deficit, and you cure it with what economists call signaling. VEDANTAM: Exactly. PINK: Could be - they actually had a much more pedestrian reason for it. They said that expensive weddings cause people to go into debt, debt causes stress in a marriage, and marriages with stress are more likely to break up, more pedestrian. I think I like the hole in the heart theory a lot better. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: Speaking of a hole in my heart, I'll have a hole in my heart if you go over your time. VEDANTAM: Oh. PINK: Your 60 seconds starts right now. VEDANTAM: All right, psychologists and economists have long known about an interesting phenomenon called the endowment effect. Basically, when something comes into my possession, I think of it differently than before I owned it. So I might be willing to pay $10 for a mug, but once I own the mug, I want $20 to part with it. Thomas Wallsten and Colette Nataf at the University of Maryland recently applied this idea to the dating market. They find that when they offered men and women profiles of potential partners, people demonstrated the endowment effect. They were willing, for example, to spend $4 to buy the contact information of a man or a woman, but they wanted $10 to sell the contact information to someone else. Curiously, the researchers found that women are especially prone to this bias. There was one guy for whom women, on average, were willing to spend $3. 97 to buy his contact information, but they wanted $23. 50. . . PINK: Whoa. VEDANTAM: . . . To sell the contact information to someone else. Now since the endowment effect is primarily about loss aversion, meaning people care more about losses than about gains, it suggests that women may experience more loss aversion when it comes to potential dating partners than do men. Now I don't know what the moral of the story is, Dan. Maybe, you know, find someone who is as unwilling to part with your phone number as you are unwilling to part with theirs. PINK: (Laughter) I'm just hoping my contact information is worth more than three or four bucks. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: Do you think there's - you know, inevitably, on a study like this, one could offer an evolutionary explanation for the reproductive strategies of women and men being different. Is that what's going on here? VEDANTAM: You know, I think the authors speculate that that might be at play. I have to say that I myself am skeptical about that because I feel like it's really difficult to disentangle what biology is telling us to do from what culture and our social norms are telling us to do. But speaking of biological and cultural imperatives, Dan. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . Your next 60 seconds starts right now. PINK: If you're like me, Valentine's Day always brings to mind two words, assortative mating. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: That's the term scientists use to describe when living creatures, including human beings, mate with those who are like themselves. Over the last half century, there has been an upsurge in assortative mating in the U. S. In particular, people with college degrees or beyond are now much more likely to marry other people with college degrees or beyond than they were back in the mid-20th century. So what does this mean for America? Well, four economists, led by Jeremy Greenwood of the University of Pennsylvania, analyzed data from hundreds of thousands of U. S. households between 1960 and 2005. Using some complicated math, they made a startling discovery. Had the U. S. more or less maintained the marriage patterns of 1960 when people were more likely to marry those with different levels of education, income inequality today would be about 21 percent lower. Put another way, one explanation for rising inequality is that marriage is becoming more socially stratified. You know, marriage is a private choice, of course. But what this research tells us is that private choices can have public consequences. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering, Dan, is it possible that the researchers are seeing these findings because the number of women, especially who are graduating from college, is very different today than it was 50 years ago? Could we be seeing this merely because more women are college graduates, and therefore, more people who are college graduates are going to be marrying one another? PINK: Yeah, not merely because, but that's a big part of it. And you add that to the fact that there are more women in the labor market, and that there are increasing returns in the labor market to education. And what you have is you have these very, very positive trends that create another trend that is less positive because you have the well-educated marrying the well-educated and pulling away. The solution, to my mind at least, is to make sure we raise all boats. So speaking of boats, you need to hop in your canoe. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: . . . For 60 seconds of paddling that begins right now. VEDANTAM: All right, I take back what I said about Dan being the love guru because he clearly knows very little about romance. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Everyone knows the most important words when it comes to Valentine's Day are not assortative mating but language style matching. James Pennebaker at the University of Texas Austin and colleagues at Wayne State University, Texas A&M and Northwestern University recently analyzed transcripts of conversations between dating couples and also instant messages exchanged by the couples. They find that when couples use the same kinds of language or mimic one another's sentence constructions, they are more likely to hit it off. That could mean being interested in a second date. It could mean sticking in a relationship over the long-term. Now we don't know what's causing what. It's possible that when people are attracted to one another, they start using similar language. It's also possible similar language somehow drives attraction. The clear implication of the study is that when you peer into your date's eyes over that candlelit dinner on Valentine's Day. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . Make sure you transcribe the conversation. . . PINK: Of course. VEDANTAM: . . . And analyze it for clues. When your date asks you what you are writing, say that you are testing him or her for pronoun, preposition and article compatibility. PINK: You know what, that's actually how I met my wife. (LAUGHTER) PINK: No, that's fascinating. It's so consistent with other research showing the power of mimicry not only as something that we can fake but something that we do naturally when we have an affinity with somebody. VEDANTAM: That's exactly right. All right, so there you have it. Find someone who loves your phone number and will never part with it. If you marry someone who comes from the same social and educational background as yourself, remember that it can have big societal consequences. If you want your next date to go successfully, match your date's pronouns, prepositions and conjunctions. Finally, buy your fiancee a cheap ring, get married at City Hall. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . And say, darling, Dan Pink told me to do it this way. PINK: All right, so I've gone from the love guru to the divorce doctor. VEDANTAM: I guess we just broke up, Dan. PINK: Yeah, hurts me, I have a hole in my heart. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: All right, thank you so much, Dan. PINK: Shankar, always a pleasure. Happy Valentine's Day. VEDANTAM: Happy Valentine's Day to you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: I'm joined by my friend, Meshelle, the indie-mom of comedy, for a segment that we call Mad Scientist. Welcome, Meshelle. SHIELDS: Thank you, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Meshelle, I'm going to give you the outlines of a research study, and you have to figure out what the study found. SHIELDS: Wow, no way. VEDANTAM: Are you ready to put on your lab coat and your. . . SHIELDS: I am so ready to put on this fictitious lab coat. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHIELDS: So glad it's fictitious. VEDANTAM: All right, so there's a man who walks around the city in France. He's pretending just to be a guy on a street, but in reality, he's running an experiment. He stops a series of women, and he says the following thing to each of them. He says, hello, my name is Antoine. I just want to say that I think you're really pretty. I have to go to work this afternoon, and I was wondering if you would give me your phone number. I'll phone you later, and we can have a drink together someplace. Here's the catch, Meshelle. When Antoine goes up to some of the women, he's holding a guitar case. When he goes up to others, he's holding a big sports bag, a gym bag, all right? So some of the women think that Antoine is a musician. Others might be led to believe that he is an athlete of some kind or he's into physical fitness. The question is, does carrying the guitar case or the gym bag make any difference to whether the women give him their phone number, and which one, do you think, makes a difference? SHIELDS: Wow, that is so interesting, Shankar. I'm sitting here - my head was spinning as you were describing the actual study. I was just like, OK, where is he going? I'll tell you this much. I think that with the guitar, he's only going to draw a certain kind of person, and I think those people are kind of far and few in between. I think with the gym bag, everybody wants someone who they deem is healthy or cares about their health. And even if he's not a professional athlete, I think he's going to get a little more rhythm, if you will, with the gym bag because he's going to look like he cares about his body, and he cares about his health. I think the women that see him with the guitar are going to be a very different kind of woman. But he's in France, so. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHIELDS: He's in France. How did I forget that? VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHIELDS: Oh, my gosh. This changes everything, Shankar. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHIELDS: He's in France. This dude is going to be racked up with numbers with the guitar. What? The French don't care about fitness. They eat baguettes all day. If you eat a lot of bread, clearly you're not preoccupied with health and wellness. So I - you know, I'm going to take that back. He's in France. He's going to kick all kinds of you know what with the guitar. He's going to get every woman he meets, and the study will show that the French have a proclivity for artists and particularly those who can - and if it's acoustic, geez Louise. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHIELDS: If it's acoustic, he's going to be like the Pied Piper. They're going to be following him wherever he goes. I'll go with that. I'll go with he's going to get more women because it's France, he's an artist, and they're really into that. VEDANTAM: All right, this was a study by Nicolas Gueguen and his colleagues Celine Jacob and Lubomir Lamy, and they find that more women share their phone numbers with Antoine when he is carrying. . . SHIELDS: Dun, dun, dun (ph). VEDANTAM: . . . The guitar case. SHIELDS: Thank you very much. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHIELDS: Thank you very - it took me a second to get there, Shankar. But when I thought about the country. . . VEDANTAM: I have to say that your reasoning process was fascinating. SHIELDS: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: I don't know whether the same results would be found in the United States. So your theory is that this is actually not being driven by gender differences between men and women. SHIELDS: No. VEDANTAM: These are cultural differences. . . SHIELDS: Cultural. VEDANTAM: . . . That might be unique to France. SHIELDS: Absolutely. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: That was Meshelle, the indie-mom of comedy. Go online to find her new album, \"Funny As A Mother. \" SHIELDS: And I'm - and if there's any French listeners, please disregard, you know, my remarks about you guys not caring about your health. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHIELDS: I just did a little, you know, informal, you know, just data collection in my brain, and I thought of baguettes, and I thought of croissants, and I thought - I mean, there's so much bread there.

The company that operates the storage facility where the leak happened says the leak could be capped as soon as the end of the week. Most of the leaking gas is the greenhouse gas methane, which we know is harmful to the environment. Our question is, how harmful? To answer that, we head out to an airfield to see UC Davis researcher Steve Conley, who is pretty psyched about his current job, a job he's been doing every week for the past few months. STEVE CONLEY: So this is a 1998 Mooney TLS, it's called. MCEVERS: That job is to fly this plane right into a huge plume of methane gas. It's a tiny little prop plane with a bunch of electronics behind the pilot seat. CONLEY: So this is a greenhouse gas analyzer here that is measuring methane and carbon dioxide and water. MCEVERS: To understand the environmental effects of this huge leak of greenhouse gas, you have to measure it. And the best way to measure it is with this plane. Four little tubes under the right wing suck in air and feed data to those greenhouse gas analyzers. This is one of how many planes in the United States that can do this? CONLEY: I would say - of this size - five or four, something like that. MCEVERS: Steve Conley flies over natural gas storage facilities all the time, and he always sees small gas leaks. But when he first was asked to fly over this big gas leak back in November, he was really shocked by what he found. CONLEY: I'd never seen measurements like that before. And so my first reaction was, crap; what just happened? Did I hit too much turbulence and some laser got out of alignment or - so my first question was that something was wrong. MCEVERS: Because the readings were so high you thought it was a mistake? CONLEY: Yeah. MCEVERS: But when he landed, he saw that two different instruments were both showing 50 or 60 parts of methane per million. The normal level here in LA is around two parts per million. The next two flights Steve Conley took, that 50 to 60 number went up. Since late November, it's steadily been going down. Still, Conley says, the amount of methane that's leaking out of the facility or well is enormous. CONLEY: If you stick a balloon over the wellhead, by the end of the day your balloon would fill the Rose Bowl Stadium. MCEVERS: We checked back with Conley on that figure. That balloon now would actually fill the Rose Bowl after 1. 8 days. We wanted to go up in the plane with Conley, but he says the turbulence from the flight makes people really sick. So they get sick during the flight or after? CONLEY: During the flight. It's very inconvenient. MCEVERS: So we asked Steven Conley to record while he's up there. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Runway 3-4-left clear for takeoff. CONLEY: Clear for takeoff on 3-4-left, 2132 x-ray. MCEVERS: The way Conley gathers the data is to fly in this crazy figure-eight pattern over and over again. CONLEY: Oh, my God. MCEVERS: Turns out it's a really windy day. CONLEY: Tightening up the seatbelt here. MCEVERS: The turbulence in the valley where the leak happened is always bad, but on this day, it's particularly bad. CONLEY: I think I'm going to make myself sick today. MCEVERS: You can't see methane with the naked eye. If you look through infrared glasses, see this huge black plume. CONLEY: It looks like we may have gone above the plume now. We're at 3,000 feet, and we haven't seen it in the last two laps. So I suspect we may have got above it finally. MCEVERS: For the record, Conley does not get sick. CONLEY: And tower Mooney 2132 x-ray, we're actually ready to come back and land. MCEVERS: And he eventually heads back down. What Steve Conley found on this trip is that the methane is at about a third of what it was back in November. The company that runs the storage facility, Southern California Gas, has depressurized the leak. But again, there's still a lot of gas. Given those readings, we wanted to know how harmful all that methane is to the atmosphere here in California and beyond. And we put that question to Rob Jackson, and environmental scientist at Stanford. ROB JACKSON: Methane is far more potent, molecule for molecule, than carbon dioxide is - the gas that people are used to thinking about in terms of climate change. That's the reason that we care so much about methane in the atmosphere. MCEVERS: So we asked Jackson, how big of a deal is this gas leak? JACKSON: It really depends on the scale that you look. The amount of methane leaking out on a day-to-day basis is comparable to whole countries. If you look in Europe, for instance, countries like Belgium and Austria produce about this much methane on a day-to-day basis from human activities, so it's really big. If you look globally, you're not going to see a massive spike when you look back at 2015 and 2016. It's not that huge. MCEVERS: Because of this leak? JACKSON: Yes. I mean, it's a huge leak in human terms, but it's not big enough that it will affect the global methane cycle so much that this would be some kind of bellwether year. It's really pretty small on the global scheme of things. The issue is more one on a local scale, on a regional scale. It's also a symbol of our reliance on fossil fuels. MCEVERS: Right, especially in a time when California is actively trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. JACKSON: It's true. People have been spending millions and millions of dollars to dial back methane leaks around the U. S. and around the world. And one mistake like this comes along and can, you know, offset all of that, at least temporarily. Now, long term, those efforts to cut leaks really pay off. But in the short term, this one mistake kind of offsets all of that. It's a little discouraging. The question is, will - will this be some kind of turning point? Will this be a symbol that people use to drive a change, a transformation towards renewables? Or in six months, will everybody have forgotten about what's happened? We don't know yet, but I think people will remember this. MCEVERS: That's Rob Jackson of Stanford University. SoCal Gas says the leak could be plugged as early as this week. We've also been reporting on the potential health effects of this gas leak. You can find that on our website, npr. org. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  Kelly, I just got to jump in here. You've covered wars and natural disasters. Really, you drew the line at going up in a little prop plane? MCEVERS: Now, as you heard, he said that it is almost guaranteed that the turbulence and this crazy figure-eight pattern that he used when he was flying was going to make you sick. SHAPIRO: Oh, so it was really out of consideration for the pilot? MCEVERS: Right. SHAPIRO: So you didn't want to get sick on the pilot? MCEVERS: Exactly. SHAPIRO: OK, duly noted. MCEVERS: I finally met my match. SHAPIRO: Flying in war zones, yes, turbulence, no for Kelly McEvers. MCEVERS: Right. Correct. Absolutely.

But the challenges we are facing are unprecedented. RAZ: Martin Rees is one of the greatest living cosmologists. He did his Ph. D. alongside Stephen Hawking back in the 1960s. And because professor Rees has devoted most of his life to studying the vastness of time and space, he's been thinking a lot about the future - actually, our future. And a question - just how long will our species be around? Here's Martin Rees on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)REES: Ten years ago I wrote a book which I entitled \"Our Final Century? \". My publishers cut out the question mark. The American publishers changed the title to \"Our Final Hour. \"(LAUGHTER)REES: Americans like instant gratification and the reverse. And my theme is this - our Earth has existed for 45 million centuries. But this one is special. It's the first when one species has the planet's future in its hands. Over nearly all of Earth's history, threats have come from nature - disease, earthquakes, asteroids and so forth. But from now on, the worst dangers come from us. And it's now not just the nuclear threat. In our interconnected world, network breakdowns can cascade globally. Air travel can spread pandemics worldwide within days. And as science offers greater power and promise, the downside gets scarier, too. We get evermore vulnerable. But we and our political masters are in denial about catastrophic scenarios. Some scenarios that have been envisaged may indeed be science fiction, but others may be disquietingly real. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: What odds would you give, if you were to wager a bet, that humanity will exist in the year 2100? REES: I'd give pretty high odds that humanity will still exist. But I wouldn't bet more than evens that we will get to 2100 without a very severe setback. I think we're going to have a bumpy ride through this century. But I think we won't wipe ourselves out completely. RAZ: But I mean, we are in our infancy compared to other hominid species that came before us, so it seems like we have the capacity to be resilient and to endure for a long time. REES: Well, we do, indeed. But of course, something special happened to our species - namely, evolution of language and an intelligence has enabled us to manipulate our surroundings and, indeed, affect the whole planet. So we are very different from all previous species, and we have the power to endure. We also have the power to destroy ourselves. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)REES: Within a few decades, millions will have the capability to misuse rapidly advancing biotech, just as they misuse cybertech today. Freeman Dyson foresaw that children will design and create new organisms just as routinely as his generation played with chemistry sets. Well, this may be on the science fiction fringe, but were even part of his scenario to come about, our ecology and even our species, would surely not survive long unscathed. For instance, there are some eco-extremists who think that it would be better for the planet if there were far fewer humans. What happens when such people have mastered synthetic biology techniques that will be widespread by 2050? And by then, other science fiction nightmares may transition to reality - dumb robots going rogue or a network that develops a mind of its own threatens us all. RAZ: I guess (laughter) - I guess I'm a little worried that you are so pessimistic about the future of our species on this planet. REES: Well, I think everyone is very aware of small risks like low levels of radiation, air crashes and things of that kind. But we are in denial about these possible new risks. We are at risk of events, such that even one occurrence could be too many. And I think we need to focus a bit more attention on this. RAZ: So, then, do you think that we could possibly be the last human species on planet Earth? REES: Well, I think - the hope is that there will be a species evolved from us. It's taken 4 billion years to get from the simplest life to us. But one thing we know as astronomers is that we are billions of years ahead. The sun's got 5 billion years before it dies. And the universe may have an infinite future ahead of it. So we are maybe not even the halfway stage of evolution. And indeed, one could strengthen that statement by saying that future evolution won't take place on the slow timescale of Darwinian selection. It'll happen on the technological timescale. It may only take a few centuries before a post-human with superhuman abilities exists. RAZ: OK, I'm curious, professor Rees, because, I mean, you studied, you know, like, these gigantic things - the universe. And we humans, in the whole scheme of it, we are barely a tiny speck - a millisecond on the clock of the history of our own planet. So does the question of whether humanity will endure - does it have any, like, larger cosmic importance for you? REES: Well, I think - I mean, as a human being, I care about human beings. . . RAZ: Yeah. REES: . . . Even if they may be just a tiny speck. But of course, in that context, I am very interested in the question of whether there is intelligent life elsewhere. And of course, if it were to turn out that the origin of intelligent life was such a rare fluke that within our galaxies, it only happened once here on Earth, then, of course, what happens is important not just terrestrially, but cosmically. RAZ: Yeah. REES: Because if we wipe ourselves out, we might destroy the potential future of life in the galaxy. Whereas if we flourish, then you could imagine that our Earth is cosmically important as the one place from which life spreads through the galaxy. So I think it's very important that we should not be self-satisfied enough to think of us humans as being the culmination of evolution. We should think of ourselves as being just a stage. And we hope that we can avoid snuffing ourselves out and therefore leave open the likelihood that something more wonderful will emerge. RAZ: Professor Martin Rees is an astronomer and cosmologist. He is also the astronomer royal, or the official astronomer to the Queen of England. You can watch Martin's entire talk at ted. com. So, like, when you're, you know, stuck in traffic, do you also have, like, a cosmic perspective? Like, you know, oh it doesn't matter. We're just, like, a tiny speck in the universe. REES: No, I'm afraid I worry about wasting small amounts. . . RAZ: (Laughter). REES: . . . Of time as much as anyone else because I know that although the universe may go on a long time, I won't. RAZ: (Laughter). On the show today, ideas about what it means To Endure. More in a minute. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. NPR.

Americans are driving less, and more of us are ditching our cars. The number of young adults without a car has been growing for years. Now middle-aged adults are also choosing to walk or bike or take the bus, as NPR's David Schaper reports from Chicago. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: Twenty-five-year-old Peter Rebecca doesn't have a car. He never has. In fact, he's never even had a driver's license. PETER REBECCA: Honestly, at this point doesn't really seem worth it. I mean, I live in Chicago. There's really good access to, you know, public transits for pretty cheap. SCHAPER: The student at Harold Washington College downtown lives just a couple of blocks from an L stop on the Northwest side. REBECCA: I've got a bunch of grocery stores in walking distance and even then I can use the bus if I have to get further. SCHAPER: And in the warmer months. . . REBECCA: I do own a bike. But I mean, it's winter now. I don't really use it right now. SCHAPER: Peter Rebecca's hardly alone, especially among young adults in urban areas. And that's not really a surprise, according to a new study from the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. BRANDON SCHOETTLE: Over the past several decades, particularly for the youngest age groups, there's been a pretty large decrease in the number of people who have been getting driver's licenses. SCHAPER: But researcher Brandon Schoettle says now this trend is not just limited it to teenagers and 20-somethings. SCHOETTLE: For some of the oldest age groups which had seen relatively large increases in licensing over the past few decades finally seem to have peaked and have started to show some small decreases in licensing. And so for the first time in the series of reports that we've done, we've kind of seen a decrease in the percentage of people with a license across all age groups. SCHOETTLE: According to Schoettle's study, only 59 percent of 19-year-olds have a driver's license today, compared to almost 90 percent of them in 1983. The percentage of 20-somethings with drivers licenses has fallen 13 percent over the last three decades, and fewer Americans in their 30s and 40s have driver's licenses. Susan Schell might soon be one of them. The manager of this Starbucks on Chicago's Northwest side says her driver's license is up for renewal this month, yet she doesn't own a car. SUSAN SCHELL: I used to. I got rid of it just because it's too much of a pain in the butt to have in Chicago, and we kept getting tickets. And I just didn't want to deal with it. SCHAPER: In addition to living in a city that's relentless in doling out parking tickets, Schell says there's the cost of insurance, gas, maintenance on top of the cost of the car itself. Her husband recently let his driver's license expire because they take public transit to work and they have other options for shopping. SCHELL: We use, like, services like Instacart a lot. We've done Ubers if we've done, like, a big trip to Target or something. We just call an Uber. There's so many options when you live in a city. SCHAPER: Forty-eight-year-old Raul Chavez hasn't renewed his driver's license since it expired over a year ago, and he keeps his car parked. RAUL CHAVEZ: It's quite a bit expensive. You have to have insurance. SCHAPER: Instead. . . CHAVEZ: The latest two years, I use public transportation. I really enjoy it because it's cheap, and it's reliable everywhere you're going to go. SCHAPER: University of Michigan researcher Brandon Schoettle says that's one of the main reasons more Americans of all ages are going without driver's licenses. SCHOETTLE: There's been a shift publicly for people to move to things like public transportation that just wasn't there back in the '80s and '90s partly because there's sometimes better public transportation in certain areas than there was a few decades ago and a little more concern about the environment. SCHOETTLE: Schoettle says he'll be watching to see if cheaper gas might now reverse the trend. David Schaper, NPR News, Chicago.

Think about how many times you've walked along the beach and been disgusted by the mounds of plastic. You're not alone. By the year 2050, the world's oceans will have as much plastic as fish. That's according to researcher Nicholas Mallos from the nonprofit advocacy group, Ocean Conservancy. The group's work was cited recently at the Davos World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Mallos says that there are already 8 million tons of plastics entering the oceans each year, which is kind of like one dump truck of plastic being dumped into the ocean every minute, he explains. It's not going anywhere. NICHOLAS MALLOS: The same qualities that make plastic such an attractive material in our everyday lives - its durability, its resistance to break down - these same qualities and chemical compounds are the same properties that make it incredibly resistant to break down in the marine environment. MARTIN: So as the world looks for ways to solve the ocean's plastic problem, Dutch entrepreneur Boyan Slat is moving forward with a tool he says could remove about half the plastic floating in the Pacific in 10 years. Slat joins me from Delft in the Netherlands by Skype, and I asked him to tell us how it works. BOYAN SLAT: The first test that will actually happen on the ocean will be deployed in June this year. I envisioned an extremely long network of floating barriers - they're like curtains floating in the ocean which are attached to the seabed. So what happens is that the current comes around and plastic gets pushed towards these barriers. And because it's in a V-shape, the plastic gets push towards the center. And once right there in the center, the plastic will be so dense, you can hardly see the water. And that's the spot where we can efficiently extract it from the seawater and store it before shipping it to land for recycling. MARTIN: First of all, what about all the other wildlife in the ocean - that if it traps the plastic, why won't it trap the fish and interfere with migration patterns and have sort of a negative impact on the very population that you're trying to improve things for? SLAT: Sure. So because we don't use nets, entanglement shouldn't be possible. So what happens is that the current flows underneath these barriers, which takes away all the fish and plankton, while the plastic remains in front of it. And that way we should be able to separate the two before it gets to any physical cleanup equipment. MARTIN: Forgive me for noting your age, in other contexts considered rude, but you're only 21 years old. And you've been working on this for about four years now, since you were 17, if I have that right. SLAT: Yeah, that's correct. MARTIN: You have managed to sustain this idea through many years, at an age when many people find it difficult to be taken seriously. And you are being taken seriously. Why do you think that is? What is it that you think you've been able to engage to carry your idea along to this point? SLAT: I think it's clear that people agree that this problem should be solved and that prevention alone isn't enough. I think the Internet has helped a lot with that as well because in the very early stage, it went viral on the Internet. It was being shared millions of times, and that then allowed me to create the seed capital through crowd-funding. I mean, there were 50,000 backers from 160 countries, so that really allowed us to start. And now thanks to some philanthropists as well as world-class engineers, we are continuing to develop the technology and soon have the first operational system in the ocean. MARTIN: There are those who argue that there is not sufficient testing. And, of course, you know, everyone has the same goal in mind - I would think - which is to fix the problem. Has any of the criticism stung you? SLAT: I think, in reality, opinions don't matter that much. Really, the ocean itself - that's really the thing that we're up against, the most destructive environment on the planet. The design philosophy there is to really work with the oceans instead of trying to fight it. So a similar strategy is what we pursue when dealing with critics. We actually very much welcome people's opinions, but what we're trying to achieve has never been done before. It will be the largest structure ever deployed in the oceans. It will be deeper than any structure ever deployed, and it will be further away from land - times 10 - than the world's most remote oil rig. Really, there's only one way to show that it's possible, and that's by actually doing it. MARTIN: Well, will you keep us posted? SLAT: Of course, I will. MARTIN: That was Boyan Slat. He is the founder of the Ocean Cleanup Project. Thank you so much for speaking with us. SLAT: All right, no worries. You're welcome.

Really, there's only one way to show that it's possible, and that's by actually doing it. MARTIN: Well, will you keep us posted? SLAT: Of course, I will. MARTIN: That was Boyan Slat.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. Every week, we look at human behavior through the lens of social science research. Today, we turn our attention to history and the untold stories that so often lie beneath it. VANESSA NORTHINGTON GAMBLE: When I see the statues and the memorials to Sims, what I see is what's not shown. VEDANTAM: We'll also look at how, as William Faulkner might say, the past is never dead. It's not even past. GAMBLE: Black kids with fractures go into an emergency room and do not get the same level of anesthesia as white kids. VEDANTAM: We'll also hear from poet Bettina Judd on who gets credit for medical advances and who doesn't. BETTINA JUDD: Sims invents the speculum. I invent the wincing, the if-you-must of it, the looking away. (MUSIC)VEDANTAM: There is a statue in South Carolina honoring a man who is known as the father of modern gynecology. The inscription on the statue reads the first surgeon of the ages in ministry to women treating alike empress and slave. GAMBLE: J. Marion Sims was a physician who was born in South Carolina in 1813. VEDANTAM: This is Vanessa Northington Gamble. She's a physician and medical historian at the George Washington University. We asked her to come in to tell us the story of J. Marion Sims who is memorialized in statues not only in South Carolina but also in Montgomery, Ala. and Central Park in New York City. GAMBLE: He started a clinic in Montgomery, Ala. And at the time, in order to survive financially, he also was a plantation physician where he took care of the enslaved on plantations. VEDANTAM: This is where the story of Sims becomes complicated because, yes, the inscription on a statue in South Carolina is true. He did invent techniques that help women to this day. He treated slaves as well as high society. He once treated Empress Eugenie, the last empress of France. But there is something not mentioned on the inscriptions on the statues. GAMBLE: Starting in 1845, he started to conduct experiments on enslaved women. And why we talk about Sims today and why that statue is there is that he perfected a technique to repair a condition called vesicovaginal fistula, and let me tell you what that means. It basically means that there is an opening between the vagina and also the bladder or the vagina and the rectum, which usually comes after traumatic childbirth. And Sims started in 1845 - 1846 according to some sources - a series of experiments to repair these fistulas. VEDANTAM: This condition was highly stigmatized and dangerous for these women. There was no treatment. So on the one hand, you could say Sims was doing what doctors are supposed to do by taking these women on as patients. But there's another side to what Sims did. He wanted to be a trailblazing researcher, and these women, their bodies, became props in his journey of scientific discovery. GAMBLE: These women were property. These women could not consent. These women also had value to the slaveholders for production and reproduction - how much work they could do in the field, how many enslaved children they could produce. And by having these fistulas, they could not continue with childbirth and also have difficulty working. VEDANTAM: There are 10 slave women central to the story. Three are named by Sims in his writing. These women were brought to him by their owners. The first woman was named Anarcha. GAMBLE: Anarcha was a 17-year-old enslaved woman who had just undergone a very traumatic delivery. Some sources say that she was in labor for three days. At first, he did not want to treat her. He was not interested in treating women. But then what he started to do from a period from 1845 to 1849, he did a series of experimental surgeries on these women. And he uses sutures to try to close up this opening. VEDANTAM: Now, presumably, this would have been painful. GAMBLE: It was very painful, and he talks about how Lucy, one of the three women, almost felt as if she were going to die, that she cried out in pain so much because of these surgeries. But at the same time, he writes that the women wanted the surgery because they did not want to have the condition anymore. VEDANTAM: Were the surgeries that he was performing on them performed without anesthesia? GAMBLE: They were performed without anesthesia. There was a belief at the time that black people did not feel pain in the same way. They were not vulnerable to pain, especially black women. So that they had suffered pain in other parts of their lives and their pain was ignored. VEDANTAM: As Sims's reputation as a researcher grew, he began to invite other physicians to come watch as he performed the surgeries. GAMBLE: So this surgery was done where black women were naked. So when we think about it, I think we think about pain. We also need to think about how these women's dignity were also taken away from them. VEDANTAM: For a long time, the surgeries didn't work. GAMBLE: No, he's not successful at the beginning. And so that's why these surgeries went on from 1846 to 1849. And finally after 30 surgeries on one woman, he was finally able to perfect his technique. VEDANTAM: That woman was Anarcha. The two others who are named in Sims's papers are Betsey and Lucy. I asked Vanessa Gamble whether there was any way to know if these women actually wanted the surgeries. GAMBLE: We do not know that. The only thing we know is that Sims said that these women - one of the women - clamorously wanted to have the surgery. They wanted to be cured. One of the things in this story that's missing are the words and voices of the women themselves not being translated by Sims. VEDANTAM: Sims, of course, has a self-interested reason to say that the women wanted what he was trying to do to them. GAMBLE: Of course he has an interest. And one of the interests is that it mutes the story of slavery in his work, that it mutes the story that the foundations of modern gynecology are based on the body and the pain of enslaved black women. VEDANTAM: The statue in South Carolina that says that Sims treated empress and slave women alike. . . GAMBLE: Yes. VEDANTAM: Is that true? Was he treating white women the same way? GAMBLE: He did treat white women. But he treated white women with anesthesia. Sims left - in the 1850s, he left Alabama and moved to New York City for health reasons. And he started a women's hospital in 1855 there. He gained a reputation as an excellent surgeon. And so that he did treat white women. But the technique had been perfected on the bodies of black women. VEDANTAM: When you hear about a story that took place 150 years ago, there is a part of us that says that was pretty awful, but that was then and this is now. But a lot of your work has actually tried to broaden that idea and said, yes, that was then, but some of what was then is also with us now. GAMBLE: Right, I mean, one of the things that - I teach a course on the history of race and racism in American medicine. And one of the things that I try to get across to my students is that racism is a very flexible, very adaptive concept. That, yes, black people are not thrown out of hospitals these days because they are black or not excluded from hospitals because they are black. But our focus today is on what happens once one gets into the hospital. VEDANTAM: It's striking as you say this because I feel like I've read studies in the last few years looking at disparities in how people of color get treated for pain in the late 20th century and the early 21st century. It feels like there is a thread between what happened 150 years ago and what's happening today. GAMBLE: Right, I agree with you because I think part of this story has to deal with how black bodies are conceptualized by the medical profession. There is a video that Johns Hopkins put out about people with sickle cell disease. And in this video, this woman says when I go to the hospital, even though I'm in pain, I make sure I get dressed up because if I get dressed up, maybe I will be treated better and not be seen as somebody who is seeking drugs. So it still is there in terms of how the medical profession views black people and black bodies. VEDANTAM: It is true though that some of the things that Marion Sims discovered are still being used or inform medical practice today. GAMBLE: Yes. VEDANTAM: He went on to become president of the American Medical Association. GAMBLE: Exactly, he was a member of the New York Academy of Medicine. VEDANTAM: So this is a very conflicted legacy because, presumably, some of the things that he helped start or he helped invent are things that are of use to us today and we value and we benefit from that knowledge. And yet that knowledge was obtained at such great cost. GAMBLE: It was obtained at great cost. And I recently read a 2011 study that was done by physicians. And they looked at medical textbooks to see how Sims was referred. He was referred as a father of modern gynecology, someone who perfected the surgical technique, but no discussion about his legacy in terms of conducting these experimental surgeries on enslaved women. So that's part of the problem. We can say that some of these surgeries that he did, women today are benefiting from, especially in poor countries. But at the same time, we can't forget how that came to be. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering as someone who is a physician herself, what do you think should be done with those statues? GAMBLE: You know, it's one of those things where I'm conflicted. If you had asked me this question last spring, I would have given you a different answer. And I'll tell you why I'm conflicted. Last summer, I went to Liverpool. And Liverpool has a remarkable international museum of slavery. And one of the things that I did when I was in Liverpool, I took a slavery history tour because Liverpool was at the center of the transatlantic slave trade. And on an art deco building, there was an image of Neptune - since it's Liverpool and water - and underneath Neptune, there were two black children who were in chains. And the tour guide, who was an 80-plus-year-old black gentleman, asked us do you think this should be taken down? And most people said yes. And he says I think it should stay. And he said I think it should stay because I don't want people to forget it happened. And so I think that we need to do something to commemorate the women, to add something to say, yes, Sims did this, but what about Anarcha? What about Lucy? What about Betsey? I think if we don't do that, that people will forget what happened to those women. So as a historian and as a teacher, I think that it's important for people to know what happened to those women. And if we whisk away these images of Sims, people will forget. VEDANTAM: How do you hear what these women were going through? So if you could speak to Anarcha and Lucy and Betsey, what do you think they would tell you? GAMBLE: I think the story they would tell me would not start with Sims. I think the story they would tell me would be about their lives as enslaved women. It would begin there. It would begin how there were times where if that baby had survived, that the baby would have been taken away from them. They would talk to me about how, as being black women, their bodies were used sexually, that they did not have consent and that what happened to them with Sims was part and parcel of what their lives were at that particular time. But I think the other thing they would want us to know is that they were human beings and that they also deserve their story to be memorialized, that we have statues of Sims in Columbia, S. C. , in New York City. There are portraits in medical schools of Sims. Where is their story? VEDANTAM: If you could build a memorial to Anarcha, Betsey and Lucy, or a memorial that stood alongside the memorials that we have erected to Marion Sims in South Carolina and New York City, what would the Memorial say? GAMBLE: The statute would not be of the experiments because I think that it's important not just to think of them as victims of these experiments. It might be with the three of them together. Or it might be with their holding children, that they were mothers, that they were women. So that would be part of it. So it would not be their prostrate on the altar of science. I think what the inscription would say is Betsey, Anarcha and Lucy, the mothers of modern gynecology. (MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Professor Vanessa Northington Gamble is a physician and medical historian at the George Washington University. When we come back, we'll hear a modern tale of race in medicine through the lens of poetry. Stay with us. (MUSIC)JUDD: In the woman, it is a checklist. Can you imagine anything worse than this? If the answer is no, ask again. VEDANTAM: Bettina Judd is a professor of gender and women's studies at the College of William and Mary. She's also a poet, and she recently wrote about a medical experience she had in a book called \"Patient. \" drawing not just on her personal history as a black woman but the stories of Anarcha, Betsey and Lucy. Producer Maggie Penman spoke to Bettina Judd and asked her to read some of her poetry. MAGGIE PENMAN: In 2006 in her first year of graduate school, Bettina Judd had what she calls an ordeal with medicine. She was driving home from her part-time job and had to pull over because of a sharp pain in her abdomen. JUDD: In 2006, I had an ordeal with medicine. I must've been found guilty of something. I don't feel innocent here lurking with ghosts. See, it happens like that. I started a thought that is quite benign and end up peccant, debased. I had an ordeal with medicine and was found innocent or guilty. It feels the same because I live in a haunted house. A house can be a dynasty, a bloodline, a body. There was punishment like the way the body is murdered by its own weight when lynched - not that I was wrong but that verdicts come in a bloodline. In 2006, I had an ordeal with medicine. To recover, I learned why ghosts come to me. The research question is why am I patient? PENMAN: Bettina Judd had to be patient as a doctor told her she was having menstrual cramps and sent her home with painkillers. A few days later, she was told she had a bladder infection and given antibiotics. She was repeatedly given pregnancy tests, though she had told doctors she wasn't having sex with men. She didn't know it at the time but what she was suffering from was an ovarian torsion, a rotation of the ovary that makes it impossible for blood to flow to it. She was experiencing the death of one of her organs. JUDD: There might be something called an impatient - pregnancy tests, doctors' whispers, my weeklong funk, sterile lubricants, discarded speculums. Every wear of morphine mimics a familiar morning, another dream of drowning in mucus, meeting a dead ovary. She floats in yellow, spits ovum into the poison and wrinkles black and mourning. PENMAN: Throughout this ordeal, Bettina kept thinking about an article she had read not long before she became ill about J. Marion Sims who operated on slave women in the 1840s. Anarcha, Betsey and Lucy began to haunt her morphine-fueled dreams. She tried to understand what was happening to her through their stories. JUDD: Nurses ask me how much does it hurt on a scale from 1 to 10? Anarcha Wescott, Betsey Harris and Lucy Zimmerman are taken into the care of a reluctant country surgeon in Montgomery, Ala. See blood on white hospital sheet - tell me I'm having menstrual cramps - Betsey's first birth. Send me home with oxycodone, ibuprofen - Lucy months out of household duties. After five hours in triage, Anarcha is first vesicovaginal fistula and another prescription. In these three, Sims shapes his speculum, invents his silver sutures, perfects protocol for proper handling of the female pelvis. We wake un-anesthetized or addicted to opium - children born, children disappeared - helpless - help. PENMAN: She kept being asked this question, what is your pain on a scale from 1 to 10? And she would ask herself, well, what is one? What is 10? If I say it's a 10, what will they think? They'll see me, a young African-American woman, alone. Will they think I'm looking for pain pills? I'll give it a seven. JUDD: Betsey invents the speculum fall 1845. Introducing the bent handle of the spoon, I saw everything as no man had ever seen before from \"The Story Of My Life\" by J. Marion Sims. I have bent in other ways to open the body, make space. More pliable than pewter, my skin may be less giving. Great discoveries are made on cushion lessons and hard falls. Sims invents the speculum. I invent the wincing, the if-you-must of it, the looking away, the here of discovery. (MUSIC)PENMAN: One day after multiple pelvic exams, after questions about her sexual history, after her answers not being believed, she had a moment of outburst. She said aloud in a roomful of doctors, gynecology was built on the backs of black women anyway. JUDD: To the patient, tears will only leave you wanting for water and more time, which, as you know, will be spent waiting. PENMAN: It's been 10 years since Bettina Judd had her ordeal with medicine. Next week, she'll be in Columbia, S. C. , and she's going to see statue of Sims, which she says she hopes will stay up for now until we have a conversation about who Sims was and who the women he operated on were, until there's a statue of Anarcha, Lucy and Betsey, the mothers of gynecology, a statue, she says, that she hopes will be bigger than the statue of Sims.

And they looked at medical textbooks to see how Sims was referred. He was referred as a father of modern gynecology, someone who perfected the surgical technique, but no discussion about his legacy in terms of conducting these experimental surgeries on enslaved women. So that's part of the problem. We can say that some of these surgeries that he did, women today are benefiting from, especially in poor countries. But at the same time, we can't forget how that came to be. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering as someone who is a physician herself, what do you think should be done with those statues? GAMBLE: You know, it's one of those things where I'm conflicted. If you had asked me this question last spring, I would have given you a different answer. And I'll tell you why I'm conflicted. Last summer, I went to Liverpool. And Liverpool has a remarkable international museum of slavery. And one of the things that I did when I was in Liverpool, I took a slavery history tour because Liverpool was at the center of the transatlantic slave trade. And on an art deco building, there was an image of Neptune - since it's Liverpool and water - and underneath Neptune, there were two black children who were in chains. And the tour guide, who was an 80-plus-year-old black gentleman, asked us do you think this should be taken down? And most people said yes. And he says I think it should stay. And he said I think it should stay because I don't want people to forget it happened. And so I think that we need to do something to commemorate the women, to add something to say, yes, Sims did this, but what about Anarcha? What about Lucy? What about Betsey? I think if we don't do that, that people will forget what happened to those women. So as a historian and as a teacher, I think that it's important for people to know what happened to those women. And if we whisk away these images of Sims, people will forget. VEDANTAM: How do you hear what these women were going through? So if you could speak to Anarcha and Lucy and Betsey, what do you think they would tell you? GAMBLE: I think the story they would tell me would not start with Sims. I think the story they would tell me would be about their lives as enslaved women. It would begin there. It would begin how there were times where if that baby had survived, that the baby would have been taken away from them. They would talk to me about how, as being black women, their bodies were used sexually, that they did not have consent and that what happened to them with Sims was part and parcel of what their lives were at that particular time. But I think the other thing they would want us to know is that they were human beings and that they also deserve their story to be memorialized, that we have statues of Sims in Columbia, S. C. , in New York City. There are portraits in medical schools of Sims. Where is their story? VEDANTAM: If you could build a memorial to Anarcha, Betsey and Lucy, or a memorial that stood alongside the memorials that we have erected to Marion Sims in South Carolina and New York City, what would the Memorial say? GAMBLE: The statute would not be of the experiments because I think that it's important not just to think of them as victims of these experiments. It might be with the three of them together. Or it might be with their holding children, that they were mothers, that they were women. So that would be part of it. So it would not be their prostrate on the altar of science. I think what the inscription would say is Betsey, Anarcha and Lucy, the mothers of modern gynecology. (MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Professor Vanessa Northington Gamble is a physician and medical historian at the George Washington University. When we come back, we'll hear a modern tale of race in medicine through the lens of poetry. Stay with us. (MUSIC) JUDD: In the woman, it is a checklist. Can you imagine anything worse than this? If the answer is no, ask again. VEDANTAM: Bettina Judd is a professor of gender and women's studies at the College of William and Mary. She's also a poet, and she recently wrote about a medical experience she had in a book called \"Patient. \" drawing not just on her personal history as a black woman but the stories of Anarcha, Betsey and Lucy. Producer Maggie Penman spoke to Bettina Judd and asked her to read some of her poetry. MAGGIE PENMAN: In 2006 in her first year of graduate school, Bettina Judd had what she calls an ordeal with medicine. She was driving home from her part-time job and had to pull over because of a sharp pain in her abdomen. JUDD: In 2006, I had an ordeal with medicine. I must've been found guilty of something. I don't feel innocent here lurking with ghosts. See, it happens like that. I started a thought that is quite benign and end up peccant, debased. I had an ordeal with medicine and was found innocent or guilty. It feels the same because I live in a haunted house. A house can be a dynasty, a bloodline, a body. There was punishment like the way the body is murdered by its own weight when lynched - not that I was wrong but that verdicts come in a bloodline. In 2006, I had an ordeal with medicine. To recover, I learned why ghosts come to me. The research question is why am I patient? PENMAN: Bettina Judd had to be patient as a doctor told her she was having menstrual cramps and sent her home with painkillers. A few days later, she was told she had a bladder infection and given antibiotics. She was repeatedly given pregnancy tests, though she had told doctors she wasn't having sex with men. She didn't know it at the time but what she was suffering from was an ovarian torsion, a rotation of the ovary that makes it impossible for blood to flow to it. She was experiencing the death of one of her organs. JUDD: There might be something called an impatient - pregnancy tests, doctors' whispers, my weeklong funk, sterile lubricants, discarded speculums. Every wear of morphine mimics a familiar morning, another dream of drowning in mucus, meeting a dead ovary. She floats in yellow, spits ovum into the poison and wrinkles black and mourning. PENMAN: Throughout this ordeal, Bettina kept thinking about an article she had read not long before she became ill about J. Marion Sims who operated on slave women in the 1840s. Anarcha, Betsey and Lucy began to haunt her morphine-fueled dreams. She tried to understand what was happening to her through their stories. JUDD: Nurses ask me how much does it hurt on a scale from 1 to 10? Anarcha Wescott, Betsey Harris and Lucy Zimmerman are taken into the care of a reluctant country surgeon in Montgomery, Ala. See blood on white hospital sheet - tell me I'm having menstrual cramps - Betsey's first birth. Send me home with oxycodone, ibuprofen - Lucy months out of household duties. After five hours in triage, Anarcha is first vesicovaginal fistula and another prescription. In these three, Sims shapes his speculum, invents his silver sutures, perfects protocol for proper handling of the female pelvis. We wake un-anesthetized or addicted to opium - children born, children disappeared - helpless - help. PENMAN: She kept being asked this question, what is your pain on a scale from 1 to 10? And she would ask herself, well, what is one? What is 10? If I say it's a 10, what will they think? They'll see me, a young African-American woman, alone. Will they think I'm looking for pain pills? I'll give it a seven. JUDD: Betsey invents the speculum fall 1845. Introducing the bent handle of the spoon, I saw everything as no man had ever seen before from \"The Story Of My Life\" by J. Marion Sims. I have bent in other ways to open the body, make space. More pliable than pewter, my skin may be less giving. Great discoveries are made on cushion lessons and hard falls. Sims invents the speculum. I invent the wincing, the if-you-must of it, the looking away, the here of discovery. (MUSIC) PENMAN: One day after multiple pelvic exams, after questions about her sexual history, after her answers not being believed, she had a moment of outburst. She said aloud in a roomful of doctors, gynecology was built on the backs of black women anyway. JUDD: To the patient, tears will only leave you wanting for water and more time, which, as you know, will be spent waiting. PENMAN: It's been 10 years since Bettina Judd had her ordeal with medicine. Next week, she'll be in Columbia, S. C. , and she's going to see statue of Sims, which she says she hopes will stay up for now until we have a conversation about who Sims was and who the women he operated on were, until there's a statue of Anarcha, Lucy and Betsey, the mothers of gynecology, a statue, she says, that she hopes will be bigger than the statue of Sims.

The reptiles are scrawny, weighing 80 percent of what they should. They grow slower, reproduce less and die younger. Amy Green of member station WMFE reports that researchers are trying to understand why this species is in decline and what it means for the Everglades. AMY GREEN, BYLINE: Laura Brandt's head swivels, the flashlight on her forehead slicing through the night's blackness. Two alligator eyes appear red and gleaming like lonely Christmas lights on a watery prairie. Brandt steers the airboat toward the gator. She slows the boat, and Frank Mazzotti reaches over its side, fastening a wired noose around the alligator's neck. The animal flails among the sawgrass of the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife refuge in South Florida. Brandt watches over Mazzotti's shoulder as the alligator struggles, ready to secure the animal's snout with electrical tape. The alligator spins in its death roll. LAURA BRANDT: That's their natural instinct of both trying to get away, fighting, and, when they catch prey, that's one of the things that they do. GREEN: Brandt and Mazzotti are part of a 15-member team of state and federal researchers. For more than a decade, they have ventured into the wilderness of the Everglades to catch and study alligators like this one. BRANDT: We've seen some alligators in some years that have been basically skin and bones, and when we get concerned is when we see multiple alligators like that. GREEN: Their research is part of the world's largest environmental restoration, a $17 billion effort that spans a region twice the size of New Jersey. They're monitoring alligators to see whether the restoration is working. Alligators are an indicator species of the Everglades, a watershed supporting dozens of federally threatened and endangered animals and the drinking water for more than a third of Floridians. The reptiles are responsive to environmental changes and influential as top predators and ecosystem engineers. They are easy for decision-makers and the public to understand and identify with. Researchers like Mazzotti say as the Everglades' 30-year restoration reaches its midpoint, the watershed still needs help. FRANK MAZZOTTI: The Everglades' food machine is broken. GREEN: Human interference with the so-called River of Grass's historic flow of water has disrupted the animal's food supply. Mazzotti says draining the Everglades upset the hydrology alligators depend on and that's why the restoration aims to resurrect a more natural flow. The watershed once spanned nearly all of South Florida. Today it's half of its former self, sustained by a complex, human-made system of canals, dams, water control points and pump stations. MAZZOTTI: We've screwed up that pattern that produced and concentrated food, meaning alligators are getting skinnier. BRANDT: OK. GREEN: Mazzotti and Brandt hoist the alligator into the air boat. The alligator is six feet long. Mazzotti inspects the animal's tail. This female actually is in good condition, unlike the many scrawny alligators the researchers have seen. MAZZOTTI: There would be no fat. This would be all sunken in and you'd be able to see the tail bone with, like, just the skin hanging on it and sunken in on the sides. GREEN: The alligator weighs 50 pounds. It groans. Finally the researchers free the animal. BRANDT: And she's ready to go.

Those little buzzing insects can also be blamed for dengue fever, West Nile virus, malaria and lots of other horrible afflictions, not to mention their tendency to ruin picnics. So we wondered, is there anything good about mosquitoes? To find out, we have reached Professor Nora Besansky on Skype. She is a mosquito expert at Notre Dame University. Hi there. NORA BESANSKY: Hi. How are you? SHAPIRO: Great. So are mosquitoes good for anything? BESANSKY: Yes, they're good for lots of things. For what it's worth, only about a hundred - less than a hundred species transmit those horrible diseases that you've referred to out of thousands of species that live on every continent except Antarctica. And what those mosquitoes are good for, they're food for fish and other insect predators and birds. They pollinate plants. SHAPIRO: Wait - they're pollinators? Really? I knew they were food, but, they're pollinators? BESANSKY: Yes, indeed. And, you know, it's only the males that take a blood meal from their hosts, and often those hosts have nothing to do with humans. So there are mosquitoes that feed on snakes, frogs, birds. Only less than a hundred are a problem for humans. SHAPIRO: Let me just play devil's advocate here. Is there anything that only eats mosquitoes, or if the mosquitoes disappeared, could the birds and the fish and the predatory insects and things just eat other things? BESANSKY: Wow. That's a pretty good question. I wouldn't want to guess the consequences of eradicating all 3,500 or 4,000 species of mosquitoes. What I do feel comfortable saying is that if we target only a single species that's the most important transmitter of, let's say, malaria in the world then I feel pretty comfortable saying it would only have good consequences. (Laughter). SHAPIRO: So we might not want to get rid of all 3,500 or 4,000 species of mosquito, but if, for example, we get rid of the Aedes Aegypti, which is the species that carries the Zika virus, you'd be OK with that? BESANSKY: I think that would be a very good outcome, yes. SHAPIRO: I know that generally scientists try not to place a value judgment on an entire species, but did I just hear you say that the Aedes Aegypti mosquito is a bad species? We can just stamp it with that label and get rid of it if possible? BESANSKY: Yes, you did hear me say that. (LAUGHTER)BESANSKY: You know, let's put this in perspective, shall we? The human race has probably been responsible - unknowingly, inadvertently - in eliminating hundreds of thousands of species, mainly rain forest ones, by destroying their habitats. So in perspective here, we're talking about a single species of mosquito that's responsible for quite a lot of disease transmission and suffering in the world. I think - there you go. No, I don't feel bad about saying we should get rid of that one species. SHAPIRO: That is biology professor and mosquito expert Nora Besansky speaking with us from Notre Dame University.

That's a major problem for one of the world's biggest wetlands. Now after decades of effort, restoration efforts are finally delivering more water. NPR's Greg Allen reports. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Bob Johnson has been involved with Everglades restoration since he started work at the national park three decades ago. He's a hydrologist by training, which he means he spends a lot of time thinking about water and how much flows through the park. BOB JOHNSON: On the western side, we're at about 10. 3 feet. And if we walk over here to the eastern side, the water level on this side is about seven and a half. So you've got almost a three-foot difference in water level. ALLEN: The difference is because of a road built through the heart of the Everglades nearly 90 years ago. U. S. Highway 41, also called Tamiami Trail. For many years, this was the main thoroughfare connecting Tampa to Miami - hence the name Tamiami. It's a road with a lot of history. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TAMIAMI TRAIL\")GENE AUSTIN: (Singing) There's a trail that's winding through the Everglades. ALLEN: The road, first proposed in 1915, took 13 years and a reported 3 million sticks of dynamite to complete. It also inspired a foxtrot, sung here by crooner Gene Austin. Jon Ullman, with the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, curated an exhibit on the road's history for the Coral Gables Museum. JON ULLMAN: This was all lime rock, so first you have to blast the lime rock. And then you create the road bed from there. And you also use the lime rock to build the levy to hold back the water. ALLEN: Although built as a road, it soon became apparent the Tamiami Trail also a dam, blocking water that flowed from Lake Okeechobee south through the Everglades to Florida Bay. As a result, in Everglades National Park, areas that used to be wet year-round now dry out for months at a time. Over decades, Bob Johnson says, a key part of the ecosystem dried up - organic peat soils. JOHNSON: As the peat soils disappeared, the vegetation community changes. We lose the food source for small fish and macroinvertebrates. ALLEN: On the north side of Tamiami Trail, a canal and a system of levees still hold back most of the water that otherwise would flow south through the park's sloughs and sawgrass marshes. Recently, for the first time in decades, more water began flowing south into an area that's long been parched. That's because a section of the highway has been removed and elevated. JOHNSON: We're standing at the eastern edge of the one-mile bridge. ALLEN: Just a small amount of additional water is moving south now. Once a second bridge is built and other projects come on line, the volume that flows into dry areas of the park will more than double. JOHNSON: So you won't see this artificial canal and the very rapid flow. You'll see very slow flow through the marsh back the way it's supposed to be. ALLEN: The river of grass. JOHNSON: The river of grass. ALLEN: When it's complete, around 2030, the $18 billion comprehensive Everglades restoration plan is expected to return nearly three-quarters of the flow the park received before the canals and the Tamiami Trail. That will help restore the ecosystem in the national park's one and a half million acres. But the Everglades once covered more than double that area. Dawn Shirreffs, with the Everglades Foundation, says the Everglades will never be what it once was. DAWN SHIRREFFS: We've lost about half of the natural ecosystem.  We'll never get that half back. It's developed. Most of us are living on land that was formerly Everglades. But we can stop hemorrhaging the existing Everglades. ALLEN: Ecosystem restoration is not for the impatient, its work measured not in years but decades. With climate change and sea level rise, Everglades restoration has taken on new urgency. Preserving the world's largest freshwater wetland is now seen as vital to protecting South Florida's drinking water supply. Greg Allen, NPR News, Miami.

It's developed. Most of us are living on land that was formerly Everglades. But we can stop hemorrhaging the existing Everglades. ALLEN: Ecosystem restoration is not for the impatient, its work measured not in years but decades. With climate change and sea level rise, Everglades restoration has taken on new urgency. Preserving the world's largest freshwater wetland is now seen as vital to protecting South Florida's drinking water supply.

One was a violinist, severely disabled in a car accident; another had a degenerative disease. None of them had enough control of their bodies to hold an instrument or even to speak. They wore caps, which read their brains' electrical impulses. Alongside them, four proxy musicians translated those impulses into an ever-changing melody. We gathered Eduardo Miranda and Elisa Bergersen to talk about the project. He harnessed the technology and she served as a proxy, playing the viola. I asked her exactly how - I asked exactly how everything worked. EDUARDO MIRANDA: We developed an interface that if someone wants to select, let's say, a melody that sounds, you know, is low or fast or whatever, then that person looks and then that choice is made. WERTHEIMER: What you appear to have done is you have discovered a way for them to choose a musical phrase from a choice of about four different ones. As I understand it, they are not imagining music in their minds. MIRANDA: No. WERTHEIMER: They are choosing a piece of music. MIRANDA: They are choosing - exactly. They choose what they see in front of them. Of course, because they are musicians and they have been - you know, some of them more professional than others - but they understand what they see because we provide little musical scores for them. So the choices they make are informed choices. They know what those things are going to sound like. WERTHEIMER: Now, Ms. Bergersen, you carry out the instruction that is sent to you by the computer through this complicated process of electronic signals. ELISA BERGERSEN: Yep, that's right. WERTHEIMER: Now, how does - what is the experience like? BERGERSEN: Well, each member of the quartet is paired up with a partner, and the four partners are the four patients. So what I see is what I'm being fed, obviously, by my musical partner. So the experience is very different from playing, let's say, a written score on a piece of paper as you would do normally because you never know what you're going to get. We did know the excerpts of music or the phrases of music that Eduardo had already composed previously. But we didn't know in which order we were going to get them or how many times we were going to get one of them. WERTHEIMER: (Laughter) So you're sort of doing a very fast sight-read of something that you've see before but you have no idea what it's going to sound like in combination with the other parts. BERGERSEN: That's right, yeah. And an actual fact - it's a more intense sight-read than normal because even if you're sight-reading a piece of music, you normally have 40 or 60 or 80 bars on one sheet. And even if you've only seen that sheet for two seconds, you can flick your eyes down the page and you can see how intense the music gets or parts where you may be resting. You know, you can get an idea of the piece even just by casting your eyes down the sheets whereas with this you can only see, let's say, two or four bars at a time, and you know nothing after that point. WERTHEIMER: (Laughter) So if I were standing there with the doctors and nurses in the back rows, I suppose, I would have seen four people with instruments and four people wearing funny hats and looking at computers. BERGERSEN: Yes, correct. WERTHEIMER: How did the audience respond to that? BERGERSEN: It was really emotional. It was really emotional because, as Eduardo said, you know, these four patients, they do have a musical background. They were all musically interested or experienced in some way. So for the audience to see them being able to perform, as it were, it was really moving. It was really - it was really emotional and there were a few tears (laughter) that I witnessed. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WERTHEIMER: Now, Dr. Miranda, you - you wrote the piece of music. MIRANDA: Yes, I did. Yeah, it's a. . . WERTHEIMER: When I mean you wrote, you wrote the original combination of phrases. right? MIRANDA: It's like a Rubik's cube, you know. . . WERTHEIMER: (Laughter). MIRANDA: . . . The way I designed it. I composed hundreds of those small phrases, and I laid a kind of a scaffold where those musical phrases would fall and then for each of those little beams, so to speak, in the scaffold, there were several options. So I more or less know what's going to happen, but this piece has millions of combinations, so it will always sound different. WERTHEIMER: Have they surprised you, your disabled musicians? Have they surprised you with what they do with the bits that you gave them? MIRANDA: Yes, they did. I think the thing that surprised me most is how quick they got to the idea. You know, I was thinking, oh, no, I'll have to explain this many times and I have to rehearse, I have to practice and so on and so on. It was nothing like that. We just got in. We just put the system in front of them and they already started doing it. Somehow, we enabled them to communicate emotions within themselves, and I think that was what moved us, Elisa was saying. You know, we were all moved when we saw this happening 'cause it was really magical. WERTHEIMER: Professor Eduardo Miranda of Plymouth University in the U. K. and Elisa Bergersen of the Bergersen Quartet, thank you both. BERGERSEN: Thank you. MIRANDA: Thank you.

It's due from government fines and court settlements that arose out of the 2010 BP oil spill. Just a fraction of that money has reached states so far. Some, but not all of it, is going to repair the damaged ecosystem. NPR's Debbie Elliott has more. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Let's start in Louisiana, where an already fragile and disappearing coastline took a direct hit from the BP disaster. Oil choked off vegetation that is critical to holding together what land is left. On a barrier island in the Gulf of Mexico, waves slap piles of concrete placed in the surf to slow the water's relentless battery. JONI TUCK: We are at Fourchon Beach. ELLIOTT: Joni Tuck is with the Greater Lafourche Port Commission. TUCK: This is on the Caminada Headlands, which was and has historically been one of the fastest eroding beach headlands in North America. ELLIOTT: It was down to a narrow strip held together by vegetation. TUCK: If you looked at it from above, there would've been, like, no sand. It would've just been marsh, mangroves, plants, ocean. ELLIOTT: The Gulf had cut through the marsh. And just beyond is Port Fourchon, the south Louisiana port responsible for about one-fifth of the nation's oil and gas production. To protect it, the state used $145 million from a criminal settlement stemming from the oil spill. Sand was barged in from offshore to build back 13 miles of beach. Tuck says it's the single largest coastal restoration project ever built in Louisiana, and shows how the billions coming from the BP spill can make a difference. TUCK: This is the best opportunity to put a down payment on our coast's future that we are ever going to get. ELLIOTT: Louisiana is in line for biggest share of fines and settlements because it had the most damage in the spill, and continues to. Tar balls still wash up on this barrier island and others. Wildlife and fisheries suffered. The state has a framework for using the money because it already had a long-term restoration plan to combat the coastal erosion crisis. Other states are not so focused. CYNTHIA SARTHOU: Mississippi and Alabama, in my opinion, are doing the worst. ELLIOTT: Cynthia Sarthou is director of the Gulf Restoration Network. She says the temptation is to use the money for pet economic projects instead of long-term environmental restoration. SARTHOU: I mean, I love the environment, but a lot of people live off the environment. And so for us, it's both critical to our way of life and to our economy. And this is an opportunity to do it right. ELLIOTT: Following the money isn't easy. It's coming from several places. There's the big $20 billion civil settlement between the federal government, states and BP. There were also criminal settlements topping $4 billion. Those deals have more oversight than clean up payments and economic damage claims BP paid directly to states and municipalities. Those monies have been steered to build a baseball stadium in Biloxi, Miss. , to plug a $200 million budget hole in Louisiana and to repair the state-owned governor's beach mansion in Alabama. In Florida, counties in the panhandle are worried that the legislature may soon lose their oil spill recovery funds. One project in Alabama is generating the most controversy, a beach lodge at a state park using $58 million set aside to restore natural resources. The beach lodge was not there during the oil spill in 2010, but had been destroyed by hurricane Ivan six years earlier. Overlooking a rare freshwater coastal lake in the Gulf State Park, project director Cooper Shattuck defends the plan. COOPER SHATTUCK: This is an environmental project. ELLIOTT: Shattuck says the hotel will compensate for the human use that was lost when tourists stopped coming to the Alabama Gulf Coast because of oiled waters and beaches. SHATTUCK: And the idea is that we have natural resources for a reason and that's for people to enjoy. ELLIOTT: Although federal and state agencies signed off on the hotel as a restoration of recreational use, a federal judge has halted the project, ruling in favor of the Gulf Restoration Network in a lawsuit that seeks to force the state to consider alternatives to the hotel. Alabama could appeal. Just as BP struggled to stop its oil gusher six years ago, states now struggle with what it means to make the Gulf Coast whole. Debbie Elliott, NPR News, Orange Beach, Ala.

Navy does pretty much the same thing. GPS and digital charts have become the norm aboard many of its vessels, but the Navy is worried about electronic warfare. So as NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports, it's returning to an ancient technique - navigating by the stars. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: It's a Monday at the U. S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. , and the midshipmen are getting ready for their first lecture on celestial navigation. DANIEL STAYTON: So raise your hand if you have ever determined your location on the planet using the stars. BRUMFIEL: Lt. Daniel Stayton is leading the class. A midshipmen halfheartedly put ups her hand. STAYTON: So at least one. All right, so I've got to stick to the truth then. I can't just make stuff up. BRUMFIEL: Right up until the mid-20th century, navigation on the sea was done by looking at the heavens above. But starting in the late 1970s, the military began launching GPS satellites and everything changed. In 2000, the U. S. Navy began phasing out sextants and charts in favor of computers. Rear Adm. Michael White is in charge of the Navy's training. MICHAEL WHITE: We do periodic reviews of our curriculum to make sure we're teaching the most appropriate material in the time allotted. We don't have infinite training time available. BRUMFIEL: Training became focused on the Navy's equivalent of Google Maps, something called the Voyage Management System. It uses GPS, radar and other tools to precisely track a ship's position and course across the ocean. But after a decade of focusing on electronic training, the Navy is reversing course, and there are a couple of reasons why. First, the U. S. military is increasingly worried it's overly reliant on GPS. BRIAN WEEDEN: We use it to synchronize all the military operations. We use it to navigate everywhere. It's - you know, it's just something that the U. S. military really can't live without. BRUMFIEL: Brian Weeden is with the Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit that studies security issues in outer space, where GPS satellites orbit. In a big war, the satellites could be shot down or, more likely, the GPS signal could be jammed or hacked. Already, jamming is becoming more common, Weeden says. WEEDEN: You can buy all kinds of GPS jammers off the Internet. Well, a lot of those are made by Russia. BRUMFIEL: He thinks the Russians probably have systems to jam the special signals the military uses as well. And China may be developing similar capabilities. Adm. White, who heads the Navy's training, says there's also a desire to get back to basics. Over the past decade, navigation systems on ships have gotten easier to use, so less training is required. He says the Navy is bringing back celestial navigation to make sure its officers understand the fundamentals. WHITE: You know, I would equate it to, like, blindly following the navigation system in your car. If you don't kind of have an understanding of north, south, you know, east, west or perhaps where you're going, it takes you to places you didn't intend to go. BRUMFIEL: In fact, there's been at least one incident in the past decade where a Navy ship ran aground in part, investigators say, because of problems with the electronic navigation system. Back in the classroom, the midshipmen are finishing up their first course. And frankly, they seem a little bewildered. Twenty-year-old Audrey Channell says until now, celestial navigation wasn't on her radar. AUDREY CHANNELL: I mean, obviously I've heard of, you know, in the old days using stars to navigate. But I never thought I'd actually be using it. BRUMFIEL: Like many of the other midshipmen in this class, she uses GPS in her daily life. Her instructor says, that's OK. No one is expecting these future officers to become Magellans overnight. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   You know, many of us rely on our smartphones to get from point A to point B.

I stood there for four and five seconds absorbing the situation I was in. And then I said a prayer and I jumped. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The PBS series \"American Experience\" tells Joseph Kittinger's story and those of the other participants in the Air Force programs in an episode called \"Space Men. \" Joseph Kittinger, who today is Col. Kittinger, joins us from member station WUCF in Orlando, Fla. Welcome, sir, to the program. KITTINGER: Thank you. I'm delighted to be here. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So take me back to that moment. You're standing on the precipice, you're about to do something that no man had ever done before. Tell me, what does it look like up there? You know, most of us will never go that high. KITTINGER: It's a beautiful view because you can see 450 miles at that altitude. But then as you look aloft about 10 or 15 degrees, the sky starts getting darker and darker. And as your eyes go up to 45 degrees or so, the sky's absolutely black. And it's daytime, so it's a very unusual situation to be in that in the daytime, it's black overhead. GARCIA-NAVARRO: There's that moment before you fall, and then of course there's the fall itself. What it that like, to go at that speed, hurtling towards the earth? KITTINGER: Well, first of all, you can't tell how fast you're going because there's nothing there to perceive, there's nothing there that you could look at to determine your velocity. But you know you're going fast as you accelerate 32 feet per second per second. And after about 20 seconds, I had reached internal velocity, which in my case was about 614 miles an hour. But it took me 4 minutes and 36 seconds to freefall down to about 14,000 feet, where I opened my main parachute. So it was - I was extremely busy. I was there as a test pilot, and I was a very, very busy person during that entire fall as I gathered data that we were there for. And the results were that when NASA started designing the Mercury project, we had already done a lot of the work that NASA would be facing. And we had answers to a lot of the questions that NASA had before they could design the Mercury program. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Colonel, you were part of this early wave of testing, and then the NASA space program comes into full effect and they're sending men into outer space. Did you feel left behind? Were you upset that this wasn't going to be a part of your future? KITTINGER: Oh, no. As a matter of fact, I was delighted that I had had the opportunity to contribute to it. I had the option to volunteer for the program. I opted not to because I was very much involved in research that needed to be done. So I was - I turned down the opportunity because I felt that what we were doing was valuable for the future of our space program. As a matter of fact, the small 5-foot diameter parachute that we used to stabilize my freefall is still being used today in every ejection seat in the world. So what we did some 50 year - 55 years ago is still being used today. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What do you think about space exploration now? It struck me watching this that it's lost its human component, in a way. We send these unmanned missions into deep space, but we haven't really pushed human boundaries, I think, for quite some time. KITTINGER: I personally think that we should go back to the moon as soon as we can because there's a lot of lessons we need to learn before we can go to Mars, which should be the next great human adventure. GARCIA-NAVARRO: May I ask you a question? As you were standing on the precipice, you said a prayer. What was that prayer? What were you praying for? KITTINGER: I said Lord, take care of me now. And then I jumped. And when the parachute opened, I said Lord, thank you for taking care of me. And it was the most vivid prayer I ever said in my life because I needed that support. There's one more part of the team that I was looking for, and I had a guardian angel that took care of me during that jump. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Joseph Kittinger appears in \"Space Men\" Tuesday on the PBS program \"American Experience. \" Colonel, thank you so very much for speaking with us. KITTINGER: Thank you. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:  Before NASA had its Mercury 7 astronauts, the Air Force was launching its own team into the stratosphere in balloons. Without the glamour or the budget of NASA, these early space scientists and test pilots performed extreme experiments that helped pave the way for the Mercury crew. Among them was Capt. Joseph Kittinger, who stepped from his balloon and into free fall from 103,000 feet above the ground. That's nearly 20 miles.

And then in this little plate above their face they can have black, brown or yellow, and various combinations of stripes and spots.

ADAM GRANT: He says, I've got this big idea. Three friends and I are going to start an online business, and we're going to disrupt an industry. Do you want to invest? VEDANTAM: But from what Adam could see, this group of friends wasn't doing so well in getting their big idea off the ground. GRANT: Six months go by. It's the day before launch. They still don't have a functioning website. The whole business is a website. That's literally all it is. And so I obviously passed on the investment. VEDANTAM: The name of the company? GRANT: Warby Parker - they were just named the most innovative company in the world by Fast Company. And they're worth over a billion dollars, which is why my wife handles all our investments now. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this week on HIDDEN BRAIN, originals - how to spot one; how to be one. We bring you my conversation with Adam Grant. He's a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. And he's the author of the new book \"Originals: How Non-Conformists Move The World. \" I asked Adam what the Warby Parker episode had taught him about the qualities of innovators. . . GRANT: They often procrastinate, and that's how they incubate ideas. VEDANTAM: . . . What parents can do to nurture originality in their kids. . . GRANT: Their parents focus more on values than rules. VEDANTAM: . . . And the downside of marching to the beat of your own drum. GRANT: One of the risks is, you know, you have everybody marching in a different direction. VEDANTAM: Well, looking back now, Adam, looking back - if you could go back and talk to the old Adam, what would you tell that Adam? GRANT: I would say that I was totally wrong about what it takes to be original. I think of original people as the nonconformists who drive creativity and change in the world. And I would say they often procrastinate, and that's how they incubate ideas. They feel the same fears and doubts that the rest of us do, they just manage them differently. They hate taking risks. And they have lots of bad ideas, and that's how they get to the good ones. VEDANTAM: I have to say, though, it's possible that when someone sits on an idea for six months, and they're an online company, and they don't have a website ready to go the day before launch, it is also possible that they could turn out to be a gigantic failure. GRANT: You're just trying to make me feel better about my decision, right? Would you have invested? VEDANTAM: I would not. GRANT: Yeah, I mean, of course it's possible that they would fail. But what I should have paid attention to is they also met all these other characteristics that originals tend to bring to the table. So a lot of times you see that originals are not the people with the deepest expertise. They're people with the broadest experience. And what was so great about Neil's background is he had been selling glasses in the developing world and also giving them away to try to help people who couldn't see get their lives in a place where they could work. And he had all sorts of exposure to the fact that you can make glasses a lot more cheaply than the monopolies here in the Western world were doing it. They were also really good at questioning the status quo. And this is a hallmark of being an original. A lot of people would just say, you know, glasses cost what they cost. You know, your doctor prescribes them and that's the end of it. And they had 60 years of combined experience wearing glasses. But suddenly one day, one of the founders, Dave, said, why do they cost so much? Like, they've been around for 800 years, and they're still more than an iPhone. That doesn't make sense. And once they did research into it, they found out that they could do a lot to lower the price. And I think that was a sign that they were going to take off. VEDANTAM: In your book, you find that the writer and poet T. S. Eliot, Google's cofounder Larry Page and the filmmaker Ava Duvernay all have something in common. When they have an opportunity to dive head-first into something, take a big risk, they actually hedge their bets and hesitate. So can you talk a little bit about that because it runs counter to the way we think that people who are true originals actually behave. GRANT: It does. I think what happens is they are afraid of failing just like you and I might be. And at first, when they have a new idea, they're not sure if it's going to succeed. They have no idea whether they can support a livelihood based on it. So T. S. Eliot - you know, poetry is not the most lucrative career. He works as a bank clerk to cover his bills and give himself the freedom to do something original as a poet. And, you know, I think Larry Page and Sergey were both in the position of saying, look, what we want to do is - we have lots of great ideas. VEDANTAM: They were Ph. D. students at Stanford at the time they came up with the idea for Google. GRANT: They were. And they thought search was bad. And they wrote an algorithm to do it better based on, you know, sort of pages linking to other pages being an indication that a page was popular. And they didn't see that as a career. They just, you know, kind of said, I know a better way to do this. And they built it. And they weren't ready to make the leap. They had visions of, you know, continuing to just create knowledge. VEDANTAM: And finish their Ph. D. s, as doubtless their parents would have wanted them to do. GRANT: Yeah, maybe still want them to do. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). GRANT: The great advantage of waiting to make that leap is you don't feel the pressure to rush it to market. If they were depending on this for their livelihood, they would have said, we need to get this search engine out there. We need to get it there now. And because they weren't doing that, it was easier to say, you know, let's get this right. VEDANTAM: And again, I mean, when you look at what people are doing in basements and in garages, this is what countless people do. I mean, they have a day job. They're working as an accountant. But they're playing in their garage or their basement and trying to build something new. GRANT: Yeah, it worked out OK for Phil Knight, right? He sold shoes out of the trunk of his car for seven years, working a day job as an accountant, before he finally started Nike. And he learned a lot in those seven years that increased his chances to succeed. VEDANTAM: So what makes the switch between the point at which you're sort of saying, I'm still tinkering, versus, I'm actually going? What happens to the people now who just procrastinate and think and plan and endlessly work in their garages and the people who say, I'm going to work in my garage for the first two, three, four, five, six years, but eventually I go out and test the waters? GRANT: I think what happens is the fear of failing gets overtaken by the fear of failing to try. And so, you know, if you have a great search engine, or you believe that a film you're making is going to change the world, then at some point you shift from worrying about, you know, regretting making a fool of yourself to regretting never taking a chance. And as you know, that's what psychologists consistently find about regret - that a lot of people are afraid in the moment of taking the risk, but that in the long run our biggest regrets are our inactions - the chances we didn't take. And they say, yeah, I might fail, but that's still better than failing to matter. VEDANTAM: One of the things you find the book that I found very intriguing is that very often, people who launch new ventures or new careers or new social innovations don't actually choose to do it themselves, but they are drafted by other people. GRANT: Yeah, I was so surprised by this. Michelangelo got commissioned to paint the Sistine Chapel. And he's looking up at this ceiling thinking, how in the world could I do that? And he's terrified, so he flees to Florence. And then he sort of gets coaxed back and talked into giving this a shot. Martin Luther King doesn't want to lead the civil rights revolution. His first dream is to be a pastor and then a college president. And he shows up at a meeting, and he's been voted unanimously to lead this movement, and basically dragged into it. VEDANTAM: And so what you find is often people then rising to the occasion when they're sort of placed in this position that's in some ways an unfamiliar position. GRANT: It is. And, you know, I think this is sometimes what makes them so effective at, you know, these leadership roles or at innovating that, you know, they've spent months or years stewing on these ideas. And they've hatched by the time that somebody pulls them into the spotlight. VEDANTAM: And that leads to the question, when you have an organization and you want to try and get the best talent, maybe the thing to do is not sort of to put a job ad out and see who applies for it but actually to be drafting people who might not on the surface seem like the ideal fit. GRANT: I think there's something to be said for that - that, you know, originality is brewing in all sorts of unexpected places. And so often as leaders what we do is we stifle that, as opposed to trying to unleash it. And, you know, there's a lot that can be done to try to figure out OK, who are the people that, you know, are in a position to bring really new ideas into this organization and why aren't we hearing from them? Susan Cain, the \"Quiet\" author, is fond of saying that there's zero correlation between who's the best talker and who has the best ideas. And that's a widely supported empirical finding. And, you know, I'd love to do a better job identifying that silent minority and giving them the floor. VEDANTAM: You have to ask how this reflects on our ongoing presidential campaign right now, where the ability to speak and to win public debates is seen, in some ways, as one of the major criteria to be president. GRANT: Yeah, you know, what I would love to see is a political system that's based more on skill in leading than it is on speaking. What I want to know is, what politicians are going to be the most effective decision-makers? Who is going to come up with the best strategic vision? Who has expertise in handling conflict? We don't see that right now. VEDANTAM: And I think we also look for people who want to step forward. We look for the person who puts up their hand. We look for the person who says, I'm the most qualified person. And of course, it's nice to hear initiative. It's nice to hear drive. But that might not actually be the best person for the job. GRANT: Yeah, the people that I'm most excited to vote for are the ones who have no interest in the job whatsoever. (Laughter)GRANT: I don't know how we get them on the stage. VEDANTAM: Right - because of course, having the most compelling speech doesn't necessarily qualify you to know what to do when there's a civil war in Syria. GRANT: I want to vote for the candidate who is willing to contradict him or herself, right, and admit to being wrong because, you know, some people call that flip-flopping - I think of it as enlightenment. VEDANTAM: I mean, of the people in your book who you look at, how many of them have that kind of evolution, if you will, where they sort of try something, it doesn't work, they try something, it doesn't work. And they're not actually rigid in their thinking, but they're actually open to being adaptable? GRANT: I think that's one of the hallmarks of being original is being flexible enough in your thinking to admit, you know, this was wrong or this was a bad idea, right? Abraham Lincoln, when he came into the presidency, he was initially not going to abolish slavery. He was afraid that it would destroy the union. And he agonized for six months over that decision before he finally signed the Emancipation Proclamation. He's a flip-flopper. That's one of the most important acts in history of this country. Thomas Edison, to go to the innovative domain - Edison worked on all sorts of failed inventions while he was trying to pioneer the lightbulb. He invented a talking doll so creepy that it scared not only kids but adults, too. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) A talking doll? GRANT: A talking doll - I've had nightmares looking at the picture of this. And. . . VEDANTAM: So it actually moved its mouth and words came out? GRANT: It did, yeah. This was a very early sort of pre-robot. But he tried to, you know - he tried to mine iron with magnets. He tried to preserve fruit with failing techniques. And he had to be willing to admit that these ideas were not working out to move on to the ones that did. VEDANTAM: But one of the things that this implies is that what distinguishes the great from the ordinary is not necessarily that the great only have great ideas, but that the great simply have many more ideas than the ordinary. GRANT: I think that's exactly the story, right? The greatest originals are the people who failed the most because they're the ones who tried the most. If you study this across lots of different domains, it's not that originals have higher hit rates than their peers. It's just they generate more volume, which gives them more variety and a better shot at something new. So Bach, Beethoven, Mozart - they were not, on average, in a typical composition, better than their peers. But they generated over 600 each - in some cases over 1,000 different compositions - and a few of those were true masterpieces. VEDANTAM: When you looked at the works of Shakespeare, you also found that at the very same time Shakespeare was writing some of his greatest masterpieces, he was also writing some of his greatest duds. GRANT: Yeah, have you heard of \"The Merry Wives Of Windsor? \" What about the \"Timon Of Athens? \" If Shakespeare were here today, he'd want us to know that around that time, he also wrote \"Hamlet\" and \"Macbeth. \"VEDANTAM: So what explains this? When the same person is sitting down and writing plays, or the same person is sitting down and doing inventions, how is it they're producing genius and crap at the same time? GRANT: One, because a lot of us fall in love with our first ideas, and those are the most conventional. Often, you have to weed out the familiar in order to get to the unusual. But a lot of people never get to those later ideas. The second thing is it's just really hard to judge your own ideas. Most of us are way too positive on the ideas we come up with. And oftentimes, they need to put a bunch of ideas out in the world to get feedback and find out what actually made sense. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if the same thing is true of Shakespeare. If we actually sat Shakespeare down the year after he wrote \"The Merry Wives Of Windsor\" and \"Macbeth,\" is it possible that he might have told us, you know, \"Macbeth,\" it's OK, but \"The Merry Wives Of Windsor,\" that's the masterpiece? GRANT: You know, this is so common among originals. I can't tell you what Shakespeare would have said, obviously, because he didn't answer my interview request. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). GRANT: . . . But, you know, you see this with scientists all the time that frequently their least cited works are the ones that they think are the greatest. And Beethoven - Beethoven was known as a great self-critic, and yet he was pretty far off the mark in predicting which of his pieces were going to be his biggest hits and his biggest flops. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: My guest today is Adam Grant. He's a professor at the Wharton School. Coming up, we talk about who gets the chance to be original and how parents can foster this quality in their kids. VEDANTAM: Hey, listeners. We're collecting stories this month about coincidences. What's the most surprising coincidence that's ever happened to you? Call us and leave your story at (661) 772-7246. That's 661-77-BRAIN. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: My guest today is Adam Grant. Adam, thank you for joining me on HIDDEN BRAIN. GRANT: Thanks for having me. VEDANTAM: I want to look a little bit at perhaps what might be called the dark side of originality - or maybe the dark side is not the right word. It's more that the benefits of originality are not distributed equally in our society. GRANT: Yeah, I think this is a great tragedy that we see both women and racial minority groups being less likely to speak up when they have original ideas. Sheryl Sandberg and I wrote an op-ed about this last year called \"Speaking While Female. \" And we covered a bunch of evidence, including some of - some studies that I ran showing that when men spoke up, they were rewarded for it. And when women spoke up, either they were barely heard, and usually some dude, like, sort of wanders in and steals credit for their idea, or they were judged as too aggressive in violating these communal, caring stereotypes we have of women. And I think those stereotypes lead a lot of women to hold back because they're afraid of backlash. And I think that we need many more organizations, and I think people in the world, to check their biases and be receptive to both women and minority groups bringing their ideas to the table. VEDANTAM: But you have to wonder how many great ideas are not being put on the table at all because people feel hesitant to talk about them. GRANT: Yeah, I think we're missing out on the majority of the original ideas in the world, not because people aren't creative, but because there's a gap between the ideas you have and the ones that you share. And if you go back to this idea about the volume of ideas, sort of creativity relationship that we talked about earlier, you know, history is obviously full of examples of men doing the majority of the original work in certain fields. And that's largely because they had the freedom to work on lots of ideas, whereas women were primarily, you know, working on child care. And they had a hard time getting their ideas heard. VEDANTAM: In the book, you talk about the idea that birth order - whether you have older siblings or younger siblings - might play a role in your willingness to take chances. Can you talk about that work? GRANT: This is wildly controversial. I don't think I've ever seen another realm of social science with more competing results. But there are a series of studies suggesting that firstborns tend to be slightly more conventional achievers, whereas laterborns (ph) are more inclined to challenge the status quo and do things that are a little bit original. And get this. So you look at over 300 pairs of brothers who played professional baseball. And that way you get to do the test within families. And you see that younger brothers are more than 10 times more likely to attempt to steal a base than their older siblings. So why is that? I think that one factor - the popular explanation from Frank Sulloway is that it's about niche-picking - that, you know, it's hard to stand out by being smarter or stronger than your older siblings. They have a clear advantage academically and athletically. So what you do is you look for other ways to stand out. And one of those is to take risks or be creative. I think the other part of the story, though, is that parents tend to give more freedom to their later-born children. VEDANTAM: What is the way you train people to be original? What is the way you encourage originality in a company, in an organization, in a family? GRANT: Let's start with the family side of it. If you study some of the - America's most original architects and compare them with technically skilled but less creative peers, one of the things that happened in the families of the creative architects was their parents focused more on values than rules. And they would say things like, you know, excellence is important in this family; what kind of success do you want to achieve? Or, we really care about our actions having an impact on others; what sort of mark would you like to make on the world around you? And when their kids grew up, they had a very clear set of guiding principles. They were willing to stand their ground when other people didn't agree with them. And they also thought a lot about not just creative self-expression, but saying, how can I do something that's useful to other people? VEDANTAM: But why is it that rules-based behavior doesn't produce the same thing as values-based advice? GRANT: When you focus on rules in a family, a lot of times kids learned to follow them, which means accepting the status quo and essentially becoming an excellent sheep. And when you go to values, kids actually have to think for themselves. What's - you know, this is funny as a parent, right, because I - after reading this research, I'm constantly catch myself, every time our kids misbehave, saying, new rule, and then realizing, nope, we should be talking about what's the value behind this rule? VEDANTAM: Give me an example where that's happened recently. GRANT: All right, so we're sitting at dinner, and, you know, one of our family values is respect. So we like for them to not get up from the dinner table before everyone's done eating. And, you know, they start to get up. And I was like, no, you must sit in your seat. And then I start to realize, well, what I need to say is here's why that's important to us, right? It's not about having the rule, it's about saying, look, the reason we like to all sit in our seats is because we want everybody to share a nice family meal, and we think that's a great way to have, you know, respect for each other. VEDANTAM: So I think when you talk about originality and creativity, there's a great hunger in our society to want to raise people, to want to have employees, be original and be creative. Are there downsides to originality and creativity? GRANT: Yeah, of course. A few years ago, Barry Schwartz and I wrote a paper on the too-much-of-a-good-thing effect, where we basically argued that all strengths and virtues are like Goldilocks, where you can have too much as well as too little. And there's no question that with originality, that can be true. One of the risks is that, you know, you have everybody marching in a different direction. And, you know, pioneers need settlers. Leaders need followers. If everybody's an original, then, you know, you don't have anyone to help implement your ideas. But I think the opposite is a greater risk. If everybody conforms, then we lose out on great ways to improve the world around us. And I don't want people to conform, which is basically saying, I will go along with your idea even though I don't believe in it. I want them to think for themselves and sometimes decide that other people's ideas are worth following. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Adam Grant, thank you so much for joining me on HIDDEN BRAIN today. GRANT: Such a delight.

SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Adam Grant was teaching his first class at the Wharton business school when a student came up to him with an interesting proposition. ADAM GRANT: He says, I've got this big idea. Three friends and I are going to start an online business, and we're going to disrupt an industry. Do you want to invest? VEDANTAM: But from what Adam could see, this group of friends wasn't doing so well in getting their big idea off the ground. GRANT: Six months go by. It's the day before launch. They still don't have a functioning website. The whole business is a website. That's literally all it is. And so I obviously passed on the investment. VEDANTAM: The name of the company? GRANT: Warby Parker - they were just named the most innovative company in the world by Fast Company. And they're worth over a billion dollars, which is why my wife handles all our investments now. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this week on HIDDEN BRAIN, originals - how to spot one; how to be one. We bring you my conversation with Adam Grant. He's a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. And he's the author of the new book \"Originals: How Non-Conformists Move The World. \" I asked Adam what the Warby Parker episode had taught him about the qualities of innovators. . . GRANT: They often procrastinate, and that's how they incubate ideas. VEDANTAM: . . . What parents can do to nurture originality in their kids. . . GRANT: Their parents focus more on values than rules. VEDANTAM: . . . And the downside of marching to the beat of your own drum. GRANT: One of the risks is, you know, you have everybody marching in a different direction. VEDANTAM: Well, looking back now, Adam, looking back - if you could go back and talk to the old Adam, what would you tell that Adam? GRANT: I would say that I was totally wrong about what it takes to be original. I think of original people as the nonconformists who drive creativity and change in the world. And I would say they often procrastinate, and that's how they incubate ideas. They feel the same fears and doubts that the rest of us do, they just manage them differently. They hate taking risks. And they have lots of bad ideas, and that's how they get to the good ones. VEDANTAM: I have to say, though, it's possible that when someone sits on an idea for six months, and they're an online company, and they don't have a website ready to go the day before launch, it is also possible that they could turn out to be a gigantic failure. GRANT: You're just trying to make me feel better about my decision, right? Would you have invested? VEDANTAM: I would not. GRANT: Yeah, I mean, of course it's possible that they would fail. But what I should have paid attention to is they also met all these other characteristics that originals tend to bring to the table. So a lot of times you see that originals are not the people with the deepest expertise. They're people with the broadest experience. And what was so great about Neil's background is he had been selling glasses in the developing world and also giving them away to try to help people who couldn't see get their lives in a place where they could work. And he had all sorts of exposure to the fact that you can make glasses a lot more cheaply than the monopolies here in the Western world were doing it. They were also really good at questioning the status quo. And this is a hallmark of being an original. A lot of people would just say, you know, glasses cost what they cost. You know, your doctor prescribes them and that's the end of it. And they had 60 years of combined experience wearing glasses. But suddenly one day, one of the founders, Dave, said, why do they cost so much? Like, they've been around for 800 years, and they're still more than an iPhone. That doesn't make sense. And once they did research into it, they found out that they could do a lot to lower the price. And I think that was a sign that they were going to take off. VEDANTAM: In your book, you find that the writer and poet T. S. Eliot, Google's cofounder Larry Page and the filmmaker Ava Duvernay all have something in common. When they have an opportunity to dive head-first into something, take a big risk, they actually hedge their bets and hesitate. So can you talk a little bit about that because it runs counter to the way we think that people who are true originals actually behave. GRANT: It does. I think what happens is they are afraid of failing just like you and I might be. And at first, when they have a new idea, they're not sure if it's going to succeed. They have no idea whether they can support a livelihood based on it. So T. S. Eliot - you know, poetry is not the most lucrative career. He works as a bank clerk to cover his bills and give himself the freedom to do something original as a poet. And, you know, I think Larry Page and Sergey were both in the position of saying, look, what we want to do is - we have lots of great ideas. VEDANTAM: They were Ph. D. students at Stanford at the time they came up with the idea for Google. GRANT: They were. And they thought search was bad. And they wrote an algorithm to do it better based on, you know, sort of pages linking to other pages being an indication that a page was popular. And they didn't see that as a career. They just, you know, kind of said, I know a better way to do this. And they built it. And they weren't ready to make the leap. They had visions of, you know, continuing to just create knowledge. VEDANTAM: And finish their Ph. D. s, as doubtless their parents would have wanted them to do. GRANT: Yeah, maybe still want them to do. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). GRANT: The great advantage of waiting to make that leap is you don't feel the pressure to rush it to market. If they were depending on this for their livelihood, they would have said, we need to get this search engine out there. We need to get it there now. And because they weren't doing that, it was easier to say, you know, let's get this right. VEDANTAM: And again, I mean, when you look at what people are doing in basements and in garages, this is what countless people do. I mean, they have a day job. They're working as an accountant. But they're playing in their garage or their basement and trying to build something new. GRANT: Yeah, it worked out OK for Phil Knight, right? He sold shoes out of the trunk of his car for seven years, working a day job as an accountant, before he finally started Nike. And he learned a lot in those seven years that increased his chances to succeed. VEDANTAM: So what makes the switch between the point at which you're sort of saying, I'm still tinkering, versus, I'm actually going? What happens to the people now who just procrastinate and think and plan and endlessly work in their garages and the people who say, I'm going to work in my garage for the first two, three, four, five, six years, but eventually I go out and test the waters? GRANT: I think what happens is the fear of failing gets overtaken by the fear of failing to try. And so, you know, if you have a great search engine, or you believe that a film you're making is going to change the world, then at some point you shift from worrying about, you know, regretting making a fool of yourself to regretting never taking a chance. And as you know, that's what psychologists consistently find about regret - that a lot of people are afraid in the moment of taking the risk, but that in the long run our biggest regrets are our inactions - the chances we didn't take. And they say, yeah, I might fail, but that's still better than failing to matter.

And. . . VEDANTAM: So it actually moved its mouth and words came out? GRANT: It did, yeah. This was a very early sort of pre-robot. But he tried to, you know - he tried to mine iron with magnets.

What's the most surprising coincidence that's ever happened to you? Call us and leave your story at (661) 772-7246. That's 661-77-BRAIN. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: My guest today is Adam Grant. Adam, thank you for joining me on HIDDEN BRAIN. GRANT: Thanks for having me. VEDANTAM: I want to look a little bit at perhaps what might be called the dark side of originality - or maybe the dark side is not the right word. It's more that the benefits of originality are not distributed equally in our society. GRANT: Yeah, I think this is a great tragedy that we see both women and racial minority groups being less likely to speak up when they have original ideas. Sheryl Sandberg and I wrote an op-ed about this last year called \"Speaking While Female. \" And we covered a bunch of evidence, including some of - some studies that I ran showing that when men spoke up, they were rewarded for it. And when women spoke up, either they were barely heard, and usually some dude, like, sort of wanders in and steals credit for their idea, or they were judged as too aggressive in violating these communal, caring stereotypes we have of women. And I think those stereotypes lead a lot of women to hold back because they're afraid of backlash. And I think that we need many more organizations, and I think people in the world, to check their biases and be receptive to both women and minority groups bringing their ideas to the table. VEDANTAM: But you have to wonder how many great ideas are not being put on the table at all because people feel hesitant to talk about them. GRANT: Yeah, I think we're missing out on the majority of the original ideas in the world, not because people aren't creative, but because there's a gap between the ideas you have and the ones that you share. And if you go back to this idea about the volume of ideas, sort of creativity relationship that we talked about earlier, you know, history is obviously full of examples of men doing the majority of the original work in certain fields. And that's largely because they had the freedom to work on lots of ideas, whereas women were primarily, you know, working on child care. And they had a hard time getting their ideas heard. VEDANTAM: In the book, you talk about the idea that birth order - whether you have older siblings or younger siblings - might play a role in your willingness to take chances. Can you talk about that work? GRANT: This is wildly controversial. I don't think I've ever seen another realm of social science with more competing results. But there are a series of studies suggesting that firstborns tend to be slightly more conventional achievers, whereas laterborns (ph) are more inclined to challenge the status quo and do things that are a little bit original. And get this. So you look at over 300 pairs of brothers who played professional baseball. And that way you get to do the test within families. And you see that younger brothers are more than 10 times more likely to attempt to steal a base than their older siblings. So why is that? I think that one factor - the popular explanation from Frank Sulloway is that it's about niche-picking - that, you know, it's hard to stand out by being smarter or stronger than your older siblings. They have a clear advantage academically and athletically. So what you do is you look for other ways to stand out. And one of those is to take risks or be creative. I think the other part of the story, though, is that parents tend to give more freedom to their later-born children. VEDANTAM: What is the way you train people to be original? What is the way you encourage originality in a company, in an organization, in a family? GRANT: Let's start with the family side of it. If you study some of the - America's most original architects and compare them with technically skilled but less creative peers, one of the things that happened in the families of the creative architects was their parents focused more on values than rules. And they would say things like, you know, excellence is important in this family; what kind of success do you want to achieve? Or, we really care about our actions having an impact on others; what sort of mark would you like to make on the world around you? And when their kids grew up, they had a very clear set of guiding principles. They were willing to stand their ground when other people didn't agree with them. And they also thought a lot about not just creative self-expression, but saying, how can I do something that's useful to other people? VEDANTAM: But why is it that rules-based behavior doesn't produce the same thing as values-based advice? GRANT: When you focus on rules in a family, a lot of times kids learned to follow them, which means accepting the status quo and essentially becoming an excellent sheep. And when you go to values, kids actually have to think for themselves. What's - you know, this is funny as a parent, right, because I - after reading this research, I'm constantly catch myself, every time our kids misbehave, saying, new rule, and then realizing, nope, we should be talking about what's the value behind this rule? VEDANTAM: Give me an example where that's happened recently. GRANT: All right, so we're sitting at dinner, and, you know, one of our family values is respect. So we like for them to not get up from the dinner table before everyone's done eating. And, you know, they start to get up. And I was like, no, you must sit in your seat. And then I start to realize, well, what I need to say is here's why that's important to us, right? It's not about having the rule, it's about saying, look, the reason we like to all sit in our seats is because we want everybody to share a nice family meal, and we think that's a great way to have, you know, respect for each other. VEDANTAM: So I think when you talk about originality and creativity, there's a great hunger in our society to want to raise people, to want to have employees, be original and be creative. Are there downsides to originality and creativity? GRANT: Yeah, of course. A few years ago, Barry Schwartz and I wrote a paper on the too-much-of-a-good-thing effect, where we basically argued that all strengths and virtues are like Goldilocks, where you can have too much as well as too little. And there's no question that with originality, that can be true. One of the risks is that, you know, you have everybody marching in a different direction. And, you know, pioneers need settlers. Leaders need followers. If everybody's an original, then, you know, you don't have anyone to help implement your ideas. But I think the opposite is a greater risk. If everybody conforms, then we lose out on great ways to improve the world around us. And I don't want people to conform, which is basically saying, I will go along with your idea even though I don't believe in it. I want them to think for themselves and sometimes decide that other people's ideas are worth following.

At five feet, it's America's tallest bird. Its wingspan is more than seven feet. Whooping cranes almost went extinct, but biologists bred them in captivity. And for years now, they've been trying to reintroduce them into the wild. But as NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, scientists have run into some unexpected problems. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Joe Duff calls himself an avian aviator. For years, he's been flying his one-man, ultra-light aircraft alongside whooping cranes that have been bred in captivity. He teaches them how to migrate between Wisconsin and Florida. The young birds follow him because they think he's an adult crane. This spectacle draws crowds of craniacs (ph), who follow the migration and videotape Duff and the snowy white birds as they fly overhead. But Duff says videotape can't begin to capture the feeling of actually flying with these huge birds almost within arm's reach. JOE DUFF: When you have this bird with an eight-foot wingspan right off your wingtip, you know, and you're a thousand feet up and they're all around you, it's just - you know, the sun is shining on themJOYCE: Duff is a burly, dark-haired Canadian who grew up wondering the north woods. Biologists approached him 15 years ago and said, we've bred a few eastern whooping cranes in captivity. Now, we want pilots to teach them how to migrate so that they can be real wild whooping cranes again. It was called Operation Migration. DUFF: Oh, it's changed me completely. It's just spectacular to watch a creature like that. I mean, their species has been migrating for millions of years. JOYCE: It was a terribly hard experiment, though. Biologists breed the birds at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland. Every person involved wears long, white coats and hoods. They even wear phony beaks. The aim is to keep the birds from imprinting on humans. They want the birds to consider the ultra-light aircraft and its pilot as their leader. DUFF: You become, actually, part of their social structure. You're the dominant bird. You're the parent bird within the flock. JOYCE: But this February, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service canceled the project. Yes, the birds did learn to fly the eastern migration - about a hundred of them do it now on their own - but migrating wasn't the problem - reproducing was. I went to Patuxent to find out what happened. I walked through snow and up a flight of wooden stairs to a shack - a bird blind. Through an open window, I could see leggy whoopers standing elegantly in fenced-in enclosures - and hear them. SARAH CONVERSE: They're good looking bird, aren't they? JOYCE: Patuxent biologist Sarah Converse helps breed the whoopers. She was exhilarated to see them actually migrate, but devastated to discover that once they arrived at their breeding grounds in Wisconsin, they just didn't breed well on their own. CONVERSE: We have two separate problems. One, the eggs don't make it. Two, even if the eggs make it, the chicks don't make it. JOYCE: The cranes mate OK, but fewer than 1 in 10 reproducing pairs actually raises a chick that lives more than four months. CONVERSE: It's not like we're almost there with reproduction. We're not really anywhere close. And so it sort of suggests that there's something wrong with the birds and the way they behave. JOYCE: They may not be staying with the eggs long enough, or they don't know how to protect the eggs or the newly hatched chicks from predators. But then, how would they know? John French, the biologists who runs the crane program at Patuxent, isn't terribly surprised that the captive-bred birds are confused. They were raised by humans, and even if the humans wear white robes and beaks and fly with the birds, they're still humans. JOHN FRENCH: It's a very odd experience for the bird. They would never do that in the wild. And we really don't know how that affects the birdJOYCE: So after 15 years, the scientific team has stopped the flight training. It requires too much interaction between chicks and humans and not enough with their avian parents. The biologists fear the chicks are missing some lesson about how to be good parents themselves. Or, says French, captive-bred birds may become genetically different from birds in the wild and lack some crucial gene for good parenting. Whatever the case, French says it's a lesson on how difficult it is for people to re-create something that took millions of years of evolution to make. FRENCH: I think we're finding out that the ark that we've built, you know, might not be the best way to preserve them, or we might have to think of a different kind of ark. Our goal here now is to step back as far as we can from that human-bird interaction and allow the bird to, you know, develop as a bird. JOYCE: So now, the chicks will stay with their parents in Patuxent for their first year, then they'll be transported to their breeding sites in Wisconsin, and nature will take its course. As for migrating back south, there are enough mature birds now to teach the newbies the flight path. As for Joe Duff and Operation Migration, the end of his career as an avian aviator is hard to take, especially his last flight with the cranes, February 6. The wind was too strong to fly, but he tried anyway and got forced down. He wrote this about the end of the project and that last flight. DUFF: I mean, it's the proper thing to do, but somehow it should have ended differently. There should have been clear skies, a colorful sunrise, a string of courageous birds off my wingtip. But nature doesn't work that way, and I should have known better. JOYCE: Christopher Joyce, NPR News. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   When a whooping crane stands up, you notice.

I'm Guy Raz. So a few weeks ago, we were talking with a research scientist named Sophie Scott. SOPHIE SCOTT: Hi, speaking. RAZ: Sophie works in London. . . SCOTT: Are we live or is this recorded? RAZ: . . . And we were recording, of course. SCOTT: Fantastic. Just thought I'd check. RAZ: It would be crazy if it was live - and now let's take your calls for Sophie Scott. SCOTT: (Laughter). RAZ: Let's open up the lines. SCOTT: (Laughter). RAZ: OK, now, that sound. . . SCOTT: (Laughter). RAZ: What happens to your brain when you hear that is exactly what Sophie studies as a cognitive neuroscientist. SCOTT: So I study - I study human brains, but I'm interested in what we're doing right now. You know, we can't see each other but we are having, you know, perfectly fluent conversation. RAZ: Yeah, right. SCOTT: And I'm interested in how that goes on in terms of perception and production. And I'm interested in the verbal stuff that we do and also in the other noises we make with our mouths. RAZ: And one noise in particular that Sophie focuses on is laughter and why like a cold or even a yawn, there's something contagious about. SCOTT: So yawning is very like laughter in this respect. You can catch it from somebody, and you're much more likely to catch it from somebody you know than someone you don't know. RAZ: OK, so to set this up a little bit more, you might remember this viral video that went around a couple years back. SCOTT: Is this where somebody starts to laugh when a woman's reading something on her phone? RAZ: Right. Basically, this was an improv group in Berlin and they filmed a stunt on the Metro train there. One lady is looking at her phone and she sees something funny, so she shows it to a friend and they start laughing. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Laughter). RAZ: (Laughter) And then somebody else around her starts laughing. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Laughter). SCOTT: It's lovely (laughter). RAZ: This is a packed train. Now, Germans are not - you know, they're kind of serious. They're, like, reading their papers. SCOTT: (Laughter) They're not hilarious fins, yeah. RAZ: Slowly but surely, even though the rest of the passengers can't see the first woman's phone and don't know what she's laughing at, the laughter spreads and spreads. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Laughter). RAZ: And Sophie says even though the initial spark of laughter was staged and planned, the spread. . . (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Laughter). RAZ: . . . That was real. SCOTT: You can go from very staged laughter, very polite laughter, very social laughter through to genuinely helpless, involuntary laughter along that same route 'cause laughter just primes laughter. If you look at anywhere in the world where if you want people to laugh. . . (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Laughter). SCOTT: . . . You get them laughing and then you keep them going. RAZ: And this part, cognitive neuroscientists like Sophie Scott, they understand it pretty well - laughter, it spreads. But what we understand less is why. Here's Sophie on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SCOTT: I'm going to talk to you today about laughter. And in terms of the science of laughter, there isn't very much. But there's - it does turn out that pretty much everything we think we know about laughter is wrong. So it's not at all unusual, for example, to hear people say humans are the only animals that laugh. Nature thought, oh, humans are the only animals that laugh. In fact, you find laughter throughout the mammals as being well described and well observed in primates, but you also see it in rats. And wherever you find it - humans, primates, rats - you find it associated with things like tickling, and that's the same for humans. You find it associated with play, and all mammals play. And wherever you find it, it's associated with interactions. So Robert Provine, who's done a lot of work on this, has pointed out that you are 30 times more likely to laugh if you are with somebody else than if you're on your own. And where you find most laughter is in social interactions like conversation. So if you ask human beings when do you laugh, they'll talk about comedy and they'll talk about humor, and they'll talk about jokes. If you look at when they laugh, they're laughing with their friends. And when we laugh with people, we're hardly ever actually laughing at jokes. You are laughing to show people that you understand them, that you agree with them, that you're part of the same group as them. You're laughing to show that you like them. You might even love them. You're doing all that at the same time as talking to them. And in fact, the laughter is doing a lot of that emotional work for you. RAZ: It's the kind of laughter you experience maybe late at night when you're a little slaphappy with your friends because that kind of laughter, the kind of laughter we heard on that train in Berlin. . . (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Laughter). RAZ: . . . It's just another way we have of saying. . . >>SCOTT I know you. I like you. RAZ: Yeah. SCOTT: I've got something in common with you. I want to hang out with you. A lot of this sort of mirroring of other people's behavior like you're guessing - behavioral contagion. It's always got a positive meaning. And in fact, if you look within conversations, you and I will have started to breathe at the same time as soon as we started speaking. We didn't decide to do this. We just have to do it, actually, to have a conversation. We have to coordinate our breath. What you'll also find is the more you like the person you're talking to, the more you'll align other things as well. So you'll start to use the same words as them, you'll start to use the same grammatical structures as them. RAZ: Oh, my God. SCOTT: You don't do that if you don't like somebody, to put it perfectly honest. You do it when you like someone. You know, you kind of got that social link. RAZ: On the show today, exploring those social links, How Things Spread - trying to understand how emotions, disease, even ideas themselves spread among us and tie us together. But first, back to Sophie Scott and a really interesting part of her research on laughter, which she presented on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SCOTT: Now, something I've got very interested in is different kinds of laughter. And we have some neurobiological evidence about how human beings vocalize that suggests there might be two kinds of laughs that we have. So it seems possible that the neurobiology for helpless, involuntary laughter might have a different basis to it than some of that more polite social laughter that you encounter, which isn't horrible laughter, but it's some of these behaviors somebody is doing as part of their communicative act to you - part of their interaction with you. They are sort of choosing to do this. So I've been looking at this in more detail. And to do this, we've had to make recordings of people laughing, and we've just had to do whatever it takes to make people laugh. And we got those same people to produce more posed social laughter. So instead, imagine your friend told a joke and you're laughing 'cause you like you friend but not, you know, not really 'cause the joke's all that. So I'm going to play you a couple of those. I want you to tell me if you think this laughter is real laughter or if you think it's posed. So is this involuntary laughter or more voluntary laughter? (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)SCOTT: (Laughter). What does that sound like to you? Posed? UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Posed. SCOTT: Posed. How about this one? (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)SCOTT: (Laughter). I'm the best. (LAUGHTER)SCOTT: Now, that was helpless laughter. And in fact, to record that, all they had to do was record me watching one of my friends listening to something that I knew she wanted to laugh at. And I just started doing this. Now, what you find is that people are good at telling the difference between real and posed laughter. They seem to be different things to us. We took it into the scanner to see how brains respond when you hear laughter. And what it seems to be the case, when you hear somebody laughing involuntarily, you hear sounds you would never hear in any other context. It's very unambiguous. And it seems to be associated to be greater auditory processing of these novel sounds. In contrast, when you hear somebody laughing in a posed way, what you see are these regions which are occupying brain areas associated with mentalizing, thinking about what somebody else is thinking. And I think what that means is even if you're having your brain scanned, which is completely boring and not very interesting, when you hear somebody going (laughter), you're trying to work out where they're laughing. RAZ: OK, so I get that laughter is always meaningful and that something's going on in the brain, right? But we don't really understand why it's contagious - right? - I mean, like, why it spreads. SCOTT: No, no, and we know that it is, we know that it happens, we know that it is contagious - but clearly can't be the whole story. We know it's more complex than that. And we don't really understand, you know, (unintelligible) the time course. People always laugh at the end of sentences, for example, and they really coordinate their laughter very tightly to do that. So it's not just contagious, it's actually being really highly orchestrated. Whereas the timescale of spontaneous, helpless laughter can actually be quite slow. People can hear something that makes them start to laugh and then a few beats later, they start really laughing hard. And then they're lost to you for a few minutes. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Laughter). SCOTT: It's a tiny little sort of dollop of the whole mammal behavior which does a huge amount of good helping you make even very transient social relationships go slightly better. RAZ: Sophie Scott, she's a cognitive neuroscientist at University College London. You can see her entire talk at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:   It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz.

(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Laughter). RAZ: And Sophie says even though the initial spark of laughter was staged and planned, the spread. . . (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Laughter). RAZ: . . . That was real. SCOTT: You can go from very staged laughter, very polite laughter, very social laughter through to genuinely helpless, involuntary laughter along that same route 'cause laughter just primes laughter. If you look at anywhere in the world where if you want people to laugh. . . (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Laughter). SCOTT: . . . You get them laughing and then you keep them going. RAZ: And this part, cognitive neuroscientists like Sophie Scott, they understand it pretty well - laughter, it spreads. But what we understand less is why. Here's Sophie on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SCOTT: I'm going to talk to you today about laughter. And in terms of the science of laughter, there isn't very much. But there's - it does turn out that pretty much everything we think we know about laughter is wrong. So it's not at all unusual, for example, to hear people say humans are the only animals that laugh. Nature thought, oh, humans are the only animals that laugh. In fact, you find laughter throughout the mammals as being well described and well observed in primates, but you also see it in rats. And wherever you find it - humans, primates, rats - you find it associated with things like tickling, and that's the same for humans. You find it associated with play, and all mammals play. And wherever you find it, it's associated with interactions. So Robert Provine, who's done a lot of work on this, has pointed out that you are 30 times more likely to laugh if you are with somebody else than if you're on your own. And where you find most laughter is in social interactions like conversation. So if you ask human beings when do you laugh, they'll talk about comedy and they'll talk about humor, and they'll talk about jokes. If you look at when they laugh, they're laughing with their friends. And when we laugh with people, we're hardly ever actually laughing at jokes. You are laughing to show people that you understand them, that you agree with them, that you're part of the same group as them. You're laughing to show that you like them. You might even love them. You're doing all that at the same time as talking to them. And in fact, the laughter is doing a lot of that emotional work for you. RAZ: It's the kind of laughter you experience maybe late at night when you're a little slaphappy with your friends because that kind of laughter, the kind of laughter we heard on that train in Berlin. . . (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Laughter). RAZ: . . . It's just another way we have of saying. . . >>SCOTT I know you. I like you. RAZ: Yeah. SCOTT: I've got something in common with you. I want to hang out with you. A lot of this sort of mirroring of other people's behavior like you're guessing - behavioral contagion. It's always got a positive meaning. And in fact, if you look within conversations, you and I will have started to breathe at the same time as soon as we started speaking. We didn't decide to do this. We just have to do it, actually, to have a conversation. We have to coordinate our breath. What you'll also find is the more you like the person you're talking to, the more you'll align other things as well. So you'll start to use the same words as them, you'll start to use the same grammatical structures as them. RAZ: Oh, my God. SCOTT: You don't do that if you don't like somebody, to put it perfectly honest. You do it when you like someone. You know, you kind of got that social link. RAZ: On the show today, exploring those social links, How Things Spread - trying to understand how emotions, disease, even ideas themselves spread among us and tie us together. But first, back to Sophie Scott and a really interesting part of her research on laughter, which she presented on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SCOTT: Now, something I've got very interested in is different kinds of laughter. And we have some neurobiological evidence about how human beings vocalize that suggests there might be two kinds of laughs that we have. So it seems possible that the neurobiology for helpless, involuntary laughter might have a different basis to it than some of that more polite social laughter that you encounter, which isn't horrible laughter, but it's some of these behaviors somebody is doing as part of their communicative act to you - part of their interaction with you. They are sort of choosing to do this. So I've been looking at this in more detail. And to do this, we've had to make recordings of people laughing, and we've just had to do whatever it takes to make people laugh. And we got those same people to produce more posed social laughter. So instead, imagine your friend told a joke and you're laughing 'cause you like you friend but not, you know, not really 'cause the joke's all that. So I'm going to play you a couple of those. I want you to tell me if you think this laughter is real laughter or if you think it's posed. So is this involuntary laughter or more voluntary laughter? (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) SCOTT: (Laughter). What does that sound like to you? Posed? UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Posed. SCOTT: Posed. How about this one? (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) SCOTT: (Laughter). I'm the best. (LAUGHTER) SCOTT: Now, that was helpless laughter. And in fact, to record that, all they had to do was record me watching one of my friends listening to something that I knew she wanted to laugh at. And I just started doing this. Now, what you find is that people are good at telling the difference between real and posed laughter. They seem to be different things to us. We took it into the scanner to see how brains respond when you hear laughter. And what it seems to be the case, when you hear somebody laughing involuntarily, you hear sounds you would never hear in any other context. It's very unambiguous. And it seems to be associated to be greater auditory processing of these novel sounds. In contrast, when you hear somebody laughing in a posed way, what you see are these regions which are occupying brain areas associated with mentalizing, thinking about what somebody else is thinking. And I think what that means is even if you're having your brain scanned, which is completely boring and not very interesting, when you hear somebody going (laughter), you're trying to work out where they're laughing. RAZ: OK, so I get that laughter is always meaningful and that something's going on in the brain, right? But we don't really understand why it's contagious - right? - I mean, like, why it spreads. SCOTT: No, no, and we know that it is, we know that it happens, we know that it is contagious - but clearly can't be the whole story. We know it's more complex than that. And we don't really understand, you know, (unintelligible) the time course. People always laugh at the end of sentences, for example, and they really coordinate their laughter very tightly to do that. So it's not just contagious, it's actually being really highly orchestrated. Whereas the timescale of spontaneous, helpless laughter can actually be quite slow. People can hear something that makes them start to laugh and then a few beats later, they start really laughing hard. And then they're lost to you for a few minutes. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Laughter). SCOTT: It's a tiny little sort of dollop of the whole mammal behavior which does a huge amount of good helping you make even very transient social relationships go slightly better.

But next time, Bill Gates says, the next pandemic could be airborne. It could spread faster, and it could be harder to detect, which means -(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GATES: We're not ready for the next epidemic. RAZ: Bill Gates picks up this idea on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GATES: Let's look at the progression of Ebola. The problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough. The problem was that we didn't have a system at all. We didn't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go who would've gone, seen what the disease was, seen how far it had spread. The case reports came in on paper. It was very delayed before they were put online, and they were extremely inaccurate. We didn't have a medical team ready to go. We were far slower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries, and a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers. There was no one there to look at treatment approaches, no one to figure out what tools should be used. The failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically more devastating than Ebola. You can have a virus where people feel well enough while they're infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market. The source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like Ebola, or it could be bioterrorism. And so there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse. RAZ: Why do you think we're not ready for the next epidemic? I mean, is it a lack of ability, or is it just a lack of will? GATES: We're underinvested in both the risk of a natural epidemic and the risk of an intentionally caused bioterrorism epidemic. And yet the United States government actually spends more on these issues than all other governments put together. Even so, every report that comes out - after SARS and H1N1, their reports call on governments to do more, but things that have a low probability of happening but a very high cost, it's always very tricky who's supposed to invest to get ready for those things. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GATES: But in fact, we can build a really good response system. We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talked about here. We've got cell phones to get information from the public and get information out to them. We have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they're moving. We have advances in biology that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen and be able to make drugs and vaccines. So we can have tools, but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system. Now what are the key pieces? First is we need strong health systems in poor countries. That's where mothers can give birth safely, kids can get all their vaccines, but also where we'll see the outbreak very early on. We need a medical reserve corps, lots of people who have got the training and background who are ready to go with the expertise. And then we need to pair those medical people with the military, taking advantage of the military's ability to move fast and secure areas. We need to do simulations, germ games, not war games so that we see were the holes are. Finally, we need lots of advanced R and D in areas of vaccines and diagnostics. There are some big breakthroughs that could work very, very quickly -RAZ: How long do we have before we can put these tools into place? Like, you know, have a system to actually stop an epidemic before it spreads out of control? GATES: Well, eventually we'll have some type of extreme surveillance where you're taking biological samples from people who are traveling around and doing full sequencing of saliva, blood, feces, and trying to understand what's out there and catch it at a very early stage, so eventually having a super effective digital immune system for the world. Hopefully that would catch something at a very early stage. Also, our technology to very quickly make new vaccines or other protective constructs - over the next 10 years that stuff is getting a lot better. So we should hope that we take it more seriously, we should hope that nothing bad happens in the next 10 years, and then we will be better equipped to deal with a natural epidemic. RAZ: Bill Gates.

YUVAL HARARI: If aliens from outer space arrived on planet Earth a hundred thousand years ago, I don't think they would've had a very good reason to place their bets on humans and not on the elephants or dolphins or whales or whatever. RAZ: This is Yuval Harari. He's written about why Homo sapiens - us - became the dominant species on the planet, not any other animal, not even any other species of early man, like Neanderthals. HARARI: In terms of actual accomplishments, there was nothing in the human record a hundred thousand years ago that indicated one of these apes is going to take over the planet. RAZ: OK so how is it - I mean, how is it that - like, who was the first Homo sapien who was like, OK guys, let's - you know, let's do this thing, let's spread out around the world? HARARI: This is the big question of history. We see the big change about 70,000 years ago. Seventy thousand, 60,000, 50,000 years ago, you start seeing Homo sapiens doing extremely impressive things. The most impressive thing is that they suddenly spread out of East Africa, and within a couple of thousand years, they colonize most of the Middle East, Europe and Asia, and then again, very quickly, they spread to places where no human being has ever reached before - to Australia, and later, to America. RAZ: And, over time. . . HARARI: We start seeing the first evidence for religion, art, for political units that are larger than a single hunter-gatherer band. RAZ: So how did we go from this unremarkable species to suddenly spreading all over the world and then ruling it? Yuval explains it in his TED talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HARARI: The real difference between humans and all other animals is not on the individual level, it's on the collective level. Humans control the planet because they are the only animals that can cooperate both flexibly and in very large numbers. Now, there are other animals, like the social insects - the bees, the ants - that can cooperate in large numbers, but they don't do so flexibly. They're cooperation is very rigid. There is basically just one way in which a beehive can function, and if there is a new opportunity or a new danger, the bees cannot reinvent their social system overnight. They cannot, for example, execute the queen and establish a republic of bees or a communist dictatorship of worker bees. Other animals, like the social mammals - the wolves, the elephants, the dolphins, the chimpanzees - they can cooperate much more flexibly, but they do so only in small numbers because cooperation among chimpanzees is based on intimate knowledge, one of the other. The only animals that can combine the two abilities together and cooperate both flexibly and still do so in very large numbers is us, Homo sapiens. RAZ: OK so if being able to work flexibly in large numbers is our main advantage, what is it that allowed us to do that? HARARI: The best solution that I can offer is our imagination and the ability not only to imagine things to yourself but to share your fictions, to invent and spread fictional stories. This is why we can cooperate in our billions whereas chimpanzees cannot, and why we have reached the moon and split the atom and deciphered DNA, and they just play with sticks and bananas. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HARARI: All other animals use their communication system only to describe reality. A chimpanzee may say, look, there is a banana tree over there, let's go and get bananas. Humans, in contrast, use their language not merely to describe reality but also to create new realities, fictional realities. A human can say, look, there is a God above the clouds, and if you all believe these stories that I've invented then you will follow the same norms and laws and values and you can cooperate. This is something only humans can do. You can never convince a chimpanzee to give you a banana by promising him that after you die you'll go to chimpanzee heaven and you'll receive lots and lots of bananas for your good deeds, so now give me this banana. Only humans believe such stories. RAZ: And so what you're saying is that these stories are what allowed us to organize and then spread out. HARARI: Yes because if you think about any religion, any economic system, any political system, at the basis you will find some fictional story about God, about money, about human rights, about a nation. All these things are fictional stories. They are not a biological reality, but it's a very powerful and convincing and benign fiction that helps us organize our political and legal systems in the modern world. Take, for example, the legal field. Most legal systems today in the world are based on a belief in human rights. But what are human rights? Take a human being, cut him open, look inside. You will find the heart, the kidneys, neurons, hormones, DNA, but you won't find any rights. The only place you find rights is in the stories that we have invented and spread around over the last few centuries. They may be very positive stories, very good stories, but they are still just fictional stories that we've invented. The same is true of the economic field. I can take this worthless piece of paper, go to the supermarket, give it to a complete stranger whom I have never met before and get, in exchange, real bananas which I can actually eat. Money, in fact, is the most successful story ever invented and told by humans because it is the only story everybody believes. RAZ: If you think about it, right, like, in terms of human expansion - in terms of the way we spread out around the world - I guess you could say that, like, our ability to procreate isn't the most significant part of it. It's our ability to imagine, which is most responsible for why we spread out. HARARI: Definitely. You can have more babies, more people, but unless you can make all these people cooperate with one another, it will be very difficult to take over the planet or even to feed all these millions. Before the agricultural revolution 10,000 years ago, the total number of humans on the planet was perhaps five million or six million. This is how much you can support by hunting and gathering. Today, we are approaching eight billion. And to feed all these billions of people, you need extremely sophisticated networks of cooperation - economic cooperation, trades, industry, banking, transportation, communication and so forth. Now, in order to have trade, you need some trust. And you can also look at the world and see how in some cases modern beliefs, like the belief in capitalism and democracy and human rights, spread far more effectively when it's done through trade and through economic relations than when it's done at the point of a bayonet. We humans control the world because we live in a dual reality, and what is amazing that as history unfolded, this fictional reality became more and more powerful so that today, the most powerful forces in the world are these fictional entities. Today, the very survival of rivers and trees and lions and elephants depends on the decisions and the wishes of fictional entities like the United States, like Google, like the World Bank - entities that exist only in our own imagination.

(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) HARARI: All other animals use their communication system only to describe reality. A chimpanzee may say, look, there is a banana tree over there, let's go and get bananas. Humans, in contrast, use their language not merely to describe reality but also to create new realities, fictional realities. A human can say, look, there is a God above the clouds, and if you all believe these stories that I've invented then you will follow the same norms and laws and values and you can cooperate. This is something only humans can do. You can never convince a chimpanzee to give you a banana by promising him that after you die you'll go to chimpanzee heaven and you'll receive lots and lots of bananas for your good deeds, so now give me this banana. Only humans believe such stories. RAZ: And so what you're saying is that these stories are what allowed us to organize and then spread out. HARARI: Yes because if you think about any religion, any economic system, any political system, at the basis you will find some fictional story about God, about money, about human rights, about a nation. All these things are fictional stories. They are not a biological reality, but it's a very powerful and convincing and benign fiction that helps us organize our political and legal systems in the modern world. Take, for example, the legal field. Most legal systems today in the world are based on a belief in human rights. But what are human rights? Take a human being, cut him open, look inside. You will find the heart, the kidneys, neurons, hormones, DNA, but you won't find any rights. The only place you find rights is in the stories that we have invented and spread around over the last few centuries. They may be very positive stories, very good stories, but they are still just fictional stories that we've invented. The same is true of the economic field. I can take this worthless piece of paper, go to the supermarket, give it to a complete stranger whom I have never met before and get, in exchange, real bananas which I can actually eat. Money, in fact, is the most successful story ever invented and told by humans because it is the only story everybody believes. RAZ: If you think about it, right, like, in terms of human expansion - in terms of the way we spread out around the world - I guess you could say that, like, our ability to procreate isn't the most significant part of it. It's our ability to imagine, which is most responsible for why we spread out. HARARI: Definitely. You can have more babies, more people, but unless you can make all these people cooperate with one another, it will be very difficult to take over the planet or even to feed all these millions. Before the agricultural revolution 10,000 years ago, the total number of humans on the planet was perhaps five million or six million. This is how much you can support by hunting and gathering. Today, we are approaching eight billion. And to feed all these billions of people, you need extremely sophisticated networks of cooperation - economic cooperation, trades, industry, banking, transportation, communication and so forth. Now, in order to have trade, you need some trust. And you can also look at the world and see how in some cases modern beliefs, like the belief in capitalism and democracy and human rights, spread far more effectively when it's done through trade and through economic relations than when it's done at the point of a bayonet. We humans control the world because we live in a dual reality, and what is amazing that as history unfolded, this fictional reality became more and more powerful so that today, the most powerful forces in the world are these fictional entities. Today, the very survival of rivers and trees and lions and elephants depends on the decisions and the wishes of fictional entities like the United States, like Google, like the World Bank - entities that exist only in our own imagination.

CHRISTAKIS: So we use the word spread and we think we understand what we're saying, but actually, germs spread differently than emotions, which spread differently than money, which spread differently than behavior. So different things spread in different ways. GUY RAZ, HOST:  This is Nicholas Christakis. CHRISTAKIS: I'm a physician and social scientist at Yale University where I direct the Human Nature Lab, and I'm also the co-director of the Yale Institute for Network Science. RAZ: And to understand Nicholas's interest - or his obsession, really - with the question of how things spread - well, first, we need to go back about 300 years. CHRISTAKIS: This was in 1744, or something like that. RAZ: And around that time, some French mathematicians decided to examine death among monks and nuns. And the conventional wisdom at the time was that living in holy purity - no sex, no marriage - it should have meant that monks and nuns live longer. CHRISTAKIS: And they began to find that, actually, the monks and the nuns did not live longer. It was very perplexing to them 'cause it wasn't in keeping with their sort of religious ideas about what should be going on. RAZ: So - theory quashed. But then about 100 years later. . . CHRISTAKIS: About 1858, I think it was. . . RAZ: A British statistician, named William Farr. . . CHRISTAKIS: Well, I think you could think of him as the father of demography, actually. RAZ: He had been wondering about that study from a hundred years before so he did one of his own. But instead of studying monks and nuns, who lived in relative isolation, he studied married couples - people who had each other. CHRISTAKIS: And he found that, actually, married people lived longer. RAZ: But there was another surprise in the study too. CHRISTAKIS: He also found that people who were widowed lost life. They lived less long. RAZ: This phenomenon became known as the widowhood effect. CHRISTAKIS: And beginning in the 1960s, some physicians and some demographers and other social scientists continued to study this topic in a famous paper was published, called, \"Dying Of A Broken Heart. \"RAZ: And it basically says if you're a man and your wife dies, your risk of death in the following year doubles. CHRISTAKIS: And when a woman's husband dies, her risk of death goes up by approximately 20 percent and then it sort of gradually rises and then gradually returns to baseline. RAZ: Wait - wait, just stop for a moment. I mean. . . CHRISTAKIS: Yeah. RAZ: . . . This is crazy, right? Like, a spouse dies - like, a wife or a husband dies - and then the possibility of death spreads to the surviving spouse? CHRISTAKIS: Yes, that's right. That's exactly what happens, and the reason is that because people are connected, their health is connected. There's something very deep and fundamental about human connection. I mean, we fare better and worse because we're connected to others. RAZ: So years ago, Nicholas was studying this effect - the widowhood effect. CHRISTAKIS: And I just suddenly had this very simple realization that, in fact, we could see the widowhood effect as a simple case of a much broader phenomenon, as a simple case of social network effects more generally. RAZ: For Nicholas, this was the moment when his career became less about death about husbands and wives and more about the profound, but hidden ways we are all connected, and how those connections fuel the spread of, well, everything. Here's Nicholas on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHRISTAKIS: And I started to see the world in a whole new way. And then I realized that, in fact, these connections were vast and that we were all embedded in this broad set of connections with each other. This thing - this network - has a memory. It moves, things flow within it. It has a kind of consistency - people can die, but it doesn't. It doesn't die - and it has a kind of resilience that allows it to persist across time. And I became obsessed with this. I became obsessed with how it might be that we're embedded in these social networks and how they affect our lives. So social networks are these intricate things of beauty and they're so elaborate and so complex and so ubiquitous in fact, that one has to ask what purpose they serve. I think understanding social networks and how they form and operate can help us understand not just health and emotions but all kinds of other phenomena like crime and warfare and economic phenomena like bank runs and market crashes and the adoption of innovation. RAZ: When we come back, Nicholas Christakis dives into his research on social networks and explains how everything spreads among everyone. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz, and on the show today, ideas about how things spread. And, before the break, we were hearing from social scientist Nicholas Christakis. And early in his career, he wanted to understand how behavior and even the choices we make spread through social networks. CHRISTAKIS: And eventually we became interested in the structure of human social networks, like, why do we have this structure at all? Why do humans make networks with these ornate, reproducible patterns? RAZ: So how does it work? Like, give me an example. CHRISTAKIS: So if you can imagine, you could think about this in terms of how you arrange workplaces. For example, you might employ a thousand engineers, and you might find that if we organize the engineers in certain ways they're inventive and cooperative. Or we take the same engineers and organize them in a different way - you know, who's talking to whom for example - and we find that those engineers are on uninventive and uncooperative. Same human beings, different typology - different architecture of ties - completely changes the kind of group properties that these individuals evince, and many experiments that we've done have shown this. You take a group of people, and you arrange them one way and they're healthy and innovative and cooperative and kind, or you take the same people and you arrange them a different way and they're unhealthy and uncooperative and unkind. And it's that insight about how the whole comes to be greater than the sum of its parts that is, is in my judgment, one of the most crucial insights arising from the study of human social networks. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHRISTAKIS: Now, how does this help us figure out some of the problems that are affecting us these days? Well, the argument I'd like to make is that networks have value. They are a kind of social capital. Our experience of the world depends on the actual structure of the networks in which we are residing and on all the kinds of things that ripple and flow through the network. The reason I think that this is the case is that human beings assemble themselves and form a kind of super organism. Super organisms have properties that cannot be understood just by studying the individuals. And so I came to see these signs of social networks as living things that we could put under a kind of microscope and study and analyze and understand. And we used a variety of techniques to do this, and we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena. So we looked at smoking and drinking behavior and voting behavior and divorce - which can spread - and altruism. RAZ: So we could get to a place where, you know, we could be so good at mapping social networks and behaviors that we could actually predict how, you know, how they're going to react - how things spread even before it happens? CHRISTAKIS: Oh, yeah. Not only can we do that, but even more, we can put information into the network. My colleague, James Fowler, published a paper where he - working with Facebook - where he randomly assigned 61 million people - he and his colleagues - to a voter intervention, showing that we could increase civic engagement in our country by exploiting the fact that people are more likely to vote when their friends vote. And in a study that we just published a couple of months ago, working in Honduras, my laboratory showed that actually we could strategically target clean water and vitamin interventions, and create artificial tipping points in villages in Honduras by taking advantage of and understanding of network structure so that we picked structurally-influential people in these villages, persuaded them to change their behavior, and as a result, the behavior change spread rapidly through the population. RAZ: I mean, there's so many things that you could spread just by identifying the right people and the right entry points. CHRISTAKIS: Yes, that's exactly right. Now, I should say this technology, like any technology, is a dual-use technology. You can use this thing not only to spread desirable properties but undesirable properties. So you can foster the spread of germs in bio-terror attacks, or you can foster the spread of fascism, or you can make groups not more cooperative but less cooperative. RAZ: So am I, like, the only one who thinks this is kind of scary? Like, you - people like you - have a lot of power - like you are kind of an evil genius, Nicholas. CHRISTAKIS: Yes, yes, yes. It - that - it's a concern. But like, it's like guns or nuclear weapons or drugs which are poisons, you know, it's a very scary thing to contemplate. RAZ: Yeah. CHRISTAKIS: So I was giving a talk about this work, about how our ideas, you know, could be used to make the world better. And I was doing this in a foreign - in an unnamed, foreign country. And afterwards, all these official-looking people came up to talk to me, and I became aware at some point that they were very interested in what I was doing, but, you know, for the wrong reasons. Yes, so all of this is a dual-use technology, but I would beg to suggest that this is not specific to, you know, network science. So this is a problem in all sciences. But as a network scientist, we need to be mindful of this as well. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHRISTAKIS: I think we form social networks because the benefits of a connected life outweigh the costs. If I was always violent towards you or gave you misinformation or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs you would cut the ties to me and the network would disintegrate. So the spread of good and valuable things is required to sustain and nourish social networks. Similarly, social networks are required for the spread of good and valuable things like love and kindness and happiness and altruism and ideas. I think, in fact, that if we realized how valuable social networks are, we'd spend a lot more time nourishing them and sustaining them because I think social networks are fundamentally related to goodness. RAZ: The more you understand about how things spread, are you optimistic about all of this stuff? CHRISTAKIS: God, yes. I mean, I wouldn't be engaged in this work and have devoted so much time to it if I wasn't moved, frankly, by the prospect of using this technology to make the world better. Many of the problems that beset human beings, at their root, have behavioral origins. And so I think inventing technologies that allow us to change behavior at scale, in populations for the better is crucial. And I really believe that these types of technologies and ideas offer tremendous hope for improving the human condition. RAZ: Nicholas Christakis teaches at Yale University.

Some environmental groups and Native American tribes want to stop this. Montana Public Radio's Corin Cates-Carney reports.

The land known as the Badger-Two Medicine. JOHN MURRAY: The spirit of Blackfoot thought is immortal. CATES-CARNEY: The land is also the site of 18 oil and gas development leases, but Murray doesn't want drilling to begin. MURRAY: And this area, this landscape, this wild, this solitude, this inextricably inalienable relationship we have with the Badger-Two Medicine would be destroyed if they came in here and started drilling and building pipelines, roads, bridges. You know, they would destroy that. For what? CATES-CARNEY: In the early '80s, a Louisiana company called Solenex leased more than 6,000 acres of this national forest land from the Bureau of Land Management for a dollar an acre. Solenex's lease was one of dozens issued in that area during the Reagan administration. During that era, the BLM was committed to increasing oil and gas production from federal lands. After years of appeals, the permit was finalized. But before drilling began new leadership entered the White House. Then Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt of the Clinton administration halted the lease. BRUCE BABBITT: What I did at that time was simply to suspend the lease. My feeling was there had not been the mandated environmental compliance. WILLIAM PERRY PENDLEY: You're talking about an area that has a railroad through it, has a pipeline through it, has a road through it. Highway 2 goes through it. CATES-CARNEY: William Perry Pendley is the lawyer for Solenex. He says his client has waited too long to use its lease. He says drilling would produce energy that would benefit the local economy as well as the whole state of Montana. PENDLEY: We have known for a long time, geologists have known that this area has tremendous potential for oil and gas development. CATES-CARNEY: Late last year, the Interior Department said that it has the authority and is prepared to cancel the lease because it was originally issued without full environmental review. The federal judge overseeing the case has scolded the federal government for the long delay. John Murray of the Blackfeet says he was a young man when he joined the effort to keep drilling out of the Badger-Two Medicine. He'll turn 69 in a couple months. MURRAY: And it's really heartbreaking. CATES-CARNEY: Drilling, Murray says, will destroy a physical symbol of his people's heritage. MURRAY: We're indigenous to this area. And we were given gifts, and it encompasses this landscape we're walking in right now. CATES-CARNEY: He doesn't want his people to end up like other tribes he has seen who have lost their memories of tradition and spiritual connection to the land. Among the issues the federal judge will decide - whether the Interior Department has the authority to cancel the lease and whether the government unreasonably delayed Solenex from drilling for 30 years.

John Murray of the Blackfeet says he was a young man when he joined the effort to keep drilling out of the Badger-Two Medicine. He'll turn 69 in a couple months. MURRAY: And it's really heartbreaking. CATES-CARNEY: Drilling, Murray says, will destroy a physical symbol of his people's heritage. MURRAY: We're indigenous to this area. And we were given gifts, and it encompasses this landscape we're walking in right now. CATES-CARNEY: He doesn't want his people to end up like other tribes he has seen who have lost their memories of tradition and spiritual connection to the land. Among the issues the federal judge will decide - whether the Interior Department has the authority to cancel the lease and whether the government unreasonably delayed Solenex from drilling for 30 years.

HAGERTY: Fluid intelligence is thought to be limited by your genes and generally begin to decrease after your 20s. Susanne Jaeggi, a cognitive neuroscientist and my guide through the brain training experiment, says scientists have long thought that you cannot increase fluid intelligence. But Jaeggi and Martin Buschkuehl, her colleague and husband, wondered about that. They decided to focus on working memory. That is your ability to hold information in your head as you manipulate, juggle and update it. SUSANNE JAEGGI: If we can strengthen working memory skills, we might see benefits on all other tasks that rely on the functioning of the working memory system, such as fluid intelligence or reading comprehension or others. HAGERTY: It worked. They found that when people practiced on a computerized game that built up working memory, they improved their scores on fluid intelligence test. When they published their findings in the Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences, they set off a firestorm. ZACH HAMBRICK: Who cares if you get better at a videogame task? HAGERTY: Zach Hambrick, a cognitive psychologist at Michigan State University, says scientists are divided as to whether brain training works. He's tried to replicate their findings and failed.

Still, I'm curious and slightly desperate to sharpen my brain. So. . . OK, here we go - brain training session number one. The day after I meet Jaeggi and Buschkuehl, I sit in my living room and start their brain training game called the n-back. Light-blue boxes fill my computer screen. When one square lights up, I decide whether it's in the same location as the square that lit up last time. Sounds easy, right? (SOUNDBITE OF BUZZER)HAGERTY: It gets trickier when you have to decide if that square lit up two times ago or three or four. Oh, 77 percent correct - gee whiz. Theoretically, after 20 days of practicing, I will become more mentally agile. I'll be able to hold memories in my head and manipulate them. I've got my doubts.

In fact, many places have long struggled with elevated lead levels. Among them, the nation's aging public schools, where the issue is old pipes and faucets. NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: It's lunchtime at Southwest Baltimore Charter School. In the kitchen, that means a few extra steps. LASHAWN THOMPSON: We don't use the water from the building for cooking - not at all. LUDDEN: Cafeteria workers Christine Fraction and LaShawn Thompson point to a large water bottle next to a stainless-steel sink. THOMPSON: We having greens or something like that, we're having vegetables, we'll just turn it over into the pan and then put it on the stove. LUDDEN: Throughout the school, water fountains are turned off. Custodian Cheryl Norris (ph) shows me the store room. CHERYL NORRIS: This is our water supply. LUDDEN: Wow, it's a lot of bottles. NORRIS: It is. We get approximately 80 bottles every two weeks. ERIKA BROCKMAN: It's safety first. LUDDEN: Erika Brockman is executive director of Southwest Baltimore Charter School. BROCKMAN: It's not the best solution. But in the short term, I completely understand why the district is approaching the problem this way. LUDDEN: Bottled water's actually become a long-term solution here. Baltimore first found elevated lead levels in scores of schools back in 1992. It ordered contaminated fountains turned off. But a decade later, many were back in service. Confronted by a crusading father, the city again vowed change. Researcher and activist Yanna Lambrinidou of Virginia Tech says Baltimore gets credit for finally taking the problem seriously. YANNA LAMBRINIDOU: They decided that protecting children from lead and drinking water was such a gargantuan task and almost impossible unless they had the ability to replace every single lead-bearing plumbing. LUDDEN: Which they did not - too expensive. So in 2007, the entire school district switched to bottled water. Baltimore City Public Schools declined to talk about the decision. But at the time, they said spending $675,000 a year on bottled water was the most cost-effective solution. With no testing since then, charter school director Erika Brockman doesn't actually know whether her school's water is unsafe. She's thought about trying it. BROCKMAN: But it's really scary to do that given everything that's going on. And I don't want my students to be the guinea pigs for this. LUDDEN: In fact, across the country it's hard to know lead levels. Researcher Lambrinidou says for most schools, there is no requirement to test for lead and if they find it no mandate to fix it or tell parents. LAMBRINIDOU: What we see again and again is that the people who first discovered the contamination were parents whose children were diagnosed with elevated blood-lead levels. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Thousands of children could be drinking water with an unsafe amount of lead. LUDDEN: Back in 2008, tipped off by a parent, NBC4 Los Angeles found local schools with lead levels hundreds of times above what the federal government deemed safe. The district promised to beef up daily flushing of fountains to wash out the lead. But when NBC4 followed up last year. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Our cameras saw employees walking right past fountains early in the morning without ever flushing them. MARK HOVATTER: It was a very idealistic complicated process that we had, and sometimes it's hard to live up to those idealistic standards. LUDDEN: Mark Hovatter is chief facilities executive with Los Angeles Unified School District. He says getting rid of lead is incredibly complicated. LA Unified doesn't even have lead pipes. HOVATTER: Our greatest percentage of fountains that do have higher concentrations than we would like come from our brand-new schools. LUDDEN: The problem? New brass fittings that leach lead and fountains on the far side of playgrounds. They're used less, he says, so the water sits and lead builds up. The school board recently allocated $20 million to fix both issues. Back at Southwest Baltimore's school, two third-grade boys unload an empty water bottle and heave a full one onto a cart. It's a routine others may adopt. In recent weeks, elevated lead levels have been found at schools in Washington state, Ohio, upstate New York and New Jersey. Jennifer Ludden, NPR News.

LUDDEN: Throughout the school, water fountains are turned off. Custodian Cheryl Norris (ph) shows me the store room. CHERYL NORRIS: This is our water supply. LUDDEN: Wow, it's a lot of bottles. NORRIS: It is. We get approximately 80 bottles every two weeks. ERIKA BROCKMAN: It's safety first. LUDDEN: Erika Brockman is executive director of Southwest Baltimore Charter School. BROCKMAN: It's not the best solution. But in the short term, I completely understand why the district is approaching the problem this way. LUDDEN: Bottled water's actually become a long-term solution here. Baltimore first found elevated lead levels in scores of schools back in 1992. It ordered contaminated fountains turned off. But a decade later, many were back in service. Confronted by a crusading father, the city again vowed change. Researcher and activist Yanna Lambrinidou of Virginia Tech says Baltimore gets credit for finally taking the problem seriously. YANNA LAMBRINIDOU: They decided that protecting children from lead and drinking water was such a gargantuan task and almost impossible unless they had the ability to replace every single lead-bearing plumbing. LUDDEN: Which they did not - too expensive. So in 2007, the entire school district switched to bottled water. Baltimore City Public Schools declined to talk about the decision. But at the time, they said spending $675,000 a year on bottled water was the most cost-effective solution. With no testing since then, charter school director Erika Brockman doesn't actually know whether her school's water is unsafe. She's thought about trying it. BROCKMAN: But it's really scary to do that given everything that's going on. And I don't want my students to be the guinea pigs for this. LUDDEN: In fact, across the country it's hard to know lead levels. Researcher Lambrinidou says for most schools, there is no requirement to test for lead and if they find it no mandate to fix it or tell parents. LAMBRINIDOU: What we see again and again is that the people who first discovered the contamination were parents whose children were diagnosed with elevated blood-lead levels. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Thousands of children could be drinking water with an unsafe amount of lead. LUDDEN: Back in 2008, tipped off by a parent, NBC4 Los Angeles found local schools with lead levels hundreds of times above what the federal government deemed safe. The district promised to beef up daily flushing of fountains to wash out the lead. But when NBC4 followed up last year. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Our cameras saw employees walking right past fountains early in the morning without ever flushing them. MARK HOVATTER: It was a very idealistic complicated process that we had, and sometimes it's hard to live up to those idealistic standards. LUDDEN: Mark Hovatter is chief facilities executive with Los Angeles Unified School District. He says getting rid of lead is incredibly complicated. LA Unified doesn't even have lead pipes. HOVATTER: Our greatest percentage of fountains that do have higher concentrations than we would like come from our brand-new schools. LUDDEN: The problem? New brass fittings that leach lead and fountains on the far side of playgrounds. They're used less, he says, so the water sits and lead builds up. The school board recently allocated $20 million to fix both issues. Back at Southwest Baltimore's school, two third-grade boys unload an empty water bottle and heave a full one onto a cart. It's a routine others may adopt. In recent weeks, elevated lead levels have been found at schools in Washington state, Ohio, upstate New York and New Jersey.

LAUREN SOMMER, BYLINE: Given how chronically dry California is, there's a rule that's going to sound really weird when you hear it. Reservoirs are not allowed to fill up in the winter, like this one, Folsom Reservoir near Sacramento. Last year, it was just a dry, dusty lakebed. DREW LESSARD: What reservoir was left was kind of confined to the old river channels before we built the dam. SOMMER: Drew Lessard helps manage this reservoir for the U. S. Bureau of Reclamation. It's filled up so much, he says, that they're releasing water to empty it out. But this reservoir is only at 60 percent capacity, and it has to stay that way because of federal rules created decades ago.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Word from News 10 reporters throughout the area, more flooding, more evacuations, more levee breaks. SOMMER: Big winter storms can cause floods in California. When a massive amount of water flows out of the mountains, this reservoir needs to catch it. LESSARD: And that's why we kind of need to reserve a space during those winter months in case that happens. SOMMER: Lessard says this is how most reservoirs work in the West, but releasing water is risky if it doesn't rain again, like happened in 1997. The reservoir was lowered. LESSARD: And it was dry the rest of the year, and we never really rebounded. SOMMER: Releasing water right now isn't all bad. It helps fish and wildlife downstream, but in a drought year, it's making people anxious, like Shauna Lorance who runs a water district near Sacramento. She says when reservoirs are releasing water, it sends a mixed message. SHAUNA LORANCE: For me to explain to customers after everything they've done that they need to continue to conserve so it can be spilled is going to be a nightmare. MARTY RALPH: If you think about it, the rules, the laws that govern water in the West were created in the 19th century, and yet here we live in the 21st century. SOMMER: Marty Ralph directs the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at the University of California, San Diego. He's working on a new way to run reservoirs. RALPH: Weather predictions have been improving over the last decades. SOMMER: Forecasts are a lot more accurate, he says, so instead of emptying out a reservoir preemptively just in case a storm comes, managers could keep the reservoir fuller with an eye on the weather. Then if a big storm appears. . . RALPH: They'd have three, four, five days lead time, enough to release that extra water, get it out of the way safely. SOMMER: But if storms don't appear that water would be saved. GREG KUKAS: We see potential forward. What we're not clear on yet is what the risks associated with that potential might be. SOMMER: Greg Kukas is with the Army Corps of Engineers, the federal agency that sets flood rules for reservoirs. He says the question is if weather forecasts are accurate enough. KUKAS: When it comes to forecasting the size of events that we're most concerned about they, you know, are about 20 percent off. SOMMER: Getting it wrong is not an option.

Can you - can you remind us what you are best known for? ROBERT BALLARD: Well, I'm best known for finding the Titanic.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Historians have waited nearly three quarters of a century to see. RAZ: Just the Titanic - you know, nothing - no big deal. Just, like, an afternoon of work. BALLARD: Well, you know, it wasn't a discovery. It was lost and found. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: The expeditions director, Robert Ballard, described the images. . . RAZ: Robert Ballard. . . BALLARD: Call me Bob. RAZ: . . . Is an oceanographer. He found the Titanic back in 1985. And since then, he spent his career exploring a place most of us don't give much thought to, the ocean, the 72 percent of our planet that is covered in water and most of it completely unexplored. BALLARD: There's a lot down there. And there's a lot we don't know that's down there. You know, there's bigger mountain ranges underwater than above water. And there's canyons down there that make the Grand Canyon look like a ditch. And there's thousands and thousands of volcanoes. And there's more history in the deep sea than all the museums of the world combined. RAZ: In fact, the greatest mountain range on Earth lies below the ocean's surface. It's called the mid-ocean ridge. And as Bob Ballard explained from the TED stage, we've known about it for a long time. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BALLARD: But no one had actually gone down into the actual site of - boundary of creation, as we call it - into the Rift Valley 'til a group of seven of us crawled in our little submarines in the summer of 1973, 1974, and were the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley. Almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range, and we didn't enter it until after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin went to the moon. So we went to the moon, played golf up there before we went to the largest feature on our own planet. We went down into the Rift Valley, and it's pitch black. It's absolutely pitch black because photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean, which is 12,000 feet. Most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the sun. Most of our planet is in eternal darkness. And for that reason, you do not have photosynthesis in the deep sea. With the absence of photosynthesis, you have no plant life. And as a result, you have very little animal life living in this underworld - or so we thought. We discovered a profusion of life in a world that it should not exist - giant tube worms 10-feet tall. I remember having to use vodka - my own vodka - to pickle it 'cause we don't carry formaldehyde. We went and found these incredible clam beds sitting on the barren rock, large clams. And when we opened them, they didn't look like a clam. And when we cut them open, they didn't have the anatomy of a clam - no mouth, no gut, no digestive system. Their bodies had been totally taken over by another organism, a bacterium that had figured out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark through a process we now call chemosynthesis - none of it in our textbooks. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Bob Ballard - coming up, his plan to fill those textbooks faster than we ever have before. That's in just a minute. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio hour from NPR. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, Hidden, ideas about how things we can't see are sometimes right in front of us or even shaping our behavior. And before the break, we were hearing from ocean explorer Robert Ballard, who's found giant worms, massive clams taken over by parasites, new life forms that we had never seen before and, oh yeah, the Titanic. So what else do you think is down there? BALLARD: I don't know. I didn't know there were 13-foot worms that had new life forms, that had another creature in their body that had taken over their body and was inhaling poisonous hydrogen sulfide. Who would've ever dreamed that? And the most horrible science fiction movie in the world would have never done that to a worm. And yet, it's real. RAZ: Does it drive you crazy to think that there are all these hidden things that are yet to be discovered and that. . . ? BALLARD: Yeah. I mean, I never grew up, see? I used to be - I used to always look under rocks for salamanders and, you know, I love discovering things. The human being - imagine, OK, you open your eyes, and you're in a room, OK? Do that right now. RAZ: All right. BALLARD: You're going to close your eyes. . . RAZ: OK. BALLARD: . . . And then you're going to open them. RAZ: All right. BALLARD: And there's a door. How fast are you going to go to that door? RAZ: Fast. BALLARD: Fast. RAZ: Really fast. BALLARD: That's us. We want to know what's on the other side of the door. RAZ: Right. BALLARD: It's Alice's looking glass. RAZ: Yeah. BALLARD: It's - we're programmed to want to know what's on the other side of that door. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: But for ocean explorers like Bob Ballard, that door is miles away, straight down at the bottom of the ocean. BALLARD: You can only go up and down so fast. So you spend all your time up and downing. RAZ: Which means for the 25 years he spent exploring the ocean with a submarine, Bob has spent a lot of that time just getting to the places he's trying to learn about. BALLARD: Well, imagine a day at the office, OK? Six hours to commute to work, six hours to get home. How long are you going to stay at work? Like, minutes, OK, and you're going to - and you still had a 12-hour day. That's why I'm trying to accelerate it. RAZ: So the best way to accelerate the time it takes to get to the bottom of the ocean is not to go at all but instead to send robots. . . BALLARD: What are called UUVs or AUVS - autonomous vehicle systems. RAZ: . . . That don't have to come up and down all the time, but they can spend days, even weeks, underwater. BALLARD: That's what's going to be the force multiplier. That's what's going to accelerate everything, when we just build these massive numbers of swarms of vehicle systems that are swarming onto the ocean. And that's - that's soon. RAZ: So you can sit in a lab in Rhode Island or Connecticut or sub-Saharan Africa, wherever you are, and you can work with this underwater robot and explore the ocean. BALLARD: Yeah, yeah, I can put it on my cell phone. RAZ: And last year, one of Bob Ballard's robots, called Hercules, was off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico when something amazing happened. BALLARD: So we're down in the Gulf of Mexico and we're doing this thing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We're going to take a super sample at all of those holes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Just going to need your help getting it in position. BALLARD: And then a - an adolescent sperm whale comes in at a couple thousand feet and. . .

WOMAN: No, he's bumping us. MAN #2: It's a sperm whale. We have a sperm whale. MAN #3: He's swimming underneath me. It's OK. Zoom out on (unintelligible) just a little bit. BALLARD: The wows. Start counting wows. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAN #1: Awesome. MAN #2: Oh, wow. MAN #3: I hope we are screen grabbing. BALLARD: How often do you hear (unintelligible) go, wow? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)WOMAN: That's as far as I can go. MAN #1: Oh, beautiful. MAN #2: Oh, wow. WOMAN: Holy cow. MAN #3: Wow. WOMAN: Oh, man. RAZ: And so where were you guys while this was all happening? BALLARD: I was in my house when it happened, watching. RAZ: Oh, you're in your house. And this robot is, like, thousands of - hundreds of miles away from you. BALLARD: Thousands of miles away from me. RAZ: And that's kind of the idea, that a group of scientists thousands of miles away can feel like they're there in a world hidden from view. And with more and more robots exploring the ocean, Bob Ballard says it might not be hidden much longer. BALLARD: I mean, I envy the generation in middle school right now. I'm going to be eclipsed by some kid in eighth grade that's going to have the technologies to do a thousand times more exploration than I've been able to do because of the advent of new technologies where they don't have to physically do it. They can move at amazing speeds. And now, with autonomous vehicles, underwater drones just really pouring into the ocean now, you're going to see the rate of discovery in the ocean skyrocket.

They can move at amazing speeds. And now, with autonomous vehicles, underwater drones just really pouring into the ocean now, you're going to see the rate of discovery in the ocean skyrocket.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about the things that are hidden all around us and how technology and sometimes just old-fashioned sleuthing is helping us to detect more and more of our invisible world. So to start the show, a little experiment with. . . (BAG RUSTLING)RAZ: A bag of chips. These ones are kettle cooked. And what this bag of chips is about to reveal is just how much of our world is hidden. Does it work with Doritos? ABE DAVIS: You know, I don't think we've tried Doritos. I suspect so. RAZ: Lays, I'm assuming, will work fine. DAVIS: We have done Lays, yeah. RAZ: OK, good. So this is the guy who did the experiment with chips. DAVIS: I'm Abe Davis. I'm a Ph. D. candidate at MIT. RAZ: As for what Abe's studying, let's just say it has to do with hidden information. And before we tell you about Abe's chip experiment, there's something you need to know. And it's a basic truth of our physical world. And it's a truth that enables Abe to do his work. DAVIS: It turns out that most of things most of the time are moving a little bit. RAZ: To put this another way, almost everything around us is constantly, almost imperceptibly, vibrating but in a way that is totally invisible to us. DAVIS: You know, our visual system is sort of tuned to pay attention to certain things. And likewise, it's tuned to ignore certain things. RAZ: Yeah. DAVIS: For instance, really tiny motions or really fast motions, these are things that we don't typically see with our eyes. RAZ: Yeah, like a hummingbird's wings. Like, we don't see the flap, flap, flap, flap. We just see, like, a hummingbird body and just, like, this weird kind of thing around it. DAVIS: Yeah. RAZ: But just like we can use cameras to capture the movement of a hummingbird's wings, Abe Davis uses cameras to capture teeny tiny vibrations, vibrations that are normally hidden from us but that surround us all the time. DAVIS: Caused by sound. RAZ: Sound. So I'm sitting here in the studio, and I have this mug of tea. It's not moving. You're telling me that the tea is vibrating just from the sound of my voice? DAVIS: Oh, yeah. RAZ: Really? DAVIS: Always. RAZ: So what happens? What do you do with that movement? You actually point a camera at it? DAVIS: Yeah. So that image of that mug of tea to us, if we look at even the image, probably won't look like it's moving at all because the actual motion is going to be a lot smaller than even a single pixel. But if it moves by just a fraction of a fraction of a pixel, then some of these pixels that see the mug will get just a little bit brighter and some will get just a little bit darker. And we can analyze that very subtle change and we can actually recover this information from it. RAZ: And then translate that information into what? DAVIS: Well, in this case, into sound. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: OK, people, this is huge. So listen closely because what Abe is saying here is that almost any object in the world around you can become a microphone. And with a pretty ordinary video camera and the right lighting, you could shoot silent video of an object and then analyze the tiny, imperceptible motion in the video and translate that motion into sound, into words even. Now, until recently, this was all theoretical, which is how Abe wound up standing in his lab one day, screaming at a bag of potato chips in a video he shared on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK, VIDEO PLAYING)DAVIS: Three, two, one, go. Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb. (LAUGHTER)DAVIS: So this experiment looks completely ridiculous. I mean, I'm screaming at a bag of chips, and we're blasting it with so much light, we literally melted the first bag we tried this on. But ridiculous as this experiment looks, it was actually really important because with the right algorithms, we can take this silent, seemingly still video and we can recover this sound. (VIDEO PLAYING)DAVIS: (Audio muffled) Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb. (APPLAUSE)DAVIS: And this was really significant because it was the first time we recovered intelligible human speech from silent video of an object. And so it gave us this point of reference. And gradually, we could start to modify the experiment using different objects or less light or quieter sounds. And that led to experiments like this one, where again, I'm going to speak to a bag of chips. But this time, we've moved our camera about 15 feet away, outside, behind a soundproof window. And the whole thing is lit by only natural sunlight. And this is what things sound like from inside, next to the bag of chips. (VIDEO PLAYING)DAVIS: Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow. And everywhere that Mary went, that lamb was sure to go. And here's what we were able to recover from our silent video captured outside, behind that window. (VIDEO PLAYING)DAVIS: (Audio muffled) Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow. And everywhere that Mary went, that lamb was sure to go. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: OK, Abe, we should explain this to people listening because what you've done here is you've taken silent video of the chips and then, using a computer algorithm, you analyze the tiny vibrations in the bag. You extract the sound that caused those tiny vibrations in the first place, all from a bag of chips. DAVIS: Yep, just a bag of chips. RAZ: This is incredible. I mean, it's. . . DAVIS: Enticing. RAZ: Yeah, right? DAVIS: Yeah. RAZ: Why do you think that is? DAVIS: I mean, speaking personally, it's exciting to sort of discover this whole new world of information. RAZ: I mean, you could imagine a future where nothing is hidden anymore, where somebody just sitting, having a quiet conversation next to an empty bag of chips, is being listened to. DAVIS: You know, it's interesting. It's easy for the mind to go there, right? It's easy to imagine, oh, man, this gives me access to this information, so therefore this information, you know, can no longer hide. RAZ: Yeah. DAVIS: But I think what's going to happen now that we know the information is there, the information is everywhere. And it's in such abundance. And we just - nobody has the resources to look at all of it. It's like telling people, I know that there's a needle in this haystack. That doesn't mean you're going to find it. RAZ: But now we can find it. That's the thing. Like, there's no way that, like, intelligence agencies aren't excited by this. Like, there's no way. This is technology that could disrupt the way they operate. DAVIS: (Laughter) I mean, I think that if you invested enough, then this does potentially open up some new doors, yeah. Is that - is that a sufficiently vague answer? RAZ: Yeah. DAVIS: I think a lot of the potential is in other kinds of information. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DAVIS: It's not hard to imagine how you might use this technology to spy on someone. But keep in mind that there's already a lot of very mature technology out there for surveillance. In fact, people have been using lasers to eavesdrop on objects from a distance for decades. But what's really new here, what's really different, is that now we have a way to picture the vibrations of an object, which gives us a new lens through which to look at the world. And we can use that lens to learn not just about forces like sound that cause an object to vibrate but also about the object itself. And you could imagine, for instance, looking at an old bridge and wondering what would happen - how would that bridge hold up if I were to drive my car across it? And, you know, that's a question that you probably want to answer before you start driving across that bridge. We've just started to scratch the surface of what you can do with this kind of imaging because it gives us a new way to capture our surroundings with common, accessible technology. And so looking to the future, it's going to be really exciting to explore what this can tell us about the world. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Abe Davis, he's a Ph. D. candidate at MIT.

ANDRES RUZO: I love that you've mentioned this is all about hidden spaces - or hidden things in spaces and places because it's funny, we don't realize how much is hidden in our every day. RAZ: This is Andres Ruzo. RUZO: And I'm a geoscientist specializing in geothermal systems. RAZ: Andres' work is about forces deep below the earth - heat, lava, rock - and how they influence the world above. RUZO: I mean, you're in D. C. , so one of my favorite things to do is just walk around in Washington, D. C. , and look at all of the different rocks that make the buildings that make that city. RAZ: Yeah. RUZO: You have this entire geologic history right in front of you. RAZ: But not all geologic forces are hidden in plain sight. And years ago, Andres heard a story about a force that wasn't only hidden but its very existence seemed impossible. RUZO: It all starts with this legend. RAZ: Here's Andres on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RUZO: As a boy in Lima, my grandfather told me a legend of the Spanish conquest of Peru. Pizarro and his conquistadors has grown rich. And tales of their conquest and glory had reached Spain and was bringing new waves of Spaniards hungry for gold. They would go into towns and ask the Inca, where's another civilization we can conquer? Where's more gold? And the Inca out of vengeance told them, go to the Amazon. You'll find all the gold you want there. In fact, there is a city called Paititi - El Dorado in Spanish - made entirely of gold. The Spanish set off into the jungle, but the few that returned come back with stories, stories of powerful shamans, of warriors with poisoned arrows, of trees so tall they blotted out the sun, spiders that ate birds, snakes that swallowed men whole and a river that boiled. All this became a childhood memory, and years passed. I'm working on my PhD at SMU trying to understand Peru's geothermal energy potential when I remembered this legend. And I began asking that question - could the boiling river exist? I asked colleagues from universities, the government, oil, gas and mining companies, and the answer was, well, an unanimous no. And this makes sense. You see, boiling rivers do exist in the world, but they're generally associated with volcanoes. And we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon nor in most of Peru, so it follows we should not expect to see a boiling river. Telling the same story at a family dinner, my aunt tells me, but, no, Andres, I've been there. (LAUGHER)RUZO: Then my uncle jumps in, no, Andres, she's not kidding. And then he starts describing a, you know - something as wide as a river flowing at a powerful flow rate as wide as a two-lane road about, you know, 190 degrees Fahrenheit. I mean, that got my attention as far as way too many details to be made up. RAZ: So at that point, did you say, I've got to go there, I've got to find this place? RUZO: Yeah, absolutely. I was - the first thing I did was grab my iPhone and start looking for everything I could online, but what was bizarre is I couldn't find anything. RAZ: There was nothing. RUZO: No, nothing. RAZ: OK. One thing here - if it existed, the river would be hot enough to kill anything that falls into it. And that kind of heat doesn't happen without a volcano, and the nearest volcano was hundreds of miles away. So Andres says to his aunt, if this river is for real, can you show it to me? RUZO: So the next day, she gave me the telephone number and the email of her contacts. She used to do indigenous rights work and had made friends with the wife of this powerful shaman who guards over the boiling river. And she goes, look, if you really want to see this thing, we need to go into the jungle, and I will personally lead you out there. RAZ: So from Lima, Peru, they got on a plane. RUZO: From Lima, there's a one-hour flight to Pucallpa. RAZ: It's a city in the Amazon and from there. . . RUZO: It was about two hours driving, most of it was on a dirt road, then about 30 minutes by peque peque. A peque peque is a motorized canoe. RAZ: Then, finally, a two-hour walk through the jungle. RUZO: The shaman's apprentice was leading us, and my aunt and I were pretty tired when suddenly in - you know, we're quiet. You can just hear heavy breathing. But I start to hear like a distant roar, like a rumble, a surge. I look over to the shaman's apprentice, and I ask him, hey, man, like, what is that? And he looks at me and says it's the river and just kind of laughs and goes, go. So I bolt down the path, and I end up standing on this small cliff off the river. So I imagined this beautiful turquoise-blue water flanked on either side by these ivory colored stones. And then 60-foot walls of green, these huge massive trees just flanking either side. And it's flowing hot, most of it hot enough to kill you for just under four miles, so it's a huge amount of water. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RUZO: The river flowed hot and fast. I followed it up river and was led by actually the shaman's apprentice to the most sacred site on the river. And this is what's bizarre, it starts off as a cold stream. And here at this site is the home of the Yacumama, mother of the waters, a giant serpent spirit who births hot and cold water. And here we find a hot spring mixing with cold stream water underneath her protective, motherly jaws and thus bringing their legends to life. How can a boiling river exist like this? I've asked geothermal experts and volcanologists for years, and I'm still unable to find another nonvolcanic geothermal system of this magnitude. There's still more research to be done, but from what the data's telling us now, it looks to be the result of a large, hydrothermal system. The deeper you go into the earth, the hotter it gets. We refer to this as the geothermal gradient. The waters could be coming as far away as glaciers in the Andes then seeping down deep into the earth and coming out to form the boiling river after getting heated up from that geothermal gradient. Now, what was amazing is that the locals had always known about this place and that I was by no means the first outsider to see it. It was just part of their everyday life. They drink its water, they take in its vapor, they cook with it, clean with it, even make their medicines with it. It's unique. It's special on a global scale. RAZ: And here's a thing, like - we think of our world as totally mapped and discovered, and this wasn't. This was - I mean, people knew about it, but it was totally hidden basically from the world. How is that possible? RUZO: So it's curious because even the shaman - the main shaman there - he even says there was never a community in the distant past - is what he says - at the boiling river area because it was seen as a place of spirits, so very few people would want to go there out of fear for the spirits. But then the final thing is the jungle is still remote, and, yeah, I am the first scientist to be given the shaman's blessing to study their site and help them bring it to the world. RAZ: Do you ever have like a moment where you worry that by bringing it out of hiding that, you know, other people will discover it and then it might like ruin it? RUZO: So bringing it to the world like this is a little nerve-racking because it's - I love this place. It's one of the most beautiful spots I've ever seen, especially at night. You know, imagine more stars than you can possibly imagine fit into the night sky, and you're laying on a rock that's naturally warm. So you are just blanketed by these clouds of warm vapor, so you're in this natural sauna hearing every animal in the jungle just calling out and singing. It feels like you're in a dream. And the threat of it getting touristy really, really saddens me. But at the same token, these people want to make a living, so are we going to let the easiest way to make money in the area be to truly exploit the jungle and not leave a single tree standing or are we going to try to empower these local people to set up their tourisms so that they can really dictate their own destiny? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RUZO: My goal is to ensure that whoever controls this land understands the boiling rivers uniqueness and significance. And in this age where everything seems mapped, measured and studied, in this age of information, I remind you all there remains so much to explore. So go out, be curious because we do live in a world where shamans still sing to the spirits of the jungle, where rivers do boil and where legends do come to life. Thank you very much.

And she goes, look, if you really want to see this thing, we need to go into the jungle, and I will personally lead you out there. RAZ: So from Lima, Peru, they got on a plane. RUZO: From Lima, there's a one-hour flight to Pucallpa. RAZ: It's a city in the Amazon and from there. . . RUZO: It was about two hours driving, most of it was on a dirt road, then about 30 minutes by peque peque. A peque peque is a motorized canoe. RAZ: Then, finally, a two-hour walk through the jungle. RUZO: The shaman's apprentice was leading us, and my aunt and I were pretty tired when suddenly in - you know, we're quiet. You can just hear heavy breathing. But I start to hear like a distant roar, like a rumble, a surge. I look over to the shaman's apprentice, and I ask him, hey, man, like, what is that? And he looks at me and says it's the river and just kind of laughs and goes, go. So I bolt down the path, and I end up standing on this small cliff off the river. So I imagined this beautiful turquoise-blue water flanked on either side by these ivory colored stones. And then 60-foot walls of green, these huge massive trees just flanking either side. And it's flowing hot, most of it hot enough to kill you for just under four miles, so it's a huge amount of water. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) RUZO: The river flowed hot and fast. I followed it up river and was led by actually the shaman's apprentice to the most sacred site on the river. And this is what's bizarre, it starts off as a cold stream. And here at this site is the home of the Yacumama, mother of the waters, a giant serpent spirit who births hot and cold water. And here we find a hot spring mixing with cold stream water underneath her protective, motherly jaws and thus bringing their legends to life. How can a boiling river exist like this? I've asked geothermal experts and volcanologists for years, and I'm still unable to find another nonvolcanic geothermal system of this magnitude. There's still more research to be done, but from what the data's telling us now, it looks to be the result of a large, hydrothermal system. The deeper you go into the earth, the hotter it gets. We refer to this as the geothermal gradient. The waters could be coming as far away as glaciers in the Andes then seeping down deep into the earth and coming out to form the boiling river after getting heated up from that geothermal gradient. Now, what was amazing is that the locals had always known about this place and that I was by no means the first outsider to see it. It was just part of their everyday life. They drink its water, they take in its vapor, they cook with it, clean with it, even make their medicines with it. It's unique. It's special on a global scale. RAZ: And here's a thing, like - we think of our world as totally mapped and discovered, and this wasn't. This was - I mean, people knew about it, but it was totally hidden basically from the world. How is that possible? RUZO: So it's curious because even the shaman - the main shaman there - he even says there was never a community in the distant past - is what he says - at the boiling river area because it was seen as a place of spirits, so very few people would want to go there out of fear for the spirits. But then the final thing is the jungle is still remote, and, yeah, I am the first scientist to be given the shaman's blessing to study their site and help them bring it to the world. RAZ: Do you ever have like a moment where you worry that by bringing it out of hiding that, you know, other people will discover it and then it might like ruin it? RUZO: So bringing it to the world like this is a little nerve-racking because it's - I love this place. It's one of the most beautiful spots I've ever seen, especially at night. You know, imagine more stars than you can possibly imagine fit into the night sky, and you're laying on a rock that's naturally warm. So you are just blanketed by these clouds of warm vapor, so you're in this natural sauna hearing every animal in the jungle just calling out and singing. It feels like you're in a dream. And the threat of it getting touristy really, really saddens me. But at the same token, these people want to make a living, so are we going to let the easiest way to make money in the area be to truly exploit the jungle and not leave a single tree standing or are we going to try to empower these local people to set up their tourisms so that they can really dictate their own destiny? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) RUZO: My goal is to ensure that whoever controls this land understands the boiling rivers uniqueness and significance. And in this age where everything seems mapped, measured and studied, in this age of information, I remind you all there remains so much to explore. So go out, be curious because we do live in a world where shamans still sing to the spirits of the jungle, where rivers do boil and where legends do come to life. Thank you very much.

ED YONG: We think of parasites as small, degenerate things, right? They're kind of biology's B-listers. They - they have these weird obscure lifestyles where they're just sitting there sucking blood or draining nutrients, whatever. And that's all they do. RAZ: This is Ed Yong. He's a science writer. YONG: A science writer at The Atlantic and a blogger at National Geographic. RAZ: You're a journalist. YONG: I am a journalist. RAZ: A lot of people think journalists are parasites. YONG: (Laughter) That's probably fair. RAZ: And fitting because you write a lot about parasites. YONG: That's right. I'm a parasite of parasite scientists. RAZ: Anyway, to Ed Yong, parasites are not biology's B-listers because they actually exert a hidden control over almost everything in the natural world, including us. YONG: Every living thing has its own parasites. A virus will count as a parasite. Some bacteria count. We can scale up to ticks and parasitic worms. There are wasps. There are fungi. A huge proportion of living things are parasites themselves. They exert this enormous influence on the world around us. They shape ecosystems and they change minds and manipulate behavior. RAZ: Parasites? YONG: That's right. And I think the idea that these very simple creatures could be manipulating and influencing things with sophisticated brains and cognition, that's quite shocking to people I think. RAZ: And frankly, it was shocking to Ed as well. When he first became obsessed with parasites about a decade ago and he explained how that obsession began on the TED stage. And just a quick note, Ed shows a lot of pictures during this talk and it's probably for the best that you can't see them on the radio because they're actually kind of gross. OK. Here's Ed's TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)YONG: I first learned about this way of life through David Attenborough's \"Trials Of Life\" about 20 years ago. And then later through a wonderful book called \"Parasite Rex\" by my friend Carl Zimmer. And I've been writing about these creatures ever since. Few topics in biology enthrall me more. It's like the parasites have subverted my own brain. . . (LAUGHTER)YONG: . . . Because after all they are always compelling. And they are delightfully macabre. When you write about parasites, your lexicon swells with phrases like devoured alive and bursts out of its body. (LAUGHTER)YONG: But there's more to it than that. I'm a writer and fellow writers in the audience will know that we love stories. And parasites invite us to resist the allure of obvious stories. Their world is one of plot twists and unexpected explanations. Why, for example, does this caterpillar start violently thrashing about when another insect gets close to it? And those white cocoons that it seems to be standing guard over - is it maybe protecting its siblings? No. This caterpillar was attacked by a parasitic wasp which laid eggs inside it. The eggs hatched and the young wasps devoured the caterpillar alive before bursting out of its body. (LAUGHTER)YONG: Now, some of the wasps seem to stay behind and controlled it into defending their siblings, which are metamorphosing into adults within those cocoons. This caterpillar is a head-banging, zombie bodyguard defending the offspring of the creature that killed it. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)YONG: There are actually quite a few examples of parasite recruited bodyguards. There's a ladybug that stands guard over this like - these silken cocoons of wasps that have parasitized it. So there seems to be - seems to be a theme. Like, you kill a thing, you turn it into a guardian for your young. RAZ: I mean, if there is this hidden force, right, there are all these parasites that change the behavior of different species, how do we even know what's real and what's not? How do we know what normal behavior is and what  - what isn't? YONG: You know, I think the point is that this is normal behavior. This is just part of what's going on in the world around us. I think we would be wrong to think of these as oddities, as, like, rare parts of the world. Normal behavior is a spectrum that includes what parasites do to us. You know, I am often not a fun person to, like, go nature watching with now because whenever I see an animal doing something weird I think - like, a friend of mine showed me this video of, like, stoked. . . RAZ: A what? YONG: . . . Like a weasel, bouncing about, hopping really happily. Going oh, look, isn't it cute? RAZ: Yeah. YONG: I'm like, I think parasite. RAZ: Parasite - you're like that is a - that's, like, a rabid, crazy animal. YONG: Yeah. That animal is doing something very strange. RAZ: You've completely destroyed the cuteness of it. YONG: Oh, you think that's cute? Let me just shank your feelings. RAZ: Wow. That's cruel. YONG: That's right, yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)YONG: This cricket swallowed the larva of a Gordian worm or horsehair worm. The worm grew to adult size within it, but it needs to get into water in order to mate. And it does that by releasing proteins that addle the cricket's brain causing it to behave erratically. When the cricket nears a body of water, such as this swimming pool, it jumps in and drowns. And the worm wriggles out of its suicidal corpse. One Japanese scientist called Takua Soto (ph) found that in one stream these things drive so many crickets and grasshoppers into the water that the drowned insects make up some 60 percent of the diet of local trout. Manipulation is not an oddity. It is a critical and common part of the world around us. RAZ: It's crazy to think how parasites, you know, aren't just, like, changing the behavior for the sake of being subversive. But they're actually like driving ecosystems. YONG: I think that's one of the things I love about this that you start seeing the natural world in a different light. Whenever we look at an animal doing something, when we ask why is it doing that, you always assume that it's in control of its own behavior. . . RAZ: Yeah. YONG: . . . Right? And we don't think that, oh, maybe something is controlling it, like, something we can't see. And I think the wonderful thing about parasite biology is that it invites you to think about that. It gives you a different lens through which to view the world. And it's a scary lens but a cool one I think. RAZ: Which, of course, leads us to a troubling question. Could there be parasites influencing us? Well, Ed Yong says there's one that could be in you right now or maybe in your cat. It's called Toxoplasma gondii. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)YONG: Or Toxo for short because the terrifying creature always deserves a cute nickname. Toxo infects mammals, a wide variety of mammals, but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat. And scientists like Joanne Webster (ph) have shown that if Toxo gets into a rat or a mouse, it turns the rodent into a cat-seeking missile. (LAUGHTER)YONG: If the infected rat smells the delightful odor of cat piss, it runs towards the source of the smell rather than the more sensible direction of away. (LAUGHTER)YONG: The cat eats the rat. Toxo gets to have sex. It's a classic tale of eat, prey, love. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)YONG: You're very charitable, generous people. Right. This thing is a single cell. This has no nervous system. It has no consciousness. It doesn't even have a body. But it's manipulating a mammal? We are mammals. We are more intelligent than a mere rat to be sure, but our brains have the same basic structure, the same types of cells, the same chemicals running through them and the same parasites. Estimates vary a lot, but some figures suggest that 1 in 3 people around the world have Toxo in their brains. Now, typically this doesn't lead to any overt illness. But there's some evidence that those people who are carriers have slightly - score slightly differently on personality questionnaires than other people, that they have a slightly higher risk of car accidents, and there's some evidence that people with schizophrenia are more likely to be infected. Now, I think this evidence is still inconclusive and even among Toxo researchers opinion is divided as to whether the parasite is truly influencing our behavior. But given the widespread nature of such manipulations, it would be completely implausible for humans to be the only species that weren't similarly affected. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: You hear about how all of these parasites manipulate behavior in creatures and then it does kind of make you question free will, right? I mean, especially among us. YONG: Yeah. And I think - I think that has really interesting philosophical implications, right? Like, how much reactions are under your own control? I still would say, like, most. But what we can say I think is that it's entirely plausible that our behavior could be affected by parasites. But I don't think we should freak out at the concept that we might sometimes make decisions not entirely of our own volition. RAZ: I'm freaking out. YONG: (Laughter) You're freaking out? RAZ: Yeah. YONG: It's 'cause I made you freak out. RAZ: Yeah. You did. YONG: (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)YONG: This capacity to constantly subvert our way of thinking about the world makes parasites amazing. They're constantly inviting us to look at the natural world sideways and to ask if the behaviors we're seeing, whether they're simple and obvious or baffling and puzzling, are not the results of individuals acting through their own accord but because they're being bent to the control of the something else. And while that idea may be disquieting and while parasites habits may be very grizzly, I think that ability to surprise us makes them as wonderful and as charismatic as any panda or butterfly or dolphin. But perhaps that's just a parasite talking. Thank you. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)RAZ: Science journalist Ed Yong. He's got a new book coming out soon called \"I Contain Multitudes. \" It's all about microbes. Watch his full talk at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  Next up - parasites.

SARAH PARCAK: That's right. RAZ: . . . For a living. PARCAK: My name is Sarah Parcak, and I am an archaeologist. RAZ: And as an archaeologist, Sarah Parcak searches for traces of past civilizations hidden beneath the earth for thousands of years. Do you think that every civilization eventually becomes buried and hidden? PARCAK: Yeah, I think all civilizations do. I think there are also a lot of civilizations and cultures out there that we don't know about yet. RAZ: Sarah has discovered an ancient amphitheater under the airport in Rome. PARCAK: Like the equivalent of an ancient Cineplex. RAZ: An unknown temple in Petra. PARCAK: Could be a temple, not sure. RAZ: And the lost city of Tanis in Egypt. PARCAK: It was Egypt's capital for about 400 years. RAZ: And how Sarah discovered these sites, not by digging but by building on a technique used by her grandfather. PARCAK: My grandfather Harold Young was one of the pioneers of using aerial photography in forestry. And so by the time I got to college, I thought if grampy did this for forestry, I bet lots of people have done this for archaeology. It would be fun to see what he did, and I really - I feel like I was the first kid in the candy store. You know, virtually no one had used it before in Egypt. RAZ: So after Sarah graduated, she started to experiment with a method that has now completely revolutionized archaeology, and as she explained on the TED stage, it's earned her a special title. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PARCAK: I'm a space archaeologist. Let me repeat that - I am a space archaeologist. This means that I use satellite images and process them using algorithms and look at subtle differences in the light spectrum that indicate buried things under the ground that I get to go excavate and survey. By the way, NASA has a space archaeology program, so it's a real job. (LAUGHTER)PARCAK: This is from a site south of Cairo. So let's have a look from space. You can't see anything. When we process the image using algorithms - think like a space-based CAT scan - this is what you see. This rectilinear form is an ancient tomb that is previously unknown and unexcavated, and you all are the first people to see it in thousands of years. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: So what does satellite imagery mean for all the hidden sites yet to be discovered? Sarah Parcak explains in just a moment. I'm Guy Raz, and on the show today, ideas about our hidden world. You're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about our hidden world. And just before the break, we were talking to space archaeologist Sarah Parcak about how satellite images can help her find places that have been hidden for centuries. OK, so how does it work? How do you use satellite images to find, you know, hidden places? PARCAK: So satellite imagery allows us to do two things. It allows us to look at sites with a fresh pair of eyes, but why they're really valuable is that they record information in different parts of the light spectrum that we simply can't see with our human eyes. So imagine there's a stone wall somewhere in Italy that dates to the Roman period - so roughly 2,000 years ago - and you'd walk over a field. And you wouldn't see it. RAZ: Yeah. PARCAK: Well, that stone wall which may be under a meter or so of earth, it affects the overlaying topography. So the roots going down - they couldn't go as deep because they'd be stopped by the stone wall. And so processing the satellite data, you can actually map out and see those changes. . . RAZ: Wow. PARCAK: . . . And you start seeing straight lines. And those straight lines form structures which definitely aren't natural. So just as an example, we got a hold of new satellite imagery for most of the pyramid fields, and when I started processing it, it feels like cheating. You can see everything. RAZ: How many sites have you guys found using pictures from satellites? PARCAK: I'm at the point where I've lost count. It is in the many thousands, but I don't know anymore. RAZ: Wow. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PARCAK: I believe we have barely scratched the surface in terms of what's left to discover. In the Egyptian Delta alone, we've excavated less than one-thousandth of 1 percent of the total volume of Egyptian sites. When you add to that the thousands of other sites my team and I have discovered, what we thought we knew pales in comparison to what we have left to discover. When you look at the incredible work that my colleagues are doing all around the world and what they're finding, I believe that there are millions of undiscovered archaeological sites left to find. Discovering them will do nothing less than unlock the full potential of our existence. RAZ: I mean, what you're saying is we only know a tiny bit about our past. Is that true? I mean, is most of our history hidden? PARCAK: I would say, yes, because history is always written by the winners. And, yeah, people are living in places where they've always lived for thousands of years. Look at places like Rome and Istanbul and Cairo. Those cities are layers upon layers upon layers of history. So I think we've taken a lot for granted about who we are and where we've come from. We think living in this very modern age with smartphones and the Internet and sort of this whole world of knowledge at our fingertips we know everything. But the more and more we delve into the past, the more we realize that we don't and that it has a lot of lessons to teach us for today. RAZ: So if we start using, you know, satellite images - I mean, if this becomes the norm, is it just going to change everything we've known about our past? PARCAK: Well, I think it already has. Huge discoveries have been made about new ancestors, human sexuality, human relationships, how we adapt to environmental change. I think what it's done is it's shown us for the first time the real scale of human occupation and really resilience. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PARCAK: I wish for us to discover the millions of unknown archaeological sites around the world by creating a 21st-century army of global explorers will find and protect the world's hidden heritage which contains clues to humankind's collective resilience and creativity. So how are we going to do this? We are going to build an online crowdsource, citizen science platform to allow anyone in the world to engage with discovering archaeological sites and protect them. By creating this platform, we will find the millions of places occupied by the billions of people that came before us. Acknowledging that the past is worth saving means so much more; it means that we're worth saving, too. And the greatest story ever told is the story of our shared human journey, but the only way that we're going to be able to write it is if we do it together. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Sarah Parcak - she's the winner, by the way, of this year's $1 million dollar TED Prize. It's given to someone who has a vision to change the world. Sarah's going to use the money to create her citizen archaeology platform to start identifying and protecting thousands, perhaps millions, of hidden sites around the world. GUY RAZ, HOST:  Today on the show, ideas about the hidden things in our world and the people who find them. . . SARAH PARCAK: That's right. RAZ: . . . For a living. PARCAK: My name is Sarah Parcak, and I am an archaeologist. RAZ: And as an archaeologist, Sarah Parcak searches for traces of past civilizations hidden beneath the earth for thousands of years. Do you think that every civilization eventually becomes buried and hidden? PARCAK: Yeah, I think all civilizations do. I think there are also a lot of civilizations and cultures out there that we don't know about yet. RAZ: Sarah has discovered an ancient amphitheater under the airport in Rome. PARCAK: Like the equivalent of an ancient Cineplex. RAZ: An unknown temple in Petra. PARCAK: Could be a temple, not sure. RAZ: And the lost city of Tanis in Egypt. PARCAK: It was Egypt's capital for about 400 years. RAZ: And how Sarah discovered these sites, not by digging but by building on a technique used by her grandfather. PARCAK: My grandfather Harold Young was one of the pioneers of using aerial photography in forestry. And so by the time I got to college, I thought if grampy did this for forestry, I bet lots of people have done this for archaeology. It would be fun to see what he did, and I really - I feel like I was the first kid in the candy store. You know, virtually no one had used it before in Egypt. RAZ: So after Sarah graduated, she started to experiment with a method that has now completely revolutionized archaeology, and as she explained on the TED stage, it's earned her a special title. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PARCAK: I'm a space archaeologist. Let me repeat that - I am a space archaeologist. This means that I use satellite images and process them using algorithms and look at subtle differences in the light spectrum that indicate buried things under the ground that I get to go excavate and survey. By the way, NASA has a space archaeology program, so it's a real job. (LAUGHTER) PARCAK: This is from a site south of Cairo. So let's have a look from space. You can't see anything. When we process the image using algorithms - think like a space-based CAT scan - this is what you see. This rectilinear form is an ancient tomb that is previously unknown and unexcavated, and you all are the first people to see it in thousands of years. (APPLAUSE) RAZ: So what does satellite imagery mean for all the hidden sites yet to be discovered? Sarah Parcak explains in just a moment. I'm Guy Raz, and on the show today, ideas about our hidden world. You're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about our hidden world. And just before the break, we were talking to space archaeologist Sarah Parcak about how satellite images can help her find places that have been hidden for centuries. OK, so how does it work? How do you use satellite images to find, you know, hidden places? PARCAK: So satellite imagery allows us to do two things. It allows us to look at sites with a fresh pair of eyes, but why they're really valuable is that they record information in different parts of the light spectrum that we simply can't see with our human eyes. So imagine there's a stone wall somewhere in Italy that dates to the Roman period - so roughly 2,000 years ago - and you'd walk over a field. And you wouldn't see it. RAZ: Yeah. PARCAK: Well, that stone wall which may be under a meter or so of earth, it affects the overlaying topography. So the roots going down - they couldn't go as deep because they'd be stopped by the stone wall. And so processing the satellite data, you can actually map out and see those changes. . . RAZ: Wow. PARCAK: . . . And you start seeing straight lines. And those straight lines form structures which definitely aren't natural. So just as an example, we got a hold of new satellite imagery for most of the pyramid fields, and when I started processing it, it feels like cheating. You can see everything. RAZ: How many sites have you guys found using pictures from satellites? PARCAK: I'm at the point where I've lost count. It is in the many thousands, but I don't know anymore. RAZ: Wow. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PARCAK: I believe we have barely scratched the surface in terms of what's left to discover. In the Egyptian Delta alone, we've excavated less than one-thousandth of 1 percent of the total volume of Egyptian sites. When you add to that the thousands of other sites my team and I have discovered, what we thought we knew pales in comparison to what we have left to discover. When you look at the incredible work that my colleagues are doing all around the world and what they're finding, I believe that there are millions of undiscovered archaeological sites left to find. Discovering them will do nothing less than unlock the full potential of our existence. RAZ: I mean, what you're saying is we only know a tiny bit about our past. Is that true?

We have heard so much about contaminated water in Flint, Mich. , yet it is still not entirely clear what is happening inside the network of pipes carrying that water. Michigan radio's Mark Brush reports on the long-running search for answers. MARK BRUSH, BYLINE: It's probably a safe bet that the drinking water system in Flint, Mich. , is now the most studied water system in the country. More than 14,000 people have tested their water, and the state continues its own testing protocol. Add to that the EPA has a series of technical tests designed to find out what's going on inside the city's old water pipes. But for these people coming to the Bethel United Methodist Church in Flint, one group of researchers rises above the rest. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Virginia Tech. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Virginia Tech. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: It would be Virginia Tech. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Virginia Tech. BERNADEL JEFFERSON: So we trust them. We don't trust nobody else. BRUSH: That last comment is from Bishop Bernadel Jefferson. It was Virginia Tech's Marc Edwards who packed up his minivan last summer and drove north. Testing the water in hundreds of homes, his team's research exposed the lead problem. And now they're back, trying to retest the water in the same homes they looked at last year. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: . . . Is Bethel United Methodist Church. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: Thank you. All right, thank you very much. BRUSH: The team is made up of Flint residents and Virginia Tech students on spring break. They're making phone calls urging people to pick up and drop off their water-testing kits and then boxing up those kits. Pamela Mayes waited in a line to drop her testing kit off. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Your name, your contact information, your email address, kit number 80. PAMELA MAYES: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Time out - I am so sorry that it took so long for you to get this done in. MAYES: That's OK. It's OK. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: But thank you for your patience. MAYES: I appreciate you guys. BRUSH: Mayes says her water had lower lead levels, but she still doesn't trust it. And she and her husband cook and wash dishes using bottled water. She says they like the house they bought in Flint. MAYES: And we wanted to stay in it, retire in it. But now we don't know what we're going to do, you know? So. . . BRUSH: Why is that? MAYES: Well, because I can't live like this for a very long time. BRUSH: People in Flint have been living with bad drinking water for almost two years now. The city switched back to treated water from Lake Huron last October, so the situation is supposed to be improving. But they need testing to confirm that. And everyone, including state and federal regulators, are waiting for what the Virginia Tech team finds. This is the only test that is comparing results from last summer to today. Many people in the city are tired of all this talk about water. They just want it fixed. Anurag Mantha is a graduate student with the Virginia Tech team. And he says there are a few people who say they are done with all this testing. ANURAG MANTHA: People have lost hope and - in the city. So when we call them, they're like I don't want to do anything with this water business anymore. Some people are really welcoming. They're like oh, Virginia Tech, definitely, we'll do - test our water for you. So we are getting mixed responses. BRUSH: They tested 269 homes last summer. Their goal is to get things back to normal in Flint. While health experts say there's no safe level of lead, the current federal action level in drinking water is 15 parts per billion. Virginia Tech's random sampling last year found that Flint was 10 parts per billion over that action level. Marc Edwards says he does expect these new tests to show that lead levels are dropping in the city. MARC EDWARDS: We want Flint to at least the same lousy standard that every other city in the United States is. So in order to meet that, there's really three I think results that people are waiting for. BRUSH: He's watching his own tests and two from the state. Officials say they hope to finally have some answers for the people in Flint in a few weeks. For NPR News, I'm Mark Brush.

Well, a pair of studies out of Chicago suggest it does. The first study looked at children 4 to 6 years old, and the second study looked at toddlers 14 to 17 months old. And both found that children growing up in environments where more than language is spoken were better at understanding other people's perspectives. And researchers argue that that's a social skill that drives good communication. Katherine Kinzler is one of those researchers. She's formerly of the University of Chicago and now associate professor of psychology at Cornell University. Welcome to the program. KATHERINE KINZLER: Thanks so much for having me. SIEGEL: Just to be clear, what you were testing was not whether the child understood words being asked but whether the child had the ability to take the perspective of the person who was doing the asking. Describe what you did first with the 4- to 6-year-olds. This involved three cars - three toy cars - one small, one medium, one large. KINZLER: So the child could see three cars. Yet, the child could also see that the adult sitting across from her could only see two of those cars - the medium and the large car. And so when the adult said to the child, oh, I see a small car; can you move the small car for me, to correctly understand what the adult was saying, the child would realize that she was talking about the medium car or the child's medium because the adult could only see the medium and large. SIEGEL: And after doing this with a few dozen kids, you found there really was a significant difference between those who were exposed to a another language at home or somewhere in their lives and those who weren't. KINZLER: That's right. And so we found that children who were bilingual were really good at taking the adult's perspective. And so about 80 percent of the time, those children would reach for the medium car instead of the smallest car, knowing that the medium car was the one that the adult could see. And I think what was even, you know, more surprising to us was that children who were exposed to another language yet were effectively monolingual themselves were just as good as the bilingual children at reaching for the medium car. SIEGEL: And for the toddlers, you had two bananas on the table, one of them evident to the questioner and one of them not. And you asked the little ones, you know, I see a banana; can you give me the banana? Once again, the children exposed to another language or bilingual where much more likely to know that means the banana in plain view. KINZLER: Exactly. Even these - you know, these are babies, really, who are, you know, barely talking themselves. And yet, again, when they heard somebody say something like, oh, I see a banana; can you hand me the banana - now, there were two bananas, so neither one was exactly, you know, a right or wrong answer. It's just that one of those bananas was one that was mutually visible. So the baby could see that the adult could also see this banana, so presumably, she was referring to the one that she could see. SIEGEL: What do you think this has to do with learning a second language, hearing two languages at home? KINZLER: So I think that children who hear more than one language have, you know, incredibly rich social experiences that monolingual children don't face. And so, you know, these kids do things, like they attend to who speaks which language to whom, when and where different languages are spoken, who understands what content and so forth. So you know, I think of this as kind of this continued practice in taking the linguistic perspective of others. And so from that, I think that children are able to perspective-take more generally. SIEGEL: What do you say to the parent out there saying, oh, no, my child is ruined; she only knows English. KINZLER: (Laughter) You know, I would say that development is a complicated thing, and there are, you know, lots of things that parents can be doing to facilitate their children's development. But I do think that if parents can find an opportunity to expose their children to multiple languages, that that's a good thing. And you know, kind of the good news of this research, I think, for many monolingual parents is that to experience some of these benefits - these social benefits, children don't have to become completely bilingual. So even children who are merely exposed, you know, somewhat regularly to another language seem to be just as good at perspective-taking.

Scientists say they're a step closer to finding out. They've created an organism with what appears to be the minimum number of genes to sustain the life form. As NPR's Rae Ellen Bichell reports, the discovery could lead to new manufacturing methods. RAE ELLEN BICHELL, BYLINE: In the mid-1990s, a few top biologists set out on a quest to make an organism that would have only the genes that are absolutely essential for survival. J. CRAIG VENTER: We were asking basic fundamental questions of life. What did we think might comprise the most primitive cell? BICHELL: That's J. Craig Venter, a genome scientist and founder and CEO of a research institute in his name. He says it was mostly philosophical curiosity. VENTER: We decided it gave us a chance to ask unique questions about fundamental biology and origins of life. BICHELL: This week, two decades later, Venter and colleagues published one possible answer in the journal Science. They've created a single-celled organism with only 473 genes. That gives it the smallest genome of any known living thing that can reproduce on its own. For comparison, humans have about 20,000 genes. They started with an already very simple bacterium. If a gene could be removed without disrupting the cell's ability to live, grow and reproduce, it was. Out it went. And here's the interesting part. They had to keep a lot more genes than they expected. There are about 150 of them, a third of the cell's genome, that it can't live without. But no one knows what they're for. Venter says that's the next goal, to figure out what the heck all those mysterious genes actually do. VENTER: This is essential for understanding all of life, to understand the basic components. BICHELL: But not just for the pure knowledge. He and his colleagues have bigger goals. They eventually want to be able to design cells that would produce whatever chemical they want them to. And that sense, the minimal cell could be like the frame of car, a starting point on which to build. VENTER: So it's sort of a basic component that we can add things to. BICHELL: For example, Venter says, you might add in a gene from some odd deep-sea creature and be able to engineer it to eat carbon dioxide and spit out fuel. VENTER: If you just have a cassette of those genes that you can just plug in, that will enable design to go much fasterBICHELL: One of Venter's companies, Synthetic Genomics Inc. , already applied to patent the process of making this minimal genome. But, says George Church, the process is nowhere near grand industrial applications. He's a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School. GEORGE CHURCH: I think the main reason it should be celebrated is that it is achievement of a 20-year goal. BICHELL: After all, he says, people are already manipulating individual genes using other, faster methods. The process of changing an entire genome would have to be speedy, cost effective and widely applicable for it to get to a point where it's useful in producing something like biofuel. Church, who does this kind of work too, says people should be thinking about worst-case scenarios. CHURCH: Most of the organisms we manipulate in the laboratory are so weak that they wouldn't survive outside the laboratory. BICHELL: But it is a possibility. CHURCH: So anything that has a chance - even a remote chance - of spreading through the wild should be something where we're very cautious and have mechanisms in place to limit it and/or reverse it. BICHELL: And right now, there aren't really any. Rae Ellen Bichell, NPR News. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  What is the essence of life? Scientists say they're a step closer to finding out. They've created an organism with what appears to be the minimum number of genes to sustain the life form. As NPR's Rae Ellen Bichell reports, the discovery could lead to new manufacturing methods. RAE ELLEN BICHELL, BYLINE: In the mid-1990s, a few top biologists set out on a quest to make an organism that would have only the genes that are absolutely essential for survival. J. CRAIG VENTER: We were asking basic fundamental questions of life. What did we think might comprise the most primitive cell? BICHELL: That's J. Craig Venter, a genome scientist and founder and CEO of a research institute in his name. He says it was mostly philosophical curiosity. VENTER: We decided it gave us a chance to ask unique questions about fundamental biology and origins of life. BICHELL: This week, two decades later, Venter and colleagues published one possible answer in the journal Science. They've created a single-celled organism with only 473 genes. That gives it the smallest genome of any known living thing that can reproduce on its own. For comparison, humans have about 20,000 genes. They started with an already very simple bacterium. If a gene could be removed without disrupting the cell's ability to live, grow and reproduce, it was. Out it went. And here's the interesting part. They had to keep a lot more genes than they expected. There are about 150 of them, a third of the cell's genome, that it can't live without. But no one knows what they're for. Venter says that's the next goal, to figure out what the heck all those mysterious genes actually do. VENTER: This is essential for understanding all of life, to understand the basic components. BICHELL: But not just for the pure knowledge. He and his colleagues have bigger goals. They eventually want to be able to design cells that would produce whatever chemical they want them to. And that sense, the minimal cell could be like the frame of car, a starting point on which to build. VENTER: So it's sort of a basic component that we can add things to. BICHELL: For example, Venter says, you might add in a gene from some odd deep-sea creature and be able to engineer it to eat carbon dioxide and spit out fuel. VENTER: If you just have a cassette of those genes that you can just plug in, that will enable design to go much faster BICHELL: One of Venter's companies, Synthetic Genomics Inc. , already applied to patent the process of making this minimal genome. But, says George Church, the process is nowhere near grand industrial applications. He's a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School. GEORGE CHURCH: I think the main reason it should be celebrated is that it is achievement of a 20-year goal. BICHELL: After all, he says, people are already manipulating individual genes using other, faster methods. The process of changing an entire genome would have to be speedy, cost effective and widely applicable for it to get to a point where it's useful in producing something like biofuel. Church, who does this kind of work too, says people should be thinking about worst-case scenarios.

And just a few days later, a task force that he appointed put most of the blame on him, his appointees and two state agencies for Flint's lead-tainted water. Steve Carmody of Michigan Radio reports. STEVE CARMODY, BYLINE: People in Flint are still lining up for bottled water. Two years ago, the city switched its drinking water source to the Flint River, but the water wasn't properly treated, damaging city pipes, which have been leaching lead into the drinking water ever since. But Michigan Governor Rick Snyder says he has a plan. On Monday, he released a 75-point plan to target short-term, intermediate-term and long-term needs in Flint. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RICK SNYDER: I want to solve the problem in Flint, so that's my focal point, so that's where - one thing I learned today is - glad to get 75 points out there that we're going to work on putting in place. SIMON: The plan includes goals for blood lead level testing for children, mobile nutritional centers and higher lead testing standards for local water systems. Some of the short-term items in the governor's plan are already underway, but many others are unfunded or lack specifics. And in Flint, some residents are frustrated that the plan doesn't call for immediately removing all lead service lines. Flint City Council president Kerry Nelson calls it more of a Christmas list than an actual plan. KERRY NELSON: Is it the best effort he can make? No. I think there's some terms that's very vague and it's going be a long road before we get to them. And time at this junction is not on our side because we need to start digging up and remove all lead-lined service lines. CARMODY: Flint has started digging up the suspect lead service lines but only about a dozen of the estimated 8,000 lead lines have been replaced so far. Just as the governor started promoting his 75-point plan to fix Flint, his office received a rebuke from a task force he appointed to examine the city's water crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHRIS KOLB: This morning, we are releasing publicly our final report. CARMODY: On Wednesday, the task force primarily blamed state government, including the governor's office, for Flint's water crisis. Task force co-chair Chris Kolb. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KOLB: I've been asked several times what caused this, and I think I personally have said that it was a mixture of ignorance, incompetence and arrogance by many decision-makers. They created a toxic and tragic situation that produced the Flint water crisis. CARMODY: Singled out for criticism is Michigan's emergency manager law. It was a state-appointed emergency manager who decided to switch the source of Flint's tap water to save money. And emergency managers long ignored residents' complaints about their tap water. The task force says Michigan's emergency manager law needs to be changed to allow for more checks and balances. Task force co-chair Ken Sikkema says it's part of a broader need for a cultural change in state government. KEN SIKKEMA: Where you don't treat outside opinion as a threat. You use it as a way to reassess the official government position. That change has to occur throughout state government. CARMODY: Governor Snyder listened uneasily as the task force delivered its report, then said the state is already implementing some of its recommendations, some of which are mirrored in his 75-point plan. But as all this occurs, Flint residents still want to know when they can again safely drink unfiltered water from their faucets. For NPR News, I'm Steve Carmody in Flint.

Across the country, millions of old, lead pipes are being used despite the health concerns, and replacing them is not easy. Madison, Wis. , began working years ago to eliminate all of its lead water pipes. Cheryl Corley explains how they did it. CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: It's a chilly, overcast afternoon in Madison. And Matt Grauvogl is watching as his water utility crew guides the jaw-like shovel of a backhoe scooping dirt into a truck. MATT GRAUVOGL: We're digging the water shut off boxes for the pipelining project. CORLEY: Another crew member climbs down into the hole and starts shoveling. Six feet down and the copper water line is visible. Madison started using copper instead of lead water pipes in the late 1920s. The bulk of the lead lines were located in the older part of the city downtown near Wisconsin's state Capitol. That's where Sue Bauman lives now. She was Madison's mayor from 1997 to 2003. SUE BAUMAN: I remember one day one of my mayoral aides came in and said he had met with the water utility and there was this issue about these lead pipes and I'm like, what? CORLEY: The Environmental Protection Agency's lead and copper rule issued in 1991 set limits on the concentration of lead and copper in drinking water. The following year, the water utility learned that 10 percent of the samples of Madison water and tests conducted shortly afterwards showed higher lead levels than the EPA allowed. That would also be the case about five years later. Chemical engineer Abigail Cantor tested the phosphate authorities recommended to prevent lead from leaching into Madison's water. What she found was shocking. ABIGAIL CANTOR: The lead increased four times over the untreated water. CORLEY: Cantor says other additives created even more problems. Madison gets its drinking water from an underground aquifer. But city officials worry the chemicals used to prevent corrosion could cause algae and weeds in the city's lakes because of excess nutrients in water runoff. CANTOR: So I went to the management at the water utility and said you can't use these recommended chemicals, and there's no other - you just have to get rid of the lead pipes. CORLEY: Madison's decision to rip out and replace all of its lead pipes was a bold proposal in 2000. JOE GRANDE: There was tremendous pushback from homeowners. CORLEY: Joe Grande, the utility's water quality manager, says there were concerns about cost. Legally, the water utility only had to pay for the portion of the lead service lines that ran from the city's water main up to a home or business property line. But Grande says Madison also wanted those residents to replace their half of the lead lines. GRANDE: Studies have shown that if you only do a partial replacement, the utility comes and replaces their portion of the service that there is no improvement in lead levels in the water, and it actually could be worse. CORLEY: Because of a shakeup of lead particles that could leach into the water. Getting approval, though, from regulators and lawmakers and by-in of homeowners took years. For nearly 6,000 property owners, it meant about a $1,300 plumbing bill. Madison reimbursed half of that cost. It took the city 11 years and $15. 5 million to replace 8,000 lead water lines. Water manager Grande says samples of Madison water still show lead as present but at levels well below EPA limits. GRANDE: That's coming from solder. That's coming from brass fittings, also coming from fixtures as well. CORLEY: Nevertheless, former Mayor Bauman considers Madison's lead pipe removal program a big success and says it was the right thing to do. BAUMAN: It was a forever solution. And if you looked at the cost of adding chemicals to the water system, to the water supply forever compared with the one-time cost of replacing, over time you were better off. CORLEY: Now as communities across the country pay much closer attention to the pipes that bring water into homes, Madison is an example they may turn to as efforts continue to make drinking water safer.

In one Chicago neighborhood, residents are about to see a lot more of them. Crews are preparing to tear down an old hospital. The city and the developer are setting poison baits and traps, and some neighbors are turning to one of the rats' biggest enemies. NPR's David Schaper reports. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: Chicago's upscale Lincoln Park neighborhood is known for its fine dining, trendy bars and clothing stores amid elegant row houses, luxurious condos and yuppie apartment buildings. And like many densely populated urban neighborhoods. Lincoln Park also has rats, a lot of rats. KELLY MCGEE: Every night when I walk down the sidewalk, I see rats. SCHAPER: Thirty-six-year-old Kelly McGee has come to accept it. MCGEE: It freaks out my sister. She screams when she sees them, but they don't bother me so much. SCHAPER: Well, McGee can expect the rat problem to get a lot worse. She lives just down the block from the old Children's Memorial Hospital which is about to be torn down as part of a massive redevelopment project. When the wrecking ball starts swinging, the rats living in and underneath it will scurry. MICHELE SMITH: Construction all over the city often disturbs rodents who are living underground. SCHAPER: Lincoln Park's alderman, Michele Smith, wrote what she says is the most stringent anti-rat development ordinance in the country. SMITH: Before excavation begins and throughout excavation and construction, every developer has to do active rodent abatement on site. SCHAPER: So there are now poison bait boxes all around the old hospital complex, but the developer still warns the rat problem could become awful. And if anyone knows what constitutes an awful rat problem, it's Victoria Thomas. VICTORIA THOMAS: At one point, we had around 400 rats living next store. SCHAPER: Staying in the unusually big backyard behind her condo building on Chicago's North Side, Thomas says a few years ago, she was completely overrun by rats. THOMAS: No one used the yard one summer because every time you would go out, they'd, like, run across your feet. Once it got dark, you'd hear them (imitating scurrying) back-and-forth on the deck. And I'm like, oh, my gosh. And we'd all lift our feet up because they're underneath the table. SCHAPER: The rats came from the yard of the apartment building next door. Thomas tried everything - trenching, underground fencing, poison, traps. Nothing worked until she got a couple of cats. THOMAS: Oh, my God, that one - that's my killer out of the three. Like, that one loves to hunt. SCHAPER: Three rescued feral cats sterilized and vaccinated by the Tree House Humane Society were relocated and put to work in Victoria Thomas's backyard to prey on rats. THOMAS: These cats are amazing. They cleaned up everything. We have a couple of dead rats. You know, once a month, we'll get a dead rat. They'll leave it here. They'll bring it to my door. SCHAPER: These aren't cuddly house cats. They stay outside. Thomas provides them food, water in a heated dish and insolated shelters while the cats patrol her yard and others on the block. Paul Nickerson manages the Cats at Work program for the Tree House Humane Society. PAUL NICKERSON: They don't just kill rats in their territory. They create a territory that rats will stay out of based on their pheromones. SCHAPER: Nickerson says those predator pheromones are the secret to keeping the rats away. Now he's getting calls from people living near the old hospital wanting their own cat colonies. That could mean that more feral cats, ones that might otherwise be euthanized, will instead be cared for while doing something that they love. David Schaper, NPR News, Chicago.

SHAPIRO: And that discovery led to the new book \"Rise Of The Rocket Girls: The Women Who Propelled Us From Missiles To The Moon to Mars. \" One of those rocket girls was Barbara Paulson who started at JPL in 1948. She and the author joined me to talk about the role that women played shaping the American space project. Nathalia Holt told me many of the rocket girls had the job title computers. HOLT: In a time before the digital devices that we're used to today, it was humans that were doing the calculations. And so you needed these teams of people, many of whom were women, especially during World War II, and they were responsible for the math. SHAPIRO: Barbara, you were one of those computers. BARBARA PAULSON: Yes. SHAPIRO: Now, in the 1940s, what made you believe you could be a scientist? PAULSON: Well, I had had quite a bit of math in high school. Both of my sisters prepared to be secretaries, and I just took a different path completely. But why I veered off into this, that I can't remember. SHAPIRO: Nathalia, when you started discovering this story of these women who were so essential to NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, I mean, does it surprise you that we didn't know this story until now, that it's taken - I don't know - six, seven decades for this to be told? HOLT: It really was surprising. It was quite difficult to track down this group and find their stories. In fact, I think it was over 40 Barbara Paulsons I talked to before I found the right Barbara Paulson. SHAPIRO: You're kidding, really? HOLT: (Laughtr). PAULSON: I didn't know that either. HOLT: (Laughter) Yes. No, it was quite difficult. But when I found the real Barbara Paulson, the one I was searching for, it was so wonderful. And right from the beginning, Barbara had these amazing stories and incredible memory and it was a wonderful thing finding the real Barbara Paulson. SHAPIRO: Barbara, do you remember the very first story you told Nathalia that you were like, here's an anecdote you need to know before anything else? HOLT: I think it has to be Explorer 1. . . PAULSON: Oh, gosh, she took me by surprise. HOLT: . . . That has to be, right? In the beginning, I remember you told me that story very early. PAULSON: Well, Explorer 1 was launched January 31 in 1958. That would've been after Sputnik had been launched. SHAPIRO: The U. S. is trying to match the Soviet Union in the space race. PAULSON: Right. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Three, two, one, by command. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: The missile is in flight, but the success of its mission is still in doubt. It will take another hour and a half to know whether the satellite is in orbit - the most tense and harrowing wait of all. PAULSON: I was asked to graph the results coming back from the Explorer 1 satellite. and I worked most of the night, through the night, at JPL with my mechanical pencil and graph paper and light table that I was working on. And those were - that was all the equipment that I had. SHAPIRO: And, Barbara, when you found out that the launch was successful, what was your reaction? Do you remember that moment? PAULSON: I don't know if I'm an emotional person (laughter). I - well, it would - you know, as I look back on so many things, I get more excited now than I did then. But it was exciting. I mean, it was great news that it was - once in orbit around the Earth. SHAPIRO: Nathalia, how would you describe the impact these women had in totality on the American space project? HOLT: There is hardly a mission that you can find in NASA that these women haven't touched. They have been there right from the beginning, from the early days of American rocketry to this first American satellite that Barbara's described for us, and then all of these amazing projects - the first planetary probes, the first lunar probes. They were there for Voyager. And even today, we have Susan Finley, who is NASA's longest-serving woman, and she's still working there today at the lab. SHAPIRO: You mention that you discovered this story when you were looking for a name for your daughter, who was born in 2010. Now that your daughter is 5 years old, what have you told her about these incredible women? HOLT: She's heard a lot about this group of women. And my hope is that these women serve as role models, not just for my daughter of course but for all of the women that are interested in science. It's a difficult time for women in technology right now. It's - you know, so in 1984, 37 percent of all bachelor's degrees in computer science were awarded to women and today that number has dropped to 18 percent. And even for women that are working in science today, it's about half of all women that leave midcareer. So I think these stories are important for inspiring and being role models that are so much needed for women today. SHAPIRO: Nathalia Holt and Barbara Paulson, thank you both.

It turns out for much of recorded history, people saw it as a kind of a miracle metal. Despite the dangers, the world uses more lead today than ever before. Frank Morris of KCUR in Kansas City, Mo. , reports. FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: These days, in the U. S. , at least, lead is sequestered, and that's strictly enforced by people like Steven Jones, who's standing in a small room just off the factory floor at the Enersys battery plant in Warrensburg, Mo. STEVEN JONES: Basically we've just stepped into a transition room. This is the area that allows an individual to transfer from what we refer to as a clean area into a dirty area. MORRIS: So this is kind of like a demilitarized zone between the world of where there's lead and where there's no lead. Inside the plant, the smell is bracing, acidic. A few of the workers wear respirators. In one section, yellow robots bend and twist, building batteries with freaky speed and precision. JONES: It's a technological ballet. Through this level of automation, we're providing a cleaner environment for our operators and, again, providing a safer environment. MORRIS: For most of the last 5,000 years, though, people have been pretty cozy with lead. JOSEPH HEPPERT: You can think about lead as kind of the plastic of the ancient world. MORRIS: Joseph Heppert, a chemist at Kansas University, says lead is easy to melt. A campfire will do it. And unlike, say, iron, lead is malleable. HEPPERT: Once you've formed it into sheets, you can do things that people had never really been able to do before with a metal. You could roll it into tubes, for example. MORRIS: Pipes, that is. Romans plumbed their famous baths with lead water pipes and lined aqueducts with lead. They'd called lead plumbum. That's where the word plumbing comes from. Romans used lead for all kinds of other stuff, too - make up, contraception, cookware. Chris Warren, who teaches history at Brooklyn College, says Romans even sweetened their food with lead. CHRIS WARREN: The sugar of lead, as they call it, was used as a direct additive but also used in winemaking to control fermentation. MORRIS: After the fall of Rome, alchemists and inventors found new uses for lead, like printing. WARREN: That would be Mr. Gutenberg. MORRIS: Johannes Gutenberg used movable lead type in his revolutionary machine. Three-hundred years later, Ben Franklin was still using it to warn about lead-tainted liquor. By the Industrial Revolution, lead was a well-known killer, but it was just so handy. WARREN: The lead industry liked to call lead the useful metal. It was adaptable to just about any commercial purpose. MORRIS: Mass-produced lead plumbing, lead alloys, beautiful leaded glass. And Heppert says lead did wonders for gasoline. HEPPERT: Tetraethyl lead was kind of a miracle substance. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Put a tiger in your tank. Happy motoring. MORRIS: And then there was lead paint. Americans came to grips with its toxicity to children in the late 1960s and early '70s.

MORRIS: Regulators in the United States banned the use of leaded house paint in 1978. They phased out leaded gas by the mid-1990s. But Americans are not using any less lead.

About three quarters of that is actually used in vehicles. MORRIS: That's Andy Bush, who directs the International Lead Association in London. He says lead batteries also provide backup power to hospitals, cell towers and railroad crossing gates. We're not talking about flashlight batteries here.

S. government has been criticized for its effort to recover and identify war dead. People say it takes too long to find remains in the field and the process is too stuck on old science. Now a part of that effort is showing success that once seemed impossible. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Imagine 208 wooden boxes each filled with bones, the remains of Americans who served and died during the Korean War. Researchers at a lab in Hawaii are going through those boxes and finally identifying those men. SHAPIRO: Jay Price of member station WUNC explains how they are doing it and what it means for the families who've been waiting more than half a century for news. JAY PRICE, BYLINE: Life didn't have time to mark Charles Ivey much. The broad-shouldered, strawberry blond soldier from Vance County, N. C. , was 21 years old when the Army told his parents he was missing in action in North Korea. That was in 1950. In 1953, they said he was dead, killed in an ambush. In 1955, his mother wrote a letter to the Army a physical description of her son. GAIL LARUE: He had a perfect set of teeth. PRICE: That's Gail Larue, Charles's niece reading the letter. LARUE: He had a slight case of pneumonia from measles when he was 12 years old. The only scar was a chickenpox scar right under. . . PRICE: There's something hopeful in her mention of the scar, a scar in flesh, a hope however faint that she thinks he might be found alive. Years stretched into decades. Ivey's mother died, his father, too. And one by one, 10 of his 11 siblings passed away. The last brother, Harold Ivey, still lives in North Carolina. He's lost a leg to diabetes and is on dialysis. He says his brother was fatalistic about going off to war. HAROLD IVEY: He said before he got shipped overseas he didn't think he'd be coming back home because it was terrible over there. PRICE: Then last fall, two soldiers came to Harold Ivey's home to deliver the official news. His brother's remains had been identified. IVEY: I think everybody was totally amazed that after all this time they had found his body - well, his remains rather. It was a very few bones that was missing. JENNY JIN: So this is the K208 lab floor. PRICE: This is the place at Pearl Harbor Hawaii where Charles Ivey's bones ended up along with those of hundreds more troops lost in North Korea. It's called the K208 lab, K for Korea and 208 for the number of boxes North Korea gave the U. S. in the early 1990s. The Koreans said each box held the remains of one American service member, but that wasn't true. JOHN BYRD: Most often there's remains of many, many different soldiers represented in each of the boxes. And it's not unusual for there to be no two bones from the same soldier in a box. PRICE: John Byrd is the lead scientist in the military's efforts to identify the remains of American troops lost in battle. Those 208 boxes delivered by North Korea held the bones of about 400 men. There were another 112 boxes of jumbled bones that U. S. teams recovered from mass graves in North Korea. So a total of more than 600 men, their remains all scrambled together. BYRD: In terms of the size of the project and the condition of the remains, I think it's the hardest case in the world. PRICE: Now they're solving it . JIN: I'm Jenny Jin, and I'm a forensic anthropologist. PRICE: Jin runs the K208 Project. JIN: So my job is to come up with the best strategy to make an identification because it's really different case-by-case. PRICE: For years, it was slow going. When the boxes arrived, there were so many bones and so few clues. JIN: Couldn't do much for about 10 years and then technology advanced, and that's when we saw the potential of using mitochondrial DNA. PRICE: Mitochondrial DNA - it can often be found in bones, even those buried for decades. It was the tool they needed, a first step towards identifying the men from thousands and thousands of bones. But - and here's the part where you should forget what you've seen about DNA on TV - the mitochondrial kind just isn't very precise. JIN: My favorite analogy is it works like last names. PRICE: Last names are helpful to a point. But a lot of people share last names like Smith or Jones. One mitochondrial DNA sequence matches 811 of the thousands missing from the Korean War. The ivory-colored bones of four of those men are laid out on a table in the lab. JIN: My job is to come up with the four names out of that 811 guys to see which one these guys could be. PRICE: The mitochondrial DNA narrowed the search then Jin had to sort the bones. That was step two - which left femur matches which right femur or did two bones form a good joint? JIN: So if you look at this bone, this is an upper arm bone, so it fits like that. PRICE: After all that sorting, Jin and her team are pretty sure which of these bones on the table belong together. JIN: We believe this is one person, that's one person, that's another one, that's the fourth individual. PRICE: But they still have to figure out who the person was. What was his name? Sometimes there are dental records or chest X-rays to check for a match. JIN: Sometimes if that person was very tall or very short, that gives us a really good clue. PRICE: Then when possible, there's a third step - test for nuclear DNA. On detective shows that's the kind that can all but ensure an individual identification, but it can be hard to find in the old bones. And when it is there, it's often incomplete. Still, combined with other evidence, it can seal an identification. In Charles Ivey's case, technicians found nuclear DNA in two leg bones and his jaw and checked his sisters' samples hoping for a useful match, and they got it. A solid match is always a big moment for the scientists. JIN: That makes my day. PRICE: And Jin has a personal connection to the men she's trying to identify. American troops helped her family flee North Korea during the war just a month after Charles Ivey vanished there. JIN: And thanks to them, my grandfather survived, and he came out of North Korea. And here I am today. The least I can do to their families is to identify these guys and send them home. PRICE: It's slow meticulous work. One time, Jin needed to clear her head. She drove to Wal-Mart and bought some display boards. She propped them up in the lab, and now they're covered with photos of the men whose remains her team has identified. JIN: These guys are near and dear to me because I know them by bones. PRICE: In the 10 years after the first boxes arrived, the military identified just one man a year. Last year alone, Jin's team identified 29, including a broad-shouldered soldier from North Carolina. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Charles Ivey, who was killed during the Korean War in 1950. PRICE: On a sunny morning almost 65 years to the day after Ivey was killed, Gail Larue, his niece and Harold Ivey, his brother, came to Raleigh-Durham International Airport. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Today, Cpl. Ivey will continue his final journey home to Henderson, N. C. IVEY: Well, I'm feeling a little sad, but I'm also feeling happy that he's being returned home, you know, and we can get this past us. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: In a few moments, members of the North Carolina Army National Guard. . . PRICE: Harold Ivey turned his electric wheelchair toward the elevator to the runway apron. The Delta jet taxied up between two fire trucks that shot an arch of water over it that made a rainbow. The flag-covered casket was unloaded from the aircraft. Harold Ivey and Gail Larue each put a hand on that flag and bowed their heads. They are among the few still alive who care that Charles is home. There's someone else who cares back in Hawaii. That's where Jenny Jin and the lab is printing up a new batch of photos for her display board. Among them is a picture of a young Charles Ivey. For NPR News, I'm Jay Price. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  The U.

The Koreans said each box held the remains of one American service member, but that wasn't true. JOHN BYRD: Most often there's remains of many, many different soldiers represented in each of the boxes. And it's not unusual for there to be no two bones from the same soldier in a box. PRICE: John Byrd is the lead scientist in the military's efforts to identify the remains of American troops lost in battle. Those 208 boxes delivered by North Korea held the bones of about 400 men. There were another 112 boxes of jumbled bones that U. S. teams recovered from mass graves in North Korea. So a total of more than 600 men, their remains all scrambled together. BYRD: In terms of the size of the project and the condition of the remains, I think it's the hardest case in the world. PRICE: Now they're solving it . JIN: I'm Jenny Jin, and I'm a forensic anthropologist. PRICE: Jin runs the K208 Project. JIN: So my job is to come up with the best strategy to make an identification because it's really different case-by-case. PRICE: For years, it was slow going. When the boxes arrived, there were so many bones and so few clues. JIN: Couldn't do much for about 10 years and then technology advanced, and that's when we saw the potential of using mitochondrial DNA. PRICE: Mitochondrial DNA - it can often be found in bones, even those buried for decades. It was the tool they needed, a first step towards identifying the men from thousands and thousands of bones. But - and here's the part where you should forget what you've seen about DNA on TV - the mitochondrial kind just isn't very precise. JIN: My favorite analogy is it works like last names. PRICE: Last names are helpful to a point. But a lot of people share last names like Smith or Jones. One mitochondrial DNA sequence matches 811 of the thousands missing from the Korean War. The ivory-colored bones of four of those men are laid out on a table in the lab. JIN: My job is to come up with the four names out of that 811 guys to see which one these guys could be. PRICE: The mitochondrial DNA narrowed the search then Jin had to sort the bones. That was step two - which left femur matches which right femur or did two bones form a good joint? JIN: So if you look at this bone, this is an upper arm bone, so it fits like that. PRICE: After all that sorting, Jin and her team are pretty sure which of these bones on the table belong together. JIN: We believe this is one person, that's one person, that's another one, that's the fourth individual. PRICE: But they still have to figure out who the person was. What was his name? Sometimes there are dental records or chest X-rays to check for a match. JIN: Sometimes if that person was very tall or very short, that gives us a really good clue. PRICE: Then when possible, there's a third step - test for nuclear DNA. On detective shows that's the kind that can all but ensure an individual identification, but it can be hard to find in the old bones. And when it is there, it's often incomplete. Still, combined with other evidence, it can seal an identification. In Charles Ivey's case, technicians found nuclear DNA in two leg bones and his jaw and checked his sisters' samples hoping for a useful match, and they got it. A solid match is always a big moment for the scientists. JIN: That makes my day. PRICE: And Jin has a personal connection to the men she's trying to identify. American troops helped her family flee North Korea during the war just a month after Charles Ivey vanished there. JIN: And thanks to them, my grandfather survived, and he came out of North Korea. And here I am today. The least I can do to their families is to identify these guys and send them home. PRICE: It's slow meticulous work. One time, Jin needed to clear her head. She drove to Wal-Mart and bought some display boards. She propped them up in the lab, and now they're covered with photos of the men whose remains her team has identified. JIN: These guys are near and dear to me because I know them by bones. PRICE: In the 10 years after the first boxes arrived, the military identified just one man a year. Last year alone, Jin's team identified 29, including a broad-shouldered soldier from North Carolina. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Charles Ivey, who was killed during the Korean War in 1950. PRICE: On a sunny morning almost 65 years to the day after Ivey was killed, Gail Larue, his niece and Harold Ivey, his brother, came to Raleigh-Durham International Airport. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Today, Cpl. Ivey will continue his final journey home to Henderson, N. C. IVEY: Well, I'm feeling a little sad, but I'm also feeling happy that he's being returned home, you know, and we can get this past us. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: In a few moments, members of the North Carolina Army National Guard. . . PRICE: Harold Ivey turned his electric wheelchair toward the elevator to the runway apron. The Delta jet taxied up between two fire trucks that shot an arch of water over it that made a rainbow. The flag-covered casket was unloaded from the aircraft. Harold Ivey and Gail Larue each put a hand on that flag and bowed their heads. They are among the few still alive who care that Charles is home. There's someone else who cares back in Hawaii. That's where Jenny Jin and the lab is printing up a new batch of photos for her display board. Among them is a picture of a young Charles Ivey.

The blight is affecting a native tree critical to the state's natural water supply and cultural heritage. Molly Solomon of Hawaii Public Radio filed this report. MOLLY SOLOMON, BYLINE: Deep in the forest of Hawaii, a native tree called 'ohi'a reigns king. The tall canopy tree dominates the islands' forests, especially here on the Big Island. 'Ohi'a, often the first plant to grow from a fresh lava flow, is known for its resilience. That's what makes a recent discovery all the more tragic - 'ohi'a is dying. The disease called Rapid 'Ohi'a Death was first spotted on the eastern side of the Big Island. A group of scientists drives me out there to what they call ground zero. Looking at the land today, what was once lush green rainforest is now barren, littered with dead trees. J. B. Friday is an extension forester with the University of Hawaii. J. B. FRIDAY: Out of hundreds of trees that we're looking at, maybe two or three of the 'ohi'a trees still have leaves on them. That's heartbreaking for people who knew what this forest was 10 years ago. SOLOMON: Using a small ax, he begins chopping at a dying tree, revealing signs that the fungus has taken hold. FRIDAY: See that tree over there that we're looking at now that you could see is turning brown? When we went inside and chopped on that, the symptoms are right there. SOLOMON: In 2010, Friday started getting phone calls from landowners in the area reporting 'ohi'a trees dying on their property. FRIDAY: We took some samples, we didn't get anything unusual. But by 2013, it became apparent that something was spreading rapidly. SOLOMON: Friday called up his colleague Flint Hughes, a research ecologist with the U. S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service. FLINT HUGHES: This forest was really a jewel of native diversity. It was perhaps the best example of a mature 'ohi'a-dominated forest. SOLOMON: Hughes calls 'ohi'a critical to maintaining Hawaii's watershed. Raindrops and condensation filter through the trees' leaves, keeping the ground well-saturated. It also provides habitat and food for endangered native birds. HUGHES: This is our everything tree. It's the most widespread, the foundational species for our forests. If we lose 'ohi'a, it will transform our forests. SOLOMON: In addition to its environmental role, 'ohi'a is also important culturally. Its wood was used to create tools and weapons, says University of Hawaii professor Kalena Silva. And hula dancers often adorn themselves with its blossoms. KALENA SILVA: I think the loss of 'ohi'a lehua would almost be like losing a member of your family. It's that important. It has that much meaning. LISA KEITH: This is the Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center's laboratory. SOLOMON: Plant pathologist Lisa Keith is leading the research on Rapid 'Ohi'a Death. For the past year, she's been studying tree samples and performing what she calls CSI tree autopsies. And what she's found isn't all grim. Keith says even in the most devastated areas, some trees are surviving. KEITH: I think it's still hopeful that we will find ones that it's not an escapee, that it actually is natural resistance, that we can then, you know, bank seed or propagate and replant. And that's some of the work for the future. SOLOMON: A more immediate concern is stopping the spread of the disease. Recent aerial surveys show the fungus has already devastated trees in tourist destinations like Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Whether Rapid 'Ohi'a death will spread to other islands depends on Hawaii's success at containing it quickly. For NPR News, I'm Molly Solomon in Hilo, Hawaii.

C. for Monday, July 11, 90 days from now. This week, AccuWeather launched its day by day 90-day forecast, calling it a valuable tool for planning further in advance including activities like vacations, weddings, baseball games, outdoor concerts and more. Joining us to talk about it is AccuWeather's founder and president, Dr. Joel Myers. Welcome to the program. JOEL MYERS: Thank you very much, a pleasure to be here. SIEGEL: Weather forecasts have gotten better over time, but, personally, I wouldn't be at all surprised if next Monday's forecast didn't hold, never mind the forecast for a Monday 90 days from now. Is this 90-day forecast - is it a best guess based on historical data or do you really have tools that allow you to see that far into the future? MYERS: Well, I would bet on the forecast for next Monday if it's the AccuWeather forecast. All of our forecasts are based on the latest science. We bring more weather data and model data into AccuWeather's headquarters in State College, Pa. than any other place on the planet, and it's how we mix these various models and all the other data we have and - with 100 plus meteorologists - how we put together the forecast. SIEGEL: But I've heard from meteorologists that predictions are really reliable, say, up to seven to 10 days. After that, the element of luck increases. Do you disagree with that? MYERS: Well, no, the forecasts - all forecasts have and always will deteriorate with time. The point of the matter is this, people want information, and they want information that is worthwhile. If we didn't have the statistics to show that the forecast - and here's the measure of what the value is - it's got to be more accurate statistically than you can come up with by using past normals and whatever climatology that you have, and it does. SIEGEL: And do you attach a level of confidence to the forecast 90 days from now in Washington? It's obviously less confident than you are in next Monday's weather in Washington. . . MYERS: Well, exactly, and that's the important trend. But we don't give a confidence number. I mean, I wouldn't take the 88 day and say, hey, there's a ballgame from 3 to 6 o'clock, and it's going to be such and such. But if I'm going on a vacation to Paris and I'm going to be there for five days between the 83rd and 88th day, this forecast will give you information that will be better than you can have figured out in any other way. SIEGEL: Well, yeah, I didn't introduce the idea of the baseball game. That came from AccuWeather saying that would be one reason why you would consult the forecast. MYERS: Well, I wouldn't recommend you use this for planning a baseball game 88 days ahead, except in a general sense. SIEGEL: You do - or AccuWeather has said that you can use the 90-day forecast to - for planning things like weddings. Should there be a disclaimer that, you know, don't blame us if it rains on your wedding day?

And some days, we hear from young thinkers who leave us excited about the future. Well, that was the case today when we talked to a couple of the more than 100 students who were in Washington for the White House Science Fair. We started with 17-year-old Augusta Uwamanzu-Nna of Elmont, N. Y. AUGUSTA UWAMANZU-NNA: It's such an honor to be here at the White House Science Fair today to be able to share, like, what really makes me happy and my first love and my first passion, which is cement. SIEGEL: Well, that's - first of all, that's one of the most passionate statements about cement that I've heard on this program. Well, tell us about your project that brings you to the White House Science Fair. UWAMANZU-NNA: The 2010 Gulf oil spill was caused by an inadequate cement seal. So cement is used to seal an offshore drill, so my goal was to engineer a new cement seal. And I added attapulgite, which is a type of clay, to enhance the flowability of the cement, but also enhance the structure rebuilding, or how solid it becomes when it fills the oil well. So ultimately I found that the clays did enhance both of these properties, especially under the simulated high-pressure conditions of an oil well. SIEGEL: Just out of curiosity, is this something that you figure you've - you will complete and then move on to other big questions? Or do you imagine college being a time of still pursuing that passion for cement? UWAMANZU-NNA: I do hope to. I think the ultimate takeaway from conducting research with cement for three years is the importance of sustainable infrastructure development. So one of the things I want to do is actually share this knowledge because, frankly, I thought cement was just rocks and water in 10th grade. I didn't understand that cement and concrete had this great application and immense application. So I definitely want to communicate with people and share this knowledge because this knowledge has definitely opened my mind. Throughout college, I hope to, yes, continue to pursue sustainable development - sustainable infrastructure development - and not only limited to cement, but just all infrastructure, you know, worldwide, as it is a very important facet in the world. SIEGEL: Well, Augusta, thanks a lot for talking with us today. UWAMANZU-NNA: You are welcome. SIEGEL: By the way, the high school senior has a big decision to make about college. She was accepted by all eight Ivy League schools. Our next science star is Annie Ostojic of Munster, Ind. She is 13. And here's how her project came about. ANNIE: So basically, I was one day with my dad, and we were trying to microwave some food - just a frozen food meal. And you've probably experienced this before, where the inside of my dish was cold with ice slivers in it, but the outer perimeter was completely cooked already. It was warm. And I realized it used a lot of energy. The microwave oven isn't the most efficient appliance out there, really. So I basically am proposing that industry should use a new microwave oven design, where you'd be able to reflect the energy from the corners to the uncooked parts of the food. So I currently have a provisional and in the process of finalizing the patent. And basically, this is a new, novel microwave cavity design, which is a rounded rectangle shape. SIEGEL: Now all this was inspired by your dad trying to cook a frozen meal in the microwave. Is your dad an accomplished cook? Is he very good in the kitchen? ANNIE: (Laughter) No. It was a frozen pasta meal. And we were kind of pressed for time and so it was taking a lot more time than I originally thought (laughter). SIEGEL: Have you heard anything from any microwave manufacturer about your design? ANNIE: No. I'm hoping, probably, to reach out to some of them because I have 3-D models - 3-D prints of them. And hopefully I can get to a manufacture out there at some point, but I think it would be really neat if we are able to save energy this way. SIEGEL: Will, Annie, thank you so much.

TEGAN WENDLAND, BYLINE: On a sunny afternoon in New Orleans, Jeff Hebert stands in a swampy, green field. JEFF HEBERT: One of the biggest challenges of the next several decades is going to be water - either too much of it or not enough. WENDLAND: In New Orleans' case, of course, the problem is too much. Hebert is chief resilience officer for the city. His job is to help it prepare for disasters like hurricanes and rising sea levels. HEBERT: You see a lot of driveways that are buckling, the streets that are buckling. WENDLAND: But it won't look like this for long. The city is experimenting with pervious surfaces and water-absorbing parks. Small single-story ranch homes line the street in Gentilly, a residential area along Lake Pontchartrain. It was one of the worst-hit areas after Hurricane Katrina. HEBERT: Over in this corner, you'll see a huge sports field that will be allowed to inundate underwater when it rains. You'll see a - almost a creek that will go through here. WENDLAND: It will include water features in medians to reduce flooding, lagoons and a pond. That city just won a competitive $141 million grant from the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to build this resilience district. That's in addition to $2 billion in relief payments the city just received from FEMA. Robin Keegan helped the city apply for some of those grants. She works with GCR consulting and says, after Hurricane Katrina, the city faced some hard choices. ROBIN KEEGAN: Every system had to be looked at anew because everything was broken, and we had to fix it. WENDLAND: She says the reason it's getting federal and private money to come up with new ways to deal with water is because it's already been hit again and again. But not every city has the cachet or the same level of crisis that New Orleans has. I'm Tegan Wendland in New Orleans. SUSAN PHILLIPS, BYLINE: Here in Philadelphia, those big checks from government and private entities aren't rolling in. I'm Susan Phillips from member station WHYY. On the one hand, the city isn't as vulnerable as New Orleans, but some of its neighborhoods are expected to flood from rising tides along the Delaware River. To pay for upgrades, it has to turn to its residents, who pay a storm water fee each month. For most, it's only a few bucks, but for others. . . GINA RUCCI: So I get this bill for $300 and - I don't know - $30. PHILLIPS: Gina Rucci operates Popi's, an Italian restaurant in south Philadelphia where, several years ago, she bought an adjacent property and turned it into a parking lot. RUCCI: And I wasn't thinking about a water bill because there was no water on the lot. PHILLIPS: But the city charges her for the water runoff from her parking lot. To reduce that bill, she recently found out about a program where the city encourages green infrastructure - things like rain gardens, tree trenches and green roofs. RUCCI: Once your own ground here becomes permeable, that water's going to just sink. PHILLIPS: Today, Rucci has cut her water runoff bill by 60 percent. So far, Philadelphia has built hundreds of green infrastructure projects in streets, parks and parking lots. And green infrastructure is cheaper, especially compared to more traditional engineering approaches, like building a large concrete tunnel to hold the extra water. Chris Crockett is an engineer with Philadelphia's water department in charge of planning for climate change. CHRIS CROCKETT: We could - instead of doing these greener practices, we could just go and dig a hole to China and build a tunnel. But that has a huge carbon footprint. PHILLIPS: And it's not just the carbon footprint that's a problem. That hole-and-tunnel approach would've cost the city's rate payers $10 billion dollars and taken decades complete. The thousands of rain gardens, green roofs and tree trenches will cost the city around $2 billion. For NPR News, I'm Susan Phillips in Philadelphia.

Long before the crisis in Flint, Mich. , Chicago announced a plan to improve or replace miles of old water lines. Well intended as that plan may be, the work shakes up the water system. And some residents contend that work is causing unsafe lead levels in the water now. NPR's Cheryl Corley reports. CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: Always bustling, it's even noisier on Chicago's North Broadway Street the past few weeks. There's water flowing from an open fire hydrant. And as traffic inches by a water management crew, a cement truck backs up and pours concrete down into a big hole in the street. MAUREEN MARTINO: Well, we always say there's two seasons, either winter and construction. CORLEY: Maureen Martino, the executive director of the Lakeview East Chamber of Commerce, says a large grocery store under construction is financing this particular water main upgrade. But the city has plenty more water main works scheduled for the area this year. MARTINO: When we took a look at the water mains, what they pulled out this week over on Broadway, and see how old they look and how crumbling and what that new water mains look, you'll see the need is there. CORLEY: Chicago has more than 4,000 miles of water mains under city streets. In 2012, the city announced a 10-year plan to replace nearly 900 miles of them. The mains are not made of lead, but nearly 80 percent of the water lines that connect up to the water mains and bring water into homes and businesses are lead pipes. And that's a problem, says attorney Steve Berman. He's filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of three Chicago residents who say the city's process of replacing water mains actually disturbs the lead service lines and increases the amount of lead in the city's drinking water. Berman says the city failed to warn residents or to tell them how to reduce the risk of lead contamination from their taps. STEVE BERMAN: So we have children drinking lead in the water in Chicago. That's not acceptable. And so we seek to have proper warnings sent out in the future when this is done, to have testing of kids to see if they have elevated lead levels and to have the city of Chicago replace these lead pipes with non-lead pipes. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Let's thank our speaker again. (APPLAUSE)CORLEY: At an evening lecture, the Environmental Protection Agency's Miguel Del Toral, briefs some Chicago residents about the 2013 study he conducted with the city's Department of Water Management that's cited in the lawsuit. Del Toral says the aim of the study was to figure out better ways to determine the lead levels in the city's drinking water. He says while Chicago's overall water quality is good, what the study made clear is that the method, or sampling protocol that's used to measure the amount of lead in drinking water. . . MIGUEL DEL TORAL: Is not really capturing the high lead that's there - everywhere, not just in Chicago. It's a national issue. CORLEY: Del Toral, who was among the first at the EPA to raise concerns about the water crisis in Flint, says disturbing lead pipes can cause lead levels to spike. But it depends on how severely the pipe is shaken and how much of the pipe's protective coating is knocked off. Chicago recently announced that it will resume a water testing program at homes in some neighborhoods where children have tested positive for elevated blood lead levels. In an interview with WFLD, Fox TV in Chicago, Tom Powers, the city's outgoing water commissioner, says Chicago water is safe. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TOM POWERS: Well, the water meets and exceeds every standard of the U. S. EPA. We've done testing in areas where water main work has been done, and we have not seen any correlation to any increases in lead levels as a result of any of that work. CORLEY: Powers says the water department adds phosphate to the water supply to mitigate lead leaching. But anyone can call the city to arrange free testing for lead. Miguel Del Toral, with the EPA, says that's a good step, but the country needs to have a conversation about what it would take to eliminate all lead pipes. In a city like Chicago, where the use of lead pipes is nearly universal, that would take a very long time. Cheryl Corley, NPR News, Chicago.

But rising seas aren't a new phenomenon. Coastal communities have had to adapt to sea level rise and shifting coastlines since the end of the Ice Age. NPR's Greg Allen reports that archaeologists in Florida have been studying how earlier cultures coped with some of the same environmental challenges that we face today. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Millions of years of Florida's history are lying on a table in Paulette McFadden's office. PAULETTE MCFADDEN: This core actually spans about 30 million years. ALLEN: McFadden is a geoarchaeologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville. The core sample on her table is several feet long, a tube of sediment that details the geological record of Horseshoe Beach, a community on the Big Bend region of Florida's Gulf Coast. In this core, around 2,500 years ago, McFadden sees the beginning of big changes in the area. Dry land becomes marshy. Marshes give way to open water. MCFADDEN: So we can see sea level rising. And as the environment changes, people are moving around on the landscape as well. ALLEN: Worldwide, sea level rise began more than 10,000 years ago at the end of the Ice Age. In Florida, then, as now, a flat land mass with a long coastline, even a small rise in sea level inundates a very large area. And analyzing the core samples, McFadden says she found something alarming, a period around 2,000 years ago when sea level rise suddenly spiked. MCFADDEN: This is a rapid pulse - that sea level rate really increased significantly, and the system couldn't equalize. So this inundated about a mile and a half of land area - very quickly. ALLEN: It was a rapid rise in sea level archaeologists have also found in other sites on the Gulf Coast, likely the result of melting glaciers from global warming. How Florida's earliest residents coped with rising seas, McFadden believes, offers lessons for today. MCFADDEN: Ready? ALLEN: At Horseshoe Beach, we take a boat out to the earliest human settlement in the area that's still above water. Bird Island is just a quarter mile from the mainland. MCFADDEN: All of this area here that's so very shallow was all terrestrial when Bird Island was first inhabited. ALLEN: A few people still live on Bird Island. Patsy Nelms's family has owned it since buying it from the government as military surplus after World War II. PATSY NELMS: Well, the island has changed shape over the years, so. . . ALLEN: As the sea level has risen, parts of Bird Island have begun to wash away. Nelms stands on a small, sandy beach area where erosion is exposing artifacts and occasionally human remains thousands of years old. Nelms stoops down and hands McFadden pottery shards she picks out of the sand. NELMS: This one's got more. MCFADDEN: There's some check-stamped pottery. ALLEN: People lived here more than 2,000 years until rising seas cut off the area from the mainland, turning it into an island. They relocated, eventually settling inland. McFadden says these were people who were well aware of the changing coastline and rising seas and for whom adapting to the environment was a way of life. MCFADDEN: I think there was always the expectation of - at some point, maybe it's not in my generation, but within my grandchild's generation - we're going to have to move. So I don't think that it was quite as traumatic as it is, perhaps, for us today when Miami floods. ALLEN: McFadden says the people who lived on Bird Island chose the site of their new settlement carefully. It had fresh water. It was just a short canoe ride away from fish and oysters in the Gulf. And it was far enough inland that it was protected from storm surge and rising seas. The decision to relocate, she believes, may have been connected to that rapid spike in sea level 2,000 years ago. It's an experience she believes officials and city planners can learn from. MCFADDEN: We're going to see similar things happen. We're going to see the shoreline move in a couple of kilometers in some areas. We're going to see large amounts of beach erode away. So understanding how people in the past dealt with that sort of event can help us to navigate the pitfalls of another event very similar to that. ALLEN: Other settlements may hold more answers about how early Floridians adapted to climate change and rising seas. Unfortunately, the earliest human settlements in Florida are now believed to be underwater on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Greg Allen, NPR News, Horseshoe Beach, Fla.

Who's number one on the ISIS terrorist network? Who's the most important character in \"Game Of Thrones? \" Turns out that math might help us figure that out. Network analysis is the branch of mathematics that adds up the links between people. Our WEEKEND EDITION math guy Keith Devlin joins us now from the studios of Stanford University. Keith, thanks very much for being with us. KEITH DEVLIN, BYLINE: Glad to be here, Scott. SIMON: Keith, I don't want to waste people's time. So who is the most important character in \"Game Of Thrones? \"DEVLIN: The most important character in \"Game Of Thrones\" is Tyrion. He's the character played by Peter Dinklage. SIMON: And you used mathematics to figure this out? DEVLIN: Well, I didn't, but a professor of mathematics at Macalester College and one of his students did that. And they use this stuff called social network analysis, which is what the NSA uses to identify key terrorists and, you know, the people that they want to send the drones after. But these guys at Macalester College took that same method and applied it to \"Game Of Thrones. \"SIMON: Is it as simple as they just add up all the mentions on social media platforms or what? DEVLIN: In a sense it is. It's a matter - it's - look at the networks, you look at the strengths of the connections between the networks and almost always you find that one or two nodes come to the top, and they're the most important nodes. And they're the ones who, in a terrorist network, if you take them out, it causes significant damage to the network. And in the case of \"Game Of Thrones,\" if you took out Tyrion, it would make a huge difference to the rest of the story. So he's the one that is most likely to survive through the entire series. SIMON: Unless of course he gets a better offer from another series and they decide they have to write him out. But I'm interested in the fact that it can be used to penetrate what's going on in a supposedly secret terrorist network. DEVLIN: When you start talking about terrorists network, then of course it gets to be real big. In fact, the reason the NSA and now the FBI want to dragnet information about everybody is the bigger the network is that you perform it on, the more accurate the results you're going to get. So when you take this idea that can be applied to \"Game Of Thrones\" and plug it into the network of everybody that's on the internet and everybody that's using mobile phones, which the NSA can do thanks to enormous computing power, then you get results that you wouldn't be able to figure out any other way because things surface that would be otherwise lost in the sea of communications. SIMON: Have you applied this to any other endeavors? DEVLIN: Yeah, in fact my own institute at Stanford did this a few years ago to look at entrepreneurship and start-up companies. We did one study where we compared Stanford, Harvard, Berkeley and MIT to see which one was the most entrepreneurial and in terms of start-up companies and the companies that they - how much money they make and so forth. And in the case of that, Stanford came out way at the top of the pile, as we expected which is. . . SIMON: Oh, oh, what a surprise. Yeah. DEVLIN: But the - one thing that was kind of a surprise and really amused us is when we looked at MIT's network of entrepreneurship, one of the biggest nodes from MIT's own entrepreneurship network is Stanford University. SIMON: Did you say nodes or nerds? DEVLIN: This is - these are actually nodes of nerds. (Unintelligible). . . SIMON: Yes, that occurred to me. DEVLIN: . . . Another catchphrase. Among the nodes of nerds from MIT, Stanford was one of the big nerd nodes. SIMON: (Laughter) I mean, all of this being noted, isn't part of the reason that people watch the series \"Game Of Thrones\" is that the author, George R. R. Martin, is perfectly capable of having the major character get swooped away by a dragon at any moment? DEVLIN: You know, it may be that the people producing that series will look at this paper and say aha, the next person we need to kill off to surprise everybody is not John Snow. It's Tyrion. SIMON: Well, to be continued. Stay tuned, as they say. DEVLIN: (Laughter). SIMON: Keith Devlin is our WEEKEND EDITION math guy joining us from Stanford. Keith, thanks so much for being with us. DEVLIN: My pleasure, Scott. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Who's the most popular person at your high school? Who's number one on the ISIS terrorist network? Who's the most important character in \"Game Of Thrones? \" Turns out that math might help us figure that out. Network analysis is the branch of mathematics that adds up the links between people. Our WEEKEND EDITION math guy Keith Devlin joins us now from the studios of Stanford University. Keith, thanks very much for being with us. KEITH DEVLIN, BYLINE: Glad to be here, Scott. SIMON: Keith, I don't want to waste people's time. So who is the most important character in \"Game Of Thrones? \" DEVLIN: The most important character in \"Game Of Thrones\" is Tyrion. He's the character played by Peter Dinklage. SIMON: And you used mathematics to figure this out? DEVLIN: Well, I didn't, but a professor of mathematics at Macalester College and one of his students did that. And they use this stuff called social network analysis, which is what the NSA uses to identify key terrorists and, you know, the people that they want to send the drones after. But these guys at Macalester College took that same method and applied it to \"Game Of Thrones. \" SIMON: Is it as simple as they just add up all the mentions on social media platforms or what? DEVLIN: In a sense it is. It's a matter - it's - look at the networks, you look at the strengths of the connections between the networks and almost always you find that one or two nodes come to the top, and they're the most important nodes. And they're the ones who, in a terrorist network, if you take them out, it causes significant damage to the network. And in the case of \"Game Of Thrones,\" if you took out Tyrion, it would make a huge difference to the rest of the story. So he's the one that is most likely to survive through the entire series. SIMON: Unless of course he gets a better offer from another series and they decide they have to write him out. But I'm interested in the fact that it can be used to penetrate what's going on in a supposedly secret terrorist network. DEVLIN: When you start talking about terrorists network, then of course it gets to be real big. In fact, the reason the NSA and now the FBI want to dragnet information about everybody is the bigger the network is that you perform it on, the more accurate the results you're going to get. So when you take this idea that can be applied to \"Game Of Thrones\" and plug it into the network of everybody that's on the internet and everybody that's using mobile phones, which the NSA can do thanks to enormous computing power, then you get results that you wouldn't be able to figure out any other way because things surface that would be otherwise lost in the sea of communications. SIMON: Have you applied this to any other endeavors? DEVLIN: Yeah, in fact my own institute at Stanford did this a few years ago to look at entrepreneurship and start-up companies. We did one study where we compared Stanford, Harvard, Berkeley and MIT to see which one was the most entrepreneurial and in terms of start-up companies and the companies that they - how much money they make and so forth. And in the case of that, Stanford came out way at the top of the pile, as we expected which is. . . SIMON: Oh, oh, what a surprise. Yeah. DEVLIN: But the - one thing that was kind of a surprise and really amused us is when we looked at MIT's network of entrepreneurship, one of the biggest nodes from MIT's own entrepreneurship network is Stanford University. SIMON: Did you say nodes or nerds? DEVLIN: This is - these are actually nodes of nerds. (Unintelligible). . . SIMON: Yes, that occurred to me. DEVLIN: . . . Another catchphrase. Among the nodes of nerds from MIT, Stanford was one of the big nerd nodes. SIMON: (Laughter) I mean, all of this being noted, isn't part of the reason that people watch the series \"Game Of Thrones\" is that the author, George R. R. Martin, is perfectly capable of having the major character get swooped away by a dragon at any moment? DEVLIN: You know, it may be that the people producing that series will look at this paper and say aha, the next person we need to kill off to surprise everybody is not John Snow. It's Tyrion. SIMON: Well, to be continued. Stay tuned, as they say. DEVLIN: (Laughter). SIMON: Keith Devlin is our WEEKEND EDITION math guy joining us from Stanford. Keith, thanks so much for being with us.

Thanks so much for being with us. PAM MUELLER: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: Your study shows that writing notes by hand makes you focus your attention in some way that just typing it doesn't. MUELLER: So when people type their notes, they have this tendency to try to take verbatim notes and write down as much of the lecture as they can. The students who were taking longhand notes in our studies were forced to be more selective because you can't write as fast as you can type. And that extra processing of the material that they were doing benefited them. MARTIN: That's so interesting. So you're saying that if you're typing notes, you're really, like, taking dictation, whereas if you're doing it by longhand, there's no way you can keep up that way. And so you're inevitably synthesizing information and that's a kind of learning? MUELLER: Exactly, particularly when you're asked a question that involves conceptual understanding of the material. We found that on factual questions, the students did approximately equivalently. But when it came to the deeper understanding of material, that's where the longhand note takers really shown. MARTIN: Do you want to out yourself? Are you a longhand note taker or were you, in college, a computer note taker? MUELLER: So when I was in college, nobody really had a laptop. (LAUGHTER)MARTIN: (Imitating whispers) Me either. But we won't tell. MUELLER: (Laughter) When I was in law school, it was a huge debate about laptop versus longhand.

Is it just unrealistic to think that people would switch it up and go old school? MUELLER: I think it is a hard sell to get people to go back to pen and paper. But they are developing lots of technologies now like Livescribe and various stylus-and-tablet technologies that are getting better and better. And I think that could be sort of an easier sell to college students and people of that generation. I think that these results resonate a lot with people who are a little older.

Pam, I've been listening carefully and writing things down, all in longhand of course. Now this means I need to work on my penmanship, by the way.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. I was on Facebook the other day when a friend request came in. I don't have a great memory for faces and names, so I found myself trying to figure out if I had met this person somewhere. But then at the back of my mind, I remembered a study. It said my friendship choices on Facebook might be shaped by biases outside of my conscious awareness, in my hidden brain. Michelle Hebl is a psychologist at Rice University who ran the Facebook study. She designed fictitious profiles for two men and two women. Both men were named Michael Davis. Both women were Jennifer Davis. All the characters were African-American. The only real difference between the profiles were the photos. One Photoshopped version of Michael Davis and Jennifer Davis had lighter skin. The other had darker skin. Mikki Hebl sent out friend requests on Facebook on behalf of these fictitious characters to more than a thousand people in a big American city. Since these were invented characters, most of the requests were declined. But there was a big disparity in how often whites accepted friend requests from the darker-skinned Michaels and Jennifers. MICHELLE HEBL: People were less likely to friend them. They were less likely particularly to friend the dark black males. VEDANTAM: If you follow these kinds of experiments, this finding is disappointing but not surprising. Using similar experimental methods, researchers have found disparities in the way professors spend time with students, how companies select job applicants for interviews, even how legislators respond to constituents. But something new is happening today. The bias decisions we once made in interpersonal settings are now being made on giant online platforms, where our actions have the potential to affect many more people. Think about the way you might look for a roommate. Once upon a time, you may have put up a flyer on a bulletin board and talked to people who responded. Today, you might turn to sites such as roommates. com or Craigslist. Raj Ghoshal, a sociologist at Goucher College in Baltimore, recently conducted a roommate study on Craigslist using a technique similar to the one Mikki Hebl used on Facebook. RAJ GHOSHAL: We definitely found a pattern of preference or bias in favor of white-sounding names. So for every 100 replies that a white-sounding name got, a Latina name got about 75, and an African-American name got about 65 or something like that. VEDANTAM: That is a huge difference. GHOSHAL: It's a pretty big difference, right? So if you were African-American, you'd have to spend about one and a half times as much time applying for housing as would somebody with a white name. VEDANTAM: On today's podcast, we're going to delve into what happens when age-old biases rear their heads in a new and growing part of our lives, what's sometimes called the sharing economy. HEBL: It's one thing if I want to discriminate about who I'm going to have over on Friday night to have for dinner or who I want to have sleep over. But it's another thing when my private house starts to become my business. VEDANTAM: The sharing economy, platforms that allow you to hail a taxi, call a babysitter, find a room on Airbnb, rely on making what used to be business exchanges into semi-personal transactions. Your Uber driver sees your name and photograph. You see your driver's name and photo. It's supposed to increase trust, and there's every reason to think it does. But it also does something else. HEBL: When you give people names, then you give people information about your ethnicity. You give people information that they can use to look you up and figure out more cues about you, and that becomes problematic. VEDANTAM: Mikki was on a ship when I interviewed her. She's teaching a semester at sea. During the long voyage, she says, her students tell her about the many online platforms that they are using. HEBL: There's a website called care. com, and it's a babysitting website where people advertise themselves as babysitters. And they have to put a picture of themselves on. So you can think about how, again, maybe I don't want a babysitter that is of that race. Maybe I don't want a babysitter that is of that gender. And so you begin to see where this very subtle type of discrimination can be very systemic. VEDANTAM: The sharing economy is unleashing new possibilities in our lives. These platforms allow us to meet more people, visit more places, get more connected. I'm personally a fan of many apps. But it also seems clear to me that these platforms provide a mechanism to amplify our collective bias. What's especially insidious about the biases on these platforms is that their consequences are largely hidden. If your request to be a babysitter gets turned down, you have no way of knowing if this was driven by racial bias. So I asked HIDDEN BRAIN producers Maggie Penman and Max Nesterak to take a few weeks and try to find people who were personally affected by such biases. They decided to focus on an important new part of the sharing economy, Airbnb. MAGGIE PENMAN, BYLINE: Imagine you're going on vacation with some friends. You do a quick search online, find a few hotels in the city you'd like to stay in. You pick one, ideally with a hot tub, and enter your credit card information. Great, you think, all set. MAX NESTERAK, BYLINE: But then you get an email. We're sorry, but the dates you just booked aren't available after all. They were listed by mistake. PENMAN: Now if this happened to you once, you might chalk it up to a weird website glitch. But if it happened to you over and over, something would start to feel funny. You might start to feel like it's something about you that's making these hotels suddenly unavailable. NESTERAK: This is exactly how could Quirtina Crittenden felt when she would try to use Airbnb to book vacations with her friends. She would find a house that was listed as available, send a booking request. QUIRTINA CRITTENDEN: And I would get declined all the time. PENMAN: Quirtina got a bunch of similar responses. CRITTENDEN: The host would always come up with excuses like, oh, someone actually just booked it or, oh, some of my regulars are coming in town, and they're going to stay there. I just haven't updated my calendar. But I got suspicious when I would check back, like, days later and see that those dates were still available. NESTERAK: Quirtina's black. And this is relevant because on Airbnb, both hosts and guests have their names and photos prominently displayed on their profiles. PENMAN: And this is actually one of the platform's selling points. It's supposed to make these transactions between strangers feel less anonymous and less scary. NESTERAK: But it also made Quirtina start to wonder if these rejections had something to do with her race. CRITTENDEN: My name is Quirtina. I have a very black-sounding name. And I also had my photos, so I'm very clearly a black woman. NESTERAK: And when she looked at the reviews that previous guests had left for these hosts. . . CRITTENDEN: I never saw anybody who looked like me. PENMAN: So, Quirtina did what any good millennial does when they're frustrated. She took to Twitter. CRITTENDEN: And I was just venting my frustrations, and I just included a lot of screenshots of the messages that I was getting from people. And I put the #AirbnbWhileBlack. NESTERAK: She started hearing from lots of friends who had similar experiences. . . CRITTENDEN: The most common response that I got was, oh, yeah, that's why I don't use my photo. Like, duh (laughter), like, I was the late one. NESTERAK: . . . And one friend who hadn't. CRITTENDEN: One of my friends who is actually black, he responded to me and said, well, I've never had an issue. And then he went back and checked his profile, and I guess he'd never wanted to use his photo. So he realized that the whole time he had been using a photo of some random white guy from our school, and so he's like, oh, maybe this is why I've never had an issue. PENMAN: So, Quirtina decided to tweak her profile. CRITTENDEN: I shortened my name to just Tina, which is a name that I go by in work and in other settings. And I changed my photo to a landscape. Ever since I changed my name and my photo, I've never had any issues on Airbnb. PENMAN: Now it's impossible to say exactly why Quirtina was rejected by those specific hosts. NESTERAK: But a recent study shows racial discrimination on Airbnb is widespread. MICHAEL LUCA: I'm Michael Luca. I'm a faculty member at Harvard Business School. I'm an assistant professor of business administration. PENMAN: Michael Luca and his colleagues, Benjamin Edelman and Dan Svirsky, sent out fake Airbnb requests to real-life hosts. LUCA: So we sent out 6,400 requests to stay with people, and we kept every request the same. NESTERAK: The only thing that was different about the requests, the profiles attached to them either had African-American-sounding names or white-sounding names. PENMAN: So, like, does Brad get the same number of responses on Airbnb as Jamaal? NESTERAK: And unfortunately. . . LUCA: We could see that there was a very different response rate and acceptance rate for African-American guests relative to white guests. Having an African-American name leads to roughly a 15 percent lower chance of being accepted as a guest on Airbnb relative to having a distinctively white name, holding all else constant. NESTERAK: To put this in perspective, Airbnb isn't some little startup anymore. PENMAN: It's one of the largest players in the hotel industry worldwide. In 2015, more than 2 million listings were offered on the platform from hosts around the world. That's nearly four times as many rooms as the Marriott hotel chain. NESTERAK: You can even rent a castle. PENMAN: You can even rent a castle. And it's not just vacation rentals. People are finding housing on this platform for months at a time. So discrimination on Airbnb is discrimination in the housing market. NESTERAK: Michael Luca and his colleagues think people could be discriminating without even knowing it. LUCA: Bias for a lot of people is something that is accidental. NESTERAK: What Michael Luca is talking about is unconscious bias, these hidden associations we have that affect our behavior without us realizing it. It's unlikely that most hosts are saying to themselves, I'm going to reject this person because I don't want to rent to a black person. PENMAN: I mean, maybe some people are intentionally discriminating. NESTERAK: There are probably some people like that. But, Michael Luca suspects the way Airbnb's platform is designed is triggering the associations people have of some racial groups. So because names and photos are the first thing people see, it may also be one of the first things they consider, consciously or unconsciously, when choosing a place to stay. He and his colleagues looked at five major cities in the U. S. , and discrimination was happening across the board. LUCA: We saw that there was discrimination among cheap listings, expensive listings, in diverse neighborhoods, in homogenous neighborhoods, among white hosts and among African-American hosts. DAVID KING: I actually spoke to Mike Luca last week. PENMAN: That's David King, the brand-new director of diversity and belonging at Airbnb. He knows this is a problem, and he wants Airbnb to be a leader on fixing it. KING: There is a racial bias in platforms, and we are working with Mike Luca and any other external interested parties into how do we address and fix this problem. NESTERAK: One thing that could fix the problem is just getting rid of names and photos or making them less prominent. But Airbnb doesn't think that would improve their platform. KING: The photos are on the platform for a reason. Number one, it really does help to aid in the trust between the guest and the host. And then secondary to that is safety. You want to make sure that that guest that shows up at your door is the person that you've been communicating with. PENMAN: But, David King also pointed out there's a lot of opportunity for Airbnb to do good. They're bringing together people from all different backgrounds who wouldn't normally meet. KING: We've done some recent reports in Chicago and New York, pointing out that undeserved communities, especially African-American communities, have benefited quite a bit from our platform, usually in neighborhoods where there are few hotels. NESTERAK: One of those neighborhoods with few hotels is Washington, D. C. 's Anacostia. The neighborhood is on the edge of city limits on the other side of the Anacostia River from the capital and the Washington Monument. It's a neighborhood with a lot of big box stores and empty lots but also rowhouses and families that go back generations. We went there to visit Airbnb host Synta Keeling. SYNTA KEELING: Hi, how are you? NESTERAK: Hi, how are you? PENMAN: Synta owns a three-story townhouse in a new development. She rents out two rooms on Airbnb. There's a fitness room, cable and high-speed Internet, solar panels and slippers for all of her guests. PENMAN: I love the slippers, first of all. KEELING: (Laughter) Ikea. NESTERAK: Synta is a super host, and we're not just saying that because of the slippers. It's an official designation she's earned from Airbnb based on positive reviews from her guests, her responsiveness to booking requests and the fact that she's never canceled a booking. It shows Airbnb travelers she's been verified as a good person to stay with. Synta says as a black host in a black neighborhood, that's important. She feels like she gets held to a higher standard than other hosts. KEELING: This neighborhood's called Capital View, and it's 98 percent African-American, double-digit unemployment. PENMAN: We asked Synta whether her race and the racial composition of her neighborhood made it harder to get guests. And she said. . . KEELING: Absolutely (laughter). Yeah, no, I had one - I've had some instances where people will ask me all these questions about is it unsafe and this, and I'll say, you know, I'm a black Filipino woman. I take - we take great pride in our community. This is absolutely a good place for you to stay. And I'll say those things, and then there will be crickets. They'll just not book. PENMAN: But, Synta also said there were great things about Airbnb. For one thing, it brings her a steady second income. NESTERAK: Airbnb brings business to the stores and restaurants that don't typically benefit from the tourism industry. It might even help change people's perceptions of Anacostia. Airbnb's slogan is belong anywhere, and there's some truth to it. PENMAN: Synta Keeling told us a story about one of her guests that drove this message home. He came back from being out for the day and told her. . . KEELING: I took the bus back, and I was the only white person on the bus, and it was all these black people. And I asked myself, were they going to hurt me? Am I unsafe? And then I realized they weren't hurting me, and nothing was going to happen to me. Like, they were just sitting there normal. And he was saying this in a way that he was like he mentally realized the horridness of what he was saying, where at the same time, he was just being honest about what he was thinking and that he arrived at the stop and just had come off. And, like, nothing had happened to him, and it was just this shock. NESTERAK: Synta says she knows that some people won't rent from her because she's a black host in a predominantly black neighborhood. PENMAN: But here's the thing. She's glad those people don't book with her. KEELING: The strange thing about Airbnb that makes it tough is I really don't want a racist guest in my house because I don't - I live here in this space, so I don't need to feel uncomfortable, you know, the other way. But if you just feel like, well, you know, maybe I'll give this a shot, then I'm willing to be open-minded. PENMAN: The fact is Airbnb is not the same thing as a major hotel chain. Hosts have discretion on the platform, but guests don't have the same legal recourse as hotel customers if they feel they've been discriminated against. NESTERAK: We spoke to a couple lawyers for this story, and the legal picture is a little murky here. It isn't clear who, if anyone, is liable for discrimination on a web-based platform. PENMAN: So Airbnb does offer this opportunity to experience different cultures, to meet people you wouldn't normally meet. But sometimes hidden bias is getting in the way. NESTERAK: And people like Quirtina and Synta are paying the price. VEDANTAM: That's Maggie Penman and Max Nesterak, reporting on people who feel they have personally experienced bias in the sharing economy. When we come back, Maggie, Max and I will discuss potential solutions to the problem. VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. We're exploring the many ways in which the sharing economy might allow hidden biases to flourish. As apps in the sharing economy become an increasingly large part of our lives, they have the potential to create great disparities. Producers Maggie Penman and Max Nesterak are in the studio with me now to talk about potential solutions. Hi, Max. NESTERAK: Hi, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Hey, Maggie. PENMAN: Hey, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Maggie, if I understand correctly, Airbnb actually gives hosts a mechanism to avoid this problem. PENMAN: It's true. There is this feature called Instant Book, and it's exactly what it sounds like. Basically, as a guest, you can book a room just like you would a hotel without waiting to be accepted by the host. VEDANTAM: Why would hosts want to offer this option? PENMAN: Well, it's much more convenient for guests, so I think you're more likely to get bookings if you offer Instant Book. And then it's also easy for hosts because if you're renting out your whole house and you don't really care who stays there, you can just offer this option and not deal with it. VEDANTAM: And is there any evidence that this feature is actually being used to avoid discrimination on Airbnb? PENMAN: Yeah, Max and I actually talked to this guy, Reid Kennedy (ph). He's African-American, and his experience with Airbnb was very similar to Quirtina's. REID KENNEDY: And so after being rejected and I think in that case four times within the same day for reasons again that weren't specified, I started to see a pattern. PENMAN: So, Reid complained to Airbnb, and Airbnb gave him a credit. But he was struggling to use this credit because he was still having trouble booking a place. So he used Instant Book. KENNEDY: And ironically, the host was a black man, who may have been using the Instant Book feature for the same reason I was. VEDANTAM: So, Max, what I'm hearing Maggie say is that there might be a designed solution for the psychological problem of bias. NESTERAK: Yeah, and this is similar to a solution that Michael Luca came up with. He worked with a computer scientist, and they developed this Google Chrome app called Debias Yourself. It removes photos and names from people's profiles so you can't discriminate even by accident. PENMAN: And didn't Michael Luca say he actually got this idea from orchestras? NESTERAK: He did. So it used to be that back in the day, orchestras were overwhelmingly male, and people may have thought, oh, there's just more male musicians, or maybe they're just better. But then there started to be a shift in orchestras where there were more women. And researchers went back and looked at this, and they found that there had been a change to the audition process, where there was now a screen in between the judges and the person auditioning. And Mike Luca says this is something that Airbnb should be doing only on a larger scale. LUCA: One of the things that I love about the digital world is that it gives us the opportunity to choose exactly where to put screens and where not to put screens. So I think we have a host of new decisions that we can make as market designers that will decide how inclusive a society we have or how much discrimination we want to encourage or allow. VEDANTAM: I have to say, it might not all be about the information that you're hiding. It could also be about the information that you're emphasizing. Raj Ghoshal - this is the sociologist at Goucher College who did the study on Craigslist - suggested that we might want to be playing up certain kinds of information. GHOSHAL: Perhaps colleges and universities can play a role in this, and perhaps websites like Craigslist or roommates. com could do more to actually, like, frontload information about people's living habits or cultural identities, what time people get up and go to bed, what level of messy they are, that sort of thing rather than immediately hitting people over the head with somebody's name just because, you know, all of the evidence we have, evidence from other studies just suggests that, like, race and names is such a powerful signal to people that we probably don't actually want it to be the first thing or the immediate thing that the people see in our deciding bias. PENMAN: Yeah, that's a really interesting idea. Another option would be to offer trainings about unconscious bias to hosts. So Airbnb has actually already taken the step of training their employees and some hosts in recognizing and combating unconscious bias. And maybe if they make that information available on a larger scale, hosts will start to check their own biases. NESTERAK: Another idea that we've heard is to provide feedback to hosts. So Airbnb could send hosts an email saying, here are the requests you received, and here are the guests you accepted. Now if someone doesn't want to host people from certain racial groups, this feedback wouldn't do much. But for those who might not mean to discriminate, it could be enough to nudge them in the right direction. VEDANTAM: Well, that's interesting stuff. Thanks so much, Max. NESTERAK: Thank you. VEDANTAM: Thanks, Maggie. PENMAN: Thanks, Shankar. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: The HIDDEN BRAIN podcast is produced by Kara McGuirk-Alison, Maggie Penman and Max Nesterak. If you like this episode, consider giving us a review on iTunes. It will help other people find the podcast. We're going to be talking about this episode on social media using the #AirbnbWhileBlack. Do join the conversation. I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is NPR. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. I was on Facebook the other day when a friend request came in. I don't have a great memory for faces and names, so I found myself trying to figure out if I had met this person somewhere. But then at the back of my mind, I remembered a study. It said my friendship choices on Facebook might be shaped by biases outside of my conscious awareness, in my hidden brain. Michelle Hebl is a psychologist at Rice University who ran the Facebook study. She designed fictitious profiles for two men and two women. Both men were named Michael Davis. Both women were Jennifer Davis. All the characters were African-American. The only real difference between the profiles were the photos. One Photoshopped version of Michael Davis and Jennifer Davis had lighter skin. The other had darker skin. Mikki Hebl sent out friend requests on Facebook on behalf of these fictitious characters to more than a thousand people in a big American city. Since these were invented characters, most of the requests were declined. But there was a big disparity in how often whites accepted friend requests from the darker-skinned Michaels and Jennifers. MICHELLE HEBL: People were less likely to friend them. They were less likely particularly to friend the dark black males. VEDANTAM: If you follow these kinds of experiments, this finding is disappointing but not surprising. Using similar experimental methods, researchers have found disparities in the way professors spend time with students, how companies select job applicants for interviews, even how legislators respond to constituents. But something new is happening today. The bias decisions we once made in interpersonal settings are now being made on giant online platforms, where our actions have the potential to affect many more people. Think about the way you might look for a roommate. Once upon a time, you may have put up a flyer on a bulletin board and talked to people who responded. Today, you might turn to sites such as roommates. com or Craigslist. Raj Ghoshal, a sociologist at Goucher College in Baltimore, recently conducted a roommate study on Craigslist using a technique similar to the one Mikki Hebl used on Facebook. RAJ GHOSHAL: We definitely found a pattern of preference or bias in favor of white-sounding names. So for every 100 replies that a white-sounding name got, a Latina name got about 75, and an African-American name got about 65 or something like that. VEDANTAM: That is a huge difference. GHOSHAL: It's a pretty big difference, right? So if you were African-American, you'd have to spend about one and a half times as much time applying for housing as would somebody with a white name. VEDANTAM: On today's podcast, we're going to delve into what happens when age-old biases rear their heads in a new and growing part of our lives, what's sometimes called the sharing economy. HEBL: It's one thing if I want to discriminate about who I'm going to have over on Friday night to have for dinner or who I want to have sleep over. But it's another thing when my private house starts to become my business. VEDANTAM: The sharing economy, platforms that allow you to hail a taxi, call a babysitter, find a room on Airbnb, rely on making what used to be business exchanges into semi-personal transactions. Your Uber driver sees your name and photograph. You see your driver's name and photo. It's supposed to increase trust, and there's every reason to think it does. But it also does something else. HEBL: When you give people names, then you give people information about your ethnicity. You give people information that they can use to look you up and figure out more cues about you, and that becomes problematic. VEDANTAM: Mikki was on a ship when I interviewed her. She's teaching a semester at sea. During the long voyage, she says, her students tell her about the many online platforms that they are using. HEBL: There's a website called care. com, and it's a babysitting website where people advertise themselves as babysitters. And they have to put a picture of themselves on. So you can think about how, again, maybe I don't want a babysitter that is of that race. Maybe I don't want a babysitter that is of that gender. And so you begin to see where this very subtle type of discrimination can be very systemic. VEDANTAM: The sharing economy is unleashing new possibilities in our lives. These platforms allow us to meet more people, visit more places, get more connected. I'm personally a fan of many apps. But it also seems clear to me that these platforms provide a mechanism to amplify our collective bias. What's especially insidious about the biases on these platforms is that their consequences are largely hidden. If your request to be a babysitter gets turned down, you have no way of knowing if this was driven by racial bias. So I asked HIDDEN BRAIN producers Maggie Penman and Max Nesterak to take a few weeks and try to find people who were personally affected by such biases. They decided to focus on an important new part of the sharing economy, Airbnb. MAGGIE PENMAN, BYLINE: Imagine you're going on vacation with some friends. You do a quick search online, find a few hotels in the city you'd like to stay in. You pick one, ideally with a hot tub, and enter your credit card information. Great, you think, all set. MAX NESTERAK, BYLINE: But then you get an email. We're sorry, but the dates you just booked aren't available after all. They were listed by mistake. PENMAN: Now if this happened to you once, you might chalk it up to a weird website glitch. But if it happened to you over and over, something would start to feel funny. You might start to feel like it's something about you that's making these hotels suddenly unavailable. NESTERAK: This is exactly how could Quirtina Crittenden felt when she would try to use Airbnb to book vacations with her friends. She would find a house that was listed as available, send a booking request. QUIRTINA CRITTENDEN: And I would get declined all the time. PENMAN: Quirtina got a bunch of similar responses. CRITTENDEN: The host would always come up with excuses like, oh, someone actually just booked it or, oh, some of my regulars are coming in town, and they're going to stay there. I just haven't updated my calendar. But I got suspicious when I would check back, like, days later and see that those dates were still available. NESTERAK: Quirtina's black. And this is relevant because on Airbnb, both hosts and guests have their names and photos prominently displayed on their profiles. PENMAN: And this is actually one of the platform's selling points. It's supposed to make these transactions between strangers feel less anonymous and less scary. NESTERAK: But it also made Quirtina start to wonder if these rejections had something to do with her race. CRITTENDEN: My name is Quirtina. I have a very black-sounding name. And I also had my photos, so I'm very clearly a black woman. NESTERAK: And when she looked at the reviews that previous guests had left for these hosts. . . CRITTENDEN: I never saw anybody who looked like me. PENMAN: So, Quirtina did what any good millennial does when they're frustrated. She took to Twitter. CRITTENDEN: And I was just venting my frustrations, and I just included a lot of screenshots of the messages that I was getting from people. And I put the #AirbnbWhileBlack. NESTERAK: She started hearing from lots of friends who had similar experiences. . . CRITTENDEN: The most common response that I got was, oh, yeah, that's why I don't use my photo. Like, duh (laughter), like, I was the late one. NESTERAK: . . . And one friend who hadn't. CRITTENDEN: One of my friends who is actually black, he responded to me and said, well, I've never had an issue. And then he went back and checked his profile, and I guess he'd never wanted to use his photo. So he realized that the whole time he had been using a photo of some random white guy from our school, and so he's like, oh, maybe this is why I've never had an issue. PENMAN: So, Quirtina decided to tweak her profile. CRITTENDEN: I shortened my name to just Tina, which is a name that I go by in work and in other settings. And I changed my photo to a landscape. Ever since I changed my name and my photo, I've never had any issues on Airbnb. PENMAN: Now it's impossible to say exactly why Quirtina was rejected by those specific hosts. NESTERAK: But a recent study shows racial discrimination on Airbnb is widespread. MICHAEL LUCA: I'm Michael Luca. I'm a faculty member at Harvard Business School. I'm an assistant professor of business administration. PENMAN: Michael Luca and his colleagues, Benjamin Edelman and Dan Svirsky, sent out fake Airbnb requests to real-life hosts. LUCA: So we sent out 6,400 requests to stay with people, and we kept every request the same. NESTERAK: The only thing that was different about the requests, the profiles attached to them either had African-American-sounding names or white-sounding names. PENMAN: So, like, does Brad get the same number of responses on Airbnb as Jamaal? NESTERAK: And unfortunately. . . LUCA: We could see that there was a very different response rate and acceptance rate for African-American guests relative to white guests. Having an African-American name leads to roughly a 15 percent lower chance of being accepted as a guest on Airbnb relative to having a distinctively white name, holding all else constant. NESTERAK: To put this in perspective, Airbnb isn't some little startup anymore. PENMAN: It's one of the largest players in the hotel industry worldwide. In 2015, more than 2 million listings were offered on the platform from hosts around the world. That's nearly four times as many rooms as the Marriott hotel chain. NESTERAK: You can even rent a castle. PENMAN: You can even rent a castle. And it's not just vacation rentals. People are finding housing on this platform for months at a time. So discrimination on Airbnb is discrimination in the housing market. NESTERAK: Michael Luca and his colleagues think people could be discriminating without even knowing it. LUCA: Bias for a lot of people is something that is accidental. NESTERAK: What Michael Luca is talking about is unconscious bias, these hidden associations we have that affect our behavior without us realizing it. It's unlikely that most hosts are saying to themselves, I'm going to reject this person because I don't want to rent to a black person. PENMAN: I mean, maybe some people are intentionally discriminating. NESTERAK: There are probably some people like that. But, Michael Luca suspects the way Airbnb's platform is designed is triggering the associations people have of some racial groups. So because names and photos are the first thing people see, it may also be one of the first things they consider, consciously or unconsciously, when choosing a place to stay. He and his colleagues looked at five major cities in the U. S. , and discrimination was happening across the board. LUCA: We saw that there was discrimination among cheap listings, expensive listings, in diverse neighborhoods, in homogenous neighborhoods, among white hosts and among African-American hosts. DAVID KING: I actually spoke to Mike Luca last week. PENMAN: That's David King, the brand-new director of diversity and belonging at Airbnb. He knows this is a problem, and he wants Airbnb to be a leader on fixing it. KING: There is a racial bias in platforms, and we are working with Mike Luca and any other external interested parties into how do we address and fix this problem. NESTERAK: One thing that could fix the problem is just getting rid of names and photos or making them less prominent. But Airbnb doesn't think that would improve their platform. KING: The photos are on the platform for a reason. Number one, it really does help to aid in the trust between the guest and the host. And then secondary to that is safety. You want to make sure that that guest that shows up at your door is the person that you've been communicating with. PENMAN: But, David King also pointed out there's a lot of opportunity for Airbnb to do good. They're bringing together people from all different backgrounds who wouldn't normally meet. KING: We've done some recent reports in Chicago and New York, pointing out that undeserved communities, especially African-American communities, have benefited quite a bit from our platform, usually in neighborhoods where there are few hotels. NESTERAK: One of those neighborhoods with few hotels is Washington, D. C. 's Anacostia. The neighborhood is on the edge of city limits on the other side of the Anacostia River from the capital and the Washington Monument. It's a neighborhood with a lot of big box stores and empty lots but also rowhouses and families that go back generations. We went there to visit Airbnb host Synta Keeling. SYNTA KEELING: Hi, how are you? NESTERAK: Hi, how are you? PENMAN: Synta owns a three-story townhouse in a new development. She rents out two rooms on Airbnb. There's a fitness room, cable and high-speed Internet, solar panels and slippers for all of her guests. PENMAN: I love the slippers, first of all. KEELING: (Laughter) Ikea. NESTERAK: Synta is a super host, and we're not just saying that because of the slippers. It's an official designation she's earned from Airbnb based on positive reviews from her guests, her responsiveness to booking requests and the fact that she's never canceled a booking. It shows Airbnb travelers she's been verified as a good person to stay with. Synta says as a black host in a black neighborhood, that's important. She feels like she gets held to a higher standard than other hosts. KEELING: This neighborhood's called Capital View, and it's 98 percent African-American, double-digit unemployment. PENMAN: We asked Synta whether her race and the racial composition of her neighborhood made it harder to get guests. And she said. . . KEELING: Absolutely (laughter). Yeah, no, I had one - I've had some instances where people will ask me all these questions about is it unsafe and this, and I'll say, you know, I'm a black Filipino woman. I take - we take great pride in our community. This is absolutely a good place for you to stay. And I'll say those things, and then there will be crickets. They'll just not book. PENMAN: But, Synta also said there were great things about Airbnb. For one thing, it brings her a steady second income. NESTERAK: Airbnb brings business to the stores and restaurants that don't typically benefit from the tourism industry. It might even help change people's perceptions of Anacostia. Airbnb's slogan is belong anywhere, and there's some truth to it. PENMAN: Synta Keeling told us a story about one of her guests that drove this message home. He came back from being out for the day and told her. . . KEELING: I took the bus back, and I was the only white person on the bus, and it was all these black people. And I asked myself, were they going to hurt me? Am I unsafe? And then I realized they weren't hurting me, and nothing was going to happen to me. Like, they were just sitting there normal. And he was saying this in a way that he was like he mentally realized the horridness of what he was saying, where at the same time, he was just being honest about what he was thinking and that he arrived at the stop and just had come off. And, like, nothing had happened to him, and it was just this shock. NESTERAK: Synta says she knows that some people won't rent from her because she's a black host in a predominantly black neighborhood. PENMAN: But here's the thing. She's glad those people don't book with her. KEELING: The strange thing about Airbnb that makes it tough is I really don't want a racist guest in my house because I don't - I live here in this space, so I don't need to feel uncomfortable, you know, the other way. But if you just feel like, well, you know, maybe I'll give this a shot, then I'm willing to be open-minded. PENMAN: The fact is Airbnb is not the same thing as a major hotel chain. Hosts have discretion on the platform, but guests don't have the same legal recourse as hotel customers if they feel they've been discriminated against. NESTERAK: We spoke to a couple lawyers for this story, and the legal picture is a little murky here. It isn't clear who, if anyone, is liable for discrimination on a web-based platform. PENMAN: So Airbnb does offer this opportunity to experience different cultures, to meet people you wouldn't normally meet. But sometimes hidden bias is getting in the way. NESTERAK: And people like Quirtina and Synta are paying the price. VEDANTAM: That's Maggie Penman and Max Nesterak, reporting on people who feel they have personally experienced bias in the sharing economy. When we come back, Maggie, Max and I will discuss potential solutions to the problem. VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. We're exploring the many ways in which the sharing economy might allow hidden biases to flourish. As apps in the sharing economy become an increasingly large part of our lives, they have the potential to create great disparities. Producers Maggie Penman and Max Nesterak are in the studio with me now to talk about potential solutions. Hi, Max. NESTERAK: Hi, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Hey, Maggie. PENMAN: Hey, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Maggie, if I understand correctly, Airbnb actually gives hosts a mechanism to avoid this problem. PENMAN: It's true. There is this feature called Instant Book, and it's exactly what it sounds like. Basically, as a guest, you can book a room just like you would a hotel without waiting to be accepted by the host. VEDANTAM: Why would hosts want to offer this option? PENMAN: Well, it's much more convenient for guests, so I think you're more likely to get bookings if you offer Instant Book. And then it's also easy for hosts because if you're renting out your whole house and you don't really care who stays there, you can just offer this option and not deal with it. VEDANTAM: And is there any evidence that this feature is actually being used to avoid discrimination on Airbnb? PENMAN: Yeah, Max and I actually talked to this guy, Reid Kennedy (ph). He's African-American, and his experience with Airbnb was very similar to Quirtina's. REID KENNEDY: And so after being rejected and I think in that case four times within the same day for reasons again that weren't specified, I started to see a pattern. PENMAN: So, Reid complained to Airbnb, and Airbnb gave him a credit. But he was struggling to use this credit because he was still having trouble booking a place. So he used Instant Book. KENNEDY: And ironically, the host was a black man, who may have been using the Instant Book feature for the same reason I was. VEDANTAM: So, Max, what I'm hearing Maggie say is that there might be a designed solution for the psychological problem of bias. NESTERAK: Yeah, and this is similar to a solution that Michael Luca came up with. He worked with a computer scientist, and they developed this Google Chrome app called Debias Yourself. It removes photos and names from people's profiles so you can't discriminate even by accident. PENMAN: And didn't Michael Luca say he actually got this idea from orchestras? NESTERAK: He did. So it used to be that back in the day, orchestras were overwhelmingly male, and people may have thought, oh, there's just more male musicians, or maybe they're just better. But then there started to be a shift in orchestras where there were more women. And researchers went back and looked at this, and they found that there had been a change to the audition process, where there was now a screen in between the judges and the person auditioning.

Thanks so much for being with us. STANLEY COREN: Glad to be here. SIMON: This is the worst news I've heard in a long time. COREN: Why (laughter)? SIMON: I like hugging dogs that I meet on the street. And the whole idea that this is distressing them - think about people who, you know, have loved their dogs for 10 years and assume the dog loves being hugged. COREN: Well, the issue is not that you shouldn't love your dog. It's just the way that you express your affection. Dogs are what we call a cursorial animal. That means to say they're adapted to run quickly. So if they run into trouble, I mean, their major way of handling it is to run away. And what we're doing when we're hugging is we are basically building a corral with our arms so that the dog can't run away. And back over there in his primitive brain, he's going, oh, my God, if something happens, you know, I can't get away. And if I. . . SIMON: I'm a prisoner of love. COREN: Yes, yes. And the signs that the dog is being stressed are very easy to read. I mean, the dog yawns. The dog avoids eye contact. The dog's ears slick back. The dog closes or partially closes his eye or shows something which we call a half moon eye where you can see part of the whites of the dogs eyes. You can pick up all those things from a photograph. So I simply thought to myself, well, if I had a stack of photographs of people hugging their dogs, I could see whether or not they're stressed. Well, it turns out, you know, all you have to do is to go onto Flickr or onto Google image search and put in something like hug dog or love dog or something like that. And you get this infinite scroll of photographs of people hugging their dogs. And what I did was I took the first 250 scorable instances. And by scorable, basically you had to see enough of the dog's face so you knew whether or not he was stressed. And what I found was absolutely astonishing. I mean, 82 percent of the pictures of people hugging the dogs had a dog who was showing at least one stress sign. Now, you know, people say what kind of upbringing did you have? You don't love dogs or maybe nobody hugged you enough when you were young or something like that. But that's not the point. SIMON: Oh, you anticipate my questions, Professor. COREN: (Laughter) The point is, you know, not that you shouldn't love your dog, but it's how you express that affection. And there's lots of ways to express affection for the dog without, you know, restraining it or hugging it in any way. SIMON: So if you love your dog, give him or her a treat and a belly pat. COREN: Yeah, exactly. And talk to them in that sort of baby talk is one way. SIMON: (Imitating baby talk). COREN: Yeah, exactly. You know. who's a clever dog? (Laughter) I mean, you've all heard it. I mean, it sounds so silly. And, you know, we know that everybody does that when they're at home. I mean, we'd never admit to it in public. But, you know, everybody does that to the dogs when they're at home. SIMON: Stanley Coren is a professor of psychology at University of British Columbia and author of Psychology Today's Canine Corner blog. Thanks so much for being with us. COREN: (Laughter) Woof. SIMON: (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MARTHA MY DEAR\")THE BEATLES: (Singing) Take a good look around you. Take a good look, you're bound to see that you and me, we're meant to be with each other, silly girl. SIMON: This is NPR News. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Many people who share their lives with dogs are certain that their dogs just love to be hugged, well, as much as we love hugging them. A new study says that dogs may be faking it. Loving embraces may actually distress dogs by raising their stress and anxiety levels.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. If you live or work in a city, sitting in traffic is probably a big part of your life. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: About 15, the Lincoln about 20 to 30 out. On the inbound side, we got about a 20-minute delay. VEDANTAM: You're in Washington, D. C. We take perverse pride in having some of the worst traffic in the United States. But on a global scale, D. C. has nothing on London or Istanbul, Rio or Mexico City. On today's episode, we're going to explore all kinds of interventions that can make traffic better. We're also going to look at the interventions that are supposed to make traffic better but don't. DANIEL PINK, BYLINE: I feel like we should put together the international journal of unintended consequences. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: . . . And send them to lawmakers all over the planet. VEDANTAM: Before we get there, we want to take you on a quick trip around some of the world's most congested cities. Producer Maggie Penman reached to NPR correspondents stationed in Asia, Africa and Europe. She's also going to tell us about a little traffic culture clash of her own. MAGGIE PENMAN, BYLINE: So a few years ago, I'm out in LA for a couple of days for work. I'm driving a rented car, and I come up to a busy intersection, and I'm trying to turn left. I have my blinker on, I'm in the left-hand turn lane, and the light is green. But there is still tons of cars coming through the intersection. So I patiently sit there waiting my turn, and the light turns yellow, and there's still cars coming through the intersection. And then the light turns red. I think, OK, I'll just wait until the light turns green again, big mistake. The cars behind me start honking like crazy. I can see the guy in my rearview mirror, and he's losing it, yelling, hitting his steering wheel in frustration. When the light does turn green again, I'm now determined to make this left turn. And the guy behind me turns, too, and then passes me immediately, yelling out his window and flipping me off. At the next intersection, the woman who was behind him pulls up next to me and signals for me to roll my window down. And she's this kind-looking lady, probably about my mother's age. And I thought she was going to commiserate with me about how crazy that guy was. But no, then she starts yelling at me, too. Why didn't you go? Were you texting? What's wrong with you? So I get to the NPR West office, and I'm very shaken up, and I describe this experience to a couple of my colleagues who live and work in LA, and they're both like, oh, yeah, you probably should have gone. AREZOU REZVANI, BYLINE: So we confirmed for you that you are indeed crazy. At least in LA you are. PENMAN: That's Arezou Rezvani, an editor at Morning Edition who works out of NPR's LA bureau. She was one of the people I was meeting that day, and I recently called her up to try and get some insight about why my style of driving was so frustrating to LA drivers. REZVANI: You have to kind of float in the middle of an intersection when you want to make a left or right turn. You got to wait for the cars on coming traffic to, you know, finish up, and sometimes that means making that turn on a red. PENMAN: So wait, I was supposed to run the red light. REZVANI: By the book, that's illegal, right? But there's just a new normal that is introduced in cities like Los Angeles, and you've just kind of got to go with the flow. PENMAN: I was really curious about this new normal that Arezou was talking about, and I wondered whether other cities had unspoken rules or conventions, too. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: When you come to a light and it turns green, the automatic thing to do if you want to take a left turn is to immediately rush and take a left across three or four lanes of traffic. PENMAN: The first person I thought to ask was Frank Langfitt, who, in addition to being NPR's correspondent based in Shanghai, has also occasionally driven a taxi around the city to find stories. LANGFITT: It's like being in a game where anything can come at you at any time from any angle. So a stop sign, a light is not entirely relevant but not very relevant. So when I go through intersections, I look right. I look left. I look right again. PENMAN: The norm in Shanghai is that traffic laws are more like suggestions. LANGFITT: Here in Shanghai, there is not a lot of enforcement. And I'm amazed when I get a ticket. I was pulled over a while ago for being in the wrong turn lane, which was just kind of comical considering all the things that the cops allow people to do here. PENMAN: But considering all of this, I was shocked when Frank told me about another norm. There's almost no road rage. LANGFITT: As long as the cars never touch, people just let it go. And I think it's - maybe it's partly a function. I don't understand all of this, even though I've been here a long time. It may be a function that this is such a crowded country, especially these big cities on the East Coast, that if you are going to get angry about this stuff, you'd just have a heart attack. PENMAN: In fact, he said. . . LANGFITT: I'm the only one who has road rage. (Unintelligible). I'm, like, the only guy in the city who has road rage. PENMAN: I also talked to NPR's correspondent in Nairobi, Greg Warner, and he told me Nairobi is one of the most polite cities he's ever lived in. GREGORY WARNER, BYLINE: For instance, nobody cuts in line. PENMAN: But when it comes to driving, Greg says, all that changes. One of the main features of driving in Nairobi, according to Greg, is that there are very few traffic lights. WARNER: There are occasionally, like, a random traffic light you'll see, but nobody actually pays attention to it. It has no actual meaning. It just turns green and red and for no particular reason. PENMAN: So how do people know when to go? WARNER: It's all convention. And so in this situation, what I would think people would do is a kind of honor system. Like, OK, yeah, you went. OK, now let me go. That lane hasn't gone for a while. Like, it's just a kind of understanding, but it's actually just a complete free for all. Everybody's trying to go at once. And every four-lane intersection is like a gridlock. And it's not just a gridlock where, you know, some cars will kind of inch forward, but it's like a twisted knot where I'm behind your bumper, and they're behind their bumper. And it's like this interlocked, you know, kind of origami or whatever. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)PENMAN: I also talked to Rich Preston, NPR's producer in London, and the primary feature of driving in the UK is, of course, that you drive on the left. RICH PRESTON, BYLINE: And as the London producer dealing with visiting American correspondents, I see this a lot is visitors to the United Kingdom stepping out into the road not looking down the road the right way. PENMAN: Rich travels around for work and is pretty accustomed to switching sides and driving on the right. But occasionally, that rule of thumb gets him into trouble. PRESTON: There's that mentality of, oh, I'm in another country. I'm going to have to drive on the right-hand side. I started driving on the right-hand side of the road in Ireland, even though I should have been sticking on the left. PENMAN: And even when he's back home in London, Rich says driving can be pretty scary. PRESTON: Because the thing about London is it's such an old city, it's really hard to make more space for all the people that are here. PENMAN: Rich mostly cycles around the city these days, but he can still be found honking at drivers. PRESTON: I actually bought a horn for my bike, which is this small thing that clips onto the handlebars. And it's an kind of electronic horn, and it's about 140 decibels, and it saved my life on so many occasions, I can guarantee it. PENMAN: I asked Rich to collect some sound of his commute home yesterday, so I'm going to leave you on this somewhat shrill note. (SOUNDBITE OF HORN)VEDANTAM: All right, I hope you made it home safely. That's HIDDEN BRAIN producer Maggie Penman. After a short break, Dan Pink is going to be back on the show to play a round of Stopwatch Science with me. We're going to tell you about interesting social science research on what works and doesn't work to fix traffic congestion. PINK: They found, even controlling for population growth, that constructing additional roads led to more traffic congestion, not less. VEDANTAM: Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Back now for a round of Stopwatch Science, I'm Shankar Vedantam. I'm joined as always by Daniel Pink, our senior Stopwatch Science correspondent. Welcome, Dan. PINK: Thank you, Shankar. VEDANTAM: On Stopwatch Science, Dan and I give one another 60 seconds to summarize interesting social science research. As we approach the 60-second mark, our producers will drown us out with music just like they do at the Oscars. Our topic today is traffic. You hate it. You deal with it. Maybe you are even in it. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . Right now. Today, we're going to explore what works and what doesn't work in easing congestion and improving traffic safety. Dan, if you're ready, your first 60 seconds starts now. PINK: Well, there's one easy, if expensive, solution, and that's just to build more roads, right? It makes sense. Well, maybe not. Two economists writing in the American Economic Review analyzed two decades worth of data on U. S. commuting times and road construction. They found even controlling for population growth that constructing additional roads led to more traffic congestion, not less. Now, what's going on here? Even though this paper is a complex bear of statistical analysis, the core explanation is simple, supply and demand. When we build roads, we increase the supply of driving opportunities. Increasing the supply of something generally reduces its price. But driving, it turns out, is extremely responsive to price changes. The lower price, that is more room on the roads, increases demand again. More individuals and commercial truckers now want to drive, and they re-congest the roads. Economists call it the fundamental law of highway congestion. More roads cause more traffic. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)PINK: Unfortunately, policymakers ignore the law, and the result is futility. VEDANTAM: So I'm guessing the solution to this is more public transit. PINK: You would think. But what the research also shows is that adding public transportation also increases congestion for the exact same reason. It lowers the price of driving, driving responds to price changes, more people then get on the roads. VEDANTAM: So more public transit doesn't help. More roads don't help. We just have to resign ourselves to traffic jams. PINK: Well, what we have to do is I think we have to start thinking like economists and realize how much driving depends on price. And so the best thing to do is something that is deeply, politically unpopular, which is to raise the price of driving perhaps through congestion charges or higher tolls. VEDANTAM: I think Dan Pink just declared for president. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . And I suspect he's not going to win. PINK: No, I don't think so, but maybe you can win, Shankar. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: . . . On your next 60 seconds, which begins right now. VEDANTAM: All right, when you enact laws or make policies that affect human beings, it's often easy to forget that you're dealing with a dynamic system, which is exactly what you were just talking about, Dan. PINK: Yes. VEDANTAM: People adapt to new rules often in ways that policymakers don't anticipate. In the late 1980s, Mexico City was dealing with a pollution problem. Lawmakers said, let's pass a new law. They banned drivers from the road one day each week. The day you were not allowed to drive was calculated based on the last digits of your car license plate number. Boom, one simple law, 20 percent fewer cars on the road each day, right? PINK: What could go wrong? VEDANTAM: Exactly. Lucas Davis at the University of Michigan finds that pollution did not decline as a result of the measure in Mexico City. Why? Drivers went out and bought more cars. PINK: Oh, boy. VEDANTAM: If I can't drive my Toyota on Mondays. . . PINK: Oh, yeah. VEDANTAM: . . . I'm going to drive my Chevy instead. Even worse, the law triggered an increase in older, more polluting cars perhaps because buying a new car is expensive, so drivers bought an old gas-guzzling clunker to drive the one day of the week they could not use their regular car. I feel that lawmakers around the world should be asked to sign the Hippocratic Oath, Dan. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: First, do no harm. PINK: Yes, exactly right. I feel like we should put together the international journal of unintended consequences. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: . . . And send them to lawmakers all over the planet. . . VEDANTAM: Indeed. PINK: . . . Because that's what this is. VEDANTAM: Indeed. Now hoping that the consequences of the next 60 seconds are predictable. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . Dan, your time starts now. PINK: We all know traffic exhaust and air pollution are harmful, but what about traffic noise? Is it a health hazard or just an annoyance? A team of British researchers looked at data on 8. 6 million people in neighborhoods across London. Then they analyzed their exposure to daytime and nighttime traffic noise and compared that to a range of health data. What they found, even after controlling for race, sex, air pollution levels, socioeconomic status and other factors, was sobering. Adults exposed to long-term daytime road traffic noise had lower life expectancies and were more likely to be admitted to the hospital for strokes than people living in quieter areas. This was especially true for elderly residents. Now the researchers found only a correlation, and the effect wasn't huge. But other evidence has shown that constantly being around loud traffic triggers stress hormones, which are linked to hypertension and occasionally death. Bottom line, that racket you here in certain areas of big cities - honking, idling, revving - maybe harming people who aren't even in the cars. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: So interesting, Dan. Is it possible that this is being driven just by the fact that you have more noise pollution in urban areas and there may be other factors in urban areas that increase the mortality rate? PINK: Well, possibly, but they actually did a good job of controlling for a lot of that. They divided up the city into census tracts and actually compared census tracts to each other. And the census tracts that had more noise had worse health outcomes, again, even after you control for the things we know drive health outcomes, especially socioeconomic status. So there was something about noise that seemed to be producing these ill effects. So let me turn it over to you for your 60 seconds, but I'd like you in light of the study to do it very quietly. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) All right, so we've heard that noise can be bad for you, but can making noise also save your life? James Habyarimana and William Jack at Georgetown University analyzed two interventions in Kenya to improve traffic safety. The government passed a set of laws to limit unsafe driving among many bus drivers. These are vans that hold a dozen passengers. They are private versions of public transit. The laws turned out to have very little effect on road safety. What worked was a second initiative where passengers on the minibuses were encouraged to, quote, \"heckle and chide. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . Drivers for unsafe driving. \"VEDANTAM: Stickers on the buses said, don't just sit there. Stand up. Speak up. PINK: Yeah. VEDANTAM: When consumers were encouraged to make some noise, driver behavior improved radically, and many bus crashes dropped by at least 50 percent. Now we don't know what exactly drove this. Maybe people spoke up. Maybe the driver was afraid people would speak up. Whatever it was, it worked. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)PINK: That is extraordinary. And I also think that we should rename this show Heckle and Chide. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: You can be Heckle. I can be Chide. But I - you know, I actually think a lot of this goes, you know, shows power to the people. VEDANTAM: Yeah, can I be Dr. Heckle and can you be Mr. Chide? PINK: Certainly. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: All right, so there you have it. Building new roads can lead to more congestion, and banning people from driving can increase pollution. Traffic noise is not just unpleasant. It can have health consequences. Finally, before you pass a new law to solve a problem, try to empower the people with the problem to fix it themselves. Dan, thanks for joining me on Stopwatch Science. PINK: My pleasure. I have to get back in my car now.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) PENMAN: I also talked to Rich Preston, NPR's producer in London, and the primary feature of driving in the UK is, of course, that you drive on the left. RICH PRESTON, BYLINE: And as the London producer dealing with visiting American correspondents, I see this a lot is visitors to the United Kingdom stepping out into the road not looking down the road the right way. PENMAN: Rich travels around for work and is pretty accustomed to switching sides and driving on the right. But occasionally, that rule of thumb gets him into trouble. PRESTON: There's that mentality of, oh, I'm in another country. I'm going to have to drive on the right-hand side. I started driving on the right-hand side of the road in Ireland, even though I should have been sticking on the left. PENMAN: And even when he's back home in London, Rich says driving can be pretty scary. PRESTON: Because the thing about London is it's such an old city, it's really hard to make more space for all the people that are here. PENMAN: Rich mostly cycles around the city these days, but he can still be found honking at drivers. PRESTON: I actually bought a horn for my bike, which is this small thing that clips onto the handlebars. And it's an kind of electronic horn, and it's about 140 decibels, and it saved my life on so many occasions, I can guarantee it. PENMAN: I asked Rich to collect some sound of his commute home yesterday, so I'm going to leave you on this somewhat shrill note. (SOUNDBITE OF HORN) VEDANTAM: All right, I hope you made it home safely. That's HIDDEN BRAIN producer Maggie Penman. After a short break, Dan Pink is going to be back on the show to play a round of Stopwatch Science with me. We're going to tell you about interesting social science research on what works and doesn't work to fix traffic congestion. PINK: They found, even controlling for population growth, that constructing additional roads led to more traffic congestion, not less. VEDANTAM: Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Back now for a round of Stopwatch Science, I'm Shankar Vedantam. I'm joined as always by Daniel Pink, our senior Stopwatch Science correspondent. Welcome, Dan. PINK: Thank you, Shankar. VEDANTAM: On Stopwatch Science, Dan and I give one another 60 seconds to summarize interesting social science research. As we approach the 60-second mark, our producers will drown us out with music just like they do at the Oscars. Our topic today is traffic. You hate it. You deal with it. Maybe you are even in it. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . Right now. Today, we're going to explore what works and what doesn't work in easing congestion and improving traffic safety. Dan, if you're ready, your first 60 seconds starts now. PINK: Well, there's one easy, if expensive, solution, and that's just to build more roads, right? It makes sense. Well, maybe not. Two economists writing in the American Economic Review analyzed two decades worth of data on U. S. commuting times and road construction. They found even controlling for population growth that constructing additional roads led to more traffic congestion, not less. Now, what's going on here? Even though this paper is a complex bear of statistical analysis, the core explanation is simple, supply and demand. When we build roads, we increase the supply of driving opportunities. Increasing the supply of something generally reduces its price. But driving, it turns out, is extremely responsive to price changes. The lower price, that is more room on the roads, increases demand again. More individuals and commercial truckers now want to drive, and they re-congest the roads. Economists call it the fundamental law of highway congestion. More roads cause more traffic. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) PINK: Unfortunately, policymakers ignore the law, and the result is futility. VEDANTAM: So I'm guessing the solution to this is more public transit. PINK: You would think. But what the research also shows is that adding public transportation also increases congestion for the exact same reason. It lowers the price of driving, driving responds to price changes, more people then get on the roads. VEDANTAM: So more public transit doesn't help. More roads don't help. We just have to resign ourselves to traffic jams. PINK: Well, what we have to do is I think we have to start thinking like economists and realize how much driving depends on price. And so the best thing to do is something that is deeply, politically unpopular, which is to raise the price of driving perhaps through congestion charges or higher tolls. VEDANTAM: I think Dan Pink just declared for president. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . And I suspect he's not going to win. PINK: No, I don't think so, but maybe you can win, Shankar. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: . . . On your next 60 seconds, which begins right now. VEDANTAM: All right, when you enact laws or make policies that affect human beings, it's often easy to forget that you're dealing with a dynamic system, which is exactly what you were just talking about, Dan. PINK: Yes. VEDANTAM: People adapt to new rules often in ways that policymakers don't anticipate. In the late 1980s, Mexico City was dealing with a pollution problem. Lawmakers said, let's pass a new law. They banned drivers from the road one day each week. The day you were not allowed to drive was calculated based on the last digits of your car license plate number. Boom, one simple law, 20 percent fewer cars on the road each day, right? PINK: What could go wrong? VEDANTAM: Exactly. Lucas Davis at the University of Michigan finds that pollution did not decline as a result of the measure in Mexico City. Why? Drivers went out and bought more cars. PINK: Oh, boy. VEDANTAM: If I can't drive my Toyota on Mondays. . . PINK: Oh, yeah. VEDANTAM: . . . I'm going to drive my Chevy instead. Even worse, the law triggered an increase in older, more polluting cars perhaps because buying a new car is expensive, so drivers bought an old gas-guzzling clunker to drive the one day of the week they could not use their regular car. I feel that lawmakers around the world should be asked to sign the Hippocratic Oath, Dan. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: First, do no harm. PINK: Yes, exactly right. I feel like we should put together the international journal of unintended consequences. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: . . . And send them to lawmakers all over the planet. . . VEDANTAM: Indeed. PINK: . . . Because that's what this is. VEDANTAM: Indeed. Now hoping that the consequences of the next 60 seconds are predictable. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . Dan, your time starts now. PINK: We all know traffic exhaust and air pollution are harmful, but what about traffic noise? Is it a health hazard or just an annoyance? A team of British researchers looked at data on 8. 6 million people in neighborhoods across London. Then they analyzed their exposure to daytime and nighttime traffic noise and compared that to a range of health data. What they found, even after controlling for race, sex, air pollution levels, socioeconomic status and other factors, was sobering. Adults exposed to long-term daytime road traffic noise had lower life expectancies and were more likely to be admitted to the hospital for strokes than people living in quieter areas. This was especially true for elderly residents. Now the researchers found only a correlation, and the effect wasn't huge. But other evidence has shown that constantly being around loud traffic triggers stress hormones, which are linked to hypertension and occasionally death. Bottom line, that racket you here in certain areas of big cities - honking, idling, revving - maybe harming people who aren't even in the cars. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: So interesting, Dan. Is it possible that this is being driven just by the fact that you have more noise pollution in urban areas and there may be other factors in urban areas that increase the mortality rate? PINK: Well, possibly, but they actually did a good job of controlling for a lot of that. They divided up the city into census tracts and actually compared census tracts to each other. And the census tracts that had more noise had worse health outcomes, again, even after you control for the things we know drive health outcomes, especially socioeconomic status. So there was something about noise that seemed to be producing these ill effects. So let me turn it over to you for your 60 seconds, but I'd like you in light of the study to do it very quietly. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) All right, so we've heard that noise can be bad for you, but can making noise also save your life? James Habyarimana and William Jack at Georgetown University analyzed two interventions in Kenya to improve traffic safety. The government passed a set of laws to limit unsafe driving among many bus drivers. These are vans that hold a dozen passengers. They are private versions of public transit. The laws turned out to have very little effect on road safety. What worked was a second initiative where passengers on the minibuses were encouraged to, quote, \"heckle and chide. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . Drivers for unsafe driving. \" VEDANTAM: Stickers on the buses said, don't just sit there. Stand up. Speak up. PINK: Yeah. VEDANTAM: When consumers were encouraged to make some noise, driver behavior improved radically, and many bus crashes dropped by at least 50 percent. Now we don't know what exactly drove this. Maybe people spoke up. Maybe the driver was afraid people would speak up. Whatever it was, it worked. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) PINK: That is extraordinary. And I also think that we should rename this show Heckle and Chide. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: You can be Heckle. I can be Chide. But I - you know, I actually think a lot of this goes, you know, shows power to the people. VEDANTAM: Yeah, can I be Dr. Heckle and can you be Mr. Chide? PINK: Certainly. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: All right, so there you have it. Building new roads can lead to more congestion, and banning people from driving can increase pollution. Traffic noise is not just unpleasant. It can have health consequences. Finally, before you pass a new law to solve a problem, try to empower the people with the problem to fix it themselves. Dan, thanks for joining me on Stopwatch Science. PINK: My pleasure. I have to get back in my car now.

At this point, virtually all the countries in the world have agreed to reduce carbon emissions to try to slow climate change. Now the challenge is to implement that deal. And when I asked the top U. S. envoy on climate change where the challenge is biggest, Todd Stern told me one country now has a steeper hill to climb than any other. TODD STERN: There's no country probably with a bigger challenge looking at the number of people, the level of their economic growth, the number of people who don't have access to electricity. SHAPIRO: Want to guess which country he's talking about? Here's a clue - sounds from a market in one of this country's biggest cities. (CROSSTALK)SHAPIRO: So which country is this? ANJALI JAISWAL: India has a lot of challenges and a lot of opportunities. SHAPIRO: That's Anjali Jaiswal from the Natural Resources Defense Council. JAISWAL: What's happening in India is really transformational. It's unprecedented. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: We would like to be the first to welcome you to New Delhi, India. SHAPIRO: To see this transformation up close, a producer, a photographer and I flew to the biggest democracy in the world. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: So we do ask that you please remain comfortably seated. SHAPIRO: We've brought back stories looking at some of the ways people are managing the tension between development and climate change. And today we want to answer a more basic question. Why India? When lots of developing countries are struggling with these challenges, what makes India unique, and what can it tell us about the challenges around climate change that the whole world faces? ANTHONY LEISEROWITZ: First and perhaps most importantly, India's now the third-largest emitter of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. SHAPIRO: This is Anthony Leiserowitz. He directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. He says even though India is only behind the U. S. and China in total carbon emissions, it's just getting started. Per Capita emissions are still really low. Most people are poor and just don't have a big carbon footprint. LEISEROWITZ: Seventy-six percent of Indians live on less than $2 a day. I mean, Americans can't imagine living on $2 a day, and yet, 76 percent of this population which is right around a billion people right now are living on that kind of income. SHAPIRO: In India, 400 million people don't have reliable electricity. That's more than the entire population of the United States. And India has ambitious goals to give its people think that Americans take for granted like refrigerators or cars or even something as basic as lighting at night. AJAY MATHUR: This means that we need to enhance the energy supply by four to five times what it is now. SHAPIRO: Do you mean provide four to five times as much energy as India is creating right now? MATHUR: Right now. SHAPIRO: Wow. MATHUR: Right. SHAPIRO: This is Ajay Mathur. He is one of India's climate experts who now runs the Energy and Resources Institute in New Delhi. He told me no matter how fast India increases its clean energy like solar and wind, the country will not cut back on coal - in fact, quite the opposite. MATHUR: It will increase. But whereas the amount of coal that we use will probably double between now and 2030, the amount of renewables will probably go up by an order of 10. SHAPIRO: So here's the answer to that question, why India? If India can find a sustainable way to develop, that could be a template for the rest of the world. Every highly developed country in history has gotten where it is in an unsustainable way - by cutting down trees, pumping carbon into the atmosphere. And if the developing world today does the same thing, this could lead to disaster, and the impacts of climate change would hit people in India harder than almost anywhere else. RICHARD HEWSTON: India has the highest number of people exposed to natural hazards. SHAPIRO: Richard Hewston is with a global risk assessment firm call Verisk Maplecroft. His company looked at which countries around the world are most vulnerable to storms, flooding and other acts of nature, and India was at the top of the list - No. 1 in the world. HEWSTON: Tropical cyclones are likely to become more intense. We're also seeing that climate change is going to have an impact on the monsoon. SHAPIRO: That means more floods for some people in India and more droughts for others. To of India's biggest cities, New Delhi and Calcutta, are on the top 10 list of global cities most vulnerable to natural hazards. We will visit both Delhi and Calcutta over the next two weeks. And here are some of the people we'll meet. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Foreign language spoken). SHAPIRO: On a small island, a man whose home has already been washed away by rising tides. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Through interpreter) This is my motherland, so I can't abandon it.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. There's so much in our popular culture about the power of positive thinking. We're often told to follow our hearts, to dream big. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: You can have, do or be anything you want. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Whatever belief you hold in your subconscious mind will become your reality, bottom line. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Value yourself, and believe in yourself. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path. VEDANTAM: But now researcher Gabriele Oettingen says maybe we should all dream a little smaller. GABRIELE OETTINGEN: Positive fantasies and daydreams, as pleasurable they are, they have a problem when it comes to fulfilling our wishes and attaining our goals. VEDANTAM: Gabriele is a professor at New York University and author of the book, \"Rethinking Positive Thinking: Inside The New Science Of Motivation. \" She's from Germany, and she said growing up, no one told her to shoot for the stars. OETTINGEN: I was, yeah, raised in Europe, and the idea of big dreams, big hopes was, if at all, more implicit than explicit. VEDANTAM: When she came to the United States, though, Gabriele noticed a real cultural difference. OETTINGEN: Well, when I came to America, it was wonderful because people always said, yes, do it. Yes, that's possible. Yeah, OK, this is a good idea. Why don't you do it? Whereas back in Europe, people were more cautious and said, you know, are you sure you want to do this? Are you sure this is possible? So I was really happy to come to America. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). OETTINGEN: . . . Because people were just sort of encouraging whatever idea you had. VEDANTAM: So yes, positive thinking, indulging in fantasies about the future, it does feel good. But when Gabriele Oettingen began to research this topic, she found something interesting. OETTINGEN: Well, these positive fantasies, they seduce us to feel already accomplished, and they take our energy away. So we found that, for example, the more positively women enrolled in a weight reduction program, the fewer pounds they lost three months later, one year later, two years later. Or the more positively university graduates fantasized about an easy transition into work-life, the fewer dollars they earned two years later, the fewer job offers they had gotten and also the fewer job applications they had sent out. Or take students. The more positively they fantasized about getting a good grade in their exam, the less well they did. Or the more positively they fantasized about getting together with a crushee, the less likely they were to actually get in a romantic relationship. Or take the health domain. Same thing, the more positively hip replacement surgery patients fantasized about an easy recovery, the less well could they move their joint, the fewer steps they could take and the less well they recovered from the surgery. VEDANTAM: So when you look at each of these cases, I'm wondering if you could tell me what you mean by a positive fantasy. So let's take the student, for example, who is hoping to go out on a date with someone that he or she likes. You're sort of imagining, for example, going out on a date, things going really well, this other person really liking you as much as you like them. OETTINGEN: Yeah, that's a good question, actually. It's not so easy to measure these fantasies. So what we did is we gave participants a short story, so for example, in the case of the people who had a crush on someone else, a short story describing how they meet this person. And they then needed to end that story, and that story could either end positively, or they could end not so positively. So then participants fantasized and wrote down their fantasies about the ending of the story. And the more positively these people had been fantasizing about getting together with their crushee, the less likely it was that they actually got together with the person they were in love. So the idea, really, is the more idealized, the more positively people fantasize, the less well they do because they don't put in the effort needed to actually reach their goals and fulfill the wishes. VEDANTAM: Now is it the case that people recovering from, example, hip replacement surgery, when they have positive fantasies of walking, at one level, you would have to say this is deeply, deeply understandable. You know, you feel like you can't do the things that you're used to doing, you want to get back on your feet, and you want to dream of the day when you would be able to walk or climb stairs or run without pain. Are you saying that that's a bad thing? OETTINGEN: No, I'm not saying it's a bad thing. Actually, we have very nice data showing that these positive fantasies, they actually come out of a person's needs. And you are completely right. A person who has a surgery and who used to be able to walk feels a need to walk like before. And they are the positive fantasies come from. And I don't say these are bad things at all because they are the beginning of action. But they are only the beginning. They give action the direction, but they don't give action the necessary energy. In fact, when we induce participants to positively fantasize, to ideally depict the positive future, then we find that the blood pressure goes down, and then we find that the feelings of energization go down, and we find that people feel already accomplished. So they relax. They relax because mentally, they're already there. VEDANTAM: There's something terribly sad about this, which is that the person imagines the happy future, perhaps because they're not very happy at the present. But by so doing, they, in some ways, deprive themselves of the energy and motivation they need to make their futures actually better and thereby make their futures worse. It feels like a vicious cycle. OETTINGEN: Well, it is not so sad if you consider that if you actually complement these positive fantasies with considerations of what stands in the way, what is it in you that stands in the way that you actually fulfill your wishes and attain your goals, that then you actually get the energy. And if these goals are attainable, then you really go for it. VEDANTAM: When we come back, we'll talk about the next steps to make that daydream a reality. OETTINGEN: You think about the next four weeks. Now in the next four weeks, what is your most important wish? VEDANTAM: Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Gabriele Oettingen has found that positive thinking, while fun, may not really be the answer to achieving your goals. But she does see that noticing your dreams and thinking about what you really want can be the first step to making them a reality. You've done a lot of work looking not just at the potential downside of these positive fantasies but also how we can use these positive fantasies in a very productive way, and you call it mental contrasting. What is mental contrasting? OETTINGEN: Mental contrasting is a strategy to fulfill your wishes and attain your goals. So you first identify a wish, a wish that is very dear to you. So for example, you think about the next four weeks. Now in the next four weeks, what is your most important wish? Can be a professional wish, can be an interpersonal wish, can be health wish. This wish should be a wish that is little challenging for you but that you actually can fulfill yourself. Now identify that wish, and keep it in front of your mind. What you do then is you think about, what would be the best thing, the best outcome if I fulfill myself that wish? And once you identify that and put it in front of your mind, then you imagine that best thing. And you recognize now imagining that best thing is like positively fantasizing. These are the positive daydreams we were just talking about. But then instead of carrying on with these positive fantasies, you now switch gears, and you say to yourself, actually, what stops me from fulfilling my wish and experiencing that outcome? What is it in me that stands in the way? What is my inner obstacle? What is it in me? And then once you identify it, your inner obstacle - and you need a little bit of humor and a little bit of honesty to yourself. Sometimes it's not so pleasant. You don't need to tell anybody. But you can identify that obstacle, and then you say to yourself, if that obstacle occurs, then I will show a behavior or think a thought to overcome that obstacle. So if obstacle, then I will behavior to overcome obstacle. And that's what in the science language is called mental contrasting with implementation intentions. And to forget this complicated name, it's called in the science literature also MCII. But we renamed it now, and it's called now WOOP for wish - first, we started with a wish - outcome - we then went on to identify that outcome and imagine that outcome - obstacle - remember the obstacle. Identify the obstacle. Imagine the obstacle. And then the plan, the if obstacle, then I will overcome plan. And that's called WOOP. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: I asked Gabriele how she would apply her strategy to someone who has a crush on another person but instead of doing something about it is just sitting around daydreaming about a blissful honeymoon. What would that person do if they wanted to use mental contrasting or WOOP? OETTINGEN: So let's say you have a young person, a student who is interested in another person. And so the wish would be, now I want to go with him or with her on a date and want to explore a little bit deeper what that person is all about. So that would be the wish. The best outcome might be something like, you know, we would have a really good time, and we would feel kind of in harmony. But then the person would change gears and say, what is it in me that stands in the way that I actually fulfill my wish, that I ask this person out for a date and experience the harmony? So what is it in me that stands in the way? And then the person might discover, I might feel too shy, or I'm a little bit anxious, reluctant to get a rejection. And then the person can elaborate on that shyness to be rejected or that fear of rejection, can really elaborate on it, kind of understand, oh, yeah, this fear, that's my obstacle. And after that, the person could think, what can I do to overcome this fear of rejection? So what can the person do? The person can sort of understand, well, if the person rejected me, then I'm there where I'm right now because if I don't talk to that person, I don't - I will not meet the person anyway. So I can't really lose anything. And then he or she could do the if-then plan. If I feel that fear of rejection, then I will tell myself, just go to that person and approach him or her because I can't lose anything. And then the person will nonconsciously, outside of awareness, approach that person by sort of overcoming one's fears of rejection. VEDANTAM: One of the things that I find so striking is that third step doesn't involve saying, what are the obstacles in my path? But you ask, what are the obstacles in me that prevent me from achieving this goal? OETTINGEN: That's correct because the obstacles in me doesn't allow me to come up with all these excuses. So if I say, what are the obstacles in my path, I could say, well, this person is in a different building or whatever or studies a different topic, or I don't have the time, or I'm just busy right now or I'm - all these excuses, they fall away if you ask, what is it in you that stands in the way? What is it really that stands in the way? So you need to be a little bit kind of generous with yourself and say, OK, what is it? What is it in me? And once you find that, then you will also find the solution by imagining that obstacle in you. Then you will also find the solution. And very often, there is a big aha moment afterwards. You say, oh, that's what I could do to actually overcome that obstacle and to fulfill my wish. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Gabriele believes the reason WOOP works is that consciously imagining goals and obstacles and making deliberate plans to overcome those obstacles creates unconscious habits. After a while, you don't have to consciously think of all the steps in WOOP. Merely thinking about the first step triggers all the others. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)OETTINGEN: This conscious strategy leads to these nonconscious processes. So for example, in mental contrasting, the future and the reality, the future and the obstacles are strongly linked after the imagery so that you can't really think about the future anymore without that the reality that the obstacle kind of shoots in. And also the obstacle is linked to the instrumental means to overcome the obstacle. So as soon as you think about obstacle, then the behavior to overcome obstacle shoots in. And, which is really important, the meaning of the reality is now changed. After mental contrasting, a party is not a fun event anymore when you actually strive to do well on an exam on Tuesday and the party on Saturday is not a fun event anymore. It's now the obstacle to being successful in that exam. And it's now (unintelligible) more negatively, and it's perceived as an obstacle. It's not a fun event anymore where you can think about what to dress and what to drink. It is now an obstacle. And at the same time, also your energy goes up, the energy to overcome the obstacle. So you can measure that by blood pressure. You can measure that by feelings of energization. And you are well-equipped to react to feedback. If you get negative feedback, now you extract the information out of that negative feedback without getting hurt. So you don't take it personally, but you take the information encompassed in this negative feedback and you use it to make the correct plans. So in that way, WOOP helps you by these nonconscious processes to change your behavior. And the interesting thing is these nonconscious processes which run off, without that people are aware, they then actually mediate or predict the behavior changes. VEDANTAM: Has mental contrasting changed anything that you do? OETTINGEN: Well, I am using WOOP on a daily basis, and we have devised - next to the book, we have devised an app, which gives you the instructions of mental contrasting with implementation intentions of WOOP. So it leads you through the four steps - wish, outcome, obstacle, plan. And interestingly enough, I thought, I'm going to experiment on WOOP. But I'm using the app every day, actually. I'm using the app because it forces me to specify my wish, to specify my outcome, to imagine the outcome, to specify my inner obstacle, to imagine the inner obstacle and to form a very specific if obstacle, then I will behavior to overcome obstacle plan. So I do it every morning. Other people do it in the evening or, you know, during lunch break or when they wait for the bus or in the subway. What you need, though, for doing WOOP, you need to have a quiet moment for yourself. You can be in subway when everybody's talking, but you need to be uninterrupted. You can't do your email. You can't talk to someone while you're doing WOOP. So you need to have a moment for yourself where you think, what is my wish? What is my wish for today? Or you might think, what is my wish for the next four weeks? Or what do I want in life? What is it really that I want? So you can WOOP very big wishes, or you can WOOP trivial wishes. But what is important, it needs to be a wish which is dear to your heart. And the nice thing with WOOP is that it also allows you to finally think about, what do I really want? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Gabriele Oettingen is a professor of psychology at New York University. The HIDDEN BRAIN podcast is produced by Kara McGuirk-Alison, Maggie Penman and Max Nesterak. Find us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and leave us a review on iTunes. I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is NPR. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. There's so much in our popular culture about the power of positive thinking. We're often told to follow our hearts, to dream big. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: You can have, do or be anything you want. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Whatever belief you hold in your subconscious mind will become your reality, bottom line. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Value yourself, and believe in yourself. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path. VEDANTAM: But now researcher Gabriele Oettingen says maybe we should all dream a little smaller. GABRIELE OETTINGEN: Positive fantasies and daydreams, as pleasurable they are, they have a problem when it comes to fulfilling our wishes and attaining our goals. VEDANTAM: Gabriele is a professor at New York University and author of the book, \"Rethinking Positive Thinking: Inside The New Science Of Motivation. \" She's from Germany, and she said growing up, no one told her to shoot for the stars. OETTINGEN: I was, yeah, raised in Europe, and the idea of big dreams, big hopes was, if at all, more implicit than explicit. VEDANTAM: When she came to the United States, though, Gabriele noticed a real cultural difference. OETTINGEN: Well, when I came to America, it was wonderful because people always said, yes, do it. Yes, that's possible. Yeah, OK, this is a good idea. Why don't you do it? Whereas back in Europe, people were more cautious and said, you know, are you sure you want to do this? Are you sure this is possible? So I was really happy to come to America. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). OETTINGEN: . . . Because people were just sort of encouraging whatever idea you had. VEDANTAM: So yes, positive thinking, indulging in fantasies about the future, it does feel good. But when Gabriele Oettingen began to research this topic, she found something interesting. OETTINGEN: Well, these positive fantasies, they seduce us to feel already accomplished, and they take our energy away. So we found that, for example, the more positively women enrolled in a weight reduction program, the fewer pounds they lost three months later, one year later, two years later. Or the more positively university graduates fantasized about an easy transition into work-life, the fewer dollars they earned two years later, the fewer job offers they had gotten and also the fewer job applications they had sent out. Or take students. The more positively they fantasized about getting a good grade in their exam, the less well they did. Or the more positively they fantasized about getting together with a crushee, the less likely they were to actually get in a romantic relationship. Or take the health domain. Same thing, the more positively hip replacement surgery patients fantasized about an easy recovery, the less well could they move their joint, the fewer steps they could take and the less well they recovered from the surgery. VEDANTAM: So when you look at each of these cases, I'm wondering if you could tell me what you mean by a positive fantasy. So let's take the student, for example, who is hoping to go out on a date with someone that he or she likes. You're sort of imagining, for example, going out on a date, things going really well, this other person really liking you as much as you like them. OETTINGEN: Yeah, that's a good question, actually. It's not so easy to measure these fantasies. So what we did is we gave participants a short story, so for example, in the case of the people who had a crush on someone else, a short story describing how they meet this person. And they then needed to end that story, and that story could either end positively, or they could end not so positively. So then participants fantasized and wrote down their fantasies about the ending of the story. And the more positively these people had been fantasizing about getting together with their crushee, the less likely it was that they actually got together with the person they were in love. So the idea, really, is the more idealized, the more positively people fantasize, the less well they do because they don't put in the effort needed to actually reach their goals and fulfill the wishes. VEDANTAM: Now is it the case that people recovering from, example, hip replacement surgery, when they have positive fantasies of walking, at one level, you would have to say this is deeply, deeply understandable. You know, you feel like you can't do the things that you're used to doing, you want to get back on your feet, and you want to dream of the day when you would be able to walk or climb stairs or run without pain. Are you saying that that's a bad thing? OETTINGEN: No, I'm not saying it's a bad thing. Actually, we have very nice data showing that these positive fantasies, they actually come out of a person's needs. And you are completely right. A person who has a surgery and who used to be able to walk feels a need to walk like before. And they are the positive fantasies come from. And I don't say these are bad things at all because they are the beginning of action. But they are only the beginning. They give action the direction, but they don't give action the necessary energy. In fact, when we induce participants to positively fantasize, to ideally depict the positive future, then we find that the blood pressure goes down, and then we find that the feelings of energization go down, and we find that people feel already accomplished. So they relax. They relax because mentally, they're already there. VEDANTAM: There's something terribly sad about this, which is that the person imagines the happy future, perhaps because they're not very happy at the present. But by so doing, they, in some ways, deprive themselves of the energy and motivation they need to make their futures actually better and thereby make their futures worse. It feels like a vicious cycle. OETTINGEN: Well, it is not so sad if you consider that if you actually complement these positive fantasies with considerations of what stands in the way, what is it in you that stands in the way that you actually fulfill your wishes and attain your goals, that then you actually get the energy. And if these goals are attainable, then you really go for it. VEDANTAM: When we come back, we'll talk about the next steps to make that daydream a reality. OETTINGEN: You think about the next four weeks. Now in the next four weeks, what is your most important wish? VEDANTAM: Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Gabriele Oettingen has found that positive thinking, while fun, may not really be the answer to achieving your goals. But she does see that noticing your dreams and thinking about what you really want can be the first step to making them a reality. You've done a lot of work looking not just at the potential downside of these positive fantasies but also how we can use these positive fantasies in a very productive way, and you call it mental contrasting. What is mental contrasting? OETTINGEN: Mental contrasting is a strategy to fulfill your wishes and attain your goals. So you first identify a wish, a wish that is very dear to you. So for example, you think about the next four weeks. Now in the next four weeks, what is your most important wish? Can be a professional wish, can be an interpersonal wish, can be health wish. This wish should be a wish that is little challenging for you but that you actually can fulfill yourself. Now identify that wish, and keep it in front of your mind. What you do then is you think about, what would be the best thing, the best outcome if I fulfill myself that wish? And once you identify that and put it in front of your mind, then you imagine that best thing. And you recognize now imagining that best thing is like positively fantasizing. These are the positive daydreams we were just talking about. But then instead of carrying on with these positive fantasies, you now switch gears, and you say to yourself, actually, what stops me from fulfilling my wish and experiencing that outcome? What is it in me that stands in the way? What is my inner obstacle? What is it in me? And then once you identify it, your inner obstacle - and you need a little bit of humor and a little bit of honesty to yourself. Sometimes it's not so pleasant. You don't need to tell anybody. But you can identify that obstacle, and then you say to yourself, if that obstacle occurs, then I will show a behavior or think a thought to overcome that obstacle. So if obstacle, then I will behavior to overcome obstacle. And that's what in the science language is called mental contrasting with implementation intentions. And to forget this complicated name, it's called in the science literature also MCII. But we renamed it now, and it's called now WOOP for wish - first, we started with a wish - outcome - we then went on to identify that outcome and imagine that outcome - obstacle - remember the obstacle. Identify the obstacle. Imagine the obstacle. And then the plan, the if obstacle, then I will overcome plan. And that's called WOOP. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: I asked Gabriele how she would apply her strategy to someone who has a crush on another person but instead of doing something about it is just sitting around daydreaming about a blissful honeymoon. What would that person do if they wanted to use mental contrasting or WOOP? OETTINGEN: So let's say you have a young person, a student who is interested in another person.

As the Park Service celebrates its centennial, we're looking at some of the jobs that are done behind the scenes at national parks. NPR's Nathan Rott tagged along with a wildlife biologist to see how challenging the day-to-day can be. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: Traffic jams - we all know them more than we'd like. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park though, on the border of North Carolina and Tennessee, it's a different kind of jam. Bear jam. RYAN WILLIAMSON: We can't be hanging out too long. ROTT: Yes, bear jam. That's the official title for it here, as in. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Dude, there's a bear by the road. Everyone stop and take a picture. ROTT: Because let's face it, it's a bear by road. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORN)ROTT: Or in this case, three black bears, a mom and two cubs. WILLIAMSON: They're little, tiny guys. Yeah, no bigger than a football. ROTT: That voice belongs to Ryan Williamson, a wildlife biologist by the park, a job that requires watching people as much as it does watching bears because he's responsible for the safety of both. WILLIAMSON: This is safe viewing distance, in my opinion. I say safe viewing distance as far as you can throw a rock because, you know, we say 50 yards but John Q. Public has no idea how far 50 yards is. ROTT: Even when John Q. Public does, a lot of times he just can't help but get a little closer. >>WILLIAMSON: Want to get the selfie. ROTT: Really? WILLIAMSON: Yeah. ROTT: It happens all of the time. Google it - bear selfie - you'll see. The reason you don't hear about it is because most of the time, John Q. Public doesn't get mauled - most of the time. Stuff does happen. Just this week, a man was bit in the leg by a bear at Great Smoky while he was sleeping. Now, it's hard to know why that happened. But you can look at bear behavior for an idea. To explain, let's leave this roadside for a minute to get a little bear behavior 101 with our host. . . BILL STIVER: I'm Bill Stiver. I'm a wildlife biologist at Great Smoky Mountains National Park. ROTT: OK, so Stiver says when it comes to behaviors, there are three broad types of bears. the first is the best, the most natural, what you'd call a wild bear. STIVER: And what I mean by wild is one that sees or smells people and runs. ROTT: The next is a habituated bear, one that doesn't run because it's gotten so used to seeing and smelling people that it just can't be bothered. From there it's not a far step to the third and worst - a food-conditioned bear. STIVER: And we define a food-conditioned animal as one that's actually coming to us trying to get our food or garbage. ROTT: It identifies human or places we frequent - like trails, campsites, dumpsters or towns - as sources of food. And it seeks them out, crossing busy roads, going through yards, whatever it takes - not good for bear, not good for human and definitely not good for the people tasked with protecting both. STIVER: Once that behavior gets ingrained, it's really, really hard to change that behavior. ROTT: They can move the bear. But if there's no way to move it or it comes back, there's really only one other option. Stiver says they usually have to do it one or two times a year. STIVER: I don't take any pleasure in euthanizing a bear. I feel like we fail if we either have to move a bear or we have to euthanize it. Somewhere in that process we've failed. And I don't mean we as just me. I mean, we as people. . . ROTT: . . . As a species. . . STIVER: Right 'cause we're getting too close to it. You know, we're stripping it of that natural wild behavior. ROTT: Which brings us back to our bear jam on the side of the road with wildlife biologist Ryan Williamson and a line of excited picture-taking tourists. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: There's two of them right there. ROTT: Remember there are three bears here - a sow and two cubs, all of which are presumably wild. WILLIAMSON: This is how habituation happens. ROTT: This is how it happens. WILLIAMSON: Like I say, she's just tolerant of us right now. ROTT: And her cubs. . . Are they picking this up, too? Like. . . WILLIAMSON: Oh yeah, they're learning right now. ROTT: Which means these cubs, no more than a year old, are already on that slippery slope to becoming problem bears. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR STARTING)ROTT: OK, so to quickly recap - bear sees people, bear gets used to people, bear becomes problem. In Great Smoky Mountains National Park every year, you have 1,600 black bears and more than 10 million people. In a perfect world, they would both exist in the same space without influencing the other. WILLIAMSON: But the problem is is that neither one can behave themselves. ROTT: People just can't help getting too close or dropping food. Bears just can't help but eat it up. So how can you stop that from happening? Well, you can educate people and you can educate bears. We're here to see the second. WILLIAMSON: Where's our bears at? ROTT: The place that we're at is called the Appalachian Bear Rescue, a rehabilitation center outside of the park. They take starving bear cubs, nurse them back to health and get them into the wild as fast as possible. Williamson comes in at that last part - the release. That's why we're here to pick up two female yearlings. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Come to you. . . ROTT: And this is where the education part comes in. Both of these bears were found in towns, so it's fair to say that they're somewhat used to people. Hard to tell because they're both drugged asleep. (SOUNDBITE OF BEAR SNORING)ROTT: Yes, that is the sound of a little 1-year-old black bear snoring. One more time, please. (SOUNDBITE OF BEAR SNORING)ROTT: Williamson and a team of vets prep every black bear before it leaves. They take blood samples and skin samples. They put in ear tags and a GPS collar. They even tattoo the inside of the bear's lip with what can best be described as an elaborate hole puncher. WILLIAMSON: Squeeze tight, too. You're not going to hurt her. ROTT: All of these things are done as humanely as possible and for good reasons. But there's no way around it - if you're the bear, this process is a huge bummer. It's like getting a crown, a vaccination and a physical from an alien dentist. And it can be a bummer for the humans, too. WILLIAMSON: Nobody ever really wants to give a cold-water enema, you know? Even a father doesn't really - it's not something - you lose a little bit of your dignity (laughter). ROTT: Jokes aside, Williamson says he wants this to be a bad experience for the bear - not a cruel experience but one that they'll remember negatively. He explains it back in the truck with both bears in the back. WILLIAMSON: Some people think that all I do is punish bears that have bad behavior. Well, yes, but I'm trying to fix that bad behavior. So in my eyes, I'm saving bears, not punishing bears. ROTT: We stop a few miles down a dirt road. Williamson has me put my microphone on the tailgate where the bears will exit and tells me to stand in clear view of the cage. WILLIAMSON: I want humans to be present so when the bear turns around and looks and sees what just happened, I want them to see us and be like I don't want to ever experience that again. ROTT: Williamson's intern, Brandon Garcia, climbs on top of the cage and lifts the gate. It happens quick. The bear cub leaps off the back and runs into the brush. So that's that. WILLIAMSON: Yep, it's pretty fast. ROTT: Hopefully you'll never have to see those bears again. WILLIAMSON: Exactly. ROTT: We get back into the truck and start driving back to headquarters. And not more than 15 minutes into the drive, the radio squawks. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: We're taking a report of a car feeding a bear just before the (unintelligible). ROTT: Oh, a bear hitting a what? WILLIAMSON: Feeding a bear. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: You're a little hard to read. . . ROTT: The radio traffic continues and Williamson sighs. He can educate all of the bears he wants here, but he can't educate all of the people. Nathan Rott, NPR News, Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

WILLIAMSON: This is safe viewing distance, in my opinion. I say safe viewing distance as far as you can throw a rock because, you know, we say 50 yards but John Q. Public has no idea how far 50 yards is. ROTT: Even when John Q. Public does, a lot of times he just can't help but get a little closer. >>WILLIAMSON: Want to get the selfie. ROTT: Really? WILLIAMSON: Yeah. ROTT: It happens all of the time. Google it - bear selfie - you'll see. The reason you don't hear about it is because most of the time, John Q. Public doesn't get mauled - most of the time. Stuff does happen. Just this week, a man was bit in the leg by a bear at Great Smoky while he was sleeping. Now, it's hard to know why that happened. But you can look at bear behavior for an idea. To explain, let's leave this roadside for a minute to get a little bear behavior 101 with our host. . . BILL STIVER: I'm Bill Stiver. I'm a wildlife biologist at Great Smoky Mountains National Park. ROTT: OK, so Stiver says when it comes to behaviors, there are three broad types of bears. the first is the best, the most natural, what you'd call a wild bear. STIVER: And what I mean by wild is one that sees or smells people and runs. ROTT: The next is a habituated bear, one that doesn't run because it's gotten so used to seeing and smelling people that it just can't be bothered. From there it's not a far step to the third and worst - a food-conditioned bear. STIVER: And we define a food-conditioned animal as one that's actually coming to us trying to get our food or garbage. ROTT: It identifies human or places we frequent - like trails, campsites, dumpsters or towns - as sources of food. And it seeks them out, crossing busy roads, going through yards, whatever it takes - not good for bear, not good for human and definitely not good for the people tasked with protecting both. STIVER: Once that behavior gets ingrained, it's really, really hard to change that behavior. ROTT: They can move the bear. But if there's no way to move it or it comes back, there's really only one other option. Stiver says they usually have to do it one or two times a year. STIVER: I don't take any pleasure in euthanizing a bear. I feel like we fail if we either have to move a bear or we have to euthanize it. Somewhere in that process we've failed. And I don't mean we as just me. I mean, we as people. . . ROTT: . . . As a species. . . STIVER: Right 'cause we're getting too close to it. You know, we're stripping it of that natural wild behavior. ROTT: Which brings us back to our bear jam on the side of the road with wildlife biologist Ryan Williamson and a line of excited picture-taking tourists. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: There's two of them right there. ROTT: Remember there are three bears here - a sow and two cubs, all of which are presumably wild. WILLIAMSON: This is how habituation happens. ROTT: This is how it happens. WILLIAMSON: Like I say, she's just tolerant of us right now. ROTT: And her cubs. . . Are they picking this up, too? Like. . . WILLIAMSON: Oh yeah, they're learning right now. ROTT: Which means these cubs, no more than a year old, are already on that slippery slope to becoming problem bears. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR STARTING) ROTT: OK, so to quickly recap - bear sees people, bear gets used to people, bear becomes problem. In Great Smoky Mountains National Park every year, you have 1,600 black bears and more than 10 million people. In a perfect world, they would both exist in the same space without influencing the other. WILLIAMSON: But the problem is is that neither one can behave themselves. ROTT: People just can't help getting too close or dropping food. Bears just can't help but eat it up. So how can you stop that from happening? Well, you can educate people and you can educate bears. We're here to see the second. WILLIAMSON: Where's our bears at? ROTT: The place that we're at is called the Appalachian Bear Rescue, a rehabilitation center outside of the park. They take starving bear cubs, nurse them back to health and get them into the wild as fast as possible. Williamson comes in at that last part - the release. That's why we're here to pick up two female yearlings. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Come to you. . . ROTT: And this is where the education part comes in. Both of these bears were found in towns, so it's fair to say that they're somewhat used to people. Hard to tell because they're both drugged asleep. (SOUNDBITE OF BEAR SNORING) ROTT: Yes, that is the sound of a little 1-year-old black bear snoring. One more time, please. (SOUNDBITE OF BEAR SNORING) ROTT: Williamson and a team of vets prep every black bear before it leaves. They take blood samples and skin samples. They put in ear tags and a GPS collar. They even tattoo the inside of the bear's lip with what can best be described as an elaborate hole puncher. WILLIAMSON: Squeeze tight, too. You're not going to hurt her. ROTT: All of these things are done as humanely as possible and for good reasons. But there's no way around it - if you're the bear, this process is a huge bummer. It's like getting a crown, a vaccination and a physical from an alien dentist. And it can be a bummer for the humans, too. WILLIAMSON: Nobody ever really wants to give a cold-water enema, you know? Even a father doesn't really - it's not something - you lose a little bit of your dignity (laughter). ROTT: Jokes aside, Williamson says he wants this to be a bad experience for the bear - not a cruel experience but one that they'll remember negatively. He explains it back in the truck with both bears in the back. WILLIAMSON: Some people think that all I do is punish bears that have bad behavior. Well, yes, but I'm trying to fix that bad behavior. So in my eyes, I'm saving bears, not punishing bears. ROTT: We stop a few miles down a dirt road. Williamson has me put my microphone on the tailgate where the bears will exit and tells me to stand in clear view of the cage. WILLIAMSON: I want humans to be present so when the bear turns around and looks and sees what just happened, I want them to see us and be like I don't want to ever experience that again. ROTT: Williamson's intern, Brandon Garcia, climbs on top of the cage and lifts the gate. It happens quick. The bear cub leaps off the back and runs into the brush. So that's that. WILLIAMSON: Yep, it's pretty fast. ROTT: Hopefully you'll never have to see those bears again. WILLIAMSON: Exactly. ROTT: We get back into the truck and start driving back to headquarters. And not more than 15 minutes into the drive, the radio squawks. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: We're taking a report of a car feeding a bear just before the (unintelligible). ROTT: Oh, a bear hitting a what? WILLIAMSON: Feeding a bear. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: You're a little hard to read. . . ROTT: The radio traffic continues and Williamson sighs. He can educate all of the bears he wants here, but he can't educate all of the people.

On farms in the western state of this Maharashtra face life with no water and usually no deed to their husband's land in this deeply patriarchal culture. Tulkaram Jadhav was barely surviving off his tiny cotton farm when he killed himself last September. His widow, a petite mother of two, says she discovered her husband as he lay dying. BHAGYASHRI JADHAV: (Speaking Marathi). MCCARTHY: \"I was the one who found him. I was sleeping and woke up to the powerful smell of pesticides that we use to farm,\" Bhagyashri says. \"I asked my husband if he smelled it. Then I realized he couldn't speak. He'd swallowed the pesticide. \"DNAYNESHWAR JADHAV: (Speaking Marathi). MCCARTHY: Bhagyashri's brother-in-law Dnayneshwar Jadhav says his brother Tulkaram poisoned himself on the same day Hindus honor Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. We'll never be able to celebrate it again, he says. Dnayneshwar explains that his brother, just 35, was distraught over loans he'd taken out to stay afloat despite withered crops. He says usurious interest rates from private money lenders pulled his brother under. D. JADHAV: (Speaking Marathi).

So switch over from sugar cane to a horticulture crop. Wherever they have moved to horticulture crop like guava or pomegranate, the income levels of farmers have gone up by 7-20 times vis-a-vis sugar cane. So you have to incentivize them. MCCARTHY: The challenge is educating farmers like the Jadhavs to conserve water and grow appropriate crops. Back at their farm, beneath the stars, we sit in their untilled cotton fields.

He wins the election. He's happy. Then he's told his city is slowly going underwater. Not financially - literally. NPR's Christopher Joyce visited that mayor and reports on his dilemma. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Six years ago, James Cason settled in Coral Gables, a seaside town near Miami. He ran for mayor on the Republican ticket. Soon after Cason won, scientists came to him to explain sea level rise. He was flabbergasted. JAMES CASON: You know, I had read some articles here and there, but I didn't realize how impactful it would be on the city that I'm now the leader of. JOYCE: Cason had been a U. S. diplomat living in Paraguay. The topic of sea level rise hadn't come up much. Those scientists had brought a map, though. It showed much of the city would be underwater in a few decades. CASON: When I saw it, I said, wow, this is - of all the issues we're discussing, how come no one is taking this on, even if there's no solutions now? But at least we need to know what our risks are and our vulnerabilities. JOYCE: In fact, city streets were already flooding more often. Sea water was seeping up underneath the town as well. Cason grew deeply worried. He had officials map the whole city's elevation. They identified vulnerable places - hospitals, schools, key roads. But he says most of his constituents still aren't very interested. CASON: Some say, oh, I don't believe it. Others say I've got other things that I'm worried about right now, and I'll put that off. And others says I'm going to leave it to my grandkids to figure it out. JOYCE: Cason wanted to understand the city's liability. He decided to hire an attorney. ABIGAIL CORBETT: You know, whenever things go south, people look around and say who can I sue, especially when there's a lot of money at stake. JOYCE: Abby Corbett's with Stearns Weaver, a firm in Miami. She hadn't given sea level rise much thought either. Now she knows her elevation. CORBETT: I know my house is at two feet (laughter) it's two, yes. JOYCE: Does that worry you? CORBETT: Yeah, it's on my radar. I wouldn't say it worries me. I'm keeping track. JOYCE: Corbett's also keeping track of potential legal trouble from sea level rise. She says the city is pretty safe from that. It's tough to win a liability suit against a municipal government. But new legal issues already are bubbling up. For example, when the sea fills your street, who has a duty to do what? CORBETT: Where if you have a house and you can't get there and your street is flooding, the big question is do you have a right to get your property? JOYCE: Another legal briar patch - should builders or realtors tell homebuyers about future sea level rise? Corbett says it's especially important for people who advise others - lawyers, engineers, politicians - to think hard about how life will change as the ocean rises. Coral Gables, for example, has lots of yacht owners - sailing yachts with tall masts. Many are anchored at people's homes, with a city bridge between them and open water, a bridge those boats can barely sail underneath now. Mayor Cason says there are 302 such yachts. His people have actually counted them. At some point, these boats aren't going to fit under those bridges. CASON: And these are $5 million homes with nice boats that suddenly are going to see their property values go down because they no longer can get a boat out. So that will be one of the first indicators and a wake-up call for people, and I want to be able to say that we told you about this. JOYCE: Cason's also thinking about what politicians don't want to think about - retreating from parts of the city. CASON: And when they start flooding, whenever that is, when do they stop paying taxes? When do we no longer have to provide levels of service that they expect? JOYCE: Cason says lots of other Florida mayors are starting to worry too about things like municipal bonds, the way cities raise money. Will bond rating companies downgrade those bonds if the cities aren't prepared? Cason says thinking about all this is his duty as the city's mayor. CASON: History's not going to look kindly on us as elected leaders for not taking a leadership position even if we don't have the community seemingly engaged. JOYCE: He says that means thinking as much about sea level rise as, say, trash collection or more parking spaces downtown. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

A group of people walks through a fake Jetway onto an actual 727 airplane parked in a studio. The group is not here to film a scene. They're part of a two-day class for fearful fliers in which NPR's Danny Hajek enrolled. DANNY HAJEK, BYLINE: It's the first time in six years that Ronnie Michel has seen the inside of a plane. RONNIE MICHEL: You hear the plastic shaking, the weird noises. I can see the top of people's heads sitting in front of me. It's all familiar. HAJEK: Reminds him of the flight he was supposed to take from New York. MICHEL: I was about to board the plane, and I turned around and I bought a ticket for the Amtrak and took it all the way back to Los Angeles. And I haven't been on a plane since. HAJEK: For years, each person here has missed out - on vacations, family reunions, job interviews. If it involves boarding a plane, they've avoided it. And each of them has put down $500 to enroll in this program called FearlessFlight at Air Hollywood. Sixteen people signed up, but there are a handful of no-shows, including one guy who, for the past two years, has signed up for every class. And he has yet to attend. RON NIELSEN: The trouble is airplanes are just so damned full of sensory overload. HAJEK: Ron Nielsen runs the show. He goes by Captain Ron. A retired airline pilot, he also flew in Vietnam. He's been working with fearful fliers for 29 years. NIELSEN: I find the shame about not being able to fly often exceeds the fear itself. HAJEK: He eases the fear by explaining everything, from the mechanics of a jet engine to everyone's favorite. NIELSEN: Turbulence. (LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: There you go. HAJEK: The cabin shakes. You can't see from inside, but the plane sits on a platform above compressed bags of air, kind of like a mattress. Forget fancy hydraulics. The shaking is Rob Shalhoub of Air Hollywood jumping up and down. ROBERT SHALHOUB: I'm just bouncing on the ramp. HAJEK: (Laughter) You're creating the turbulence. SHALHOUB: Yeah. HAJEK: Back inside, Koren Owens says it's giving her anxiety. They spend all day in the simulator. KOREN OWENS: My legs are a little shaky and weak - doesn't feel good, no. And it's reminding me that tomorrow I'm really going to be going through this. HAJEK: That's when Captain Ron will take this class to Oakland on an actual Southwest Airlines flight. Fifteen-year-old Mikki Yuthus will be on board, too. She and her mom drove here from Portland 15 hours away, and she's pretty nervous. MIKKI YUTHUS: I'm think about how high off the ground we're going to be. And, like, I'm enclosed, and I can't get out. DAVE BARON: And that's a theme that you hear time and again. At the core of this is that sense of feeling out of control. HAJEK: Dr. Dave Baron is the interim chair of the Department of psychiatry at the University of Southern California. He has lots of experience working with patients afraid of flying. BARON: It's way beyond a fear. This is really - I mean, their heart races. They can't get their breath. It's absolute terror. And the next thing you know, I got to get off that plane. (SOUNDBITE OF PLANE FLYING)HAJEK: Hollywood Burbank Airport - Koren Owens clutches her boarding pass. Reality sets in. OWENS: I didn't sleep great. I tried to put it out my head, but - I mean, it's not terrible. But it's not great. I'm not dying right now. But I'm nervous. HAJEK: Captain Ron tells the group to just try and let it all go. NIELSEN: I do have a big thing about crying, you know. Inevitably, I have somebody in the group - I don't want to cry. I say let it rip, man. Honest to God, I cry all the time. It's a release, so do not bottle that up. HAJEK: They stand around the gate waiting for the plane to arrive - a lot of nervous banter, a couple people sit down and just kind of keep to themselves, alert to every announcement blaring over the intercom. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Over intercom) May I have your attention, please? If you left your laptop behind. . . HAJEK: The Southwest plane pulls in and passengers pour out - busy travelers, parents pushing kids in strollers. (CROSSTALK)HAJEK: Suddenly, one participant pulls Captain Ron aside. Everyone in the group turns. She's saying, I can't do this. I want to go home. NIELSEN: Just give me one inner thought right now. Why do you want to run? HAJEK: She says a quick goodbye, and she's gone - not much time to react because boarding has already begun. Passengers pack in their suitcases. It's a full flight. We find our seats, but the guy sitting next to me seems on edge. He keeps looking around. His hands are shaking. Captain Ron tries to get his attention from across the aisle, but he's not listening. Maybe it's too crowded or the smell of jet engine exhaust or the doors on the overhead bins slamming shut. He unbuckles his seatbelt, gets up and walks off the plane. HAJEK: Yeah, he's gone? Moments later, we pushed back and head for the runway. Every time those engines rev, we all brace for takeoff. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Folks on the flight deck just waiting for a little bit of traffic to clear. . . HAJEK: . . . Until we finally come to a stop and we're first for takeoff - no turning back now. As soon as we're airborne, there's turbulence. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Folks, just climbing up through a couple of bumps here. HAJEK: Some passengers grasp armrests. Even for seasoned travelers, this is pretty choppy. (SOUNDBITE OF SEATBELT CHIME)HAJEK: But we get above the clouds, and something happens. For the first time, these fearful fliers start to relax. Mikki Yuthus chats with her dad, and Koren Owens laugh at Captain Ron's jokes. ALEX: Just sort of let the fear wash over and, you know, I'm remembering that I used to love fly. HAJEK: This is Alex who's asked us not to use his last name because only his wife knows he's taking this class. He's wearing one of those neck pillows and orders an apple juice. ALEX: Do you see me nervous? Hands are pretty still. I'm not sweating. I mean, should have done it sooner. HAJEK: An hour later, the plane descends, and we're back on the ground in Oakland. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Oh, I'm so proud of you, too. HAJEK: Outside the Jetway, they're hugging, sharing stories from the flight. YUTHUS: I haven't been able to do this, and I've, like, missed opportunities. And now I can finally just get on a plane and not be, like, constantly stressed and worried about it. HAJEK: Mikki Yuthus is ready to hop on the plane home to Portland. Her dad, John Bizjak, puts his arm around her. JOHN BIZJAK: It was like her old self flying. HAJEK: Boarding the return flight is surprisingly easy. Getting on a plane for this group has suddenly become kind of routine - another takeoff, another landing, back in Burbank. And then Captain Ron holds this little awards ceremony right there in the terminal. NIELSEN: Courage beyond your years. OWENS: Thank you. NIELSEN: Yeah. You are inspiring to me. OWENS: Thank you. HAJEK: FearlessFlight isn't a cure-all. The next time, without Captain Ron, will be a challenge. But Dr. Dave Baron from USC says this is a huge step. BARON: You can learn techniques and gain a sense of control as opposed to having it be an emotional runaway train. HAJEK: In the end, Captain Ron says it comes down to one thing. NIELSEN: Sooner or later, you got to get on the the damn plane. And so people ask me - what's the most important thing for me to do to get over my fear? I say, book a flight. HAJEK: Danny Hajek, NPR News. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  We're going to take you now to a sound stage near Burbank, Calif. A group of people walks through a fake Jetway onto an actual 727 airplane parked in a studio. The group is not here to film a scene. They're part of a two-day class for fearful fliers in which NPR's Danny Hajek enrolled. DANNY HAJEK, BYLINE: It's the first time in six years that Ronnie Michel has seen the inside of a plane. RONNIE MICHEL: You hear the plastic shaking, the weird noises. I can see the top of people's heads sitting in front of me. It's all familiar. HAJEK: Reminds him of the flight he was supposed to take from New York. MICHEL: I was about to board the plane, and I turned around and I bought a ticket for the Amtrak and took it all the way back to Los Angeles. And I haven't been on a plane since. HAJEK: For years, each person here has missed out - on vacations, family reunions, job interviews. If it involves boarding a plane, they've avoided it. And each of them has put down $500 to enroll in this program called FearlessFlight at Air Hollywood. Sixteen people signed up, but there are a handful of no-shows, including one guy who, for the past two years, has signed up for every class. And he has yet to attend. RON NIELSEN: The trouble is airplanes are just so damned full of sensory overload. HAJEK: Ron Nielsen runs the show. He goes by Captain Ron. A retired airline pilot, he also flew in Vietnam. He's been working with fearful fliers for 29 years. NIELSEN: I find the shame about not being able to fly often exceeds the fear itself. HAJEK: He eases the fear by explaining everything, from the mechanics of a jet engine to everyone's favorite. NIELSEN: Turbulence. (LAUGHTER) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: There you go. HAJEK: The cabin shakes. You can't see from inside, but the plane sits on a platform above compressed bags of air, kind of like a mattress. Forget fancy hydraulics. The shaking is Rob Shalhoub of Air Hollywood jumping up and down. ROBERT SHALHOUB: I'm just bouncing on the ramp. HAJEK: (Laughter) You're creating the turbulence. SHALHOUB: Yeah. HAJEK: Back inside, Koren Owens says it's giving her anxiety. They spend all day in the simulator. KOREN OWENS: My legs are a little shaky and weak - doesn't feel good, no. And it's reminding me that tomorrow I'm really going to be going through this. HAJEK: That's when Captain Ron will take this class to Oakland on an actual Southwest Airlines flight. Fifteen-year-old Mikki Yuthus will be on board, too. She and her mom drove here from Portland 15 hours away, and she's pretty nervous. MIKKI YUTHUS: I'm think about how high off the ground we're going to be. And, like, I'm enclosed, and I can't get out. DAVE BARON: And that's a theme that you hear time and again. At the core of this is that sense of feeling out of control. HAJEK: Dr. Dave Baron is the interim chair of the Department of psychiatry at the University of Southern California. He has lots of experience working with patients afraid of flying. BARON: It's way beyond a fear. This is really - I mean, their heart races. They can't get their breath. It's absolute terror. And the next thing you know, I got to get off that plane. (SOUNDBITE OF PLANE FLYING) HAJEK: Hollywood Burbank Airport - Koren Owens clutches her boarding pass. Reality sets in. OWENS: I didn't sleep great. I tried to put it out my head, but - I mean, it's not terrible. But it's not great. I'm not dying right now. But I'm nervous. HAJEK: Captain Ron tells the group to just try and let it all go. NIELSEN: I do have a big thing about crying, you know. Inevitably, I have somebody in the group - I don't want to cry. I say let it rip, man. Honest to God, I cry all the time. It's a release, so do not bottle that up.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: My guest today is Keith Chen. He's a behavioral economist at UCLA. He's also the head of economic research at Uber, the ride-sharing company. Keith's going to talk about some of the behavioral anomalies that Uber has observed, and we're then going to talk about some of Keith's earlier work which explored the evolutionary and cultural origins of certain biases and heuristics. Keith Chen, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. KEITH CHEN: Thank you so much for having me. I'm a big fan of the podcast. VEDANTAM: I want to start by talking about surge-pricing. Uber charges more when demand is high based on the idea that this is going to draw more drivers into the pool and increase the supply of rides. Now, this makes perfect sense from the point of view for traditional economists, but you're a behavioral economist and you must know there's something about charging different prices for the same products that rubs customers the wrong way. They say, hey, five minutes ago this ride was 10 dollars. Now it's 20. CHEN: So as you can imagine, I hear over and over again, you know, both at my dinner table and at family gatherings. . . (LAUGHTER)CHEN: . . . That surge-pricing can feel very unfair to customers. But it's been a really integral part of Uber's success, precisely because, you know, the whole kind of goal of the company was to replace a really frustrating experience with taxi with a service that's just ultimately reliable - right? And the only way to do that, the only way to be able to get basically everyone who lives in a dense part of a city a car within five minutes was to do that through dynamic pricing, through giving drivers a very, very strong incentive to want to get to the places where they're needed the most, and also to get riders who could afford to wait a little longer - say they're at a bar - to say, well, you know, if it's more expensive to take a ride right now, go ahead and relax and sit back. If you can wait 15 minutes, the drink's on the person who's got to go now. VEDANTAM: Right (laughter). The interesting thing, Keith, is that when I think about my own behavior, when Uber tells me that the price is now 1. 8 times the regular price, I notice that and I factor that in, and there's a part of me that feels it's a little unfair. When I'm waiting for just a taxicab and now the taxicab doesn't show up, I don't actually think of someone whom I can blame or someone whom I hold responsible, even though it actually has a bigger effect on me that now I actually have to wait two hours or I can't get a cab at all. CHEN: Yeah, that's absolutely right. And, you know, this basic question of how psychologically painful kind of the experience of paying a price is is something that I worry about every day, especially because I actually think that it's one of the reasons that we've grown so fast. It's one of the reasons that we've been able to displace taxi so quickly is because in a taxi, you sit in the car and when you're trapped in traffic, you literally watch your money ticking away like in front of you. (LAUGHTER)CHEN: You're just kind of forced to watch it. There's nothing else to see except this. VEDANTAM: It's hypnotic, absolutely. CHEN: It's hypnotic and it's the worst possible psychological experience - you know? Taxis and gas pumps - right? - are the two places where you just watch your money tick away. And the typical Uber experience, you know, you just hit a button, get in the car and if it's not surging, you don't even need to know what you paid until tomorrow morning if you want to open the email. And if you kind of trust that Uber's the kind of cheapest possible of option, you don't even need to look. VEDANTAM: So you found that psychology plays a role in how surge-pricing works because there are places where it works in the way that a traditional economist would predict it would work and there are places where it breaks down. CHEN: Definitely. So just like traditional economics would predict, as you raise the price, you know, surge-pricing starts to dampen demand. You know, when you go from kind of a surge of 1X, meaning no surge, to 1. 2, you actually see a very, very large drop in demand - OK? And that initial drop in demand - actually early on when we first started surge-pricing at Uber, going from 1X to 1. 2X, you would see a 27 percentage points drop in people who would request. After sometime though, like both after a surge has been in the city for a while and after people have gotten a little used to it, that drops to 7 percent. So people start getting used to - it's not such an alien experience anymore. They may not love you - right? - at the company because of it, but they're not quite as kind of put off by it as normal. And then as you tick up the price further and further, you see further and further drops in demand - so 1. 2, 1. 3, 1. 4. You know, people like surge less and less because they understand that they're paying more. The surprising thing is there is a very, very strong round number effect which we detect. So when you go from 1. 9 to 2. 0, you see six times larger of a drop in demand than you saw from going from 1. 8 to 1. 9. So the amount more that you're paying for the trip is the same between those two steps, but 2. 0 just feels viscerally larger to people - right? It just seems a lot like - it's very easy to understand. Everyone understands I'm paying twice as much for this trip as I would have. VEDANTAM: I saw a paper that came out on National Bureau of Economic Research a couple of months ago. This is by Matthew Backus, Tom Blake and Steven Tadelis where they looked at pricing on eBay. And they found something that sounds similar, which is they found that when you price things with round numbers, those things tend to sell faster, partly because people believe that sellers who price things at round numbers aren't really wedded to those prices. . . CHEN: That's right. VEDANTAM: . . . That they basically put those prices on because they want to move something quickly. CHEN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: And therefore they're actually willing to negotiate with you because they actually don't care so much about what the actual prices is, whereas, when you pick a very specific price point. . . CHEN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: . . . People say, this couch costs 74 dollars and 26 cents - some thought must have gone into this and I don't have much room to negotiate. CHEN: (Laughter) And there is no back and forth. Where if somebody prices their couch at a hundred. . . VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: . . . You think, well, why don't I just counter with 50? VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: And then the conversation gets starting from there - right? VEDANTAM: Yeah. CHEN: Actually, you know, we see exactly the same thing at Uber. And I think that's the main explanation for something really, really puzzling, and that is more people will take a ride at a surge multiplier of 2. 1 than would take a ride and 2. So I described to you how between 1. 9 and 2, a lot of people stopped taking rides. If anything, people take more rides at 2. 1 than they did at 2. VEDANTAM: When it's more expensive? CHEN: When it's more expensive. It's as if they're telling you, I would rather pay you 2. 1 times the normal price than I would 2. And I think just like your intuition on negotiations on eBay, that's exactly the same intuition I think that drives the behavior here. You know, people, when you tell someone, your trip is going to be two times more than it normally costs, they think, wow, that's capricious and unfair. VEDANTAM: Someone just made that up. CHEN: Somebody just made that up. Like, you know, they must have seen it was raining and just decided to mess with me - right? Whereas if you say, oh, you know, your trip is going to be 2. 1 times more than it normally does - wow, you know, there must be some smart algorithm in the background here that's at work. It doesn't seem quite as unfair. VEDANTAM: We had the behavioral economist Richard Thaler on the podcast some time ago. And one of the thinks he was talking about is why it's often hard to find a cab on a rainy evening. And his theory is that this had something to do with what he calls mental accounting, which is the cab driver has a number in his or her head about how much money he wants to make on a given day. So the cab driver says, you know, my expenses are going to be a hundred bucks a day. I want to make a hundred dollars over that. And so when I hit 200, I go home. And on a rainy day, demand is higher, so you hit 200 faster. CHEN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: And so the cab driver goes home. And so you end up with fewer cabs with more demand. CHEN: Exactly. VEDANTAM: Now, you have done some work looking at dynamic pricing and surge pricing. And you're finding that actually that isn't the case with Uber driver. Uber drivers do not necessarily go home when it's actually a smart time to be driving. CHEN: Yeah, exactly right. I find very different results than Dick does with New York City cab drivers. And I think I understand a little bit of the psychology as to why we're finding different things. All right, so exactly as you said. If you're a New York City cab driver, you know, you're going to get the same amount for every trip no matter what. It's a regulated fare. So when it's raining, the only thing that's really changing is you're just picking up more people - right? So in that world, it does feel very salient. You know, many of them are collecting cash. You can just see, you know, once there's a pile of 200 dollars in the front seat, I'm just going to call it a day - right? Whereas, on Uber, you know, the main way that we incentivize drivers to move to the places that riders need them and to stay out a little longer if they can afford to is through surge pricing. And so I think that's - I think that's very, very salient. So if you're an Uber driver, and say you were planning to do about a two-hour shift this afternoon - you know, you're driving around but all of a sudden, unexpectedly, it starts to surge 2. 1 times - all right? Like, every trip you're going to make, you know, (laughter) - I can't believe my mind just went to 2. 1(LAUGHTER)CHEN: But, you know, you're an Uber driver, and it's surging, you're going to get twice as much. . . VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: . . . For every additional trip you do. What I actually see in our Uber data is that even compared to yourself a week ago in exactly this situation, Uber drivers will double, triple the length of the shift that they were planning to do if it's surging 2X, if it's surging 3X. They're just going to stay out because, well, they can make a lot of money right now. You know, they can take the whole weekend off if they put in another few hours today. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: When you yourself use Uber as a rider, what is it you pay attention to? I mean, do you use your own trips as sort of research into how the company is working? You must at some level. CHEN: Oh, my god, I do all of the time. VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: And it frustrates me because I kind of see so many kind of psychological biases in my own life. VEDANTAM: Like what? CHEN: So, for example, partially because I think it's just one of our most exciting products, I take UberPool a lot. So UberPool is this service by which now up to three passengers can share the same Uber car. And, you know, when you're in the car, you know, you can just - somebody just kind of two blocks ahead just happens to be going, you know, along the exact same route that you are, you know, will just suddenly tell your Uber driver, pull over and, you know, take in this new person. And then because that we can get people to share rides and get more people into seats, we can like reduce the price. And on average, like, UberPool can save up to 50 percent for most people's rides. VEDANTAM: Not to mention saving on gas and emissions and all the environmental issues. CHEN: Not to mention saving on gas, emissions and increases driver pay because, you know, literally now drivers can be constantly utilized. They can be constantly making money and they don't have any of that downtime of driving to someone or sitting idle somewhere. But a big part of making UberPool work is minimizing the amount of psychological frustration that people have with that experience. And so, for example, I find for myself that initially when we were writing those kind of UberPool algorithms, we took a very rational view. You know, we want to pass people the most amount of savings that we can and inconvenience them as little as possible, with inconvenience usually being kind of just really, really focused on how much time is it going to get you from your point A to your point B? One of the things that we have started to discovered is that - and that I feel very viscerally when I'm in an UberPool - is that there's something really, really psychologically painful about going backwards - right? So even if this is an amazing match for you - right? - forcing your car to kind of, you know, make three right turns and circle around the block and for a short period drive backwards - right? - drive away from your destination. . . VEDANTAM: Yeah. CHEN: . . . Is just like three times more painful than you would have expected just from the added time. VEDANTAM: Yeah. CHEN: So, you know, so we try and avoid that as much as possible. And that's something (unintelligible). VEDANTAM: You know, I feel there have been times that I miss an exit on the freeway, and you know that you have to wait, go to the next exit and then turn around and come back. And every inch of the way, as you're going to the next exit, you're reminding yourself, I'm going to have to retrace this inch. I'm going to have to retrace this inch. I made a mistake. And you really - it's true, you really beat up on yourself when you feel like you're doing something that's taking you in the wrong direction. CHEN: Yeah, I'll do crazy things, like I realized the other day that - you know, there's two airports that I can fly out of. I have to fly south and there's two airports I can fly out of. One of them is north of me and one of them is south of me. I can't bring myself to book a flight out at the airport that's north of me because I feel like I'll spend the whole drive, like, going in the wrong direction. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). One of the things I wanted to talk to you about this Uber is collecting massive amounts of information on what people are doing. And I think a lot of people don't quite realize how powerful this information is. I remember doing a story some months ago looking at some social science research, analyzing how people were using cell phones in a poor country and how the way people use their cell phones and whether they kept their cell phones topped off - so this is a country where you sort of prepay your cell phone - whether you keep your cell phone prepaid. And whether you have a lot of incoming calls or you have a lot of outgoing calls, how wide your network is - all these things can predict, with a remarkable degree of accuracy, your credit worthiness. And so if a bank sort of just looks at your cell phone usage data, it can make remarkably accurate predictions about whether you are likely to repay a loan or not repay a loan. And, I mean, who would think that just the way that you're using your cell phone could tell a bank that, you know, they should give you a loan to start a new business? And I feel like Uber has sort of similar access to vast amounts of data. I mean, there have been reports for example of, you know, so Uber broadly knows where I live and where I work because I'm often taking cabs back and forth between those two locations. But let's say one day I leave work, and instead of going home I go to another location, which is known to be the address of a bar. CHEN: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: And then a few hours later I go to another location, which is not my home address. CHEN: Sure. VEDANTAM: And then I come to work the next morning, you know, you can draw the conclusion of what I was doing that evening. And it feels like you actually know more about people's lives than perhaps they realize they are letting you know. CHEN: We do have access to a tremendous amount of data. And because of that we have kind of a privacy officer, you know, within the firm. Because of that, kind of even as an employee of the firm, I have to be very, very careful about what kinds of queries and what I look at in people's data. Yeah, precisely because this is people's lives. And you're right that, you know, we have to take very seriously this responsibility that we're becoming a big part of how people move around the world. And we just want to be very careful with that. VEDANTAM: Have you ever been concerned about the way you are using these services that might reveal things about you? I mean, as someone who sees things from the point of view of the institution of the company and knows how powerful this information is, has it changed your own behavior and how you interact with any number of these sites? CHEN: Well, now that you're talking about it, I'm getting even more worried, but. . . (LAUGHTER)CHEN: But, you know, I - and this might be naive, but I have often thought to myself that - you know, so my experience inside of large companies that have access to these huge kind of treasure troves of data is that, you know, you almost always just look at these like broad, broad aggregates. And I guess I've always just taken comfort in the fact that I'm boring enough of a person that no one would ever (laughter) - I mean, it's almost like - you know, so, for example, like, some people I know, like my sister, kind of shreds all of her credit card statements and kind of does everything before she tosses paper in the trash. And I always just throw everything in the trash because I figure, like, I just don't feel important enough for, like, someone to rummage through my trash. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). CHEN: We do though, you know, in the Uber data, see a lot of really, really interesting patterns. So, for example, a data scientist named Peter at Uber discovered somewhat accidentally this really, really kind of interesting fact. And that is one of the strongest predictors of whether or not you are going to be sensitive to surge - in other words, whether or not you are going to kind of say, oh, 2. 2, 2. 3, I'll give it a 10 to 15 minutes to see if surge goes away - is how much battery you have left on your cell phone. VEDANTAM: Oh, that's fascinating. Of course, yeah. CHEN: Yeah, like when your cell phone is like down to like below 5 percent battery and that little icon on the iPhone turns red, you know, then people start saying, well, I better get home, like, because I don't quite know how I'm going to get home otherwise. And we absolutely don't use that to kind of like push you a higher surge price, but it's an interesting kind of psychological fact of human behavior. VEDANTAM: I'm talking with Keith Chen. He's a behavioral economist at UCLA. And heads up economic research at Uber. When we come back, I'm going to ask Keith about some of his earlier work, which explores the origin of some very interesting biases. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Keith, in your life before Uber, you conducted different experiments into the origins of various human biases, including some issues that often come up in behavioral economics. Some of your most fascinating early work was with monkeys. And I understand to conduct these experiments, you first trained the monkeys to become economic actors. CHEN: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: How did you go about doing that? CHEN: Oh my gosh, this feels like a lifetime ago. But with a bunch of colleagues at Yale University, we set out to answer this kind of somewhat ill-defined question but one that we were kind of obsessed with, which was, if monkeys were taught to use money - well, one, could monkeys be taught to use money? And two, if monkeys could be taught to use money, would they behave in the same way that humans do in all of the kind of psychologically rich ways that we interact with kind of prices and think about wealth and think about how we spend our own money? So basically what we did was, you know, we just - we had a small colony of Capuchin monkeys that were living with us at Yale. I also did some work with a colony of Tamarin monkeys back at Harvard. And my Yale students were thrilled to hear that the Yale monkeys were much smarter than the Harvard monkeys. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). CHEN: I didn't tell them it was because it was a different species. VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: They attributed it to the school. VEDANTAM: Right (laughter). CHEN: But basically what you do to teach a monkey to use money is you hire a bunch of Yale undergrads to basically just live with the monkeys for a long time. So, you know, these Yale undergraduates were typically psychology majors. They were studying the monkeys for various other things. You know, the monkeys live in a big, spacious, comfortable habitat. You know, they typically ignore the kind of humans that are moving around. But you'd have a Yale undergraduate every now and then just drop a coin on the floor - OK? And we had chose these kind of large, metal washers to kind of stand in for a coin. Now, a monkey thinks that's fascinating, runs over, grabs the coin, kind of chews on it, like, you know, bangs it on the floor, every now and then would throw it around, kind of almost a little dangerously, but would eventually kind of lose interest in this metal disc. Then you'd have the Yale undergraduates stand there and stare at the monkey with an open hand outstretched - OK? - and just stare at that monkey uncomfortably, just kind of setting this uncomfortable situation. And every now and then, the monkey would actually pick up the coin and just put it in the undergraduates' hand, like give it back to the student. And what we did was we trained the students to say, why thank you in a really exaggerated tones and then like hand the monkey a piece of food - OK? - so like a little apple slice. One undergraduate came to be known to the monkeys as like the apple undergraduate. If you gave that person a coin, they would always, like, hand you an apple slice. Another person was the pineapple undergraduate. And another person was the orange slice undergraduate. Now, what's amazing is you do this for about six months - all right? - nonstop for about six months. And eventually you start to realize that the monkeys understand that this is Fiat money - right? Now, what does that mean? Well, what that means is, you know, the monkeys had been very familiar with, like, basic ideas, like there's a lever on the wall. If I pull this lever, an apple slice falls from the ceiling. But money is something fundamentally different. When I find this coin - all right? - it's not just an apple lever. It's actually a choice between an apple lever, an orange lever, and a pineapple lever because I can take this coin, I can carry it around with me, and I can wait until the - if I feel like having an apple, I've got to run over to the apple person and I can spend it there - right? Money is kind of fungible across different kinds of food that I can purchase. So we started to see that. We saw that monkeys started to use these with each other, and to save them, to kind of hide them from other monkeys and then to make very, very rational decisions, rational-looking decisions. When the price of apple doubled, you know, when that apple undergraduate started only giving one piece of apple, not two, when you handed him a coin, you know, demand for apples went down and demand for oranges and for pineapples went up. VEDANTAM: How did the monkeys protect their money? CHEN: A fascinating component of the monkeys starting to understand money was that they displayed signs that they realized not only that they understood the value of this disc but that they understood other monkeys recognized the value of this disc. So, for example, you know, early on when the money that we were using was these physical disks, it's a little bit hard to shield from other monkeys - right? And you don't want to be kind of carrying all of these things around. So you would see monkeys, like, hide the discs, like, you know, over in the corner, under a pile of, like, wood shavings - right? They'd kind of hide the discs. Later, actually, we taught these monkeys to use touchpads. And so, like, then kind of in some sense, like, monkeys learned, you know, to use currency as if it's just kind of an ATM, as if it just gets, like, Venmoed or transferred to other players, to the apple guy. . . VEDANTAM: So this is like an Apple wallet basically? CHEN: Yeah, basically. They are ahead of us on this dimension. You know, they are a completely cashless economy at this point. VEDANTAM: You eventually got to the point where you would also introduce to the monkeys the idea that sometimes when they would give a certain amount of money to an experimenter, the experimenter might give the monkey three things. And sometimes the experimenter might give the monkey one thing. So in other words, it was unpredictable what the reward was going to be. You taught the monkeys to gamble. CHEN: Yeah, that's basically exactly what we did. So we introduced them to two new undergraduates. So one undergraduate would always approach a monkey with three pieces of apple in their outstretched hand. Let's call this undergraduate Adam - OK? - would show three, and either give over all three or would it take two back and would only give one. Then we introduced him to another undergraduate, Ben, - all right? - who always showed one - OK? But if you gave Ben a coin, Ben would half the time hand over just that one, half the time would add two apple pieces to his hand and hand over three - all right? So now the fascinating thing is both Adam and Ben are presenting you exactly the same deal. They are a 50-50 gamble between three apple pieces and one apple piece - right? And you can give the monkeys  a lot of experience trading only with Adam and a lot of experience training only with Ben. So they kind of get that this is a 50-50 gamble. The interesting thing is what the monkeys showed us through their preferences between Adam and Ben is that they experience something just like humans do. And that's this very powerful psychological force called loss aversion - all right? And that's the idea that it's more than twice as painful to experience a loss than it is to experience a similar sized gain - right? Now, what does that have to do with Adam and Ben? Well, Adam half the time gives you, in some sense, what he's shown - right? - the three apple pieces. But half the time he delivers you a loss. He takes away two and then hands over only one - all right? So half the time, he delivers you a loss of two. Ben half the time just hands you the one that he is showing you and half the time delivers you a gain. He gives - he puts an extra two pieces of apple there and hands you an extra two apple pieces. What we find is that when given the choice between Adam and Ben, monkeys vastly prefer Ben, - all right? - the guy who initially only shows one apple piece but half the time gives you a gain, than they preferred Adam, who initially shows you three apple pieces and then half the time delivers you a loss. They - you know, 6 to 1 preferred trading with Ben to Adam. And that's fascinating because that cuts against their very, very core instinct, which is, well, if I have got a coin, why don't I go trade it with the guy who is showing me three instead of the guy who is showing me one - right? Like every kind of fiber in their body tells them that they should be going for more food, not less. And yet because of loss aversion and because they actually feel this very viscerally in the same way that people do, they actually prefer the guy who promises less but delivers more. VEDANTAM: I have to say that I am thinking about what I would do in that situation. And I have to say I'm clearly no smarter than a monkey because I would definitely prefer to trade with Ben because you are getting something that seems like it's a surprise. It's a gift. It's like - it's wonderful. It's unexpected. It's happy. And at the worst it's only going to be what he's promised you in the first place. But with Adam, he's taking away something that you thought was yours. CHEN: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And interestingly, we see in our Uber data this loss aversion at work as well. And you can even just feel it psychologically. Like when you are a rider and, you know, surge pricing hits, like that's a loss - right? And that feels very, very bad. We have often been asked, well, why didn't you frame surge pricing as discounts instead of as - instead of surcharges? Why isn't Uber's standard price twice as high as it is and then most of the time you're getting a discount - right? Why not kind of frame it that way? VEDANTAM: Because behavioral economics would predict that you would actually make people much happier if you did it that way. CHEN: Well, behavioral economics would predict that you would make riders happier if you did that. I mean, the critical thing to notice is that we are a two-sided market. That move, which would make riders happier, would also make drivers feel less well. So, I mean, so we had thought for a while, why not just frame Uber's pricing as how much cheaper we are than a taxi? Because in many major cities in the United States, we're up to 60 percent cheaper than taxi fares when we're not surging. And, you know, what that means is that, you know, you can surge like 2. 1 and still be coming basically out even if you had instead just taken a taxi. But even though because Uber drivers are in such an efficient system, they constantly have a paying rider in the back of the car, they are actually making more than they would have if they had been working as a taxi driver, framing this to them - oh, you're making 60 percent less per mile than you would if you were driving a taxi, that's - that would be a cost of this pricing system.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: My guest today is Keith Chen. He's a behavioral economist at UCLA. He's also the head of economic research at Uber, the ride-sharing company. Keith's going to talk about some of the behavioral anomalies that Uber has observed, and we're then going to talk about some of Keith's earlier work which explored the evolutionary and cultural origins of certain biases and heuristics. Keith Chen, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. KEITH CHEN: Thank you so much for having me. I'm a big fan of the podcast. VEDANTAM: I want to start by talking about surge-pricing. Uber charges more when demand is high based on the idea that this is going to draw more drivers into the pool and increase the supply of rides. Now, this makes perfect sense from the point of view for traditional economists, but you're a behavioral economist and you must know there's something about charging different prices for the same products that rubs customers the wrong way. They say, hey, five minutes ago this ride was 10 dollars. Now it's 20. CHEN: So as you can imagine, I hear over and over again, you know, both at my dinner table and at family gatherings. . . (LAUGHTER) CHEN: . . . That surge-pricing can feel very unfair to customers. But it's been a really integral part of Uber's success, precisely because, you know, the whole kind of goal of the company was to replace a really frustrating experience with taxi with a service that's just ultimately reliable - right? And the only way to do that, the only way to be able to get basically everyone who lives in a dense part of a city a car within five minutes was to do that through dynamic pricing, through giving drivers a very, very strong incentive to want to get to the places where they're needed the most, and also to get riders who could afford to wait a little longer - say they're at a bar - to say, well, you know, if it's more expensive to take a ride right now, go ahead and relax and sit back. If you can wait 15 minutes, the drink's on the person who's got to go now. VEDANTAM: Right (laughter). The interesting thing, Keith, is that when I think about my own behavior, when Uber tells me that the price is now 1. 8 times the regular price, I notice that and I factor that in, and there's a part of me that feels it's a little unfair. When I'm waiting for just a taxicab and now the taxicab doesn't show up, I don't actually think of someone whom I can blame or someone whom I hold responsible, even though it actually has a bigger effect on me that now I actually have to wait two hours or I can't get a cab at all. CHEN: Yeah, that's absolutely right. And, you know, this basic question of how psychologically painful kind of the experience of paying a price is is something that I worry about every day, especially because I actually think that it's one of the reasons that we've grown so fast. It's one of the reasons that we've been able to displace taxi so quickly is because in a taxi, you sit in the car and when you're trapped in traffic, you literally watch your money ticking away like in front of you. (LAUGHTER) CHEN: You're just kind of forced to watch it. There's nothing else to see except this. VEDANTAM: It's hypnotic, absolutely. CHEN: It's hypnotic and it's the worst possible psychological experience - you know? Taxis and gas pumps - right? - are the two places where you just watch your money tick away. And the typical Uber experience, you know, you just hit a button, get in the car and if it's not surging, you don't even need to know what you paid until tomorrow morning if you want to open the email. And if you kind of trust that Uber's the kind of cheapest possible of option, you don't even need to look. VEDANTAM: So you found that psychology plays a role in how surge-pricing works because there are places where it works in the way that a traditional economist would predict it would work and there are places where it breaks down. CHEN: Definitely. So just like traditional economics would predict, as you raise the price, you know, surge-pricing starts to dampen demand. You know, when you go from kind of a surge of 1X, meaning no surge, to 1. 2, you actually see a very, very large drop in demand - OK? And that initial drop in demand - actually early on when we first started surge-pricing at Uber, going from 1X to 1. 2X, you would see a 27 percentage points drop in people who would request. After sometime though, like both after a surge has been in the city for a while and after people have gotten a little used to it, that drops to 7 percent. So people start getting used to - it's not such an alien experience anymore. They may not love you - right? - at the company because of it, but they're not quite as kind of put off by it as normal. And then as you tick up the price further and further, you see further and further drops in demand - so 1. 2, 1. 3, 1. 4. You know, people like surge less and less because they understand that they're paying more. The surprising thing is there is a very, very strong round number effect which we detect. So when you go from 1. 9 to 2. 0, you see six times larger of a drop in demand than you saw from going from 1. 8 to 1. 9. So the amount more that you're paying for the trip is the same between those two steps, but 2. 0 just feels viscerally larger to people - right? It just seems a lot like - it's very easy to understand. Everyone understands I'm paying twice as much for this trip as I would have. VEDANTAM: I saw a paper that came out on National Bureau of Economic Research a couple of months ago. This is by Matthew Backus, Tom Blake and Steven Tadelis where they looked at pricing on eBay. And they found something that sounds similar, which is they found that when you price things with round numbers, those things tend to sell faster, partly because people believe that sellers who price things at round numbers aren't really wedded to those prices. . . CHEN: That's right. VEDANTAM: . . . That they basically put those prices on because they want to move something quickly. CHEN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: And therefore they're actually willing to negotiate with you because they actually don't care so much about what the actual prices is, whereas, when you pick a very specific price point. . . CHEN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: . . . People say, this couch costs 74 dollars and 26 cents - some thought must have gone into this and I don't have much room to negotiate. CHEN: (Laughter) And there is no back and forth. Where if somebody prices their couch at a hundred. . . VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: . . . You think, well, why don't I just counter with 50? VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: And then the conversation gets starting from there - right? VEDANTAM: Yeah. CHEN: Actually, you know, we see exactly the same thing at Uber. And I think that's the main explanation for something really, really puzzling, and that is more people will take a ride at a surge multiplier of 2. 1 than would take a ride and 2. So I described to you how between 1. 9 and 2, a lot of people stopped taking rides. If anything, people take more rides at 2. 1 than they did at 2. VEDANTAM: When it's more expensive? CHEN: When it's more expensive. It's as if they're telling you, I would rather pay you 2. 1 times the normal price than I would 2. And I think just like your intuition on negotiations on eBay, that's exactly the same intuition I think that drives the behavior here. You know, people, when you tell someone, your trip is going to be two times more than it normally costs, they think, wow, that's capricious and unfair. VEDANTAM: Someone just made that up. CHEN: Somebody just made that up. Like, you know, they must have seen it was raining and just decided to mess with me - right? Whereas if you say, oh, you know, your trip is going to be 2. 1 times more than it normally does - wow, you know, there must be some smart algorithm in the background here that's at work. It doesn't seem quite as unfair. VEDANTAM: We had the behavioral economist Richard Thaler on the podcast some time ago. And one of the thinks he was talking about is why it's often hard to find a cab on a rainy evening. And his theory is that this had something to do with what he calls mental accounting, which is the cab driver has a number in his or her head about how much money he wants to make on a given day. So the cab driver says, you know, my expenses are going to be a hundred bucks a day. I want to make a hundred dollars over that. And so when I hit 200, I go home. And on a rainy day, demand is higher, so you hit 200 faster. CHEN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: And so the cab driver goes home. And so you end up with fewer cabs with more demand. CHEN: Exactly. VEDANTAM: Now, you have done some work looking at dynamic pricing and surge pricing. And you're finding that actually that isn't the case with Uber driver. Uber drivers do not necessarily go home when it's actually a smart time to be driving. CHEN: Yeah, exactly right. I find very different results than Dick does with New York City cab drivers. And I think I understand a little bit of the psychology as to why we're finding different things. All right, so exactly as you said. If you're a New York City cab driver, you know, you're going to get the same amount for every trip no matter what. It's a regulated fare. So when it's raining, the only thing that's really changing is you're just picking up more people - right? So in that world, it does feel very salient. You know, many of them are collecting cash. You can just see, you know, once there's a pile of 200 dollars in the front seat, I'm just going to call it a day - right? Whereas, on Uber, you know, the main way that we incentivize drivers to move to the places that riders need them and to stay out a little longer if they can afford to is through surge pricing. And so I think that's - I think that's very, very salient. So if you're an Uber driver, and say you were planning to do about a two-hour shift this afternoon - you know, you're driving around but all of a sudden, unexpectedly, it starts to surge 2. 1 times - all right? Like, every trip you're going to make, you know, (laughter) - I can't believe my mind just went to 2. 1 (LAUGHTER) CHEN: But, you know, you're an Uber driver, and it's surging, you're going to get twice as much. . . VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: . . . For every additional trip you do. What I actually see in our Uber data is that even compared to yourself a week ago in exactly this situation, Uber drivers will double, triple the length of the shift that they were planning to do if it's surging 2X, if it's surging 3X. They're just going to stay out because, well, they can make a lot of money right now. You know, they can take the whole weekend off if they put in another few hours today. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When you yourself use Uber as a rider, what is it you pay attention to? I mean, do you use your own trips as sort of research into how the company is working? You must at some level. CHEN: Oh, my god, I do all of the time. VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: And it frustrates me because I kind of see so many kind of psychological biases in my own life. VEDANTAM: Like what? CHEN: So, for example, partially because I think it's just one of our most exciting products, I take UberPool a lot. So UberPool is this service by which now up to three passengers can share the same Uber car. And, you know, when you're in the car, you know, you can just - somebody just kind of two blocks ahead just happens to be going, you know, along the exact same route that you are, you know, will just suddenly tell your Uber driver, pull over and, you know, take in this new person. And then because that we can get people to share rides and get more people into seats, we can like reduce the price. And on average, like, UberPool can save up to 50 percent for most people's rides. VEDANTAM: Not to mention saving on gas and emissions and all the environmental issues. CHEN: Not to mention saving on gas, emissions and increases driver pay because, you know, literally now drivers can be constantly utilized. They can be constantly making money and they don't have any of that downtime of driving to someone or sitting idle somewhere. But a big part of making UberPool work is minimizing the amount of psychological frustration that people have with that experience. And so, for example, I find for myself that initially when we were writing those kind of UberPool algorithms, we took a very rational view. You know, we want to pass people the most amount of savings that we can and inconvenience them as little as possible, with inconvenience usually being kind of just really, really focused on how much time is it going to get you from your point A to your point B? One of the things that we have started to discovered is that - and that I feel very viscerally when I'm in an UberPool - is that there's something really, really psychologically painful about going backwards - right? So even if this is an amazing match for you - right? - forcing your car to kind of, you know, make three right turns and circle around the block and for a short period drive backwards - right? - drive away from your destination. . . VEDANTAM: Yeah. CHEN: . . . Is just like three times more painful than you would have expected just from the added time. VEDANTAM: Yeah. CHEN: So, you know, so we try and avoid that as much as possible. And that's something (unintelligible). VEDANTAM: You know, I feel there have been times that I miss an exit on the freeway, and you know that you have to wait, go to the next exit and then turn around and come back. And every inch of the way, as you're going to the next exit, you're reminding yourself, I'm going to have to retrace this inch. I'm going to have to retrace this inch. I made a mistake. And you really - it's true, you really beat up on yourself when you feel like you're doing something that's taking you in the wrong direction. CHEN: Yeah, I'll do crazy things, like I realized the other day that - you know, there's two airports that I can fly out of. I have to fly south and there's two airports I can fly out of. One of them is north of me and one of them is south of me. I can't bring myself to book a flight out at the airport that's north of me because I feel like I'll spend the whole drive, like, going in the wrong direction. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). One of the things I wanted to talk to you about this Uber is collecting massive amounts of information on what people are doing. And I think a lot of people don't quite realize how powerful this information is. I remember doing a story some months ago looking at some social science research, analyzing how people were using cell phones in a poor country and how the way people use their cell phones and whether they kept their cell phones topped off - so this is a country where you sort of prepay your cell phone - whether you keep your cell phone prepaid. And whether you have a lot of incoming calls or you have a lot of outgoing calls, how wide your network is - all these things can predict, with a remarkable degree of accuracy, your credit worthiness. And so if a bank sort of just looks at your cell phone usage data, it can make remarkably accurate predictions about whether you are likely to repay a loan or not repay a loan. And, I mean, who would think that just the way that you're using your cell phone could tell a bank that, you know, they should give you a loan to start a new business? And I feel like Uber has sort of similar access to vast amounts of data. I mean, there have been reports for example of, you know, so Uber broadly knows where I live and where I work because I'm often taking cabs back and forth between those two locations. But let's say one day I leave work, and instead of going home I go to another location, which is known to be the address of a bar. CHEN: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: And then a few hours later I go to another location, which is not my home address. CHEN: Sure. VEDANTAM: And then I come to work the next morning, you know, you can draw the conclusion of what I was doing that evening. And it feels like you actually know more about people's lives than perhaps they realize they are letting you know. CHEN: We do have access to a tremendous amount of data. And because of that we have kind of a privacy officer, you know, within the firm. Because of that, kind of even as an employee of the firm, I have to be very, very careful about what kinds of queries and what I look at in people's data. Yeah, precisely because this is people's lives. And you're right that, you know, we have to take very seriously this responsibility that we're becoming a big part of how people move around the world. And we just want to be very careful with that. VEDANTAM: Have you ever been concerned about the way you are using these services that might reveal things about you? I mean, as someone who sees things from the point of view of the institution of the company and knows how powerful this information is, has it changed your own behavior and how you interact with any number of these sites? CHEN: Well, now that you're talking about it, I'm getting even more worried, but. . . (LAUGHTER) CHEN: But, you know, I - and this might be naive, but I have often thought to myself that - you know, so my experience inside of large companies that have access to these huge kind of treasure troves of data is that, you know, you almost always just look at these like broad, broad aggregates. And I guess I've always just taken comfort in the fact that I'm boring enough of a person that no one would ever (laughter) - I mean, it's almost like - you know, so, for example, like, some people I know, like my sister, kind of shreds all of her credit card statements and kind of does everything before she tosses paper in the trash. And I always just throw everything in the trash because I figure, like, I just don't feel important enough for, like, someone to rummage through my trash. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). CHEN: We do though, you know, in the Uber data, see a lot of really, really interesting patterns. So, for example, a data scientist named Peter at Uber discovered somewhat accidentally this really, really kind of interesting fact. And that is one of the strongest predictors of whether or not you are going to be sensitive to surge - in other words, whether or not you are going to kind of say, oh, 2. 2, 2. 3, I'll give it a 10 to 15 minutes to see if surge goes away - is how much battery you have left on your cell phone. VEDANTAM: Oh, that's fascinating. Of course, yeah. CHEN: Yeah, like when your cell phone is like down to like below 5 percent battery and that little icon on the iPhone turns red, you know, then people start saying, well, I better get home, like, because I don't quite know how I'm going to get home otherwise. And we absolutely don't use that to kind of like push you a higher surge price, but it's an interesting kind of psychological fact of human behavior. VEDANTAM: I'm talking with Keith Chen. He's a behavioral economist at UCLA. And heads up economic research at Uber. When we come back, I'm going to ask Keith about some of his earlier work, which explores the origin of some very interesting biases. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Keith, in your life before Uber, you conducted different experiments into the origins of various human biases, including some issues that often come up in behavioral economics. Some of your most fascinating early work was with monkeys. And I understand to conduct these experiments, you first trained the monkeys to become economic actors. CHEN: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: How did you go about doing that? CHEN: Oh my gosh, this feels like a lifetime ago. But with a bunch of colleagues at Yale University, we set out to answer this kind of somewhat ill-defined question but one that we were kind of obsessed with, which was, if monkeys were taught to use money - well, one, could monkeys be taught to use money? And two, if monkeys could be taught to use money, would they behave in the same way that humans do in all of the kind of psychologically rich ways that we interact with kind of prices and think about wealth and think about how we spend our own money? So basically what we did was, you know, we just - we had a small colony of Capuchin monkeys that were living with us at Yale. I also did some work with a colony of Tamarin monkeys back at Harvard. And my Yale students were thrilled to hear that the Yale monkeys were much smarter than the Harvard monkeys. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). CHEN: I didn't tell them it was because it was a different species. VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: They attributed it to the school. VEDANTAM: Right (laughter). CHEN: But basically what you do to teach a monkey to use money is you hire a bunch of Yale undergrads to basically just live with the monkeys for a long time. So, you know, these Yale undergraduates were typically psychology majors. They were studying the monkeys for various other things. You know, the monkeys live in a big, spacious, comfortable habitat. You know, they typically ignore the kind of humans that are moving around. But you'd have a Yale undergraduate every now and then just drop a coin on the floor - OK? And we had chose these kind of large, metal washers to kind of stand in for a coin. Now, a monkey thinks that's fascinating, runs over, grabs the coin, kind of chews on it, like, you know, bangs it on the floor, every now and then would throw it around, kind of almost a little dangerously, but would eventually kind of lose interest in this metal disc. Then you'd have the Yale undergraduates stand there and stare at the monkey with an open hand outstretched - OK? - and just stare at that monkey uncomfortably, just kind of setting this uncomfortable situation. And every now and then, the monkey would actually pick up the coin and just put it in the undergraduates' hand, like give it back to the student. And what we did was we trained the students to say, why thank you in a really exaggerated tones and then like hand the monkey a piece of food - OK? - so like a little apple slice. One undergraduate came to be known to the monkeys as like the apple undergraduate. If you gave that person a coin, they would always, like, hand you an apple slice. Another person was the pineapple undergraduate. And another person was the orange slice undergraduate. Now, what's amazing is you do this for about six months - all right? - nonstop for about six months. And eventually you start to realize that the monkeys understand that this is Fiat money - right? Now, what does that mean? Well, what that means is, you know, the monkeys had been very familiar with, like, basic ideas, like there's a lever on the wall. If I pull this lever, an apple slice falls from the ceiling. But money is something fundamentally different. When I find this coin - all right? - it's not just an apple lever. It's actually a choice between an apple lever, an orange lever, and a pineapple lever because I can take this coin, I can carry it around with me, and I can wait until the - if I feel like having an apple, I've got to run over to the apple person and I can spend it there - right? Money is kind of fungible across different kinds of food that I can purchase. So we started to see that. We saw that monkeys started to use these with each other, and to save them, to kind of hide them from other monkeys and then to make very, very rational decisions, rational-looking decisions. When the price of apple doubled, you know, when that apple undergraduate started only giving one piece of apple, not two, when you handed him a coin, you know, demand for apples went down and demand for oranges and for pineapples went up. VEDANTAM: How did the monkeys protect their money? CHEN: A fascinating component of the monkeys starting to understand money was that they displayed signs that they realized not only that they understood the value of this disc but that they understood other monkeys recognized the value of this disc. So, for example, you know, early on when the money that we were using was these physical disks, it's a little bit hard to shield from other monkeys - right? And you don't want to be kind of carrying all of these things around. So you would see monkeys, like, hide the discs, like, you know, over in the corner, under a pile of, like, wood shavings - right? They'd kind of hide the discs. Later, actually, we taught these monkeys to use touchpads. And so, like, then kind of in some sense, like, monkeys learned, you know, to use currency as if it's just kind of an ATM, as if it just gets, like, Venmoed or transferred to other players, to the apple guy. . . VEDANTAM: So this is like an Apple wallet basically? CHEN: Yeah, basically. They are ahead of us on this dimension. You know, they are a completely cashless economy at this point. VEDANTAM: You eventually got to the point where you would also introduce to the monkeys the idea that sometimes when they would give a certain amount of money to an experimenter, the experimenter might give the monkey three things. And sometimes the experimenter might give the monkey one thing. So in other words, it was unpredictable what the reward was going to be. You taught the monkeys to gamble. CHEN: Yeah, that's basically exactly what we did. So we introduced them to two new undergraduates. So one undergraduate would always approach a monkey with three pieces of apple in their outstretched hand. Let's call this undergraduate Adam - OK? - would show three, and either give over all three or would it take two back and would only give one. Then we introduced him to another undergraduate, Ben, - all right? - who always showed one - OK? But if you gave Ben a coin, Ben would half the time hand over just that one, half the time would add two apple pieces to his hand and hand over three - all right? So now the fascinating thing is both Adam and Ben are presenting you exactly the same deal. They are a 50-50 gamble between three apple pieces and one apple piece - right? And you can give the monkeys  a lot of experience trading only with Adam and a lot of experience training only with Ben. So they kind of get that this is a 50-50 gamble. The interesting thing is what the monkeys showed us through their preferences between Adam and Ben is that they experience something just like humans do. And that's this very powerful psychological force called loss aversion - all right? And that's the idea that it's more than twice as painful to experience a loss than it is to experience a similar sized gain - right? Now, what does that have to do with Adam and Ben? Well, Adam half the time gives you, in some sense, what he's shown - right? - the three apple pieces. But half the time he delivers you a loss. He takes away two and then hands over only one - all right? So half the time, he delivers you a loss of two. Ben half the time just hands you the one that he is showing you and half the time delivers you a gain. He gives - he puts an extra two pieces of apple there and hands you an extra two apple pieces. What we find is that when given the choice between Adam and Ben, monkeys vastly prefer Ben, - all right? - the guy who initially only shows one apple piece but half the time gives you a gain, than they preferred Adam, who initially shows you three apple pieces and then half the time delivers you a loss. They - you know, 6 to 1 preferred trading with Ben to Adam. And that's fascinating because that cuts against their very, very core instinct, which is, well, if I have got a coin, why don't I go trade it with the guy who is showing me three instead of the guy who is showing me one - right? Like every kind of fiber in their body tells them that they should be going for more food, not less. And yet because of loss aversion and because they actually feel this very viscerally in the same way that people do, they actually prefer the guy who promises less but delivers more. VEDANTAM: I have to say that I am thinking about what I would do in that situation. And I have to say I'm clearly no smarter than a monkey because I would definitely prefer to trade with Ben because you are getting something that seems like it's a surprise. It's a gift. It's like - it's wonderful. It's unexpected. It's happy. And at the worst it's only going to be what he's promised you in the first place. But with Adam, he's taking away something that you thought was yours. CHEN: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And interestingly, we see in our Uber data this loss aversion at work as well. And you can even just feel it psychologically. Like when you are a rider and, you know, surge pricing hits, like that's a loss - right? And that feels very, very bad. We have often been asked, well, why didn't you frame surge pricing as discounts instead of as - instead of surcharges? Why isn't Uber's standard price twice as high as it is and then most of the time you're getting a discount - right? Why not kind of frame it that way? VEDANTAM: Because behavioral economics would predict that you would actually make people much happier if you did it that way. CHEN: Well, behavioral economics would predict that you would make riders happier if you did that. I mean, the critical thing to notice is that we are a two-sided market. That move, which would make riders happier, would also make drivers feel less well. So, I mean, so we had thought for a while, why not just frame Uber's pricing as how much cheaper we are than a taxi? Because in many major cities in the United States, we're up to 60 percent cheaper than taxi fares when we're not surging. And, you know, what that means is that, you know, you can surge like 2. 1 and still be coming basically out even if you had instead just taken a taxi. But even though because Uber drivers are in such an efficient system, they constantly have a paying rider in the back of the car, they are actually making more than they would have if they had been working as a taxi driver, framing this to them - oh, you're making 60 percent less per mile than you would if you were driving a taxi, that's - that would be a cost of this pricing system.

It spans India's border with Bangladesh, where three major rivers empty into the Bay of Bengal. This is a watery landscape of islands that grow and shrink with the tides. It is also home to hundreds of wild Bengal tigers. The men who protect this habitat put their lives at risk every day. Our colleague Ari Shapiro, who hosts All Things Considered, went to hear their story. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: This place is called the Sundarbans. It means beautiful forest. Locals kept telling me the tigers here are so stealthy if I see one it will only be as its jaws clamp down on my neck. They didn't smile when they said this. I went to meet some forest guards who know the danger firsthand. It was a long journey. Just a few minutes ago, I was walking along this trail about 5:30 in the morning, and the sun came up over the horizon in this huge orange ball like a harvest moon, but made out of fire. It's probably going to get up close to 100 today, and it's very humid. And here's our boat waiting at the water's edge. A handmade fishing boat is just motoring by in the dawn light. And this woman at the front in a gold and red sari is being illuminated. It's like she's glowing. We've turned up the small tributary, and now there's wildlife everywhere. There are all kinds of birds along the bank - a tall stork stalking for crabs and other food. There's a little, spotted deer on the riverbank just nibbling some greenery. This is classic tiger food, all brown with white speckles on its sides. Now all we need is to see the tiger eat it. We saw the prey, how about the predator? After about three hours on the boat, we are deep, deep in the forest. And we have arrived at a forest encampment where we're going to talk with some forest guards, rangers who have had run-ins with tigers. Hello, I'm Ari. DEBNATH MONDAL: Debnath Mondal. SHAPIRO: Very good to meet you. The men all wear khaki uniforms, long pants, even in the sweltering heat. They lead us is inside Netidhopani Camp. Oh, this is like the size of a football field. And there are elevated walkways, little concrete benches, a couple of benches. There's the lookout tower. There's a pond and lots of staff. There's a sign that says direct sighting of tigers at Netidopani Camp. So the most recent one was just yesterday, and it was just around high noon. We sit in the shade of a towering tree with the forest guard Debnath Mondal. His face is not quite right. A long scar runs from his right ear down his jaw. His mouth is pulled to the left near his cheek. I ask how many years ago he was attacked. And his answer is more specific than I expected. MONDAL: (Through interpreter) It was the 1 of June 2010 at 8:15 in the morning. SHAPIRO: Two weeks before, a team had gone out to attach a radio collar to a Bengal tiger. Debnath Mondal was the man who put the tracker on the animal. He believes the tiger remembered that and hunted him down. On the morning of June 1, the team left the camp to visit a nearby watering hole. MONDAL: (Through interpreter) We were about a dozen men. And we were going to take the data card out of the camera trap there. SHAPIRO: That morning, the radio collar on the tiger was sending GPS signals to a tracking center far away in northern India. If someone had been watching those signals, they would have seen the blip of the tiger on the screen, slowly creeping through the forest to the watering hole where the men were working. The forest guards stood in a circle, facing out, scanning the trees for movement. MONDAL: (Through interpreter) I saw the tiger coming in. Everyone shouted tiger. But before I could do anything, it pounced on me. It landed on my thighs and chest and bit my face and head. I had 80 stitches in my scalp. SHAPIRO: You're taking off your hat and showing the line on your scalp where the tiger bit you. MONDAL: (Through interpreter) I can no longer see out of my left eye or hear out of my left ear. SHAPIRO: The forest guards fought the tiger with their bamboo poles until it ran away. And they rushed their bleeding friend to a speedboat. They arrived at the hospital hours later. And three months after the attack, Debnath Mondal was back patrolling these jungles. Do you blame the tiger? Are you angry at it? MONDAL: (Through interpreter) No. We are here to save the tiger. It gives us life. I have to be careful and teach others to be careful. But I don't have any anger towards the animal. SHAPIRO: There are some people who, if they had been attacked by a tiger, they would say kill them all (laughter). Burn down the forest (laughter). They're terrible creatures. Why do you take a different approach? MONDAL: (Through interpreter) I believe that if the forest is destroyed, man will not survive. We have to save the forest, the tiger. The trees are our life. SHAPIRO: Some experts believe that here in the Sundarbans, climate change will lead to more tiger attacks. Bittu Sahgal is an Indian conservationist and editor of Sanctuary Asia magazine. He says consider that with every high tide, a huge amount of land in the Sundarbans disappears. Rising seas mean the land will shrink even more. BITTU SAHGAL: So tigers, people - everybody gets squeezed into smaller land areas. When fields and farms and residential areas get completely unusable and people try to move into tiger habitats, there is an inevitable clash going to take place. People will die. Tigers will die. SHAPIRO: Tonight on All Things Considered, we'll hear about an unusual program to try to prevent that from happening. In the Sundarbans of eastern India, I'm Ari Shapiro.

RAZ: Janine works with designers who want to find a better way to do things like lay floor tiles in an airport or insulate buildings. And she does this by looking at the natural world for design inspiration. It's an approach called biomimicry. BENYUS: It's literally a bridge between biology and design. It's innovation inspired by nature. RAZ: Which makes total sense, right? Innovation inspired by nature. But on the TED stage, Janine says in our day-to-day lives, we don't always see that connection. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BENYUS: I have this neighbor, and one time he came up to me - he was about 7 or 8 years old - he came up to me. And there was a wasps' nest that I had let grow in my yard. And he asked me how I had made the house for those wasps 'cause he had never seen one this big. And I told him, you know, Cody, the wasps actually made that. And we looked at it together, and I could see why he thought - you know, it was so beautifully done. It was so architectural. It was so precise. But it occurred to me how in his small life had he already believed the myth that if something was that well done that we must have done it? How did he not know - it's what we've all forgotten - that we're not the first ones to build? You know, we're not the first ones to process cellulose. We're not the first ones to make paper. We're not the first ones to try to optimize packing space or to waterproof or to try to heat and cool a structure. We're not the first ones to build houses for our young. What's happening now in this field called biomimicry is that people are beginning to remember that organisms - other organisms, the rest of the natural world - are doing things very similar to what we need to do. But, in fact, they're doing them in a way that have allowed them to live gracefully on this planet for billions of years. RAZ: I wonder - I mean, it seems like designers and inventors kind of always looked to nature for inspiration. Like you think of da Vinci or, you know, the Wright brothers. Like, they were looking at the natural world around them, and they were building things that mimicked them. BENYUS: You know, you just mentioned two of the biomimics. And there were not that many of them, to tell you the truth. Now, I think when you go way back, we practiced biomimicry. RAZ: Yeah. BENYUS: You know, we looked at the webs of spiders and said, you know, let's make fishing nets like this, right? RAZ: Yeah. BENYUS: We looked at the snowshoe hare, - the foot of a snowshoe hare and said, you know, let's make snowshoes like this. RAZ: Yeah. BENYUS: I mean, I think because our survival depended on noticing what works. RAZ: But as you said in your talk, it seems like we're going through a shift now - right? - like that more designers are paying much, much more attention to the natural world. BENYUS: They are. And what's interesting now is that the questions that designers are being asked to fulfill are very similar to what organisms in the natural world have had to do all along. You know, they've had to use local raw materials, and we want to use local raw materials. You know, they've had to make things that are easily upcycled back to their environment. We want to do that, too. So suddenly the playbook - nature's playbook - is like finding this amazing catalog of answers to the questions we're now asking. RAZ: I mean, so what are some examples? Like, what are some of the things that we're using right now that were inspired by things in nature? BENYUS: Well, for instance, every day people are walking through the airplane security things - that thing where you put your hands up over your head. And that is an acoustic camera that's based on the learnings from the Brazilian free-tailed bat and how it echolocates. RAZ: And there are tons and tons of examples like this, including a little beetle from Southern Africa. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BENYUS: This is a little critter that's in the Namibian desert. It has no fresh water that it's able to drink. But it drinks water out of fog. It's got bumps on the back of its wing covers, and those bumps act like a magnet for water. They have water-loving tips and waxy sides. And now kinetic and architectural firms are starting to look at this as a way of coating buildings so that they gather water from fog 10 times better than our fog-catching nets. How does nature repel bacteria? We're not the first ones to have to protect ourselves. This is a Galapagos shark. It has no bacteria on its surface, no barnacles. So how does it keep its body free of bacteria buildup? It doesn't do it with a chemical. It does it, turns out, with the same denticles that you had, you know, in - on Speedo bathing suits that broke all those records in the Olympics. But it's a particular kind of pattern. And the architecture of that pattern keeps bacteria from able to land and adhere. There's a company called Sharklet Technologies that's thinking about putting this on the surfaces in hospitals to keep bacteria from landing, which is better than dousing it with antibacterials or harsh cleansers that many, many organisms are now becoming drug-resistant. There are scientists in Cornell that are making what they call a synthetic tree because they're saying, you know, there's no pump at the bottom of a tree. Its capillary action and transpiration pulls water up a drop at a time. And they're creating - you can think of it as a kind of wallpaper - they're thinking about putting it on the insides of buildings to move water up without pumps. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: These are absolutely incredible examples. Like, you don't - I mean, I guess, you know, when you describe it, it makes perfect sense. But it also makes you wonder, like, why isn't this happening more? BENYUS: That's a really good question. And I - in part, it's simply because, you know, the people who make our world rarely take biology classes. Imagine if a mechanical engineer - the first class they took was, how does nature pump? RAZ: Yeah. BENYUS: You know? And they learned about whale hearts. Or how does nature distribute fluids? And they learned about the Murray's law and the perfect branching system and a perfectly efficient way to move fluids through tree branches and roots. That was their first class. But we teach people in great detail how humans have solved problems in the past, and we very much elevate those people. We admire those people. But when we look to the natural world, we don't have that same level of respect yet. RAZ: Yeah. When something is designed - right? - like, you can imagine that there's like focus groups and blueprints and tests and surveys done. But the cool thing about nature is it's totally unselfconscious, right? It just does what it does. And I wonder if there's something for humans to learn from that, you know - that risk-taking. BENYUS: Well, you know, it's exceedingly cautious during its lifetime. Organisms are exceedingly cautious. They really are paying attention to their surroundings on, like, a second-by-second basis. You know, how are the conditions now? How are the conditions now? And they're adapting themselves to those changing conditions all the time. We could learn a lot from that. But then the way life innovates over generations is the reshuffling of information from two beings, like sex. RAZ: Yeah. BENYUS: And the selection of which of those great ideas are going to get to go into the next generation is all about does it create conditions conducive to life? RAZ: Yeah. BENYUS: Is a conducive to life continuing? And that selection criteria is another thing that I don't think we quite have that yet. We need to start asking questions like will this product, will this process - or service or whatever it is we're inventing - will it allow life to continue? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BENYUS: The question is biomimicry is an incredibly powerful way to innovate. Life over 3. 8 billion years has made a lush, livable place for us. How can we do what life has learned to do, which is to create conditions conducive to life? Now, in order to do this - the design challenge of our century, I think - we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses and to somehow be in touch with these incredible models, these elders that have been here far, far longer than we have. And hopefully with their help, we'll learn how to live on this earth and on this home that is ours, but not ours alone. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Janine Benyus is the co-founder of the company Biomimicry 3. 8. You can see both of her TED Talks at TED. com. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MAKE IT BEAUTIFUL\")THE PHANTOMS: (Singing) You got to tear it down. You got to tear it down. Tear it all down. Sometimes you got to tear it all down to make it beautiful. RAZ: Hey, thanks for listening to our show on the Power of Design this week. Our production staff here at NPR includes Jeff Rogers, Brett Bachman (ph), Megan Kane (ph), Neva Grant (ph) and Sanaz Meshkinpour (ph), with help from Daniel Shukin (ph). Our partners at TED are Chris Anderson, Kelly Stoetzel and Janet Lee (ph). I'm Guy Raz, and you've been listening to Ideas Worth Spreading, right here on the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:  Today on the show, the Power of Design. And so far we've been talking about things designed by us, by humans. But that is only one part of the story. When did you start to sort of look around at all the things in nature, like a tree or a flower or a beehive and think, oh, my God, this is design. JANINE BENYUS: You know, I can't think of a time when I wasn't sitting in the grass watching ants go by. I mean, I was always that kind of a kid. RAZ: This is Janine Benyus. BENYUS: So I thought of the natural world as, you know, a community because I knew all the birds and butterflies and where they were nesting. I thought of them as a natural city in the sense and that all the inhabitants were really good at what they do. People think about the struggle of nature. It didn't seem like a struggle to me. RAZ: Yeah. BENYUS: Seems like they had it worked out. RAZ: And so if you were to describe in just one sentence what it is you do, what do you do?

I'm talking about water. That's one reason I head to Fort Collins, Colo. this week for the latest in a series of NPR events focused on important issues that we call our Going There series. Our event in Fort Collins is called The Future of Water. But first, we want to dig into a recent report by the World Bank that addresses climate change, water and economic growth. According to the report, the impact of climate change will be felt mainly through water. Water scarcity, already a problem, could dramatically slow down world economic growth, push more people to migrate and spark even more global conflict. But not all hope is lost. The report also says that potentially affected countries can mitigate the effects of water scarcity by taking action now to use water more efficiently. We wanted to talk more about this, so we called the lead author, World Bank lead environmental economist Richard Damania. And we reached him in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Mr. Damania, thank you so much for speaking with us. RICHARD DAMANIA: Thank you, Michel. MARTIN: What does this report pull together? What does it accomplish that previous ones have not, in your view? DAMANIA: I think there are two important things that this report highlights. The first is that as you suggested earlier - that the major impacts of climate change are felt through water, things like more intense rainfall, droughts, cyclones. Indeed, I'm here in Colombo and it's pouring with rain. And there's a threat of floods, which are unseasonal and unexpected. And that's one of the things that the report highlights. It also highlights that if you happen to have in some senses the misfortune of living in an area that's dry, most likely you're going to get even drier. Another important point - we all know that we need water to live, but seldom do we recognize that the economy also needs water. MARTIN: The report says that water scarcity exacerbated by climate change could cost some regions up to 6 percent of GDP. How did you arrive at that figure? DAMANIA: We combined a model of climate change with a hydrological cycle, and then we fed through what would be the likely consequences of climate change - shrinking, shriveling supplies of water - on economic growth. If you don't have the water and your business needs water, of course this is going to increase your costs. Costs go up, therefore growth tends to be affected by it. So it's quite logical. MARTIN: It is quite logical. I mean, in a way it seems as though it's an issue that's hiding in plain sight. DAMANIA: I think that's partly because we tend to take water for granted. We assume that it's so abundant. And we really are set for a somewhat different world to what we've been experiencing in the past. MARTIN: Now the report does call for three sort of overarching policy priorities to help lead countries to what you call climate-resilient economies. What would such a framework look like? How would such a thing occur? DAMANIA: So what the report tries to emphasize is that if you have a shortage of water, there's really only three things that you can do. You can try to increase the supply of water, but that's dreadfully expensive. Or you could go to really expensive solutions like desalination or water reuse. But a lot more effort needs to be spent on managing demand. Today, in a lot of countries that are water scarce, more water is lost through leaking pipes than is actually delivered to people in their faucets. We also observe that in a lot of countries that are awfully dry, we provide them with, say, irrigation and they tend to grow rice and water-thirsty crops where really - in deserts and arid regions where one shouldn't be growing those water-thirsty crops. So these are the kinds of shifts that need to actually happen. But they are long-term shifts, and we need to start preparing and making them. MARTIN: That was World Bank environmental economist Richard Damania speaking to us about his new report addressing water scarcity. It's called \"High And Dry: Climate Change, Water And The Economy. \" And we reached Richard Damania in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Mr. Damania, thank you so much for speaking with us.

Researchers recently tried to replicate a hundred experiments in psychology that were published in. . .

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: And found that most of them could not be reproduced with the same results. In the fact, depending on. . . SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST: Welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Today, we're going to talk about what has been called a replication crisis in science. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: The replicators in this recent study failed to get the same findings from the original experiment. VEDANTAM: From cancer medicine to psychology, researchers are finding that many claims made in scientific studies fail to hold up when those studies are repeated by an independent group. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Later in this episode, we're going to explore one provocative study that looked at stereotypes about Asians, women and math tests and explain what happened when researchers tried to reproduce the finding. We're going to use this story to explore a deeper question. What do scientists really mean when they talk about the truth? Before we get to that story, I want to give you some context. The crisis has actually been a long time coming. In 2011 for example, Dutch researchers claimed that broken sidewalks encourage racism. They published their findings in one of the most prestigious academic journals, Science Magazine. A couple of years later, another article in Science showed that when a gay person shows up at a stranger's door and speaks openly about what it's like to be gay, this has an extraordinary fact. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: It was a personal connection between the gay person who they were trying to show, you know, there in person and. . . VEDANTAM: People who are against gay marriage changed their minds after these emotional encounters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: It was the combination of, you know, contact with a minority coupled with a discussion of issues pertinent. VEDANTAM: The results were written up in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post. They were featured on public radio programs such as the clip you're hearing on Science Friday. Finally in 2009, researchers claimed that bilingualism, the ability to speak more than one language, is better for your brain. All these claims had serious problems. The Dutch claim was based on fabricated data. One author of the gay marriage claim asked for the paper to be withdrawn after concerns were raised about fraud. Both claims were retracted. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Might be true, might not. We don't know because it turns out the researchers made up the data. VEDANTAM: The bilingual advantage paper wasn't fabricated, but it was missing important context. The researchers had conducted four experiments. Three failed to show that bilingualism was better for the brain. Only one experiment showed a benefit. It was the only one that was published. Angela de Bruin was on the team that worked on the bilingual advantage study. ANGELA DE BRUIN: It is troubling 'cause we like to believe that what we see is actually at its truth. But if it's only half of the results we find and we're in fact hiding the other half of the results, then we'll never really find out what's going on. VEDANTAM: At the University of Virginia, psychologist Brian Nosek decided something had to be done. Brian felt the problem was that too many researchers and too many scientific journals were focusing on publishing new and unusual findings. Too few were spending time crosschecking earlier work to make sure it was a solid. BRIAN NOSEK: One of the key factors of science is that a claim becomes a credible claim by being reproducible, that someone else can take the same approach, the same protocol, the same procedure, do it again themselves and obtain a similar result. VEDANTAM: Brian launched an effort to reproduce dozens of studies in psychology. He published a report in 2015. NOSEK: We found that we were able to reproduce the original results in less than half of the cases across five different criteria of evaluating whether a replication was successful or not. VEDANTAM: Over the last year, there have been many debates about what this means. Some critics say it proves that most studies are worthless. At many universities, researchers feel it's their integrity, not just their scientific conclusions, that are being called into question. At Harvard University, psychologist Dan Gilbert recently published a paper calling Brian's conclusions into question. DAN GILBERT: So I think we just have to use our heads to figure out which kinds of things we expect to replicate directly and which kinds of things we would only expect a conceptual replication. And we need to calm down when we don't see direct replication and ask whether we really should have expected it at all. VEDANTAM: To unpack all of this, let's take a detailed look at one study and what happened when researchers tried to replicate it. I think this story reveals many truths about the ongoing controversy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: When they were graduate students at Harvard, Todd Pittinsky and his friend Margaret Shih often went to restaurants together. They went for the food, but they also spent a lot of time observing human behavior. TODD PITTINSKY: We often after class would go to The Cheesecake Factory. And she would order a strawberry shortcake. And I would typically order a salad. And the number of times that the salad was delivered to her and the strawberry shortcake was delivered to me - she also likes regular Coke, and I'm a diabetic. So I drink Diet Coke. And without fail, the Diet Coke would go to her and the regular Coke would go to me. VEDANTAM: The waiters were stereotyping Todd and Margaret. The guy was probably ordering the less healthy stuff. The woman was ordering salads and diet drinks. Todd and Margaret knew there was lots of research into the effects of such stereotypes. Now, getting a dish you haven't ordered is one thing. But there are more serious consequences. Stereotypes can be hurtful. They can affect performance. But as Todd and Margaret observed the waiters, they realized something was missing in the research. The previous studies had focused on the negative consequences of stereotypes. Could stereotypes also work in a positive fashion? PITTINSKY: We thought if we really want to understand how stereotypes operate in the world, we can't simply look at half of it. VEDANTAM: The young researchers brainstormed how they might study the other half of the equation. The answer came to them as they were, yeah, eating together. PITTINSKY: We were sitting in Harvard Square over ice cream. And we said what we needed is a group where the stereotypes go in very different directions. VEDANTAM: They wanted to study a situation where stereotypes could have both positive and negative effects. PITTINSKY: And Margaret, she happens to be an Asian-American and a woman. And we started talking about math identities. And we kept going back and forth and back and forth. And then literally, at the same moment, we said, well, why don't we study Asian women and math? VEDANTAM: The experiment they designed was ingenious and simple. There are negative stereotypes about women doing math and positive stereotypes about Asians and math. So what happens when you give a math test to women who are Asian? PITTINSKY: We hypothesized that when you make different identities salient, you should expect different stereotypes to be applied. VEDANTAM: Todd and Margaret figured that if they reminded Asian women about their gender, they would see the negative stereotype at work. But what would happen if they subtly reminded the volunteers about their Asian identity? The researchers recruited Asian women as volunteers and asked some of them to identify their gender on a form before taking a math test. Earlier research had shown that when you make gender salient in this way, this triggers the negative stereotype about women and math. Todd and Margaret reminded other volunteers, selected at random, about their Asian heritage. They wanted to make these volunteers remember the stereotype about Asians being good at math. After all the volunteers finished the test, the researchers analyzed their performance. Todd was walking down the hall from Margaret one day when he heard her call out to him. PITTINSKY: She just shouted, holy cow, it worked (laughter). So I just sort of ran down there, and we started looking at the output together. VEDANTAM: The study found that when the volunteers were reminded that they were women, they did worse on the math test. When they were reminded that they were Asian, they did better. Same women, same math test. Negative stereotype, negative result, positive stereotype, positive result. The study was an instant sensation. Psychologist Brian Nosek. NOSEK: This is one of my favorite effects in psychological science. Something that seems like it shouldn't be flexible, how well we perform in math, is flexible as a function of the identities that we have in mind and stereotypes associated with those identities - Asians being good at math, women being not as good at math. VEDANTAM: The study quickly became a staple of college textbooks, says psychologist Carolyn Gibson. CAROLYN GIBSON: It is a pretty amazing finding. And I heard about that study for the first time as an undergrad. It's been used as an example in social psychology courses for years since it was published in 1999. And it's been used as a good example for stereotype threat and stereotype boost. VEDANTAM: But from a scientific perspective, there was one big problem. GIBSON: It had never been replicated exactly. Somebody had never followed their steps that they followed and replicated their results. But it's been used to support further studies many times over the past 15 years. VEDANTAM: Brian Nosek agreed. Someone needed to replicate the original study. He was spearheading a mammoth effort to reproduce dozens of studies in psychology. Along with a panel of reviewers, he selected this study for replication and asked Carolyn Gibson at Georgia Southern University to conduct it. Brian wanted the replication to closely match the conditions of the original study. If you don't do that, you really are conducting two different studies. After launching the replication, he had second thoughts about its location in the South. NOSEK: And the reviewers thought, this looks like a case where the location might matter. Asians in the Southern U. S. might be a more distinct minority than Asians in the Northeast or in the West. And so we recruited a second team to do a replication simultaneously at UC Berkeley in a West Coast University where Asians are much more prominent members of the community. VEDANTAM: The team in Berkeley was headed by Alice Moon. Alice was a fan of the original paper. ALICE MOON: When I heard about it, I just thought it was, like, one of the very cool demonstrations in social psychology. And so that's why I always liked this paper. VEDANTAM: She followed the protocol of the original Harvard experiment. She recruited Asian women, reminded them of the female side of their identity or the Asian side of their identity and then gave them a math test. So what happened? MOON: When we compared, just as the original paper did - when we compared the participants who were in the Asian identity salient condition with the participants in the female identity salient condition, we found that there was no difference in their math performance. VEDANTAM: The celebrated study failed to be replicated. When Brian Nosek announced the finding about this and dozens of other studies that could not be replicated, it caused an uproar. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: In social psychology did not hold up. . . VEDANTAM: Newspaper articles called it a crisis. Critics held accusations about fraud and scientific misconduct. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Seems to be running into some problems. VEDANTAM: In a 6,000-word cover story, the conservative magazine Weekly Standard said that liberals had been making up research into how stereotypes affect women and people of color. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: The Berkeley study, however, was not the only replication of Todd Pittinsky and Margaret Shih's paper. Remember how Brian had two groups conduct replication? I asked Carolyn Gibson at Georgia Southern University what she found when she ran the experiment on Asian women in math. GIBSON: When primed with Asian identity, Asian females did better on a math test compared to those who had been primed with their female identity. And then those primed with their female identity did significantly worse. VEDANTAM: Carolyn has no doubt about the meaning of what she found. GIBSON: I believe that it further supports the original finding and that it gives even more robust evidence to this idea mostly because we followed the same method as the original study and because we collected more participants. And so we have a more powerful study. VEDANTAM: At Berkeley, Alice isn't sure. MOON: I do believe that stereotypes, in general, do have effects on our lives. But in terms of this particular finding about whether stereotypes can facilitate people's academic performance, I guess it has made me question whether or not that finding is true. VEDANTAM: OK, so which is it? Should we trust the results of the Berkeley study and say that Todd Pittinsky and Margaret Shih's finding was disproved? Should we trust the Georgia study and say the finding was confirmed? What happens when scientific studies disagree with one another? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: The popular narrative of the replication crisis suggests that scientists are like dueling gladiators. If two scientists come up with different findings, it must mean one of them is wrong. Or worse, one of them must have faked her data. When we come back, we look at why this idea misunderstands how science actually works. PITTINSKY: Our statistical techniques are probabilistic and not definitive. And so we absolutely need replications. But replications in our current academic climate are also serving the purpose of trying to vet out academic fraud and are serving as a detection technique. And those two are very different missions for replications. VEDANTAM: Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. We're taking a look today at how science works and the so-called replication crisis in the social sciences. As I listened to the news reports, I found myself drawing an analogy with my own profession, journalism. Here's what I mean. A Few years ago, a reporter for The New York Times was caught fabricating stories. Instead of traveling to various locations and interviewing people, he simply made stuff up. The newspaper went back and re-reported the stories Jayson Blair had written. When the facts didn't match, the reporter was fired. Imagine for a second what would happen if we re-reported every story by every reporter at The New York Times. Even when reporters are doing a perfectly good job, the older news stories might not match. A source might not say exactly the same thing again. Sometimes if the circumstances have changed, a source might say something completely different. So when two reporters don't produce the same story, it could be that one of them is making stuff up. But much more likely is that both of them are right. Now, I know what you're thinking. Journalism is storytelling. Science is about data. But let's look closely at what happened in the replications that Carolyn Gibson and Alice Moon did of Todd Pittinsky's study. In the original study, women administered the experiment. In Georgia, the facilitator was also female. But in Berkeley, where the replication failed, both male and female facilitators administered the study. Could that have made a difference? ERIC BRADLOW: Let's be clear. So it was not an exact replication. So here's an example. It mentions clearly in the paper that - and I don't know whether this factor's important or not - that in one study, the experimenter gender were males. And in another study, the experimenter gender were females. I have no idea whether that's a factor that could explain the difference between the two studies. And so let's be clear about what - it's not an exact replication. VEDANTAM: This is Eric Bradlow from the University of Pennsylvania. He's eminently qualified to talk about this stuff. BRADLOW: Spent four years here at Wharton studying statistics and mathematics, went on to get my Ph. D. in statistics. And for the last 20 years, I've been applying statistical methods to lots of problems. But I consider myself a mathematical social scientist. VEDANTAM: Eric believes that requiring studies to achieve statistical application, to match more or less perfectly, before you conclude that either is true, is like requiring two reporters to cover a basketball game and come back with nearly identical stories. BRADLOW: Exact replication is one of those mythological ivory tower things that doesn't exist. What we really need to think about is if the study doesn't replicate, why doesn't it replicate? And even if it doesn't replicate exactly, it may actually reinforce the original finding. In other words, you may be more certain. . . VEDANTAM: This isn't just true about studies in psychology. Eric told me that NIH researchers once found that lab mice, given a sedative, took 35 minutes to recover. When the experiment was repeated, the mice took 16 minutes to recover. The scientists scratched their heads. It made no sense. It took a while to figure out that something that shouldn't have made a difference did. In between the two experiments, wood shavings in the animal cages were changed. Turns out that red cedar and pine shavings step up the speed at which the sedative was metabolized, birch or maple don't. This is not to say that repeating experiments is useless or pointless. It's incredibly valuable. But replications primarily help us understand the nuances around a phenomenon. They're not very useful as a tool to detect fraud. BRADLOW: Just 'cause you get different results doesn't mean you shouldn't trust them. Are they within a margin of error of each other? Are there other variables that would make it so that study done at University A and the study done at University B wouldn't yield exactly the same thing? I think that's a better way of looking at it than, say, if you don't get exactly the same results or even results that are very nearly the same, you can't trust them. I think that's a superficial level of science. I think you need to go below that. VEDANTAM: So when you yourself look at a study that has not replicated or you look at what's sometimes called a failed application, do you not at the back of your mind say, well, this disproves the first study? Do you actually never think that way? BRADLOW: Never's a long word. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). BRADLOW: Never's a strong word. You know, I'm thinking, I have to think of that James Bond movie when Sean Connery said, I will never do James Bond again. And then 15 years later, he came out with a movie called \"Never Say Never Again. \" No, I would never say that. But I would say the following. Let's imagine that you do a study and that you find that, you know, people that take an SAT prep course do 15 percent better on the SAT. And let's imagine, then, someone else does a study, and the answer's only 3 percent. Now, there's two possibilities. One is the first study, for whatever reason, overestimated the effect. That's entirely possible. And therefore, 3 present is less than 15 percent. But note, if you combine those two studies together, your finding might actually be stronger in the sense I'm now more sure that SAT prep helps performance on the SAT. Now, the effect size may shrink from 15 percent to 11 percent. But also notice I've possibly now doubled or tripled my sample size, so my uncertainty goes down. And now I may even be more sure that SAT prep helps, maybe not to the degree that it helped in the first study. But still, I'm more sure that it's actually effective. VEDANTAM: When you think about different branches of science, though, aren't there branches of science where you can expect the same thing to happen very predictably over and over again? When you look at particle physics, for example, you would expect that if you fire, you know, 20,000 protons out of a gun, that they're basically going to do the same thing pretty much every time. BRADLOW: Well, it's been - you're testing the boundary of my memory. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). BRADLOW: . . . Of my particle physics class when I took it here at Penn. But my understanding is, of course, and this is what statisticians study, right? We study the concept of randomness. And so every science, every discipline, unless you're talking about an equal sign, like E equals MC squared. E doesn't approximately equal MC squared. It actually equals. Most physical laws and things aren't equals signs. There's approximate signs, and so that means there's randomness to it. I think if you fired 20,000 protons, you would see that there's a deviation in the way they collide with other particles, and there's randomness. I think the same thing is true in the social sciences. You bring in 500 subjects. You bring them in at University A. You bring them in at University B. There's randomness in people's answers. Of Course, you would hope the overall patterns would be similar. But the fact - this belief that you're going to get exactly the same findings, I'm not sure that's something science should be striving for. VEDANTAM: Any individual study is just that, an individual study. It isn't the truth. BRADLOW: Every observation is a point. It's a dot. And we observe dots. And then we observe more dots. And if those dots replicate, great, then we have more belief. Science is about the evolution of knowledge, might? VEDANTAM: But the process is never ending. There will always be more things to uncover, more nuances. BRADLOW: We get more certain about what it is we know. And we also get more certain about what are called boundary conditions or moderators like, for example, maybe this effect holds in urban areas versus not. Maybe it holds in California and not in Alabama. Maybe it holds for people that are - hold these stereotypes, and maybe it doesn't hold for people that don't. That's - to me, that's an advance of science. We have found what's called a main effect, which is, you know, stereotypes have an effect on outcomes or priming has an effect on outcomes. And then we say, oh, and by the way, it doesn't hold in these conditions. That's not a failure to replicate. That's a more nuanced view of the original finding. VEDANTAM: At Harvard, Dan Gilbert says you can expect some studies to replicate nearly perfectly every time. But in other cases, the very thing you're studying is changing. So exact applications aren't possible. GILBERT: There are many findings in psychological science that we would expect to replicate quite exactly years later and on different populations. Eyeblink conditioning is a very nice example. If I blow in your eye enough, you're going to start blinking as I purse my lips. And that's not going to be very different across cultures, across times, across age groups. Other kinds of findings certainly are. There's one of my favorite experiments in social psychology shows that when young men who are from the North or the South of the United States are insulted, they react very differently because Northerners and Southerners have very different codes of honor. Now, you can't take that experiment and expect to do it in Italy or expect to do it 25 years from now. It's an experiment that's of its moment and of its time. VEDANTAM: Every researcher I spoke with told me there's lots of agreement within the scientific community. There are certainly many scientific studies that are poorly designed. There are researchers who do shoddy work. There is great pressure at universities and scientific journals to publish striking findings. But the solution to all these problems, say Eric Bradlow, Brian Nosek and Dan Gilbert, is more and better science. Eric Bradlow. BRADLOW: The truth will come out. More dots will come out. And if it turns out that what I published - it's not because I did anything fraudulent - just isn't true because of sample size, the way I collected the data, then, you know what? Science will eventually figure out that what I'm saying is not true. So if you'd like. . . VEDANTAM: Brian Nosek is bemused that his findings about replicability have been taken to mean that the studies that failed to reproduce are worthless. He started a new system where researchers register protocols for their studies and commit to sticking to them. Scientific journals commit to publishing the findings of these studies regardless of whether the results are sexy. NOSEK: Science is the slow march of accumulating evidence. And it's very easy to want a simple answer. Is it true? Is it false? But really, replication is just an opportunity to accumulate more evidence, to get a more precise estimate of that particular effect. VEDANTAM: To most people, the debate over scientific truth is an abstract issue. Most of us turn to scientist for answers. Should I drink a glass of red wine in the evening? Is this drug safe to give to my ailing mother? Should I give my kid a dollar every time she does something well at school? In reality, science is more in the question business than the answer business. There's a reason nearly every scientific paper ends with a call for more research. Especially when it comes to human behavior, nearly every conclusion you can draw about human beings has tons of exceptions. Are people selfish? Yeah, except millions act altruistically every day. Are humans kind? Yes, except that few species are capable of greater cruelty. If you want answers that never change, definitive conclusions and final truths, odds are you don't want to ask a scientist.

Researchers recently tried to replicate a hundred experiments in psychology that were published in. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: The Center for Open Science recruited colleagues from around the world to try and replicate a hundred studies. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: And found that most of them could not be reproduced with the same results. In the fact, depending on. . . SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  Welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Today, we're going to talk about what has been called a replication crisis in science. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: The replicators in this recent study failed to get the same findings from the original experiment. VEDANTAM: From cancer medicine to psychology, researchers are finding that many claims made in scientific studies fail to hold up when those studies are repeated by an independent group. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Later in this episode, we're going to explore one provocative study that looked at stereotypes about Asians, women and math tests and explain what happened when researchers tried to reproduce the finding. We're going to use this story to explore a deeper question. What do scientists really mean when they talk about the truth? Before we get to that story, I want to give you some context. The crisis has actually been a long time coming. In 2011 for example, Dutch researchers claimed that broken sidewalks encourage racism. They published their findings in one of the most prestigious academic journals, Science Magazine. A couple of years later, another article in Science showed that when a gay person shows up at a stranger's door and speaks openly about what it's like to be gay, this has an extraordinary fact. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: It was a personal connection between the gay person who they were trying to show, you know, there in person and. . . VEDANTAM: People who are against gay marriage changed their minds after these emotional encounters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: It was the combination of, you know, contact with a minority coupled with a discussion of issues pertinent. VEDANTAM: The results were written up in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post. They were featured on public radio programs such as the clip you're hearing on Science Friday. Finally in 2009, researchers claimed that bilingualism, the ability to speak more than one language, is better for your brain. All these claims had serious problems. The Dutch claim was based on fabricated data. One author of the gay marriage claim asked for the paper to be withdrawn after concerns were raised about fraud. Both claims were retracted.

Three failed to show that bilingualism was better for the brain. Only one experiment showed a benefit. It was the only one that was published. Angela de Bruin was on the team that worked on the bilingual advantage study. ANGELA DE BRUIN: It is troubling 'cause we like to believe that what we see is actually at its truth.

VEDANTAM: The celebrated study failed to be replicated. When Brian Nosek announced the finding about this and dozens of other studies that could not be replicated, it caused an uproar. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: In social psychology did not hold up. . . VEDANTAM: Newspaper articles called it a crisis. Critics held accusations about fraud and scientific misconduct. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Seems to be running into some problems. VEDANTAM: In a 6,000-word cover story, the conservative magazine Weekly Standard said that liberals had been making up research into how stereotypes affect women and people of color. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: The Berkeley study, however, was not the only replication of Todd Pittinsky and Margaret Shih's paper. Remember how Brian had two groups conduct replication? I asked Carolyn Gibson at Georgia Southern University what she found when she ran the experiment on Asian women in math. GIBSON: When primed with Asian identity, Asian females did better on a math test compared to those who had been primed with their female identity. And then those primed with their female identity did significantly worse. VEDANTAM: Carolyn has no doubt about the meaning of what she found. GIBSON: I believe that it further supports the original finding and that it gives even more robust evidence to this idea mostly because we followed the same method as the original study and because we collected more participants. And so we have a more powerful study. VEDANTAM: At Berkeley, Alice isn't sure. MOON: I do believe that stereotypes, in general, do have effects on our lives. But in terms of this particular finding about whether stereotypes can facilitate people's academic performance, I guess it has made me question whether or not that finding is true. VEDANTAM: OK, so which is it? Should we trust the results of the Berkeley study and say that Todd Pittinsky and Margaret Shih's finding was disproved? Should we trust the Georgia study and say the finding was confirmed? What happens when scientific studies disagree with one another? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: The popular narrative of the replication crisis suggests that scientists are like dueling gladiators. If two scientists come up with different findings, it must mean one of them is wrong. Or worse, one of them must have faked her data. When we come back, we look at why this idea misunderstands how science actually works. PITTINSKY: Our statistical techniques are probabilistic and not definitive. And so we absolutely need replications. But replications in our current academic climate are also serving the purpose of trying to vet out academic fraud and are serving as a detection technique. And those two are very different missions for replications. VEDANTAM: Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. We're taking a look today at how science works and the so-called replication crisis in the social sciences. As I listened to the news reports, I found myself drawing an analogy with my own profession, journalism. Here's what I mean. A Few years ago, a reporter for The New York Times was caught fabricating stories. Instead of traveling to various locations and interviewing people, he simply made stuff up. The newspaper went back and re-reported the stories Jayson Blair had written. When the facts didn't match, the reporter was fired. Imagine for a second what would happen if we re-reported every story by every reporter at The New York Times. Even when reporters are doing a perfectly good job, the older news stories might not match. A source might not say exactly the same thing again. Sometimes if the circumstances have changed, a source might say something completely different. So when two reporters don't produce the same story, it could be that one of them is making stuff up. But much more likely is that both of them are right. Now, I know what you're thinking. Journalism is storytelling. Science is about data. But let's look closely at what happened in the replications that Carolyn Gibson and Alice Moon did of Todd Pittinsky's study. In the original study, women administered the experiment. In Georgia, the facilitator was also female. But in Berkeley, where the replication failed, both male and female facilitators administered the study. Could that have made a difference? ERIC BRADLOW: Let's be clear. So it was not an exact replication. So here's an example. It mentions clearly in the paper that - and I don't know whether this factor's important or not - that in one study, the experimenter gender were males. And in another study, the experimenter gender were females. I have no idea whether that's a factor that could explain the difference between the two studies. And so let's be clear about what - it's not an exact replication. VEDANTAM: This is Eric Bradlow from the University of Pennsylvania. He's eminently qualified to talk about this stuff. BRADLOW: Spent four years here at Wharton studying statistics and mathematics, went on to get my Ph. D. in statistics. And for the last 20 years, I've been applying statistical methods to lots of problems. But I consider myself a mathematical social scientist. VEDANTAM: Eric believes that requiring studies to achieve statistical application, to match more or less perfectly, before you conclude that either is true, is like requiring two reporters to cover a basketball game and come back with nearly identical stories. BRADLOW: Exact replication is one of those mythological ivory tower things that doesn't exist. What we really need to think about is if the study doesn't replicate, why doesn't it replicate? And even if it doesn't replicate exactly, it may actually reinforce the original finding. In other words, you may be more certain. . . VEDANTAM: This isn't just true about studies in psychology. Eric told me that NIH researchers once found that lab mice, given a sedative, took 35 minutes to recover. When the experiment was repeated, the mice took 16 minutes to recover. The scientists scratched their heads. It made no sense. It took a while to figure out that something that shouldn't have made a difference did. In between the two experiments, wood shavings in the animal cages were changed. Turns out that red cedar and pine shavings step up the speed at which the sedative was metabolized, birch or maple don't. This is not to say that repeating experiments is useless or pointless. It's incredibly valuable. But replications primarily help us understand the nuances around a phenomenon. They're not very useful as a tool to detect fraud. BRADLOW: Just 'cause you get different results doesn't mean you shouldn't trust them. Are they within a margin of error of each other? Are there other variables that would make it so that study done at University A and the study done at University B wouldn't yield exactly the same thing? I think that's a better way of looking at it than, say, if you don't get exactly the same results or even results that are very nearly the same, you can't trust them. I think that's a superficial level of science. I think you need to go below that. VEDANTAM: So when you yourself look at a study that has not replicated or you look at what's sometimes called a failed application, do you not at the back of your mind say, well, this disproves the first study? Do you actually never think that way? BRADLOW: Never's a long word. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). BRADLOW: Never's a strong word. You know, I'm thinking, I have to think of that James Bond movie when Sean Connery said, I will never do James Bond again. And then 15 years later, he came out with a movie called \"Never Say Never Again. \" No, I would never say that. But I would say the following. Let's imagine that you do a study and that you find that, you know, people that take an SAT prep course do 15 percent better on the SAT. And let's imagine, then, someone else does a study, and the answer's only 3 percent. Now, there's two possibilities. One is the first study, for whatever reason, overestimated the effect. That's entirely possible. And therefore, 3 present is less than 15 percent. But note, if you combine those two studies together, your finding might actually be stronger in the sense I'm now more sure that SAT prep helps performance on the SAT. Now, the effect size may shrink from 15 percent to 11 percent. But also notice I've possibly now doubled or tripled my sample size, so my uncertainty goes down. And now I may even be more sure that SAT prep helps, maybe not to the degree that it helped in the first study. But still, I'm more sure that it's actually effective. VEDANTAM: When you think about different branches of science, though, aren't there branches of science where you can expect the same thing to happen very predictably over and over again? When you look at particle physics, for example, you would expect that if you fire, you know, 20,000 protons out of a gun, that they're basically going to do the same thing pretty much every time. BRADLOW: Well, it's been - you're testing the boundary of my memory. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). BRADLOW: . . . Of my particle physics class when I took it here at Penn. But my understanding is, of course, and this is what statisticians study, right? We study the concept of randomness. And so every science, every discipline, unless you're talking about an equal sign, like E equals MC squared. E doesn't approximately equal MC squared. It actually equals. Most physical laws and things aren't equals signs. There's approximate signs, and so that means there's randomness to it. I think if you fired 20,000 protons, you would see that there's a deviation in the way they collide with other particles, and there's randomness. I think the same thing is true in the social sciences. You bring in 500 subjects. You bring them in at University A. You bring them in at University B. There's randomness in people's answers. Of Course, you would hope the overall patterns would be similar. But the fact - this belief that you're going to get exactly the same findings, I'm not sure that's something science should be striving for. VEDANTAM: Any individual study is just that, an individual study. It isn't the truth. BRADLOW: Every observation is a point. It's a dot. And we observe dots. And then we observe more dots. And if those dots replicate, great, then we have more belief. Science is about the evolution of knowledge, might? VEDANTAM: But the process is never ending. There will always be more things to uncover, more nuances. BRADLOW: We get more certain about what it is we know. And we also get more certain about what are called boundary conditions or moderators like, for example, maybe this effect holds in urban areas versus not. Maybe it holds in California and not in Alabama. Maybe it holds for people that are - hold these stereotypes, and maybe it doesn't hold for people that don't. That's - to me, that's an advance of science. We have found what's called a main effect, which is, you know, stereotypes have an effect on outcomes or priming has an effect on outcomes. And then we say, oh, and by the way, it doesn't hold in these conditions. That's not a failure to replicate. That's a more nuanced view of the original finding. VEDANTAM: At Harvard, Dan Gilbert says you can expect some studies to replicate nearly perfectly every time. But in other cases, the very thing you're studying is changing. So exact applications aren't possible. GILBERT: There are many findings in psychological science that we would expect to replicate quite exactly years later and on different populations. Eyeblink conditioning is a very nice example. If I blow in your eye enough, you're going to start blinking as I purse my lips. And that's not going to be very different across cultures, across times, across age groups. Other kinds of findings certainly are. There's one of my favorite experiments in social psychology shows that when young men who are from the North or the South of the United States are insulted, they react very differently because Northerners and Southerners have very different codes of honor. Now, you can't take that experiment and expect to do it in Italy or expect to do it 25 years from now. It's an experiment that's of its moment and of its time. VEDANTAM: Every researcher I spoke with told me there's lots of agreement within the scientific community. There are certainly many scientific studies that are poorly designed. There are researchers who do shoddy work. There is great pressure at universities and scientific journals to publish striking findings. But the solution to all these problems, say Eric Bradlow, Brian Nosek and Dan Gilbert, is more and better science. Eric Bradlow. BRADLOW: The truth will come out. More dots will come out. And if it turns out that what I published - it's not because I did anything fraudulent - just isn't true because of sample size, the way I collected the data, then, you know what? Science will eventually figure out that what I'm saying is not true. So if you'd like. . . VEDANTAM: Brian Nosek is bemused that his findings about replicability have been taken to mean that the studies that failed to reproduce are worthless. He started a new system where researchers register protocols for their studies and commit to sticking to them. Scientific journals commit to publishing the findings of these studies regardless of whether the results are sexy. NOSEK: Science is the slow march of accumulating evidence. And it's very easy to want a simple answer. Is it true? Is it false? But really, replication is just an opportunity to accumulate more evidence, to get a more precise estimate of that particular effect. VEDANTAM: To most people, the debate over scientific truth is an abstract issue. Most of us turn to scientist for answers. Should I drink a glass of red wine in the evening? Is this drug safe to give to my ailing mother? Should I give my kid a dollar every time she does something well at school? In reality, science is more in the question business than the answer business. There's a reason nearly every scientific paper ends with a call for more research. Especially when it comes to human behavior, nearly every conclusion you can draw about human beings has tons of exceptions. Are people selfish? Yeah, except millions act altruistically every day. Are humans kind? Yes, except that few species are capable of greater cruelty. If you want answers that never change, definitive conclusions and final truths, odds are you don't want to ask a scientist.

You might say it's a car accident. Safety advocates want you to call it a car crash. Already places like Nevada, New York City and San Francisco have swapped the word crash for accident in their laws and policies. The New York Times reports this reverses nearly a century of cultural thinking. And to get some historical perspective on this clash of words, we've called Peter Norton. He's a historian at the Department of Engineering and Society at the University of Virginia. Welcome to the program. PETER NORTON: Thank you, Audie. CORNISH: Before we get to this history, what's the distinction between an accident and a crash that these safety advocates feel needs to be made? NORTON: Well, there's a lot of disagreement about that, but I think the advocates say that the word accident has a connotation that it's a chance event, something that's bound to happen; it's inevitable; it's not something that could ever be completely prevented. And I think they see it as absolving people of responsibility for their actions. CORNISH: And today we're very much used to hear and using the word accident. And you've found that this preference for accident was actually pushed in a public awareness campaign or campaigns in the early 1900s. Who was behind it, and what were they trying to accomplish? NORTON: Well, if you go back more than a hundred years ago, manufacturing was big, and manufacturing jobs were dangerous jobs. A lot of them were heavy machinery, belts turning at high speeds, lathes. All kinds of machinery like that could be very dangerous, and people got hurt. And when they got hurt, it was to the employer's advantage legally to call it an accident. CORNISH: So then the automobile comes along, and how does this industry embrace the concept? NORTON: For the auto industry, it was a complicated thing. I mean, they wanted people to be able to drive cars, and they wanted drivers to not have to bear an extraordinary burden of responsibility such that driving would become unattractive. At the same time, they didn't want reckless drivers creating a bad image for the entire industry, so the auto industry generally favored tough penalties for reckless drivers. But at the same time, they wanted to redirect responsibility to other street users like pedestrians. So a lot like the industrial safety people invented this cartoon character called Otto Know Better (ph), who was careless and getting injured, the pro-automobile people - manufacturers, auto clubs, auto dealers - invented caricatures of careless pedestrians because most of the people cars were killing then were pedestrians, not other people in cars. CORNISH: You know, upwards of 38,000 people were killed in deadly car crashes or accidents in 2015. That's according to the National Safety Council. And that was an 8 percent increase over the year before. Why does language matter? NORTON: Well, if we continue to define these calamities as accidents, they're easier to ignore because we think of them as the inevitable side effects of modern living. But if we can call them crashes, we can redefine them as something we can control. I'd like to mention the example of William Haddon. He was a traffic accident expert from a generation ago, and he saw as the biggest obstacle to diminishing the very high traffic fatalities of his time - he saw the biggest obstacle to that in language. People were calling these accidents, and he wanted to look at traffic accidents as the way a disease expert looks at disease - as something we can control. And the word accident defeats the whole notion that we can control this issue, and it's like a surrender before we've even started.

We know that. Some places, though, like south Florida are already feeling the effects. Streets are flooding more often, for example. As NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, there's a much more insidious threat from rising sea levels in Florida. And it's one that people can't see. The ocean is threatening the region's supply of fresh water. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: The city of Coral Gables has seen a lot of nuisance flooding lately. But the mayor, James Cason, says few people are paying much attention to the cause. JAMES CASON: I've never received an email in five years on sea level rise, which, for me, was just - I was flabbergasted. I asked other mayors in some series of meetings we've had. And they said, well, that's the same with us. JOYCE: Cason and other mayors are worried. Some of them are talking about building walls and sand dunes to hold back the ocean. The problem is - the ocean is actually penetrating underneath the land in south Florida. Walls and dunes can't stop that. And that invasion could drastically change life for people here and millions of others in south Florida. To understand why, I drove to the Everglades, a swampy wilderness the size of Delaware. A few miles in, I park on the shoulder of the road. There's an experiment going on here to understand what could happen as the ocean invades. It's tall sea grass to the horizon, a few twisted cypress trees and the pale blue sky. A guy with a mosquito net over his face is stirring water in a vat the size of a Jacuzzi. JOE STACHELEK: We're making, basically, artificial seawater here. JOYCE: Joe Stachelek and Tiffany Troxler from Florida International University are making salt water. They're pumping it out into the wetland. Troxler's experiment involves dosing the plants and soil with it - a preview of what the ocean could do. TIFFANY TROXLER: As sea level rises, the saltwater wedge moves inland. JOYCE: The wedge of seawater will move through the bedrock - yes, through rock. TROXLER: Our underlying rock is limestone. That limestone is very porous. It's almost like Swiss cheese in some areas. JOYCE: A rising sea increases the pressure of the ocean on the coastal bedrock. Eventually, the ocean wins and moves in. We walk out into the test site through the sawgrass and the underlying peat, which is a fancy name for muck. So I think the secret is to step on where the grass is, rather than where the muck is. That muck is rich stuff, though, full of nutrients and microorganisms that feed the river of grass. The team has laid a metal boardwalk over the peat so you can walk around without sinking up to your waist. Out here, the grass is patchier. In some places, the peat is slumping - collapsing downwards. TROXLER: When we start to lose the structure of the plants, essentially, this peat that's otherwise held together by roots becomes a soupy pond. JOYCE: What we were walking through. TROXLER: Yes. JOYCE: As salt water is hosed into the ground, the sawgrass plants actually pull up some of their roots. The plants look like teeth protruding from receding gums. This, says Troxler, could be the future of the Everglades. And here's the thing - the Everglades are like a sponge - a sponge that feeds the Biscayne Aquifer, a giant cell of fresh water that lies underneath the land. TROXLER: We get over 90 percent of our fresh water from the Biscayne Aquifer. JOYCE: Millions of thirsty people in south Florida draw their water from that aquifer. So if seawater seeps out from underneath, it's infiltrating and contaminating the freshwater aquifer as well as the Everglades above it. That's starting to worry some people like Julie Hill-Gabriel, who's the expert on the Everglades at the Florida Audubon Society. JULIE HILL-GABRIEL: What we do in the Everglades is a hundred percent going to affect you and your neighborhood. You know, when you turn on the tap - whether you have enough fresh, clean water. JOYCE: For millennia, fresh water flowed south to the Everglades, the largest flooded grassland in America. But that fresh water was diverted to irrigate agricultural fields and to keep it from flooding homes. Environmental groups like Audubon have been trying to restore the natural flow of fresh water to the Everglades, mostly to preserve wildlife there. But now, Hill-Gabriel says there's a new reason to repel the invading sea. Putting more fresh water into the Everglades sponge could push back the invading ocean. HILL-GABRIEL: It just really compounds the urgency to move that fresh water south because it's the No. 1 thing, really, we can do to help push off the salt water that's now moving inland. JOYCE: At least, that's the theory. It's one that Mayor Cason in Coral Gables wants his constituents to think about when they think about the Everglades. CASON: It's not just so they can go see the alligators. It's because they want to see - make sure the drinking water on which we all depend is not contaminated. JOYCE: Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

We went there to work with our member station KUNC for this latest in our live event series we call Going There. We're going to hear just a portion of that conversation with panelist Kathleen Curry. She's a former member of the Colorado state legislature and a member of a longtime ranching family. Patty Limerick, the Colorado state historian, was also with us. She's share of the board of the Center for the American West at the University of Colorado. Also with us, Roger Fragua, a member of the Pueblo Jemez tribe and president of a company to support Native Americans in the development of water and energy resources and Paolo Bacigalupi, the award-winning author of a futuristic novel called \"The Water Knife,\" which imagines a future defined by extreme water scarcity. And we started by talking about the idea of water as something to own, not just something to use, beginning with Kathleen Curry. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KATHLEEN CURRY: There are folks that have come into Colorado and people who've lived here a long time, they would like to see water used different ways than the way it's been used traditionally. The senior water rights are primarily for mining and agriculture, and that drives a certain amount of tension in Colorado. We hold senior rights on our creek. And if we aren't getting the amount of water that we're entitled to, we will call out the upper users and they will have to watch it go by. And it's a matter of financial welfare for our family. So it's a simple equation - if we can't divert enough water to produce enough hay, we can't feed our cattle. We don't make as much money. We can't pay the bills. It's about that. What you see happening in a lot of Colorado I think is this desire to use water for other purposes that really don't involve raising food. MARTIN: Patty, do you want to add to that? PATTY LIMERICK: I do. So the uses have layered on, and I'm going to say something that will cause me to drive home under the Witness Protection Program. . . (LAUGHTER)LIMERICK: . . . That in hindsight maybe installing conventional crop production in the American West wasn't the cleverest move. So - and I shall be - you won't recognize me when I leave here. I'll have a disguise on. And I will say I - as an American historian, as a citizen - I think agriculture and ranching are extremely vital and important elements of our culture. A lot of what we consider the beauty, the open space, the Purple Mountains majesty, the open plains, that's agriculture that keeps those plains open. And if we - for some reason, if we become a society that really prefers condos to open plains, we can go there. So when I go through the suburbs, I'm going to have to be in Witness Protection as well I guess on that. So as soon as you get a simple position, it means you haven't thought enough. So if you - which doesn't stop a lot of people. . . (APPLAUSE)LIMERICK: . . . From doing that. So that's an interesting. . . MARTIN: OK, but we have to dig into this because really this is where - where the rubber hits the road. I can't think. . . CURRY: Yeah. MARTIN: . . . Of a water metaphor. Sorry if I'm back east. Kathleen, look, most of the water in Colorado comes from the western slope, where you live. But most of the people are in the big cities on the east. Roger, I know you'll co-sign this - with few exceptions, some people in this country are told where to live, but the majority of people - the custom in the United States has been you can live wherever you want to live, right? So what has to happen if there's too many people for too little water, what has to happen? CURRY: I'm going to try to answer that question politely. I - I don't have a lot of sympathy for the newcomers. I'm sorry, I apologize but this is how the system works in Colorado, and the senior rights have priority. And if that were to be changed, it would have to be changed really with a constitutional amendment, not even just a statutory adjustment. So having said that, I understand that we need to work together. But here's one idea - and that would be to show good faith on both sides and make sure that if there's going to be a transfer of water from rural to urban, that at least the urban entities are using the water they have wisely. And. . . (APPLAUSE)CURRY: And maybe show a true commitment to growth management. We. . . MARTIN: And growth management means what? Everybody wants to live here can't, is that what that means? CURRY: No, no, I'm sorry. . . MARTIN: What does it mean? CURRY: . . . I should explain that. Growth management would mean perhaps smaller yards, less outdoor watering, more dense development versus sprawl that would use more water. That's what - out here - what kind of the catchphrase would be that - with growth management. Then you can have conversations about reallocating existing supplies, and those conversations would be much more civil because you could build more trust. MARTIN: Roger, I want to bring you back in. What do you think we need to be thinking about that we're perhaps not thinking about? ROGER FRAGUA: So I sit and I listened to the debate. When people talk about being last in the door and then shutting the door behind them, so we don't want any more newbies coming in behind us because we're - the pioneers are here. So if this Christian nation, right, under God really believes the book that it says - that God created this universe, he created plants, he created animals and then on the last day he created man, right? Then we're last; we're not first. The winged the finned, the four-legged, who's lobbying for them? This isn't about the economy. I mean, no disrespect for to our ranchers. I mean, we're ranchers, too. And water has multiple uses. And it is economic, but it can't be about the economy. It can't be about the mighty dollar because in the end, what's that dollar going to buy you? Water is life. And if you don't have water, you don't have life. And if you have money, so what? MARTIN: Paolo, you're our kind of big thinker here. We're all big thinkers; I'm just giving you a title. PAOLO BACIGALUPI: All right, I'll take it. I love it. My brain just expanded. . . MARTIN: Yeah. BACIGALUPI: . . . Or at least my ego. MARTIN: Well, I mean, Roger just told us that water is sacred in some of our cultures. But in others, why isn't it, in your view? BACIGALUPI: Well, I think in the United States, I think that we like to address our natural world as commodities, not as sacred objects. The entire point of invading the North America was to make a lot of money and to prosper. And so if you have to go worship the forest, then you can't cut them down and ship the timber places. MARTIN: So resources are something to subdue, not something with which we coexist. BACIGALUPI: Someone to extract. MARTIN: Extract. BACIGALUPI: Yeah, yeah. One of the things that I'm fascinated about specifically is the idea of empathy. The problem is - seems to be that we do have this sense of empathy, mostly for our present self and our personal self. One of the things I'm really interested in is whether or not there's a way for us to engage with the idea of our future self or our children's future self. If we can live inside of the shoes of that person 20 or 30 years out and what kind of world we hand off to them as if it's as important as we are in this moment, I think that we could start out actually having some actual successful conversations that would maybe allow us to innovate in positive directions. MARTIN: I thank you all so much. We've only just scratched the surface. We'll have to come back. We'll just have to come back.

That's where we try to understand stories we'll be hearing more about by parsing some of the words associated with them. This week, our word is ministerial. That's in reference to a conference happening this week in San Francisco. Energy ministers from 23 countries and the European Union are gathering for the Clean Energy Ministerial. U. S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz will be there for the ministerial, or as he calls it, the CEM, for its initials - C-E-M. ERNEST MONIZ: C-E-M - Clean Energy Ministerial, right. MARTIN: Yeah, that's not that catchy, I have to be honest. ERNEST MONIZ: (Laughter). MARTIN: I spoke to Secretary Moniz in advance of the week's meetings. He says the meeting is a way to follow up on last year's Paris climate accords. The idea is to encourage the global use of technologies that will save energy and reduce pollution. ERNEST MONIZ: The CEM is promoting the expansive use of LED lighting across the world. MARTIN: And, Secretary Moniz says, the meeting is also looking for ways to encourage businesses to adopt energy efficiency guidelines. ERNEST MONIZ: What's called the ISO 50001 standard for energy efficiency in industry. MARTIN: The secretary also told me that governments still have an important role to play in developing new environmentally friendly technologies. ERNEST MONIZ: Absolutely, the - I think the government role is often undersold. For one thing, the basic science that underpins just about any technology development typically is developed through federal funding of research performed by universities, laboratories and our companies. MARTIN: You know, on the consumer end what you hear people say - it's the cost, even with LED lighting. I mean, the upfront cost for consumers is still high. So I'm just wondering if there's some thought about or if part of this conference is making clean energy affordable enough to compete in the marketplace, especially for people who aren't just invested in the idea or who aren't rich. ERNEST MONIZ: Well, I think we do have to recognize that in some of the technologies - like LEDs, like solar, like onshore wind - we have seen pretty remarkable cost reductions in the last six, seven years. And we have seen as well very substantial upticks in their deployment. LED costs have dropped probably 90 percent in the last six or seven years. And in solar, we have between 10 and 20 times as much deployment because costs have come down between 50 and 60 percent. So we're making a lot of progress. But I think that we still must focus on continuing deployment in the near term and continuing innovation for the longer term. MARTIN: You know, I do have to ask because on Thursday, Donald Trump made his first policy address on energy and the environment, very much in the news. And this is what he had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: We're going to cancel the Paris climate agreement and stop all payments of the United States' tax dollars to U. N. global warming programs. MARTIN: So Mr. Secretary, I understand you wouldn't want to get into partisan politics. But I do have a factual question to ask you, which is that - does the president actually have that authority at this point? ERNEST MONIZ: While, first of all, let me reinforce the point that I will not comment on any candidate's position. But the Paris Agreement is not binding on targets. However, all the steps that have been taken are based upon existing authorities and following many-year processes spelled out in law to establish rules. If any president wants to change those, they will have to go through the same multi-year process to alter those. And so those will go forward unless, again, a new president and a new Congress decide to redo the entire processes of rulemaking. And I do not believe that there would be a lot of success in that attempt. So I believe what President Obama has put in place will keep us on our trajectory to meeting our Paris commitments. MARTIN: I understand that the meeting has not yet commenced, but I assume that you've been talking to your fellow ministers sort of all along. And I was just wondering what reaction - that you are getting as a representative of the United States in these talks to this kind of dialogue about canceling the United States' participation in it. Have you gotten any reaction to this so far? ERNEST MONIZ: In this arena - the climate talks - and in other areas that the Department of Energy is engaged in very heavily - like nuclear security, for example - I would say the current dialogue in the United States is causing some concern and some queries, shall we say, of my fellow ministers across the world. But again, I think the important response is as we just discussed. Here's what we are doing. Here is what is in place. Here is what is going to stay in place going forward into the next administration. MARTIN: That's Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz. He joined us from his offices at the Department of Energy in Washington, D. C. just days before he embarks on the Clean Energy Ministerial, a conference happening in San Francisco this coming week. Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for speaking with us. ERNEST MONIZ: Well, thank you Michel. I'm pleased to be here. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Now it's time for our regular segment Words You'll Hear.

It's a story about land that now holds houses, schools and malls. Some of that land has been re-used. And beneath those new buildings are abandoned oil and gas wells. Some residents are surprised to learn this. And safety concerns make this more than just a matter of curiosity. Here's Stephanie Joyce with Wyoming Public Radio. STEPHANIE JOYCE, BYLINE: Jeff Parsek lives in a neighborhood of cul-de-sacs and suburban ranch homes on the south side of Fort Collins, Colo. So it came as news to Parsek that state records show there's an abandoned oil and gas well in his driveway. JEFF PARSEK: Bought the house in 2004 and haven't had any concerns about oil wells or anything else. JOYCE: Confronted with similar news, several homeowners responded with curses and slammed doors. One yelled, thanks for ruining my afternoon. But when I asked Parsek if the news worried him. . . PARSEK: It really doesn't. If it started to emit something, then I might. But to this point, I'm not concerned. JOYCE: The trouble is it might be hard to know if the well were emitting something. When a well stops producing commercial quantities of oil and gas, companies abandon it, usually by filling the well with cement to stop the flow of gas and fluids. The industry considers that the end of the life of a well. MARK WATSON: It's not rocket science to plug these wells. JOYCE: That's Mark Watson, Wyoming's oil and gas supervisor. WATSON: It's a hole in the ground that's pretty deep. And, you know, you set cement. And cement lasts a long time. JOYCE: That firm belief that once a well is plugged, it's dead, means there's no systematic monitoring for leaks. We simply don't know what percent of abandoned wells are leaking. But we do know that at least in a handful of cases, it's happened. RICK KINDER: This lot was located off of Highway 12. . . JOYCE: Back in 2007, Rick Kinder was working for a contractor building a house in southern Colorado. They had just finished sealing the house, putting in all the doors and windows, and Rick and a colleague were working in the crawl space hanging insulation. KINDER: And we just heard this big roar, and then a big boom and it threw us against the walls. And it just blew the whole top of the roof off. JOYCE: Rick and his colleagues didn't know it, but they were building on top of an abandoned gas well that was leaking methane, an odorless and highly explosive gas. No one was killed in the explosion. But the blast sent Rick into cardiac arrest. He ended up having a quadruple bypass. KINDER: And I lost, probably, a third of my heart, the muscle. JOYCE: Rick had worked in the oil and gas industry for nearly 30 years. If anyone were going to recognize an old well site, it would be him. KINDER: There was no signs, no nothing there that would give us an indication that somebody had built there or had done some work. JOYCE: Across the U. S. , from Pennsylvania to Texas to California, there are millions of abandoned wells, their locations unmapped or poorly mapped. Rob Jackson is a researcher at Stanford University. He says keeping track of them is a low priority. ROB JACKSON: When a state sees a well is plugged, they typically put a checkmark by that well in a database or in a file somewhere. And they don't do anything for the most part. JOYCE: Unless a well starts leaking fluids or a house blows up, the assumption is that everything is fine. Jackson says it's partly an issue of states not having the resources to monitor. JACKSON: But I also think the states aren't that interested in some cases - in many cases, in the data. I'm not sure that they really want to know. JOYCE: In the Canadian province of Alberta, it's a different story. Theresa Watson is an engineering consultant and former Alberta energy regulator. Back in the early 2000s, she started pushing for better tracking, monitoring and regulation of abandoned wells as people started to move in to rural areas that were once oil and gas fields. THERESA WATSON: If you don't measure it, you don't know what kind of risk you have. I mean, ignorance is bliss, I guess. But I think most people will tell you that they'd want to know. JOYCE: Which is why Watson recommended not only monitoring abandoned wells near homes, but an outright prohibition on building on top of them. WATSON: From a public safety perspective, even a slow leak into a building can cause an explosion hazard. JOYCE: Alberta now has a 15-foot no-build zone around abandoned wells. But similar rules are lacking in most of the U. S. Even as we can see in places like the Front Range of Colorado, new development is encroaching on old oil and gas fields. State oil and gas regulators say the situation is out of their hands. Stuart Ellsworth is the engineering manager for the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. STUART ELLSWORTH: We'd really try to discourage construction on top of old wells. JOYCE: But he says any actual prohibition is up to local governments who permit development. In turn, many of those local governments see abandoned wells as the state's problem. KINDER: Somebody needs to be held accountable for it. JOYCE: That's Rick Kinder again, the construction worker who was injured in the well explosion. KINDER: To me, the most important thing is it doesn't happen to somebody else. It doesn't need to happen to somebody else. JOYCE: He says he doesn't care who ends up making rules about building on top of abandoned wells. He just wants somebody to do it. For NPR News, I'm Stephanie Joyce. CHANG: That story came to us from Inside Energy, a public media collaboration focused on America's energy issues. AILSA CHANG, HOST:  This next story takes us beneath your feet. It's a story about land that now holds houses, schools and malls. Some of that land has been re-used. And beneath those new buildings are abandoned oil and gas wells. Some residents are surprised to learn this. And safety concerns make this more than just a matter of curiosity. Here's Stephanie Joyce with Wyoming Public Radio. STEPHANIE JOYCE, BYLINE: Jeff Parsek lives in a neighborhood of cul-de-sacs and suburban ranch homes on the south side of Fort Collins, Colo. So it came as news to Parsek that state records show there's an abandoned oil and gas well in his driveway. JEFF PARSEK: Bought the house in 2004 and haven't had any concerns about oil wells or anything else. JOYCE: Confronted with similar news, several homeowners responded with curses and slammed doors. One yelled, thanks for ruining my afternoon. But when I asked Parsek if the news worried him. . . PARSEK: It really doesn't. If it started to emit something, then I might. But to this point, I'm not concerned. JOYCE: The trouble is it might be hard to know if the well were emitting something. When a well stops producing commercial quantities of oil and gas, companies abandon it, usually by filling the well with cement to stop the flow of gas and fluids. The industry considers that the end of the life of a well. MARK WATSON: It's not rocket science to plug these wells. JOYCE: That's Mark Watson, Wyoming's oil and gas supervisor. WATSON: It's a hole in the ground that's pretty deep. And, you know, you set cement. And cement lasts a long time. JOYCE: That firm belief that once a well is plugged, it's dead, means there's no systematic monitoring for leaks. We simply don't know what percent of abandoned wells are leaking. But we do know that at least in a handful of cases, it's happened. RICK KINDER: This lot was located off of Highway 12. . . JOYCE: Back in 2007, Rick Kinder was working for a contractor building a house in southern Colorado. They had just finished sealing the house, putting in all the doors and windows, and Rick and a colleague were working in the crawl space hanging insulation. KINDER: And we just heard this big roar, and then a big boom and it threw us against the walls. And it just blew the whole top of the roof off. JOYCE: Rick and his colleagues didn't know it, but they were building on top of an abandoned gas well that was leaking methane, an odorless and highly explosive gas. No one was killed in the explosion. But the blast sent Rick into cardiac arrest. He ended up having a quadruple bypass. KINDER: And I lost, probably, a third of my heart, the muscle. JOYCE: Rick had worked in the oil and gas industry for nearly 30 years. If anyone were going to recognize an old well site, it would be him. KINDER: There was no signs, no nothing there that would give us an indication that somebody had built there or had done some work. JOYCE: Across the U. S. , from Pennsylvania to Texas to California, there are millions of abandoned wells, their locations unmapped or poorly mapped. Rob Jackson is a researcher at Stanford University. He says keeping track of them is a low priority. ROB JACKSON: When a state sees a well is plugged, they typically put a checkmark by that well in a database or in a file somewhere.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. Millions of us try to lose weight every year. We go on diets, read books, buy pills off the Internet. Collectively, we spend billions of dollars trying to slim down. And the truth is, we might as well flush a lot of that money down the toilet. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: All those workouts, challenges and temptations. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: With thousands of diets out there, they've all chosen. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Jack was trying to teach me sugar equals pain. Yes, I was miserable. VEDANTAM: As they say in the infomercials, there must be a better way. This week, we're going to talk about psychological tricks we can play on ourselves to help us eat better and to follow through on our best intentions. ADAM BRUMBERG: My name is Adam Brumberg. I am the deputy director of the Cornell Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University. VEDANTAM: Adam Brumberg and his colleagues research food psychology. And they find that many of our food choices aren't really conscious choices. BRUMBERG: The majority of food decisions are based on habit or convenience. You know, habit being I did it yesterday. It worked out fine. I'm going to do it again. And convenience - well, I'm sitting at my desk, and there is, you know, a package of Ring Dings on the desk. And so I'm just going to eat that instead of going to find something that's healthier. VEDANTAM: Once you understand these bad, unconscious patterns, you could stay on guard, use will power to fight them. But there's also a smarter way. You could turn the tables and get these unconscious habits to work for you. BRUMBERG: Yeah, I mean, we like to say that the best diet is the one you don't know you're on. Our research shows you make about 200 food-related decisions a day, which is a lot. VEDANTAM: By food decisions, Adam doesn't just mean whether you eat a salad or a sandwich. It's also how much salt do you put on your food? Do you have a slice of cake when your coworker celebrates a birthday? Do you reward yourself for going to the gym with a cookie? Here's one example of how you can turn the tables on your unconscious habits. Adam and his colleagues find that volunteers in lab experiments make worse choices when they're stressed. BRUMBERG: The stressed-out folks were more likely to buy a desert or to select a fried item as opposed to the people I asked to think of things they were grateful for, they were more likely to get salad or grilled chicken or, you know, whatever it was. VEDANTAM: Once you understand how stress shapes mindless eating, you can set up a system when you're not stressed that allows you to take advantage of this tendency. BRUMBERG: If you pack a lunch the night before, you're definitely going to put together something that's a lot more healthful than if you are, you know, doing it as you're running out of the house in the morning. VEDANTAM: Now, Adam Brumberg says, when you're stressed out at work and mindlessly reaching for something to eat, your hand's going to come up with a carrot rather than a Ring Ding. BRUMBERG: You have to work really hard to eat too many baby carrots. VEDANTAM: We decided to devote this whole episode to ideas like this. Coming up in a moment, senior Stopwatch Science correspondent Dan Pink and I are going to trade psychological tricks that might help your actual waistline look like the one you want. DANIEL PINK, BYLINE: Behavioral science has given us lots of tricks for eating less - smaller plates, smaller portions - but a new study this year in the Journal of the Association of Consumer Research offers another option, larger tables. VEDANTAM: So pull up a chair and a big table and stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: If you love listening to HIDDEN BRAIN, you're going to want to check out the new Code Switch podcast.

Summer is around the corner, which means beaches and swimsuits are around the corner, too. Today, with a view to getting myself into beach-ready shape, I've asked Daniel Pink to come in to trade psychological tricks on how to eat better. We're also going to look at some surprising factors that make us eat worse. Dan, of course, is our senior Stopwatch Science correspondent, or actually I should say our svelte senior Stopwatch Science correspondent. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Welcome, Dan. PINK: Thank you, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Now, I would say my body is beach ready on the radio. What about yours, Dan? PINK: You know what? I don't really think in those terms. I tend to go out in public fully, if not heavily clothed. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: All right. Now, as you know on Stopwatch Science, Dan and I give one another 60 seconds to summarize interesting social science research. As we approach the 60-second mark, our producers will bring up the music just like they do at The Oscars. Dan and I will each present three different pieces of social science research. We'll also spend a little more time between the segments unpacking the signs and its implications. Our topic today is dieting and the many ways in which hidden and unconscious factors shape our diets. Dan, if you're ready, your first 60 seconds starts now. PINK: Behavioral science has given us lots of tricks for eating less - smaller plates, smaller portions - but a new study this year in the Journal of the Association of Consumer Research offers another option, larger tables. VEDANTAM: What? PINK: Yes. For these experiments, researchers got a bunch of pizzas and a bunch more college students. They found that students consumed the least amount of pizza when they were served small slices on a large table. It sounds weird, but there's a good explanation. When students saw the small slices on a tiny table, they quickly noticed just how measly those slices were. So, of course, they grab more. But when those same small slices were on a big table, their attention shifted away from the smallness of the pizza slices and toward the largeness of the table. On a large table, the small slices seemed not so measly after all. So students didn't feel the need to pile as many on their plate and ended up consuming less pizza over all. The lesson here, large tables may prevent large people. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). All right, Dan. I have a question. PINK: Yes. VEDANTAM: So are the researchers saying that the fact that we see these pizza slices differently on small tables versus large tables, are they saying this is because of an optical illusion? PINK: A little bit of an optical illusion. The way our vision works is that we don't see things in absolute terms. We see them in relative terms. So when you have small slices on a tiny table, you can actually see how small those slices are. But on a big table, everything looks about the same size because there's greater contrast. Therefore, people on the big table will eat the small slices. They'll eat fewer of them and consume less pizza in total. VEDANTAM: That makes sense. PINK: So, Shankar, you and I are sitting here at a large table ourselves. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: So why don't you give us a small idea? VEDANTAM: I'm going to give you a small portion of an idea, Dan. PINK: (Laughter) A small slice. VEDANTAM: It's going to fit in 60 seconds. It turns out it isn't just the size of your dining table that influences how much you eat. Your dining companions might make a difference, too. I did a story about this for NPR some time ago. Molly Allen-O'Donnell told me that when she was a graduate student at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, she sat down at a college cafeteria and looked at how much food people bought for lunch and dinner. She noticed that when women sat with other women, they ordered an average 833 calories of food. When they sat with men, they ordered only 721 calories. So women ate more when they ate with women, and they ate less when they ate with men. Now, what about men? I hear you asking the question, Dan. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: What about men? When men sat with other men, they ordered 952 calories. But when they sat with women, they ordered 1,162 calories. PINK: Oh, my God. VEDANTAM: So another way to put this is both men and women ate more when they ate with women, and both men and women ate less when they ate with men. Now, I'm sure we're going to talk about why this might be the case, Dan. But I want to take a moment to shout out to every overweight, married, heterosexual man who is listening. The next time your wife tells you to lose a few pounds, you might want to say, honey, it's your fault. (LAUGHTER)PINK: Oh, nice, nice. You know, I think it's interesting. The takeaway for me is that if you want to lose weight, eat with men. VEDANTAM: I think that is one. . . PINK: But why is that? Why. . . (LAUGHTER)PINK: Why do men eat so much around women? VEDANTAM: I don't think the study conclusively answers that question, Dan. There was a related study that I saw by Kevin Kniffin at Cornell University. He and his colleagues found that men eat 93 percent more pizza and 86 percent more salad when eating with a woman compared to eating with a man. So it isn't just eating more unhealthy food. It's just eating more food in general. Now, other studies have shown that heterosexual men in general tend to pursue more risky behaviors in the presence of women. Studies show that mixed sex groups, for example, make more risky financial decisions. So it's possible that men are acting out some kind of evolutionary script by eating more food and demonstrating they're capable of riskier behavior. PINK: So they lose their inhibitions. They show, I'm a big risk-taker who can go out there and slay that saber-tooth tiger. VEDANTAM: Exactly. PINK: So, for my experience, back - many, many years ago, I would just be so psyched that a woman would be willing to eat with me. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: . . . That I would probably lose my inhibitions - start gorging on pizza. VEDANTAM: You know, it may be that men who are able to eat a lot of food may have signaled some kind of evolutionary fitness in our ancient past. Now, of course, when food is so plentiful today. . . PINK: Right. VEDANTAM: . . . It might signal something else altogether. PINK: A lack of fitness. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: All right, let's see if you can signal to me that you can stick to your time, Dan. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Your next 60 seconds starts right now. PINK: You are what you eat. We've all heard that. But this next study shows you are also when you eat. Researchers at Tel Aviv University's medical school randomly assigned 93 overweight women into two groups. Both groups ate the same food, 1,400 calories a day, not very much, for 12 weeks. But one group consumed half the calories at breakfast. The other group consumed half the calories at dinner. When the study was over, the big dinner group had lost an average of about seven pounds, not bad. But the big breakfast group, those who ate the same food, just earlier in the day, lost more than double that, an average of more than 17 pounds. They also reduced their waistline more than the dinner group and even had greater drops in glucose, insulin and triglycerides, high levels of which can lead to metabolic problems. Again, same food, same calories, just a different schedule. The bottom line, in eating as in life, timing is everything. VEDANTAM: So what I find interesting about the study, Dan, is that it contradicts a view that I think many people hold, which is that dieting is all just about calories in, calories out because what the study is suggesting is that it's not just about calories in, calories out. It's when you eat those calories that can make a huge difference. PINK: Yeah, yeah. Our bodies are very, very complex systems. They don't work like simple machines. They're much more complex than that. And a lot of endocrinologists, a lot of physicians are trying to figure out exactly what that right mix is. But it turns out that questions of when can be just as important as questions of what. Now, here's a what question for you. What do you got on your plate for your next study? VEDANTAM: All right, this next study will be of interest to anyone who hangs around with small kids. What's one way you get youngsters to eat healthy food? You educate them about the health benefits of the food. But is this actually a good idea? New social science research suggests maybe not. PINK: Uh-oh. VEDANTAM: Michal Maimaran at Northwestern and Ayelet Fishbach at the University of Chicago find that children who are told that crackers are healthy infer that this means the crackers are not yummy, and they eat less of them. The researchers tried another experiment with carrots. They told preschoolers that eating carrots would help them become better readers. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: Again, they find that creating this kind of instrumental goal causes the preschoolers to eat fewer carrots. Basically, the researchers think that when preschoolers are given one kind of association, crackers are healthy or carrots help you with reading, they unconsciously infer that alternate associations must be weaker, that the carrots and the crackers can't be tasty. The moral of the story is if you want kids to eat certain kinds of food, sell the tastiness of the food, rather than the health benefits. PINK: Wow. So sell the steak, not the sizzle, in other words. VEDANTAM: Exactly. PINK: Yeah, I also think another factor that could be at work here is that any child who hears an adult say that carrots will make you a better reader knows that is not an adult they could ever trust. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: In other words, kids are just good lie detectors. PINK: Yeah, exactly. Kids are good lie detectors, no matter what they eat. But it is interesting because we do - I mean, I remember when my kids were growing up. You know, you do want them to eat healthy. And so you're not sure how to persuade them to do it. And so, basically, what you're saying is that - push the good taste rather than the ancillary benefits. VEDANTAM: Yeah, and I think when we think about many things in human behavior, Dan, I think we often assume that presenting the rational arguments to people is the best way to go. PINK: Yeah. VEDANTAM: And so if you're selling carrots, you sell the rational arguments that carrots are good for you. The rational arguments don't always work, and sometimes, they backfire. PINK: Yeah, especially when it comes to eating. VEDANTAM: All right, let's see if this rational argument has any benefits. Dan, if you're going to be done on time, you have to do your next segment on time. And your next 60 seconds starts right now. PINK: Well, as we've discussed, all kinds of hidden forces affect how much we eat. But here's one I didn't expect - the weight of your waiter or waitress. VEDANTAM: Oh, boy. PINK: Tim Doering of the University of Gottingen in Germany and Cornell's Brian Wansink, one of the leading scholars of eating behavior, went to more than 50 restaurants in the U. S. , from chains like Applebee's and Olive Garden to smaller, independent establishments. And they looked at interactions between diners and servers. They found that customers were four times as likely to order dessert when they were served by wait staff with high body mass indexes than those with low BMIs. VEDANTAM: Wow. PINK: People also ordered more alcohol from heavy servers than from slimmer ones. And the BMI of the diners themselves didn't matter at all. Now, this is what's called an observational study. It wasn't a controlled experiment. It doesn't mean that heavy waiters necessarily cause people to order the apple chimicheesecake. Still, it shows, once again, how quiet factors, the setting we're in, the social cues around us, can influence what we do and even what we eat. VEDANTAM: Here's a question for you, Dan. If I want to avoid this kind of bias, do you think it makes sense for me to decide what I'm going to order before the waiter actually shows up at my table? PINK: Absolutely. There's a lot of evidence in eating and even in another kinds of behaviors that when - we make better decisions when we make them in advance rather than at that moment of truth when the triple brownie explosion melt is staring us in the face. VEDANTAM: I like that because, of course, there's all this research showing that we make better decisions for our future selves. And so I'm going to tell you right now, Dan. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . I'm going to stick to my next 60-second deadline on my next Stopwatch Science segment. PINK: OK, well, I'm going to set the timer. And it's going off right now. VEDANTAM: All right, this is a study that makes me very happy. If you're on a diet, should you allow yourself to cheat? The rational answer is no. The HIDDEN BRAIN answer is yes. A study in the Journal of Consumer Psychology finds that when dieters are told they can have a day off each week from their diets, when they can eat whatever they want - this is a day of planned cheating - they did just as well when it came to losing weight as dieters who didn't give themselves any room to cheat. Even better, the dieters who cheated reported being happier with their diets and maybe would stick to them much longer. The researchers have a wonderful academic euphemism to describe this kind of cheating. They call these hedonic deviations. PINK: Nice. VEDANTAM: The important thing to remember here is that the cheating has to be planned and deliberate. Most diets end with a crash. And when you crash, you feel like you failed. When you plan your hedonic deviations, it's not a crash. It's just a controlled landing before you take off again. It puts you in charge, makes you happier, might have long-term health benefits. PINK: Yeah, that's quite fascinating. I actually think that some of it also has to do with autonomy, that when you're on a diet, you're very controlled. And so if you have this escape valve where you're in control, just for one day, that can probably make you feel better and probably boost adherence. I also love the idea of the hedonic deviation. I think that I like to consider Stopwatch Science a hedonic deviation in the lives of American listeners. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) I'll tell you what, I think I'm going to stick to my time better the next time, Dan, if occasionally, maybe once every two weeks, you give me two minutes. . . PINK: OK. VEDANTAM: . . . To do a Stopwatch Science segment. PINK: We can have a cheat day for Stopwatch Science. VEDANTAM: All right, so there you have it. Buy a big table and cut your food into tiny pieces. Be mindful of your eating companions, or as Dan would put it, eat with men, not women. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Eat a big breakfast, not a big dinner. Tell kids vegetables are tasty and not very healthy. Have a rule of thumb when you go to a restaurant - one drink, one entree. And if you're going on a diet, plan on indulging yourself once in a while. Dan Pink, thank you for joining me on Stopwatch Science. PINK: Always a pleasure, Shankar.

What does it mean? And why is it important that we figure out how to talk about it? Find Code Switch on the NPR One app and at npr. org/podcasts. This is HIDDEN BRAIN, I'm Shankar Vedantam. Summer is around the corner, which means beaches and swimsuits are around the corner, too. Today, with a view to getting myself into beach-ready shape, I've asked Daniel Pink to come in to trade psychological tricks on how to eat better. We're also going to look at some surprising factors that make us eat worse. Dan, of course, is our senior Stopwatch Science correspondent, or actually I should say our svelte senior Stopwatch Science correspondent. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Welcome, Dan. PINK: Thank you, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Now, I would say my body is beach ready on the radio. What about yours, Dan? PINK: You know what? I don't really think in those terms. I tend to go out in public fully, if not heavily clothed. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: All right. Now, as you know on Stopwatch Science, Dan and I give one another 60 seconds to summarize interesting social science research. As we approach the 60-second mark, our producers will bring up the music just like they do at The Oscars. Dan and I will each present three different pieces of social science research. We'll also spend a little more time between the segments unpacking the signs and its implications. Our topic today is dieting and the many ways in which hidden and unconscious factors shape our diets. Dan, if you're ready, your first 60 seconds starts now. PINK: Behavioral science has given us lots of tricks for eating less - smaller plates, smaller portions - but a new study this year in the Journal of the Association of Consumer Research offers another option, larger tables. VEDANTAM: What? PINK: Yes. For these experiments, researchers got a bunch of pizzas and a bunch more college students. They found that students consumed the least amount of pizza when they were served small slices on a large table. It sounds weird, but there's a good explanation. When students saw the small slices on a tiny table, they quickly noticed just how measly those slices were. So, of course, they grab more. But when those same small slices were on a big table, their attention shifted away from the smallness of the pizza slices and toward the largeness of the table. On a large table, the small slices seemed not so measly after all. So students didn't feel the need to pile as many on their plate and ended up consuming less pizza over all. The lesson here, large tables may prevent large people. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). All right, Dan. I have a question. PINK: Yes. VEDANTAM: So are the researchers saying that the fact that we see these pizza slices differently on small tables versus large tables, are they saying this is because of an optical illusion? PINK: A little bit of an optical illusion. The way our vision works is that we don't see things in absolute terms. We see them in relative terms. So when you have small slices on a tiny table, you can actually see how small those slices are. But on a big table, everything looks about the same size because there's greater contrast. Therefore, people on the big table will eat the small slices. They'll eat fewer of them and consume less pizza in total. VEDANTAM: That makes sense. PINK: So, Shankar, you and I are sitting here at a large table ourselves. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: So why don't you give us a small idea? VEDANTAM: I'm going to give you a small portion of an idea, Dan. PINK: (Laughter) A small slice. VEDANTAM: It's going to fit in 60 seconds. It turns out it isn't just the size of your dining table that influences how much you eat. Your dining companions might make a difference, too. I did a story about this for NPR some time ago. Molly Allen-O'Donnell told me that when she was a graduate student at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, she sat down at a college cafeteria and looked at how much food people bought for lunch and dinner. She noticed that when women sat with other women, they ordered an average 833 calories of food. When they sat with men, they ordered only 721 calories. So women ate more when they ate with women, and they ate less when they ate with men. Now, what about men? I hear you asking the question, Dan. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: What about men? When men sat with other men, they ordered 952 calories. But when they sat with women, they ordered 1,162 calories. PINK: Oh, my God. VEDANTAM: So another way to put this is both men and women ate more when they ate with women, and both men and women ate less when they ate with men. Now, I'm sure we're going to talk about why this might be the case, Dan. But I want to take a moment to shout out to every overweight, married, heterosexual man who is listening. The next time your wife tells you to lose a few pounds, you might want to say, honey, it's your fault. (LAUGHTER) PINK: Oh, nice, nice. You know, I think it's interesting. The takeaway for me is that if you want to lose weight, eat with men. VEDANTAM: I think that is one. . . PINK: But why is that? Why. . . (LAUGHTER) PINK: Why do men eat so much around women? VEDANTAM: I don't think the study conclusively answers that question, Dan. There was a related study that I saw by Kevin Kniffin at Cornell University. He and his colleagues found that men eat 93 percent more pizza and 86 percent more salad when eating with a woman compared to eating with a man. So it isn't just eating more unhealthy food. It's just eating more food in general. Now, other studies have shown that heterosexual men in general tend to pursue more risky behaviors in the presence of women. Studies show that mixed sex groups, for example, make more risky financial decisions. So it's possible that men are acting out some kind of evolutionary script by eating more food and demonstrating they're capable of riskier behavior. PINK: So they lose their inhibitions. They show, I'm a big risk-taker who can go out there and slay that saber-tooth tiger. VEDANTAM: Exactly. PINK: So, for my experience, back - many, many years ago, I would just be so psyched that a woman would be willing to eat with me. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: . . . That I would probably lose my inhibitions - start gorging on pizza. VEDANTAM: You know, it may be that men who are able to eat a lot of food may have signaled some kind of evolutionary fitness in our ancient past. Now, of course, when food is so plentiful today. . . PINK: Right. VEDANTAM: . . . It might signal something else altogether. PINK: A lack of fitness. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: All right, let's see if you can signal to me that you can stick to your time, Dan. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Your next 60 seconds starts right now. PINK: You are what you eat. We've all heard that. But this next study shows you are also when you eat. Researchers at Tel Aviv University's medical school randomly assigned 93 overweight women into two groups. Both groups ate the same food, 1,400 calories a day, not very much, for 12 weeks. But one group consumed half the calories at breakfast. The other group consumed half the calories at dinner. When the study was over, the big dinner group had lost an average of about seven pounds, not bad. But the big breakfast group, those who ate the same food, just earlier in the day, lost more than double that, an average of more than 17 pounds. They also reduced their waistline more than the dinner group and even had greater drops in glucose, insulin and triglycerides, high levels of which can lead to metabolic problems. Again, same food, same calories, just a different schedule. The bottom line, in eating as in life, timing is everything. VEDANTAM: So what I find interesting about the study, Dan, is that it contradicts a view that I think many people hold, which is that dieting is all just about calories in, calories out because what the study is suggesting is that it's not just about calories in, calories out. It's when you eat those calories that can make a huge difference. PINK: Yeah, yeah. Our bodies are very, very complex systems. They don't work like simple machines. They're much more complex than that. And a lot of endocrinologists, a lot of physicians are trying to figure out exactly what that right mix is. But it turns out that questions of when can be just as important as questions of what. Now, here's a what question for you. What do you got on your plate for your next study? VEDANTAM: All right, this next study will be of interest to anyone who hangs around with small kids. What's one way you get youngsters to eat healthy food? You educate them about the health benefits of the food. But is this actually a good idea? New social science research suggests maybe not. PINK: Uh-oh. VEDANTAM: Michal Maimaran at Northwestern and Ayelet Fishbach at the University of Chicago find that children who are told that crackers are healthy infer that this means the crackers are not yummy, and they eat less of them. The researchers tried another experiment with carrots. They told preschoolers that eating carrots would help them become better readers. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: Again, they find that creating this kind of instrumental goal causes the preschoolers to eat fewer carrots. Basically, the researchers think that when preschoolers are given one kind of association, crackers are healthy or carrots help you with reading, they unconsciously infer that alternate associations must be weaker, that the carrots and the crackers can't be tasty. The moral of the story is if you want kids to eat certain kinds of food, sell the tastiness of the food, rather than the health benefits. PINK: Wow. So sell the steak, not the sizzle, in other words. VEDANTAM: Exactly. PINK: Yeah, I also think another factor that could be at work here is that any child who hears an adult say that carrots will make you a better reader knows that is not an adult they could ever trust. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: In other words, kids are just good lie detectors. PINK: Yeah, exactly. Kids are good lie detectors, no matter what they eat. But it is interesting because we do - I mean, I remember when my kids were growing up. You know, you do want them to eat healthy. And so you're not sure how to persuade them to do it. And so, basically, what you're saying is that - push the good taste rather than the ancillary benefits. VEDANTAM: Yeah, and I think when we think about many things in human behavior, Dan, I think we often assume that presenting the rational arguments to people is the best way to go. PINK: Yeah. VEDANTAM: And so if you're selling carrots, you sell the rational arguments that carrots are good for you. The rational arguments don't always work, and sometimes, they backfire. PINK: Yeah, especially when it comes to eating. VEDANTAM: All right, let's see if this rational argument has any benefits. Dan, if you're going to be done on time, you have to do your next segment on time. And your next 60 seconds starts right now. PINK: Well, as we've discussed, all kinds of hidden forces affect how much we eat. But here's one I didn't expect - the weight of your waiter or waitress. VEDANTAM: Oh, boy. PINK: Tim Doering of the University of Gottingen in Germany and Cornell's Brian Wansink, one of the leading scholars of eating behavior, went to more than 50 restaurants in the U. S. , from chains like Applebee's and Olive Garden to smaller, independent establishments. And they looked at interactions between diners and servers. They found that customers were four times as likely to order dessert when they were served by wait staff with high body mass indexes than those with low BMIs. VEDANTAM: Wow. PINK: People also ordered more alcohol from heavy servers than from slimmer ones. And the BMI of the diners themselves didn't matter at all. Now, this is what's called an observational study. It wasn't a controlled experiment. It doesn't mean that heavy waiters necessarily cause people to order the apple chimicheesecake. Still, it shows, once again, how quiet factors, the setting we're in, the social cues around us, can influence what we do and even what we eat. VEDANTAM: Here's a question for you, Dan. If I want to avoid this kind of bias, do you think it makes sense for me to decide what I'm going to order before the waiter actually shows up at my table? PINK: Absolutely. There's a lot of evidence in eating and even in another kinds of behaviors that when - we make better decisions when we make them in advance rather than at that moment of truth when the triple brownie explosion melt is staring us in the face. VEDANTAM: I like that because, of course, there's all this research showing that we make better decisions for our future selves. And so I'm going to tell you right now, Dan. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . I'm going to stick to my next 60-second deadline on my next Stopwatch Science segment. PINK: OK, well, I'm going to set the timer. And it's going off right now. VEDANTAM: All right, this is a study that makes me very happy. If you're on a diet, should you allow yourself to cheat? The rational answer is no. The HIDDEN BRAIN answer is yes. A study in the Journal of Consumer Psychology finds that when dieters are told they can have a day off each week from their diets, when they can eat whatever they want - this is a day of planned cheating - they did just as well when it came to losing weight as dieters who didn't give themselves any room to cheat. Even better, the dieters who cheated reported being happier with their diets and maybe would stick to them much longer. The researchers have a wonderful academic euphemism to describe this kind of cheating. They call these hedonic deviations. PINK: Nice. VEDANTAM: The important thing to remember here is that the cheating has to be planned and deliberate. Most diets end with a crash. And when you crash, you feel like you failed. When you plan your hedonic deviations, it's not a crash. It's just a controlled landing before you take off again. It puts you in charge, makes you happier, might have long-term health benefits. PINK: Yeah, that's quite fascinating. I actually think that some of it also has to do with autonomy, that when you're on a diet, you're very controlled. And so if you have this escape valve where you're in control, just for one day, that can probably make you feel better and probably boost adherence. I also love the idea of the hedonic deviation. I think that I like to consider Stopwatch Science a hedonic deviation in the lives of American listeners. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) I'll tell you what, I think I'm going to stick to my time better the next time, Dan, if occasionally, maybe once every two weeks, you give me two minutes. . . PINK: OK. VEDANTAM: . . . To do a Stopwatch Science segment. PINK: We can have a cheat day for Stopwatch Science. VEDANTAM: All right, so there you have it. Buy a big table and cut your food into tiny pieces. Be mindful of your eating companions, or as Dan would put it, eat with men, not women. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Eat a big breakfast, not a big dinner. Tell kids vegetables are tasty and not very healthy. Have a rule of thumb when you go to a restaurant - one drink, one entree. And if you're going on a diet, plan on indulging yourself once in a while. Dan Pink, thank you for joining me on Stopwatch Science. PINK: Always a pleasure, Shankar.

In California, there's so much solar energy that on Sundays, there's too much. One solution is to join forces across state borders to share that renewable wealth. And that's sparking some not-so-neighborly opposition. We're going to hear two reports now from the perspective of different Western states. Lauren Sommer of member station KQED starts us off with California's side of things. LAUREN SOMMER, BYLINE: Nancy Traweek's job is a lot like an orchestra conductor's. But instead of balancing strings and horns, she's balancing California's electric grid. NANCY TRAWEEK: It's constantly solving a constant problem, meaning that you're always trying to balance. SOMMER: Traweek has to keep the lights on for 30 million people at the California Independent System Operator. She relies on huge natural gas power plants, which are like the string section, putting out a steady stream of electricity. But lately, Traweek's job has gotten harder because of this. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SOMMER: Solar and wind power. If clouds come in, the solar power drops off. TRAWEEK: That needs to come from somewhere else immediately. SOMMER: So Traweek has to keep the natural gas power plants going in the background just in case. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SOMMER: But running solar, gas and wind together is becoming a problem. On certain days, they make more power than California needs. And that's not just inconvenient. TRAWEEK: Now we've really just got to start cutting as much as we possibly can. If that's not done, then you could have a blackout. SOMMER: So she has to tell solar farms to shut off. One way to avoid this - join up with other Western states. Right now, California's grid runs mostly on its own. It's like an island. But if there was one big Western grid where states could share power, it would be easier for California to hit its goal of 50 percent renewable energy by 2030, says Keith Casey, who also works at the California grid operator. KEITH CASEY: If you can operate it as an integrated whole, you can just operate the system more efficiently. SOMMER: And when California has too much solar power, Western states would buy it instead of having to switch off the solar farms. CASEY: It's a win-win. SOMMER: This marriage of electric grids would start with PacifiCorp, a utility in Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. Negotiations are already underway. But PacifiCorp isn't a partner that everyone wants to get in bed with because a lot of their electricity comes from coal. TRAVIS RITCHIE: That's a big problem for California. SOMMER: That's Travis Ritchie of the Sierra Club. He says coal doesn't fit into California's ambitious climate change agenda, a plan that some Western states actively oppose. RITCHIE: Will California actually lose the ability to lead on climate issues if it gives up its power to Utah and Wyoming? SOMMER: And those states feel the same way about California, just for the opposite reason. STEPHANIE JOYCE, BYLINE: Indeed. Stephanie Joyce, Wyoming Public Radio here. Public Service Commissioner Bill Russell is one of the regulators who would need to bless a PacifiCorp-California marriage. As it's currently proposed, he's not inclined to do that. BILL RUSSELL: California policies, whether you like them or not, are going to be exported throughout the entire West, and all of us in the West are going to be importing California policies. JOYCE: Policies like the state's commitment to renewables, a commitment not shared by Wyoming, the nation's largest coal producing state. But California isn't the only one who might benefit from sharing electricity between Western states. An initial study by PacifiCorp estimated its customers would save $2 billion over 20 years, which is why Russell isn't dismissing the idea outright. RUSSELL: I wouldn't say it's dead yet. JOYCE: Regional grids like what's being proposed already thrive, sharing all kinds of power in the Midwest, New England and in the mid-Atlantic. But Western states have resisted similar arrangements in the past. CINDY CRANE: Politics, at the end of the day, are going to be the biggest obstacle. JOYCE: Cindy Crane is the CEO of Rocky Mountain Power, the PacifiCorp's subsidiary in Wyoming, Idaho and Utah. She worked on some of the previous efforts to integrate the Western grid. She's hopeful this time will be different. CRANE: I think it has a better shot, but there are some pretty big threshold issues to get through. JOYCE: If those issues can't be overcome - remember all that wind and solar in California? The state will have to find a way to store that extra renewable energy, which is difficult and expensive. So in the end, the West may soon find that it can't afford not to share. For NPR News, I'm Stephanie Joyce.

Congress has passed the biggest chemical safety bill in 40 years. President Obama is likely to sign it. Here to explain what this means for water bottles, soap, paper and other stuff that we use every day is Richard Denison. He's a toxicologist at the Environmental Defense Fund. Welcome to the program. RICHARD DENISON: Thank you so much, Ari. SHAPIRO: First explain what's in this bill. DENISON: So this bill will revamp the way the country evaluates the safety of chemicals that we encounter every day. These chemicals have really never been assessed for safety. Unlike drugs, for example, that have to go through a rigorous review to get on the market, chemicals we use in everyday products have simply been assumed to be safe. This bill is going to change that, and it's going to require an affirmative finding that chemicals are safe in order for them to stay on the market. SHAPIRO: Tell me more about the specific consumer products that are likely to be affected by this. DENISON: So the chemicals that are covered by this law are used in a huge array of applications that we run into every day - the paint on our walls, the carpeting under our feet, cleaning products and detergents - about the only thing it doesn't cover are chemicals in products that you put on or in your body deliberately. So drugs and food additives are not covered under this law, but just about everything else - every material and product that we use contains chemicals that this law is supposed to have regulated and hopefully will now be able to. SHAPIRO: I'm thinking about products like lead and asbestos that maybe a few generations ago were widespread and used everywhere that today we think of as toxic and hazardous to people's health. Do you think there are things we're using today that will be the asbestos or lead of a future generation? DENISON: Unfortunately, I do. I think we have two problems. One is chemicals that we actually already know are very dangerous. Formaldehyde is a good example, used in thousands of products - and it's a known human carcinogen. Then there are the tens of thousands of chemicals that we know very little about. And while many of those are likely to be quite benign, some of them aren't. And we have to start the process of sorting through those to get the ones that are problems out of our lives. SHAPIRO: As everybody knows, Washington is unable to do the most routine business these days. How on Earth did a sweeping set of environmental regulations pass the House and Senate with the support of not only very many environmental groups but industry groups as well? DENISON: It is a really stunning development, Ari. I would say the thing that brought it about is first the fact that the public and consumers were demanding change, second - that the industry itself began to recognize it needed a stronger federal system to restore confidence and third - there really was a commitment to do this on a bipartisan basis in Congress. And I think that's because these issues touch everyone because they deal with our health. Everyone knows someone who got cancer at an early age or who wasn't able to conceive a child. And chemical exposures are increasingly linked to those problems, so I think what everybody felt it was time to upgrade this law. SHAPIRO: Richard Denison is a toxicologist with the Environmental Defense Fund. Thanks for joining us. DENISON: My pleasure, Ari. Thanks for having me.

Then there are the tens of thousands of chemicals that we know very little about. And while many of those are likely to be quite benign, some of them aren't. And we have to start the process of sorting through those to get the ones that are problems out of our lives. SHAPIRO: As everybody knows, Washington is unable to do the most routine business these days. How on Earth did a sweeping set of environmental regulations pass the House and Senate with the support of not only very many environmental groups but industry groups as well? DENISON: It is a really stunning development, Ari. I would say the thing that brought it about is first the fact that the public and consumers were demanding change, second - that the industry itself began to recognize it needed a stronger federal system to restore confidence and third - there really was a commitment to do this on a bipartisan basis in Congress. And I think that's because these issues touch everyone because they deal with our health. Everyone knows someone who got cancer at an early age or who wasn't able to conceive a child. And chemical exposures are increasingly linked to those problems, so I think what everybody felt it was time to upgrade this law. SHAPIRO: Richard Denison is a toxicologist with the Environmental Defense Fund. Thanks for joining us. DENISON: My pleasure, Ari.

SARAH PARCAK: Glad to be back. SHAPIRO: Explorers have been surveying Petra for at least a couple centuries. How did no one find this before? PARCAK: That is what we are asking ourselves. But, you know, where it's located on the site - it's located on a plateau. And it's just covered enough to where when you're walking over it, if you don't know exactly what to look for, you could easily miss it. SHAPIRO: What is it exactly? PARCAK: That's another good question. We're not sure. We know given its pretty large size and its location that it probably would have been used in public functions, potentially some kind of religious function or ritual function. We just don't know. That will require excavation. What we do know is that it wasn't just one large structure. There are other structures inside it. And the other thing, too, is there's nothing else like it at the site. SHAPIRO: You used Google Earth, satellite imagery, drones. What exactly was it that you saw that made you think, OK, that's something we need to go explore in person? PARCAK: You know, initially just because I'd never looked before at the site of Petra from space, I wanted to get a sense of the lay of the land. So that's where I used Google Earth just to really see what was there, see what the different features look like from satellite imagery. And then I just started processing the imagery and looking for shapes that couldn't be natural - so squares, rectangles, straight lines. You know, we certainly have a lot of data about structures that are known at Petra as well as roads and cairns and other features. And this rectangular form popped out. When I initially looked at it, I dismissed it. I'm pretty skeptical. But I thought, well, it's not going to do any harm to share that with Chris and his team. They're going to go out and survey anyway, so I gave the data to them. And I was just blown away when they came back to me with the results. SHAPIRO: I wonder if part of your success depends on just not assuming that all the thousands of archaeologists who've looked at this before you have found what there is to find. I mean, I imagine if I were looking at a place like this I would be like there's nothing new to see here. People have been coming here for hundreds of years. If there was something to see, it would have been seen. PARCAK: That's exactly what I thought. You know, I did not think that we could ever find something this large and significant and important really so close to the city center. I've just - still surprised even though I was heavily involved in this project that previous archaeologists had missed it. And it's interesting. I'm now hearing from different specialists who know the site well, and they've actually said, gosh, I - you know, I wondered.

His ex-wife, Sitora Yusufiy, has described him as both physically and psychologically abusive. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SITORA YUSUFIY: A few months after we were married, I saw his instability. And I saw that he was bipolar, and he would get mad out nowhere. He started abusing me physically very often and not allowing me to speak to my family, keeping me hostage from them. MCEVERS: Deborah Epstein studies domestic violence at Georgetown University. She says what the shooter's wife is describing sounds like a classic example of what's called intimate terrorism. DEBORAH EPSTEIN: Those are situations where a partner tries to exercise an incredible degree of coercive control over their partner - their finances, their employment, what clothes they wear, their social contacts. And one of the methodologies of enforcing that control is violence. MCEVERS: So do we know anything about whether a history of this kind of intimate terrorism is a risk factor for committing mass shootings like this one in Orlando? EPSTEIN: I'm not aware, and I don't think there are any actual studies that have explored that connection between intimate terrorism, domestic violence and terrorism. But is certainly true that in the aftermath of terrorist events on American soil, we often learn that the perpetrator had a history of domestic violence against their intimate partner or multiple intimate partners. MCEVERS: What do we know about the link between domestic violence and gun violence? EPSTEIN: We know that guns are used in a relatively small number of domestic violence incidents, overall. But we also know that in states that require a background check for handguns, 38 percent fewer women are shot to death by their intimate partners. So there is a link between background checks and the reduction in fatalities due to domestic violence. MCEVERS: And what does this case tell us about how domestic violence does or doesn't get reported? I mean, it of course raises the question - if this person had had a criminal conviction or restraining order, maybe he wouldn't have passed a background check. EPSTEIN: I think it's well accepted in our culture - the idea of see something, say something in the terrorist context. But we are still seeing a reluctance in American society for bystanders to say something and intervene in incidents of domestic violence. Bystander intervention is absolutely essential if we're going to really reduce and eradicate domestic violence in our culture. And this potential link between domestic violence and mass shootings - terrorism - gives us another reason to intervene early in cases of domestic violence. MCEVERS: That's Deborah Epstein.

And so a familiar narrative returns - speculation that the shooter could have been motivated by self-hatred as a closeted gay man. Gregory Herek urges caution. He is a professor of psychology at UC Davis and has written extensively about prejudice against gay men and others. Welcome to the program. GREGORY HEREK: Hello. It's good to be here. SHAPIRO: When you first heard these reports that the shooter may have been using a gay dating gap called Jack'd in coming to the club, what first went through your head? HEREK: Well, my first thought was wondering if, in fact, those reports were substantiated. I'm not sure, even now, to what extent they have been. But then I had a thought similar to what you just described - that this a familiar narrative. People seem to want to take this narrative away from instances of anti-gay violence and anti-gay prejudice, but it's really not a very useful way of trying to understand those acts. SHAPIRO: What do you mean when you say it's common that people associate this narrative with acts of anti-gay violence and prejudice? What do you mean by that? HEREK: Well, the idea of these repressed homosexual urges and personal conflicts about sexuality probably goes back to psychoanalytic theory. And it's made its way into popular culture, so that people often make these assumptions. What it ignores, though, is that even today, homosexuality is still very stigmatized American society. And everyone grows up learning about that stigma and internalizing it, regardless of their own sexual orientation. SHAPIRO: So what does the research show about the connection between repressed sexuality and homophobia or anti-gay acts? HEREK: There isn't a great deal of research. There's a lot of speculation. But certainly there's as much research suggesting that there is not some sort of underlying same-sex attraction associated with strong anti-gay attitudes as suggesting that there is. SHAPIRO: So you're saying - I think a lot of people may have heard this idea that the most anti-gay people are themselves repressed homosexuals. Are you saying that's got no founding in science? HEREK: I'm saying that that has happened, but, yeah, we don't have support to say that that's typically the case. And, in fact, we have much more evidence for saying that it's not. SHAPIRO: Whether or not the killer a Pulse nightclub used gay dating apps or went to gay clubs, there are lots of old films and plays and other characters where, you know, the evil villain is a tortured gay man. HEREK: Right. SHAPIRO: Why is this such a pervasive theme, if it isn't, in fact, supported by the facts? HEREK: Until 1973, homosexuality was officially classified as a mental illness. And so portrayals of people who are homosexual typically hewed to that line and portrayed people as being mentally ill, being sick - and not only being sick, but also being evil, being criminals, having all of these other negative attributes. SHAPIRO: I think at this point everybody understands that homosexuality is not a mental illness. But is there a reason to believe that intense homophobia, stigma, being told evil that you're and wrong and you don't deserve to exist and you have to change could drive a person to be mentally ill or to commit atrocious acts? HEREK: Well, it is the case that many people, as they recognize their own same-sex attractions - that they have to unlearn all of the things that they've learned throughout their life about homosexuality being so evil and bad and undesirable. And they also have to learn how not to apply those attitudes to themselves and to develop a sense of positive identity. That is a process that people have to go through. The vast majority of people who identify as gay or lesbian or bisexual go through that process successfully. There are people who have more trouble with the process. And harboring those negative societal attitudes, buying into the culture's stigma and directing those negative feelings toward oneself are known to be associated with low self-esteem, depression and other types of psychological distress.

And there are some things to think about if you are - first of all, travel, maybe what you're going to wear. And then there's the gift - choose from the registry or go rogue. Well, NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam wondered what that choice might tell us about human nature. He is here to talk more. Hey there, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, Audie. CORNISH: So why the registry? What intrigued you about that choice? VEDANTAM: Well, it turns out that there are conflicting forces within our society. We want the gifts that we give to please the people getting married, but we also want the gifts to reflect well on us. And this can produce some tensions. I was speaking with Morgan Ward. She's a marketing professor at Southern Methodist University. She told me she got the idea for a study because of something that happened as her own wedding day approached. She had created a wedding registry, but for some friends choosing gifts from the registry wasn't good enough. MORGAN WARD: As the wedding approached, people asked me what it was that I would like. And I thought it was kind of funny given that I had spent all this time creating a list of exactly that. But the people who didn't want to purchase from the registry are those who were closest to me. And it was clear that those people wanted to buy something that was special and different. And they clearly wanted to signal something. CORNISH: So the idea is I'm your close friend. I want to get something extra special, and the registry is somehow not special? VEDANTAM: Exactly. If you're buying a gift off the registry that anyone else could have bought, how does that make you special? How does it signal that you know something about the people getting married that nobody else does? Ward found that her closest friends were the ones who were the most likely to improvise gifts rather than buy from the registry. One friend, for example, knew that Ward liked origami. WARD: I had one woman give me a few hundred dollars folded into origami birds. But the problem with it is if you want to use the money, you have to dismantle the gift. It was like please destroy this gift if you actually want to do something as materialistic as you use the money for something you need. CORNISH: That's great. What did she actually do with this origami bird? VEDANTAM: She did the rational thing. She dismantled it and spent the money. CORNISH: OK. (LAUGHTER)CORNISH: So when she looked into whether her experience was unique, what did she find? VEDANTAM: Well, Ward and her adviser Susan Broniarczyk conducted a series of experiments, Audie, that found that close friends are indeed more likely than strangers to buy things that they think we want or need rather than simply listen to the preferences that we've expressed ourselves. They also found interestingly that when gift-giving is anonymous, when volunteers give gifts anonymously, this effect disappears, meaning close friends are now OK with buying off of a registry. In other words, when our close friends depart from a registry, they say they're doing it because they know what we really want more than we know ourselves. But if that was the case, they should still buy those gifts when they're giving anonymously. The fact that they don't suggests the real reason close friends depart from the registry is to send a signal to us, to the world, maybe even to themselves that they have a special relationship with us and the unique gift is an advertisement for that special relationship. CORNISH: All right. Do we know they're wrong, though? I mean, did Morgan Ward ask whether the gift recipients liked these gifts? VEDANTAM: She did, and in fact she finds something deeply ironic. WARD: We actually looked at whether or not recipients were happy with those gifts. And we found as - as was my experience as well - that they weren't as happy especially when the giver was a close friend. And I think people do get sort of disappointed when their close friends don't listen to their preferences. You know, it's a little bit offensive (laughter). VEDANTAM: So here's the irony, Audie, close friends don't listen to our preferences because they want to signal to us that they are close friends. But doing that sends us exactly the wrong signal. We say, you of all people ought to respect who I am and what I say I want instead of signaling to me that you know what's best for me. CORNISH: Yikes. I will issue some formal apologies. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). CORNISH: . . . After I get off the line with you. Shankar Vedantam is NPR's social science correspondent. He's also the host of a new podcast that explores the unseen patterns in human behavior. It's called Hidden Brain. Shankar, thanks so much. VEDANTAM: Thanks, Audie.

If you're buying a gift off the registry that anyone else could have bought, how does that make you special? How does it signal that you know something about the people getting married that nobody else does? Ward found that her closest friends were the ones who were the most likely to improvise gifts rather than buy from the registry. One friend, for example, knew that Ward liked origami. WARD: I had one woman give me a few hundred dollars folded into origami birds. But the problem with it is if you want to use the money, you have to dismantle the gift. It was like please destroy this gift if you actually want to do something as materialistic as you use the money for something you need. CORNISH: That's great. What did she actually do with this origami bird? VEDANTAM: She did the rational thing. She dismantled it and spent the money. CORNISH: OK. (LAUGHTER) CORNISH: So when she looked into whether her experience was unique, what did she find? VEDANTAM: Well, Ward and her adviser Susan Broniarczyk conducted a series of experiments, Audie, that found that close friends are indeed more likely than strangers to buy things that they think we want or need rather than simply listen to the preferences that we've expressed ourselves. They also found interestingly that when gift-giving is anonymous, when volunteers give gifts anonymously, this effect disappears, meaning close friends are now OK with buying off of a registry. In other words, when our close friends depart from a registry, they say they're doing it because they know what we really want more than we know ourselves. But if that was the case, they should still buy those gifts when they're giving anonymously. The fact that they don't suggests the real reason close friends depart from the registry is to send a signal to us, to the world, maybe even to themselves that they have a special relationship with us and the unique gift is an advertisement for that special relationship. CORNISH: All right. Do we know they're wrong, though? I mean, did Morgan Ward ask whether the gift recipients liked these gifts? VEDANTAM: She did, and in fact she finds something deeply ironic. WARD: We actually looked at whether or not recipients were happy with those gifts. And we found as - as was my experience as well - that they weren't as happy especially when the giver was a close friend. And I think people do get sort of disappointed when their close friends don't listen to their preferences. You know, it's a little bit offensive (laughter). VEDANTAM: So here's the irony, Audie, close friends don't listen to our preferences because they want to signal to us that they are close friends. But doing that sends us exactly the wrong signal. We say, you of all people ought to respect who I am and what I say I want instead of signaling to me that you know what's best for me. CORNISH: Yikes. I will issue some formal apologies. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). CORNISH: . . . After I get off the line with you. Shankar Vedantam is NPR's social science correspondent.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. Let's begin today by listening to an interrogation. We found it on YouTube. Two young children sit before their mother. The little boy, Jackson (ph), is 2. 5. The girl, Reagan (ph), is 5. Both have wary expressions. Here's their mom. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: OK, now we're going to talk about this, you two. Something happened here on the wall. VEDANTAM: The camera pans to the wall. Someone has drawn a bunch of lines in black ink. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Who did that? VEDANTAM: Reagan instantly points at Jackson. Jackson develops a case of the hiccups. There's a pause. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Jackson, did you do that? VEDANTAM: Jackson sees that his sister has betrayed him. He decides to take revenge. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JACKSON: No, she do that. REAGAN: No, I did not. I really didn't. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: OK, well, when I walked in the room, you looked like you were hiding something. VEDANTAM: Jackson decides to pivot. He comes up with an entirely new suspect that can get them both off the hook. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JACKSON: A ghost. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: No, a ghost definitely did not do that. VEDANTAM: Jackson looks disappointed. Reagan rubs her nose with a hankie and comes up with an approach that's actually kind of brilliant. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)REAGAN: Well, I was trying to hide it from you 'cause I don't want Jackson to get in trouble. VEDANTAM: This is especially dark because as the parents find out later, Reagan actually did do it. Jackson is clearly out of his depth. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Jackson, how do you think this happened? JACKSON: I do it. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: You did it? JACKSON: Yeah. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: You did do it. VEDANTAM: But when mom reminds him there're going to be consequences, he points at his sister and she points at him. Reagan reminds her mother that her brother has already incriminated himself. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)REAGAN: Jackson said, yes, he did it. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: He doesn't know what he's saying right now, I don't think. VEDANTAM: Like it or not, lying and deception are part of being human. It takes a certain degree of smarts to lie. Like Reagan, you have to guess what's happening inside another person's mind before you can tell an effective lie. YouTube is filled with videos of parents capturing moments of young children lying, learning to lie and flubbing lies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Hey, Brentley (ph), did you get into the Nutella? BRENTLEY: No. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: You didn't, really? BRENTLEY: No. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Promise? BRENTLEY: No. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: So that light switch fell off the wall, right? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: It was a raccoon. It opened up the door. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: So the raccoon opened this door here? So he unlocked it? FRANCESCA GINO: I have a child who's 3. And what is interesting about this age is that their brains are on fire. VEDANTAM: This is Francesca Gino. She's a professor at Harvard Business School. Francesca studies deception, among lots of other things. Her son is just starting to tell little lies. And she finds it fascinating. GINO: It's very interesting as a parent because I think about my own research on what happens when people cross ethical boundaries but they do so in creative ways. VEDANTAM: Francesca has found that when cheating is creative, or perhaps cute, we tend to judge it less harshly. It's almost as if we admire liars for coming up with clever lies. GINO: And so I find myself looking at my son sometimes deceiving me, telling me that the light on his alarm clock is on when I know that it's not, and I want to reward the creative excuses and descriptions of his behavior. But at the same time, I feel like it's deception and it should be punished or noticed. VEDANTAM: We're going to devote this episode to talking about lying and cheating. It's a rich subject for research among social scientists. And it turns out to be far more complicated than we think. We lie and cheat to get ahead, sure. But we can also do those things out of a misplaced sense of altruism. Anya Samek once ran a study looking at cheating among adults. She got them into a laboratory to play a game where each person had to flip two coins. If both landed heads, the volunteer won a prize. ANYA SAMEK: So in this game, you flip two coins in private. But the researcher actually leaves the room during the game. And so you're free to report any outcome you want. You're not told that you can act dishonest. But you definitely can act dishonest because nobody is in the room and observing you. VEDANTAM: The researchers couldn't tell who lied and cheated. But they could tell how many people lied and cheated. How? They used math. The laws of probability predict two coins will come down heads 25 percent of the time. But when Anya ran the experiment with hundreds of adults. . . SAMEK: We actually find that people cheat a lot. So we expect 25 percent of the time, people will win. They actually win 40 percent of the time. VEDANTAM: But here's the thing. The details of the situation matter. Some volunteers were allowed to have their children with them as they played. Anya found volunteers cheat less when their kids are around. The gender of the child plays a big role too. SAMEK: We actually see that the entire effect of parents acting more honestly when a child is in the room is driven by daughters. So parents seek to model honest behavior to their daughters but not to their sons. VEDANTAM: It gets even more complicated. Some volunteers were told that they would get the prize if they won. Others were told their children would get the prize. Volunteers were more likely to cheat if they thought their children would benefit. SAMEK: I really don't want to feel like a bad person for acting dishonest. But if I'm acting dishonest to benefit someone else, especially if that's my own child, then I feel a little bit more OK about acting dishonest. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SAMEK: For a long time, we thought that perhaps we had honest people in the world and we had dishonest people in the world. But what we see now is that context actually really matters. VEDANTAM: And we'll explore how in just a moment. Coming up after the break, Dan Pink is going to be back to play Stopwatch Science with me. We'll consider all the other tricky, slippery ways lying and cheating are shaped by social context. DANIEL PINK, BYLINE: If we came back at 3:00 in the afternoon, would we behave differently? In particular, would we act less morally, say, by cheating on our time limits or stealing each other's jokes? VEDANTAM: Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. I'm joined now by Daniel Pink. He's the author of several books on human behavior. But on our show, his title is senior Stopwatch Science correspondent. Welcome, Dan. PINK: Thank you, Shankar. VEDANTAM: On Stopwatch Science, Dan and I give one another 60 seconds to summarize interesting social science research. As we approach the 60-second mark, our producers bring up the music just like they do at the Oscars. Our topic today is cheating. Why we cheat, when we cheat, what happens when we cheat? Now, Dan and I are widely known as ethical men. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: So the only way we know anything about cheating is by reading social science experiments on cheating. Right, Dan? PINK: That's absolutely right. I read these studies, and I was just shocked that people actually cheat. VEDANTAM: Shocked, absolutely shocked. All right, Dan. So what do you have for us today? PINK: Well, before I start, Shankar, I've got two questions for you, right? I want you to look at the clock here in the HIDDEN BRAIN studio. As we're recording this, what time is it? VEDANTAM: It's 11 o'clock in the morning. PINK: OK, great. So now I'm ready to start. VEDANTAM: All right, Dan, your first 60 seconds starts right now. PINK: And I have another question. If we came back at 3:00 in the afternoon, would we behave differently? In particular, would we act less morally, say, by cheating on our time limits or stealing each other's jokes? In four experiments, Maryam Kouchaki of Harvard and Isaac Smith of Cornell pose that question. Does time of day affect our ethical behavior? They found that participants in the morning sessions of their experiments were less likely to lie and cheat than similar participants in the exact same experiments later in the day. And the effect was strongest for people who were the most morally aware. Kouchaki and Smith call it the morning morality effect. VEDANTAM: I love it. PINK: They speculate that all the decisions and choices we make during the day eventually wear us down and deplete our moral reserves. So in the morning when we're fresh, we tend to do the right thing. But as the day goes on, temptations become more tempting and good behavior can turn bad. VEDANTAM: I like this because it's obviously other work, which shows that people tend to melt down closer to the end of the day. Your resources feel like they've been depleted. You're exhausted. The pilot sort of has to take a break. That's when the autopilot kicks in. And that's when bad things happen. PINK: Yeah, and if we're going to make moral decisions, make them in the morning. So here we are in the morning. Let's see how moral you are, and can you stick to your 60 seconds, which begins right now? VEDANTAM: A guiding principle in sociology and social psychology is that the context matters. We believe that we're autonomous, self-directed individuals when really, we're shaped in very powerful ways by the situation. Leslie John at Harvard along with her colleagues George Loewenstein and Scott Rick recently looked at how social comparisons affect the likelihood of cheating. And they find it in a couple of experiments that cheating might be less about having the opportunity to gain a lot as much as it's about finding yourself in a situation where you're aware that others are doing much better than you. Volunteers who are unaware that others are financially better off than they are cheat less than volunteers who are aware that others are financially better off. One implication of this research, if you run an organization where people are compensated very differently, making those pay disparities public and salient can potentially increase the risk of cheating in the workplace. PINK: Oh, interesting because, I mean, people are exquisitely attuned to the norm of fairness. VEDANTAM: Exactly. And again, this is not what standard economic theory would predict. The standard theory might say we will cheat when we have access to cheating and when we can get away with it. Whereas what this is suggesting is really you need a behavioral lens to understand how people actually behave in economic situations. All right, let's go to your next study. Your next 60 seconds starts right now. PINK: Steroids, blood doping, stolen playbooks, they're essential parts of Stopwatch Science. No. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: We all know that some people will cheat to win. But does winning also lead to cheating? Last year, Amos Schurr at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and Ilana Ritov of Hebrew University in Jerusalem decided to find out. First, they had participants compete in an estimation contest. The winners received ear buds, the losers, nothing. Then a bit later, everyone squared off in an unrelated dice game. In that second competition, the winners in the first contest cheated much more than those who'd lost. So winning makes us cheat, right? Well, not quite. In later experiments, people who'd won a lottery for ear buds, that is they won by chance, and then played the dice game, cheated less. What's going on here? One reason, these researchers say, is the ferocious power, once again, of social comparison. Succeeding makes us feel good. But beating someone else makes us feel really good. Comparing ourselves to others and coming out on top creates a sense of entitlement. And when we feel entitled, we cheat more because, of course, the rules don't apply to awesome people like us. VEDANTAM: So I have to say, Dan, the study by Leslie John finds that people cheat more when they compared to themselves to others who are doing better than they are. And the study that you've just cited is that people cheat more when they compare to people who are doing less well than they have whom they've beaten in the competition. So basically. . . PINK: People cheat (laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . People cheat. And people cheat all the time. Now, I guess you can look at this and say people cheat all the time. But I think a better way of looking at this is to say that social comparisons are actually central to cheating. When we feel like others are ahead, we feel entitled to do what it takes to catch up. When we feel we're ahead, we feel entitled to stay ahead. PINK: I think that's exactly right. And I think it's something that we don't factor into our own decision-making. We need to take that into account. Now, you have some social comparison here, Shankar, because I nailed my time. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: You have to see whether you can too. VEDANTAM: All right, here's the final piece of the puzzle. And I have to say, this whole exercise looking into cheating has left me feeling much worse about human nature, Dan. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Nicole Ruedy at the University of Washington, along with Celia Moore, Maurice Schweitzer and, yes, Francesca Gino again, find that cheaters who get away with cheating are often not wracked by guilt. They actually experience a cheater's high. . . PINK: Oh, boy. VEDANTAM: . . . A sense of euphoria. In several experiments, the researchers find that people believe they will feel badly if they cheat. But once they cheat and get away with it, they often feel secretly happier than they did before. Now, this is a profoundly depressing study because it upturns every moral framework I've been taught since I was a kid. What happens if cheaters go through their days not feeling torn and guilty and miserable but secretly happy? Where's the justice in that, Dan? PINK: I do not see any justice in the cheater's high. It just - I'm with you in that. That just makes me shake my head in disbelief and want to go cheat. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: What can we do about this? Is cheating something that's going to run rampant? VEDANTAM: Yeah, and, you know, it raises the question that part of the reason we cheat may not be for the financial and material benefits but the psychological benefits. If cheating makes you happy, doesn't that serve as an incentive for even more cheating? PINK: It seems like it. Again, I'm going to leave this feeling dim about the human condition. VEDANTAM: All right, so there you have it. Cheating is more likely later in the day than earlier. Feeling like others are getting ahead of you increases your propensity to want to cheat. Doing better than others in a competition can make you more likely to cheat because you feel your brilliance entitles you to more of the pie. Depressingly and horrifyingly, and I hope no small children are listening to this right now, cheating can make you happy. This is probably why Voltaire said that if God does not exist, it would be necessary to invent him. Dan Pink, thank you for joining me on Stopwatch Science today. PINK: Always a pleasure, especially when you quote Voltaire. VEDANTAM: This episode of HIDDEN BRAIN was produced by Chris Benderev and Max Nesterak and edited by Jenny Schmidt.

When we feel we're ahead, we feel entitled to stay ahead. PINK: I think that's exactly right. And I think it's something that we don't factor into our own decision-making. We need to take that into account. Now, you have some social comparison here, Shankar, because I nailed my time. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: You have to see whether you can too. VEDANTAM: All right, here's the final piece of the puzzle. And I have to say, this whole exercise looking into cheating has left me feeling much worse about human nature, Dan. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Nicole Ruedy at the University of Washington, along with Celia Moore, Maurice Schweitzer and, yes, Francesca Gino again, find that cheaters who get away with cheating are often not wracked by guilt. They actually experience a cheater's high. . . PINK: Oh, boy. VEDANTAM: . . . A sense of euphoria. In several experiments, the researchers find that people believe they will feel badly if they cheat. But once they cheat and get away with it, they often feel secretly happier than they did before. Now, this is a profoundly depressing study because it upturns every moral framework I've been taught since I was a kid. What happens if cheaters go through their days not feeling torn and guilty and miserable but secretly happy? Where's the justice in that, Dan? PINK: I do not see any justice in the cheater's high. It just - I'm with you in that. That just makes me shake my head in disbelief and want to go cheat. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: What can we do about this? Is cheating something that's going to run rampant? VEDANTAM: Yeah, and, you know, it raises the question that part of the reason we cheat may not be for the financial and material benefits but the psychological benefits. If cheating makes you happy, doesn't that serve as an incentive for even more cheating? PINK: It seems like it. Again, I'm going to leave this feeling dim about the human condition. VEDANTAM: All right, so there you have it. Cheating is more likely later in the day than earlier. Feeling like others are getting ahead of you increases your propensity to want to cheat. Doing better than others in a competition can make you more likely to cheat because you feel your brilliance entitles you to more of the pie. Depressingly and horrifyingly, and I hope no small children are listening to this right now, cheating can make you happy. This is probably why Voltaire said that if God does not exist, it would be necessary to invent him. Dan Pink, thank you for joining me on Stopwatch Science today. PINK: Always a pleasure, especially when you quote Voltaire. VEDANTAM: This episode of HIDDEN BRAIN was produced by Chris Benderev and Max Nesterak and edited by Jenny Schmidt.

(SOUNDBITE OF COYOTES)GREENE: Those are coyotes in Colorado, recorded by the National Park Service as part of its project to capture natural soundscapes. We're doing a series on the centennial of the national parks. And as part of that series, NPR's Christopher Joyce and audio producer Bill McQuay from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology went soundscaping. And they discovered how hard it is to escape the noise of humanity. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Colorado's Great Sand Dunes National Park is like a 30-square-mile patch of the Sahara Desert that somehow ended up at the foot of snow-capped mountains. Bill and I arrived during a pounding hail storm and ducked into the park's visitor center. We were there to meet biologist Kurt Fristrup. He's the mastermind of the park service's soundscape project. He arrived with hail stuck in his blond hair. KURT FRISTRUP: The weather here can change very quickly. This particular thunderstorm - I thought a lot about trying to find cover. JOYCE: Fristrup has collected a staggering amount of sound from more than 70 national parks. Bill and I wondered why. Fristrup explains that the Park Service has been concerned about human noise in national parks. BILL MCQUAY: Helicopters, off-road vehicles, nearby road traffic, airplanes - the sound of us, basically. JOYCE: Was it diminishing the park experience for people? FRISTRUP: We're interested in you being able to hear the sound of a squirrel scurrying through the leaf litter a hundred feet away, you know, and other things like that. These are the small moments that can really connect you with the park. MCQUAY: So Fristrup started putting microphones in the parks to detect human-made sound leaking in. FRISTRUP: So the signature challenge for the Park Service is how you bring people to these places without destroying the essential qualities that made the park worth founding in the first place. MCQUAY: As an audio producer, I also wanted to know how Fristrup's team captures soundscapes. I traveled about 250 miles north of Great Sand Dunes to Rocky Mountain National Park. I hiked up into the high country with Jacob Job, a biologist with Colorado State University. Job carries a portable digital recorder, microphones, batteries - 30 pounds in his backpack. He looks for just the right place. JACOB JOB: I don't feel like I see the place first. I feel like I hear the place first. MCQUAY: Job and I set up our recorders on tripods in an area called Moraine Park. It's a grassy valley with sharp peaks all around. JOB: I just had seen these small trees sitting out here. And I figured it might attract some birds. And sure enough, a bit of a wetland - all kinds of stuff. MCQUAY: Soon we've gotten ravens, black birds - then, a group of wild turkeys walks right by us. Normally, Job collects several days of sound. Computers help sort through all of it. It's a lot of work but for Job, a work of love. JOB: So I think if we start to lose sounds of wilderness, we start to lose a piece of us. And I think that really hits at us at a place - we don't really fully understand what is very important. (SOUNDBITE OF PROPELLER PLANE)MCQUAY: Less than an hour into our recording, the sound of a machine breaks the spell. JOB: This is a prop plane. And this is one of the things we deal with on a constant basis. You kind of get - shift back into reality. (SOUNDBITE OF PROPELLER PLANE)JOYCE: Human-made sound is everywhere in parks. Fristrup's team found that on any given day, you can hear some form of it 25 percent of the time. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAFFIC)JOYCE: Even back at Great Sand Dunes Park, a place known for its silence, Bill and I had a heck of a time escaping human-made sound. MCQUAY: Highway traffic and, of course, tourists, even on a cold, blustery day. JOYCE: So we decided to climb up into the dunes with Fristrup. To do that, first, we had to cross a fast-moving, shallow stream. (SOUNDBITE OF STREAM)JOYCE: All right. I think I'm going to have to take my shoes off to do this. Oh yeah, that's cold. FRISTRUP: (Laughter) Straight from the mountain snows to you. JOYCE: You approach this place. And what you see in front of you is this enormous sandbox. FRISTRUP: It's so unusual. It looks unreal to me. It just looks strange, like it's been painted there. You can see there's depth, but the texture just is so odd. Wow. JOYCE: That'll be blowing around 40 right now. FRISTRUP: It is blowing. JOYCE: Once we reach the dunes, we climb. They rise over 700 feet - the highest dunes in North America. We duck behind a dune. Oh, nice and deep. FRISTRUP: (Laughter). JOYCE: Oh, that's soft. FRISTRUP: Yeah. MCQUAY: Just below the crest of the dune, the howl of the wind dies to a whisper. The sand absorbs the sound like a sponge. JOYCE: On a calm day, Fristrup says it's the kind of quiet that animals experience when we're not around. And that's something that Fristrup has been thinking about. Animals evolved for millions of years in natural soundscapes. How does our sound affect them? He and other scientists have conducted experiments to test that idea. They found that if you add just a few decibels of unnatural sound, like a distant highway, it throws animals off-kilter. FRISTRUP: I think it's in the 30s or 40 percent of the natural areas - sound levels are 3 dB higher than they would be. You imagine, you know, the owl looking for your dinner. A 3 dB increase in background sound level cuts in half the area in which you could possibly hear those sounds. And so you're half as efficient in finding food with a relatively subtle increase in background sound level. JOYCE: And prey animals, like small birds, have a harder time hearing predators. And all animals need to hear to communicate. Fristrup is optimistic, though, that park managers can do something about all this noise. FRISTRUP: Natural soundscapes can be fully restored as soon as we are smarter about where we put our noise sources. JOYCE: Electric vehicles are quieter. Planes can be routed away from parks. Off-road vehicles already are limited in some parks. And soundscapes are starting to win some respect. A few years ago, an oil and gas operation wanted to drill near Great Sand Dunes. An environmental group argued that the Dunes's silence was unique and sued to stop the project. And a judge agreed. FRISTRUP: It's not a common story here in the - out in the West. But this is one of the cases where noise actually played a role in land use decisions. JOYCE: Fristrup says soundscapes can be protected. FRISTRUP: The good news is that there are a lot of places where those noise events are infrequent enough that you get many, many minutes - sometimes a few hours - of noise-free time. MCQUAY: So next time you're in a national park, stop. . . JOYCE: . . . And listen. Christopher Joyce, NPR News. MCQUAY: And Bill McQuay, Cornell Lab of Ornithology.

There is also income, which is one of the most persistent disparities. Children from more affluent families do better in school on average than children from poor families. And there's new social science research exploring why this is the case. To talk about it, I'm joined by NPR social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam. Hey, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So dig into this research for us. What are we learning here? VEDANTAM: Well, we've known for a very long time that family income really matters. This could be because schools in richer neighborhoods are better schools. But it could also be that rich parents are able to give their children more learning opportunities outside of school. I was speaking with the economist Barbara Wulf. She's at the University of Wisconsin. Along with Jason Fletcher, she recently decided to explore another explanation. She asked if income disparities might also be linked to disparities in what are sometimes called non-cognitive skills. Many researchers think that it's these skills that undergird not just academic performance in school but a host of other abilities later in life, including in the workplace. Here's Wulf. BARBARA WULF: When we think about who is a good employee and who's likely to succeed in the workplace, you hear a lot of attention paid to these what I'll call non-cognitive skills. So they pay attention, they are persistent, they are eager. So they have a set of characteristics that make them good employees. GREENE: OK. So people who have these non-cognitive skills - better employees. But tie this to American education and sort of the income disparity. VEDANTAM: Wulf and Fletcher analyzed data from a national survey, David, that tracked children from kindergarten through the fifth grade. The survey data allowed the researchers to track the effects of family income on what parents and teachers were reporting about these children as they went through elementary school. The researchers find there's a very strong correlation between family income and these non-cognitive skills. In other words, when it comes to being cooperative or dealing with conflict productively, children from wealthier families on average seem to have more of these skills than children from poorer families. GREENE: OK. So this is actually making the connection. We've always known that there's this income disparity. Now we're sort of understanding that income disparity might be because if you're less affluent, I mean, you're just not developing these skills you're talking about. VEDANTAM: Yes. And the question of course is why is this happening? Why are children from richer families demonstrating more of these skills? The most obvious explanation, David, is that poverty creates stresses in people's lives. If you have Mom or Dad working two jobs to make ends meet, it's going to be harder for Mom and Dad to be spending time helping children develop these kinds of non-cognitive skills. Wulf also said there's evidence of peer effects, meaning that if you're a kid who lacks these skills it would be helpful to be around kids who have the skills. But the way our schools are set up, children in poor families tend to live in poor neighborhoods, which means that their classmates at schools are also likely to come from poor families. Here's Wulf. WULF: So if we were to have individuals who attend schools where other children are doing better, they themselves would be likely to do better. VEDANTAM: One implication of this work, David, is that a lot of schools currently track scores in things like math or reading. Not many are systematically tracking these non-cognitive skills, seeing how they change over time and systematically trying to teach those skills. And yet, it may be that those skills are actually central, not just for doing well at school but doing well throughout life. GREENE: Especially if you catch them early and then maybe you'll see better math and reading scores later on in schooling. VEDANTAM: Exactly. GREENE: All right. Shankar, thanks as always.

Some of them are charming, like dragonflies or ladybugs. Others - just a little aggravating, like mosquitoes or ticks. But we think of all of them as interesting, which is why we're running a series this summer - What's Bugging You? We'll feature a new bug every few weeks, starting now with a summer classic, the firefly. Sara Lewis is an evolutionary ecologist at Tufts University. SARA LEWIS: And I have been researching fireflies for about three decades. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LEWIS: What is it that we find so magical about fireflies? They have this ability to transform what looks like an ordinary landscape - you know, your backyard, your lawn, a hillside - into something ethereal and otherworldly. A lot of people recognize that they're watching the mating dance - the courtship dance - of fireflies. And, you know, it all seems very romantic. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LEWIS: But there's a dark side to fireflies. We have discovered that their light first evolved as a warning signal, a way of flashing out like a neon sign - I'm toxic. Stay away. And it turns out that in North America, there's one particular group of fireflies. Their name is Photuris. And these fireflies have evolved a way to mimic the courtship signals of other fireflies. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LEWIS: Jim Lloyd, the scientist who discovered this behavior by going out in the field - he found that when he thought he was looking at the female response to the males that were flying all around him, he'd get closer and closer, and finally he'd find this one little bug lighting up on a leaf. And he'd take a closer look, and he discovered that what had been flashing was a predatory female. By very, very accurately mimicking these courtship signals, they're able to lure in the flying males. The males come closer and closer and closer until finally these predatory females are able to reach out, grab the prey male. And once they grab the male, they sink their sharp jaws into his shoulder. The blood oozes out. Firefly blood is white. They basically drink the prey's blood, and then they spend about the next hour slowly chewing up all the soft bits, spitting out the hard bits until there's just a pile of scattered remains. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LEWIS: Jim Lloyd, the scientist who discovered this behavior, he said, you know, if Photuris were the size of house cats, people would be afraid to go outside at night. And it's absolutely true. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SIMON: Quite a love story. Sara Lewis is an evolutionary ecologist.

So if you happen to be heading to Jupiter, you better bring your own navigation tools. NPR's Joe Palca has been describing how inventions solve problems as part of his series, Joe's Big Idea. And today he has the story of a device that is critical for NASA's Juno spacecraft to navigate its way to Jupiter. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Getting around on Earth is relatively straightforward. (SOUNDBITE OF NASA DOCUMENTARY)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: On Earth, we move between points which remain fixed relative to each other. PALCA: But as this 1967 NASA documentary pointed out, finding your way around in space presents a whole new set of challenges, challenges scientists and engineers were going to have to overcome. (SOUNDBITE OF NASA DOCUMENTARY)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: Eventually, man will set out toward another planet millions of miles distant. The instruments and techniques of modern science will guide his spacecraft with an accuracy and precision inconceivable to earthbound navigators. PALCA: John Leif Jorgensen has spent a career pursuing that kind of accuracy and precision. He's at the Technical University of Denmark. He says if you want to go to Jupiter, for example, you have to know exactly where Jupiter is, but you also have to figure out where you are. JOHN JORGENSEN: The problem in space is there's no up and down. So the only real reliable source to find your orientation is where's the sun. PALCA: But knowing where the sun is isn't enough. You need another reference point. And Jorgensen says fortunately, there are plenty of reference points out there - stars. There are two reasons stars are good for spacecraft navigation. One, they don't move around, and two -JORGENSEN: It's always night up in space, so we can always see stars. PALCA: To navigate by the stars, Jorgensen builds instruments called star trackers. A star tracker is essentially a camera with a built-in star catalog. It looks at a patch of sky and picks out stars it knows and tells the spacecraft which way it's pointing, its orientation. So now it knows that Jupiter is, say, ahead and to the right and Earth is below and to the left. And that's important information for a spacecraft like Juno. JORGENSEN: Know where to point the antenna, the telescopes and stuff like that. PALCA: But from a navigating standpoint, there's still a problem. JORGENSEN: It doesn't give you the position. PALCA: Position is different from orientation. Orientation tells you where you're pointed. Position tells you where you are in space, how far you are from the Earth and the Sun and Jupiter. JORGENSEN: To find the position when you go deep space, like on Juno, you need to have help from somewhere. PALCA: The help comes from something called the Deep Space Network. These are three large radio antennas, one in California, one in Australia and one in Spain. They receive radio signals from Juno and use those to figure out where the probe is and how fast it's moving. JORGENSEN: And that works beautifully for deep space spacecraft. It's just that it is relatively expensive to track a satellite with a big dish antenna. So people have been looking for different ways of navigating. That's a problem you also can solve with the star tracker. PALCA: Jorgensen is working on an advanced version of the star tracker that can navigate all on its own. That's for the future. NASA is still using the Deep Space Network to guide Juno on its path. There are actually four of Jorgensen's star trackers on Juno, but they aren't being used for navigation. His are extremely high-precision, and they're being used by one of Juno's instruments to know precisely where it's pointing as it maps the planet's magnetic field. After all, if you've gone all that way to Jupiter, you don't want to make an inaccurate map. Joe Palca, NPR News. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  In space, there are no road maps.

I'm Rachel Martin. When Vice President Joe Biden announced last October that he would not run for president again, he said he did have one regret. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOE BIDEN: If I could be anything, I would've wanted to be the president that ended cancer because it's possible. MARTIN: In his last months in the White House as vice president, he's leading the charge to make that happen. In his State of the Union address in January, President Obama tapped Biden to head up the administration's so-called cancer moonshot. It's a reference to the U. S. mission to be the first country to land on the moon. Curing cancer may end up being an even more audacious goal because it requires bringing together a whole host of government agencies, drug companies, research institutes, other medical groups and getting them all on the same page. Vice President Biden has spent the last few months visiting cancer centers across the country. And on Thursday, we sat down with him at the Langston Hughes Community Health and Education Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Mr. Vice President, thank you so much for sitting down with us. BIDEN: Delighted to be with you. MARTIN: We all know cancer is not just one disease. It's dozens, if not hundreds. . . BIDEN: It's over 200. MARTIN: . . . Of different diseases, which means there's not just one cure. There are likely dozens, if not hundreds of different cures. You've tagged a billion dollars for this initiative. The annual budget for the National Cancer Institute, as you know, is $5. 2 billion a year. BIDEN: Yeah. MARTIN: So is a billion dollars enough to do what you need to do? BIDEN: No, it's not. And here's the deal - it's more than the money. There's an awful lot of duplication. There's very little - there's not nearly enough collaboration. There's not nearly enough joint science. And what's happened in the last five years - we've reached an inflection point. I know you're tired of hearing me use that phrase, but it's true that we now are understanding where you have genomicists working with the oncologists, working with virologists, working with chemical and biological engineers, working with immunotherapy. And so there's multiple sources of attack. There's across-the-borders prevention. It is collaboration - we can move more quickly - as well as new research development and new breakthroughs. MARTIN: But some would say, why not then just focus on one of those pieces? Why not put all the money into prevention? BIDEN: Because you have to - you - it's awful hard to say to someone, you've got breast cancer, God forbid. You know, we're not going to focus on dealing with your breast cancer, even though we can. We've found genetic markers. We've found a lot of other things. Because we did, we're just going to focus on prevention. So I know you're going to die but, you know, lots of luck in your senior year. You can't do that. You've got to do it all. You've got to do it all at the same time. MARTIN: It's a strange language one learns when dealing with cancer. BIDEN: It is. It is. MARTIN: Going through that with a loved one, you learn more than you ever thought you would. Have you thought about how something in this initiative could have changed things for your son? Beau Biden died almost a year ago of brain cancer. BIDEN: A year ago on Memorial Day. The answer is I learned when I lost my wife and daughter - and a tractor-trailer broadsided them - I decided that there is no answer why - why me, or what could have happened? I find it to be a - not a useful exercise. I think he got the best - I know he got the best care he could possibly have gotten. And the particular disease he had is particularly pernicious. And not much research is being done on it - glioblastoma - in relative terms. And so I don't sit and say, you know, if I had been somewhere else or if this had happened. But I do know this. I do know that there is the overwhelming prospect in the next year or two, three, four, five, you're going to see significant breakthroughs for certain types of cancers as well as significant breakthroughs in terms of how to turn cancer into a chronic disease as opposed to a life-threatening disease. MARTIN: We only have a couple moments left. And we are talking in the middle of a presidential election. There's just a couple of weeks. . . BIDEN: . . . Is that right? MARTIN: Yeah, I don't know if you've heard. BIDEN: Oh (laughter). MARTIN: Yeah, kind of a big deal. Couple weeks till the conventions. Your candidate, the presumptive Democratic nominee. . . BIDEN: She is my candidate. MARTIN: . . . Hillary Clinton - there is still a cloud over her in terms of whether or not she will face an indictment for her use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. BIDEN: Under the law. . . MARTIN: . . . Do you think she did anything wrong? BIDEN: Under the law - I can't comment on that for the following reason. If I comment and tell you what I think, which is positive, then the easy accusation would be Biden is vice president and probably put pressure on one of the government agencies to keep that from happening. The president and I have kept our hands off completely. What we do know is that she is incredibly - by leaps and bounds more qualified than the other person to be the president of the United States. I've known her for 40 years. I'm a friend of hers. And I don't - I find it hard to believe that she would do anything intentionally wrong. MARTIN: She is now neck-and-neck with the GOP presumptive nominee. . . BIDEN: That's true. MARTIN: . . . Donald Trump, in a recent Quinnipiac poll. A lot of Americans still don't trust her. That is the word they cite. There's a trust gap when it comes to Hillary Clinton. You're taking her home, I understand, next week. BIDEN: I am. MARTIN: You're taking her to Scranton, Pa. on the campaign trail. BIDEN: Yes, yes. MARTIN: How do you help her fix that? Do you think those perceptions of her are fair, this idea? BIDEN: I don't think they're fair. But I acknowledge they're there, and I think - I hope that I help her just by vouching for her. I mean, most folks back home know me. And they know my shortcomings, and I have a lot of them (laughter). And they know my strengths. When you vouch for them you say, I'm putting my reputation on the line. I believe this person is a good person, has character. That's what I'm prepared to do for Hillary. MARTIN: Why have those perceptions lingered around her? BIDEN: Well, the truth is I don't know. I think it is in part because she has been the center of a storm for a long, long time. I don't know that anybody's ever had as much focus on them for over - many, many years. But I think it's - I think she can and will, quote, \"cure\" that problem. And the more people see her in a context where it's a head-to-head race and she's laying out who she is and what she does - and, you know, I think right now it's - I know it's - this is good and bad. It's awfully early in the campaign. MARTIN: But, you know, this primary season has been a bitter one. And people always say that it sounds like a cliche, but Bernie Sanders has yet to endorse her officially, he hasn't conceded. . . BIDEN: . . . Well, I've talked to Bernie. Bernie's going to endorse her. This is going to work out. You can already notice in that same polling data reference is the Democrats are coalescing even before this occurs. It's. . . MARTIN: . . . You think she has it in her to be the great unifier? Not just of the Democratic Party, but of an American public that is more divided than ever? BIDEN: I think she is totally equipped to be a unifier. Look, I have spent - sometimes being a unifier is - when you guys talk about me, you sometimes think I'm too much of a unifier. You think that I reach out too much to my Republican colleagues. And I think that if you look at - how can I say this? - let me give you a case in point, the refusal of the Republican Party to even hold a hearing for the Supreme Court nominee who everybody says is qualified, including them. I called 17 of my Republican colleagues and I said, you know, you guys know this is wrong. And they go, yeah, I do know, Joe. I do know. But I can't be the first to break because Joe, all that big money is going to come in and they'll primary me here. They will do this to me and do that to me. Part of the problem is the system is a little bit broken right now. I know you talk about - and not you. I don't mean that in a specific way. But I know you in a notarial sense talk about Hillary's, you know, negatives. But my lord, Trump is at what, 70 percent negative? Or whatever - it's a gigantic number. I mean, and people think. . . MARTIN: . . . The American people don't like either candidate so much. BIDEN: But they like one a lot more than the other. And, you know, that whole expression, the proof of the pudding is in the eating - I think as this campaign goes forward, it's going to become clearer and clearer to people as they focus and they don't just listen to the negative advertisement. At least, that's my hope. MARTIN: If you will permit me one more question. BIDEN: Sure. MARTIN: I got the one-minute wrap. But a moon landing is something very different than fixing and solving cancer. BIDEN: In a sense, it's almost. . . MARTIN: . . . There was a flag. There was a moment America was watching on TV. That moonshot was easy to measure. How do you measure this? BIDEN: Well, there will be a flag when, for example, we find out that there are no more stovepipes, where you have all these private organizations aggregating data of genomic sequencing and biopsies and lifestyles in one place instead of each of them having their own little thing. MARTIN: These will be incremental victories for you personally. BIDEN: Yeah - but no, I think they'll be more than incremental. I think you can begin to see as a consequence of these institutional changes that I expect to take place - I think you'll see breakthroughs occurring really much more rapidly. I think you're going to see over the next three, four years a number of vaccines developed that actually prevent cancer from occurring. You're already seeing things that I think you're going to see - I'm not a scientist, but what I've tried to learn as much as I can - I think you're going to see the ability to take a blood test and determine whether you have a marker for cancer and prevent it from happening. And I think you're going to see a whole range of changes that take place in the treatment of cancers. There's just so many things that are sitting there on the cusp that I really believe in the next two to five years you're going to see significant changes where people say you know, if I'd gotten that cancer five years ago I'd be dead. Now I'm alive and I'm going to be able to make it. I really think you're going to see that. MARTIN: Vice President Joe Biden, thank you so much for your time. BIDEN: Thank you. I appreciate it.

We're putting together a podcast episode about vacations. Do you have a funny story about a vacation that went terribly wrong? Call and tell us about it at 661-772-7246. That's 661-77BRAIN. Enjoy the show. This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Several months ago, I noticed one of my colleagues taking breaks from work during the day. At first, I thought Max Nesterak was trying to build some exercise into his schedule. Good for him, I thought. But when I asked him about it, he confessed that he was stepping outside to smoke. We did a podcast episode about New Year's resolutions and Max's resolution to quit smoking at the start of the year. MAX NESTERAK, BYLINE: It's 2016, and I have not spoke for two minutes. VEDANTAM: Lots of you have written and phoned and emailed to ask how Max is doing and whether he's managed to stick to his resolution. NESTERAK: Ah, I really want a cigarette. VEDANTAM: Yeah, about that - we'll get to it in a few minutes. Today we're going to talk about Max's story and three interventions I suggested to help him quit smoking. You can apply these ideas in your own life, whether that's giving up smoking or that three-latte-a-day Starbucks habit. When Max decided to quit, he and I sat down to chat. I asked him how he became a smoker and what cigarettes meant to him. So you told me that you started smoking when you were 14 or 15 years old. NESTERAK: Yeah. VEDANTAM: That seems shockingly young to me. NESTERAK: It seems shockingly young to me, too. I should say the first cigarette I actually smoked, I was 10 years old. It was Christmas. And my aunt smoked, so they would be on the back patio, you know, shivering outside. And, you know, I'm like - I wonder what it's like to smoke a cigarette. And my dad was like - sure, go ahead. Join Aunt Doe (ph) and, you know, Cousin Jenny and have a cigarette. And so I went outside, and I had a cigarette. And I think his hope was that, you know, I would just vomit or just get so sick that I would never do it again because he never - you know, he never touched cigarettes. But, you know, I never did. And I - you know, it didn't really have an effect. I was a little buzzed. VEDANTAM: Did you like it? NESTERAK: I did like it. I thought I liked it. I mean, I liked, you know, being there, like, with my family outside smoking. I felt kind of cool. And all the other cousins who were my age were kind of, like, peering out of the patio behind the glass door, the safety of the nonsmoking kitchen nook. And just like - what is Max doing? And there I was in my coat huddling with the other ostracized family member smokers. VEDANTAM: What did your mom say about this? My mom, I think, rolled her eyes. And she was like I can't believe your dad said this was OK. But I hope you vomit, too. VEDANTAM: But, as Max said, he did vomit. In fact, he liked smoking. A few years later, when he was a freshman in high school, he asked an older friend to buy him a pack of cigarettes. He began smoking regularly. NESTERAK: I used to take the dog on walks. And that was, like, my smoke break. And so I think, you know, starting around age, you know, 14, that dog got so many walks a day. Or like. . . (LAUGHTER)NESTERAK: It got increasingly more exercise as the years went on. VEDANTAM: So a scientist would say there was an inverse relationship between the dog's health and your health. NESTERAK: Correct. Yes, I think that's an apt description. VEDANTAM: As he's gotten older, Max says he's become aware of the stigma around smoking. It didn't stop him, but it did make him think twice about telling friends and co-workers about his habit. NESTERAK: I don't think it makes me cooler or more interesting. And generally, I think when I first meet people, I'm not afraid of being judged. But it's just something that's, like - yeah, it's not something I just want to share right off the bat. VEDANTAM: But if there's a social stigma to smoking, there are also social benefits. One thing Max and I discussed was the smokers club that forms outside of offices and libraries. You see the same people congregating every day, chatting as they smoke. I mean, that's very profound, psychologically speaking, if you're constantly meeting people only at the times that you're doing something that you enjoy. Those are people you're going to associate, in a Pavlovian fashion, with the thing that you enjoy. You're going to be forming friendships with them. And other friendships keep you in that world. NESTERAK: Yeah. I think it's same with activities. I mean, the more you smoke, the better life gets in a way (laughter). I mean, smoking and television, smoking and eating breakfast, smoking and eating ice cream. But I think that's true with people - that there is, like, this shared bond where you're out on the break. And right, the pleasure center is being activated and - while you're talking. So you probably think, you know, the conversation is better. I think it's the same as when people go out to the bar to happy hour together, and they have drinks. There's this bond that's formed that's - that just wouldn't be formed at work around the water cooler in a way. VEDANTAM: There are other clubs you get to join when you're a smoker. But of course, smokers like Max tend not to think of those clubs when they're smoking. NESTERAK: With smoking, I associate myself with the film noir, the cigarette after dinner, the social smoking, but not the emphysema or lung cancer or oxygen mask part of the game, if you will. VEDANTAM: So that's the interesting thing, of course. And you know all the social science literature on this, which is that the pleasure and the social camaraderie and the friendships are real and immediate, and the potential costs are delayed and distant. And there's just six warehouses filled with psych studies that basically show that when you set up the incentives this way so that the short-term incentives are positive and gratifying and the long-term incentives are horrible, people will ignore the long-term and focus on the short-term. NESTERAK: Yeah, I think there's never a good day to quit smoking, right? You know, there's the part of yourself that wants to wake up at 6 o'clock in the morning, and so you set the alarm clock. The you at 6 o'clock in the morning presses the snooze button 20 times until it's 8 o'clock, and then you're rushing into work, and you're late. And, you know, there's the part myself at night who says, OK, tomorrow I'm going to stop smoking. And then, you wake up and you have one. And then, you're like, well, if I had one, I'm not going to go the rest of the day without - without smoking. So it's easy to weigh the long-term benefits of smoking when you're not craving a cigarette. VEDANTAM: An old smokers' joke says, quitting is easy; I've done it lots of times. Knowing that most people who quit go back to smoking, I suggested that Max do three things to help him stick to his resolution. All were ideas drawn from social science research. First, I asked him to put the money he was spending on smoking - about 6 bucks a day - into a savings account. If he succeeding in quitting at the end of the year, he would be able to go on a nice vacation. But if he started smoking, he would have to donate the money to an organization he detests. Now, I'm not going to identify it, but let's just say max picked an organization that does a lot of lobbying in Washington. Second, I asked him to reach out to a bunch of friends and ask them to be there for him when he needed support. And finally, I asked him to record a public service announcement about why young people should never start smoking. The idea is that when you publicly declare you're against smoking, it makes it hard to start smoking again. It produces cognitive dissonance, makes you feel like a hypocrite. We aired Max's public service announcement in January. Here's an excerpt. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NESTERAK: If you don't smoke, here's what you should know. When you're a smoker, life is lived around cigarettes. You'll be laughing with friends at dinner or totally engrossed in a good book, and something will tug at you. And as much as you want to stay in this moment, you'll be thinking about a cigarette. So you'll get up, walk outside and light up. And it will feel really good, but you'll wish you were back inside, and you'll be so tired of trading off these moments for a smoke. If you don't smoke, you should know that smoking makes a prison out of perfectly normal situations - long flights, concerts, class, anything that lasts longer than a couple of hours. These are your enemy as a smoker. And any time you go on a date or to a job interview or to your grandparents' house, it will be accompanied by a pang of worry. You'll wash your hands and pull your shirt to your nose and hope they can't smell smoke. VEDANTAM: We also asked something from all of you. We asked that you call in with your own stories about how you managed to quit smoking. We were absolutely overwhelmed and moved by your responses. So many of you wrote and called with words of wisdom and encouragement. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Hi, this message is for Max. I was just on my way home listening to the resolutions podcast. And I was actually on the way home from my dad having surgery on his lungs for lung cancer. So I just wanted to wish Max good luck. And hopefully he's able to quit, and this isn't him in 50 years. My dad is 74, so. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: There's no need to badmouth your old self, but best to nurture the new direction with as many creative ways as you can come up with. I have no doubt you will succeed. It's been 28 years since the day I quit. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: The thing that really helped me was not to focus on the whole project, but only on steps. For instance, I kept repeating to me every time I had the urge of going out to smoke a cigarette, well, this one - you're not going to smoke it. So, I mean, I just concentrate my attention and my power on the single cigarette that I was craving. And that way, cigarette by cigarette, I successfully quit it. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: I threw out my cigarettes. And in that moment, I decided that not only was I going to quit smoking, but that I would become a non-smoker right then. And from then on, every time I would want a cigarette, I would ask myself why in the world a nonsmoker would want a cigarette. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Go to the places where you usually buy cigarettes and introduce yourself to the person behind the counter. And just let them know that you're trying to stop smoking. You don't have to tell them not to sell you cigarettes or anything like that, but just say to them that you're trying to stop smoking. It's going to be really hard for you to then go back there and buy cigarettes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: We're going to take a break now. When we come back, we're going to hear from Max. He kept an audio diary as he went along to document his triumphs and setbacks. NESTERAK: It's, like, this mental obsession. So you're kind of like, oh, should I have a granola No, I want to have a cigarette. Should I go for a walk? No, I want to have a cigarette. VEDANTAM: Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)NESTERAK: Quitting smoking is kind of like a really bad break up. At first, I'm OK. I feel relieved, happy even that I finally did it. This isn't so bad. I go to bed that night looking forward to waking up the next day as a new person. Tomorrow is January 1, 2016. It's going to be the first day of the rest of my so-much-better life. Of course, the first thing I think about when I wake up is a cigarette. I plan to go downstairs and poor myself a cup of coffee, bundle up in my winter coat and have the first cigarette of the day, which is, as any smoker will tell you, the best cigarette of the day. Then I remember what I had done - said I would quit smoking. And I do not stop remembering it. I started keeping an audio diary. Here's a clip. (SOUNDBITE OF AUDIO DIARY)NESTERAK: It's just - it's, like, this mental obsession. So you're kind of like, oh, should I have a granola bar? No, I want to have a cigarette. Should I go for a walk? No, I want to have a cigarette? Should I watch a movie? No, I want to have a cigarette. So (laughter) that's - it's just, like, this obsession is all you want, and it's all you can think about. I think back to the early days of the romance, when I would get lightheaded, tingly in my fingers and just feel giddy. I started smoking around the time I realized I was gay. I went to high school in suburban Colorado with a champion football team. And, well, by the time I started smoking at 14, I needed it. Sometimes I would inhale as much as I could, close my eyes and just let my head buzz while I held in the smoke. The withdraw feels like just the opposite. I'm sad and frustrated. My head aches. My muscles tighten up. My thoughts are foggy. I'm acutely aware that there's suffering in the world. When you're having a craving, you just - you don't think that you're ever going to feel differently or have felt differently. I try to embrace it. A craving comes, and I just lean into it. You have to love the burn almost, you know what I mean? Like, you - it sucks. It hurts. And you just kind of lean into it and you're like, yeah, like, this is what quitting feels like. And, yeah, so I'm loving the burn right now - loving, hating the burn right now. I'm chewing sugar-free gum and drinking seltzer water. NESTERAK: These are my sad romance song and cinnamon bun equivalents. I bask in the pain and let my mind do what it wants to do - think about how much it sucks to not have a cigarette. Then I think about something I heard about buffalo - that when Buffalo see a storm coming, they walk towards it rather than away from it because they know they'll get through it faster. I am the buffalo. It's, like, three minutes away from being 48 hours, so it's at the end of day two. Oh, there were some dark moments today. I don't know if I can take another day of this. I think about the money I've said on cigarettes that I'd have to donate to that horrible organization if I smoked. It's actually only $13. I think, if I'm going to relapse, I should do it now while there's so little at stake. Then I think about having to say I failed on this podcast. I google quitting smoking timeline. After 20 minutes, your blood pressure and heart rate will return to normal. After 12 hours, blood-oxygen level has increased to normal. Forty-eight hours - damaged nerve endings start to regrow and anger and irritability have peaked. Seventy-two hours - entire body is free of nicotine, number of cravings have peaked, lung function is improving. I make it to day 3. I go for a run, and I'm surprised at how much my lungs have already recovered. The cravings come less frequently, just like the quitting-smoking websites promise they will. I'm nearly three weeks into quitting smoking now. It's day 20, and the most amazing thing happens. I woke up, and I drank a glass of orange juice. I took a shower. I got dressed. I packed my bag for work. And, you know, as I'm about to head out, I realized that I hadn't thought about a cigarette the entire morning. I had literally gone through my entire routine without once thinking about a cigarette. And, of course, then I was thinking about a cigarette, but it was incredible because, for me, by that time, I would have already had a cigarette and would have been planning to have my next one right as I walked out the door. I've made it this far before. I quit for about six months when I was 18. And last year, I quit for 10 months. So this isn't even the longest I've gone without smoking. I google how many people successfully quit smoking. It says 90 percent of smokers who try to quit relapse in the first year. The last time I quit, I relapsed on a Black & Mild - one of those 60-cent cigars they sell at gas stations. I think I've only smoked one other Black & Mild in my life, when I was 16 at a house party. I bought it because they're strong, and you can buy one at a time. I thought if I could just have one really strong cigarette, it'd be enough to last me the rest of my life. The next day, I bought a pack of Camel Lights. This time, I know to stay away from Black & Milds. It's been about a month since I quit smoking, and I'm walking home from work. It's cold, but sunny. I'm happy. I see a guy about my age step out of his office and start walking in front of me. He reaches into his coat pocket and puts a cigarette to his mouth. Then he reaches into his other pocket, and I see him do that familiar pause to light up before he starts walking again. The smoke drifts back to me, and I'm just jealous that he's not doing a radio story about quitting smoking. He reminds me of how much I miss the ritual of the after-work cigarette. I've had a bunch of cravings like this, so I've had to call my friend Larry Hanson (ph) in Minneapolis. He's a former smoker and one of the support people Shankar suggested I line up before quitting. It's like - I don't know. It's like I wish I could smoke without any of the, like, consequences, you know? LARRY HANSON: But that's magical thinking, Max. Don't even go that - don't even go there. Yeah, don't even go there. I mean, that's foolish. We can't do it, you know? It's not in the stars for us. I couldn't, you know, light up a cigarette and just say, oh, I'll have a cigarette, and I won't have another one for six months or something like that. It wouldn't work that way for me. You know, I'm sure. And I don't want to even experiment and, you know, say, oh, would that really happen? You know, no, I don't care. I'm not going to try. NESTERAK: I asked Larry if it was hard for him to quit. HANSON: You know, I told you how I had tried to quit, and I would go buy cigarettes and then smoke one and - and then flush them down the toilet. And then, I - you know, I tried the various things. I tried tapering off, and then I tried going to smoke low - whatever those - you know, they were supposed to be, like - I don't know - diet cigarettes or something like that. NESTERAK: Then I ask him what I've been most scared to ask him. Does he still miss it? HANSON: Well in - you know, I mean, I feel - I feel great now. I mean, I'm, you know, 72 years old. I haven't smoked for more than 30 years, you know? And I know if I were still smoking now, it - it would - it - well, I just - I can't imagine it. But to answer your question, did - do I miss it? I don't really, you know? And, you know, when I was in Vienna back in November, I - they still allow smoking in in some cafes there. As soon as you walked in the door of the place, it reeked of smoke. And it's just not a pleasant kind of experience. And maybe that was a line that I crossed when - when I used to get a whiff of cigarette smoke and there would be this pang of remorse, you know, or, oh, that smells good. I wish I could have a cigarette right now. And then - I've passed that point now. And I - you know, I just go, oh, what's that smell? It stinks, you know. Yeah. NESTERAK: I have not reached that point yet. When I smell a cigarette, it still smells pretty good to me. But I'm so grateful I don't have to smoke anymore. Everytime I run, I'm grateful I don't smoke. I'm grateful I don't have to get up and leave my desk all the time. I'm grateful I don't need a cigarette when I feel stressed or sad or happy. I used to smoke every couple hours - every hour on the weekends. Last week, I looked up at the clock and couldn't believe how late it was. That rarely happened to me as a smoker, but it happens to me all the time now. It wasn't anything unusual. I cooked dinner with my roommate. We played a few games of Cribbage. And we were laughing about something or other as I ate my nightly bowl of cereal. Before, each of these moments were bookended by a cigarette. Now, I'm just here - present. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)NESTERAK: It's been 186 days without a cigarette, but I'm by no means out of the woods. I thought I'd be able to say I quit smoking, but I realize it's not something I get to say yet. I just get to say I'm not smoking today. But I think, one day, I'll get to the point where I can go to a beautiful place like Vienna, full of outdoor cafes with strong espresso and ashtrays at every table, and think those cigarettes, they just stink. VEDANTAM: As I listened to Max, I realized one really hard thing about giving up smoking is that you don't get to declare victory. You don't get to say, OK, I'm done. The victory is always provisional. But recently, I was speaking with Tom Frieden, who heads the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC. I told him about Max. Tom told me that getting to six months is huge. Turns out, every day you stay off smoking makes it less likely you'll ever go back. The longer you quit, the longer you quit. Max had one big source of inspiration these last six months that he isn't going to have going forward. That's you. Max knew we were going to put together this podcast six months after he stopped smoking, and he knew lots of you were waiting for it. He didn't want to tell you he'd failed. On the plus side, he's now put away more than a thousand dollars in that savings account, and he's going to donate all that money to that evil organization if he goes back to smoking. They're going to do terrible things with the money, Max - awful things. Don't let them do it. If you want to help Max, follow him on Twitter - @maxnesterak. He's agreed that if he ever goes back to smoking, he'll announce it the same day publicly on Twitter. I know you'll have his back.

And I think his hope was that, you know, I would just vomit or just get so sick that I would never do it again because he never - you know, he never touched cigarettes. But, you know, I never did. And I - you know, it didn't really have an effect. I was a little buzzed. VEDANTAM: Did you like it? NESTERAK: I did like it. I thought I liked it. I mean, I liked, you know, being there, like, with my family outside smoking. I felt kind of cool. And all the other cousins who were my age were kind of, like, peering out of the patio behind the glass door, the safety of the nonsmoking kitchen nook. And just like - what is Max doing? And there I was in my coat huddling with the other ostracized family member smokers. VEDANTAM: What did your mom say about this? My mom, I think, rolled her eyes. And she was like I can't believe your dad said this was OK. But I hope you vomit, too. VEDANTAM: But, as Max said, he did vomit. In fact, he liked smoking. A few years later, when he was a freshman in high school, he asked an older friend to buy him a pack of cigarettes. He began smoking regularly. NESTERAK: I used to take the dog on walks. And that was, like, my smoke break. And so I think, you know, starting around age, you know, 14, that dog got so many walks a day. Or like. . . (LAUGHTER) NESTERAK: It got increasingly more exercise as the years went on. VEDANTAM: So a scientist would say there was an inverse relationship between the dog's health and your health. NESTERAK: Correct. Yes, I think that's an apt description. VEDANTAM: As he's gotten older, Max says he's become aware of the stigma around smoking. It didn't stop him, but it did make him think twice about telling friends and co-workers about his habit. NESTERAK: I don't think it makes me cooler or more interesting. And generally, I think when I first meet people, I'm not afraid of being judged. But it's just something that's, like - yeah, it's not something I just want to share right off the bat. VEDANTAM: But if there's a social stigma to smoking, there are also social benefits. One thing Max and I discussed was the smokers club that forms outside of offices and libraries. You see the same people congregating every day, chatting as they smoke. I mean, that's very profound, psychologically speaking, if you're constantly meeting people only at the times that you're doing something that you enjoy. Those are people you're going to associate, in a Pavlovian fashion, with the thing that you enjoy. You're going to be forming friendships with them. And other friendships keep you in that world. NESTERAK: Yeah. I think it's same with activities. I mean, the more you smoke, the better life gets in a way (laughter). I mean, smoking and television, smoking and eating breakfast, smoking and eating ice cream. But I think that's true with people - that there is, like, this shared bond where you're out on the break. And right, the pleasure center is being activated and - while you're talking. So you probably think, you know, the conversation is better. I think it's the same as when people go out to the bar to happy hour together, and they have drinks. There's this bond that's formed that's - that just wouldn't be formed at work around the water cooler in a way. VEDANTAM: There are other clubs you get to join when you're a smoker. But of course, smokers like Max tend not to think of those clubs when they're smoking. NESTERAK: With smoking, I associate myself with the film noir, the cigarette after dinner, the social smoking, but not the emphysema or lung cancer or oxygen mask part of the game, if you will. VEDANTAM: So that's the interesting thing, of course. And you know all the social science literature on this, which is that the pleasure and the social camaraderie and the friendships are real and immediate, and the potential costs are delayed and distant. And there's just six warehouses filled with psych studies that basically show that when you set up the incentives this way so that the short-term incentives are positive and gratifying and the long-term incentives are horrible, people will ignore the long-term and focus on the short-term. NESTERAK: Yeah, I think there's never a good day to quit smoking, right? You know, there's the part of yourself that wants to wake up at 6 o'clock in the morning, and so you set the alarm clock. The you at 6 o'clock in the morning presses the snooze button 20 times until it's 8 o'clock, and then you're rushing into work, and you're late. And, you know, there's the part myself at night who says, OK, tomorrow I'm going to stop smoking. And then, you wake up and you have one. And then, you're like, well, if I had one, I'm not going to go the rest of the day without - without smoking. So it's easy to weigh the long-term benefits of smoking when you're not craving a cigarette. VEDANTAM: An old smokers' joke says, quitting is easy; I've done it lots of times. Knowing that most people who quit go back to smoking, I suggested that Max do three things to help him stick to his resolution. All were ideas drawn from social science research. First, I asked him to put the money he was spending on smoking - about 6 bucks a day - into a savings account. If he succeeding in quitting at the end of the year, he would be able to go on a nice vacation. But if he started smoking, he would have to donate the money to an organization he detests. Now, I'm not going to identify it, but let's just say max picked an organization that does a lot of lobbying in Washington. Second, I asked him to reach out to a bunch of friends and ask them to be there for him when he needed support. And finally, I asked him to record a public service announcement about why young people should never start smoking. The idea is that when you publicly declare you're against smoking, it makes it hard to start smoking again. It produces cognitive dissonance, makes you feel like a hypocrite. We aired Max's public service announcement in January. Here's an excerpt. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NESTERAK: If you don't smoke, here's what you should know. When you're a smoker, life is lived around cigarettes. You'll be laughing with friends at dinner or totally engrossed in a good book, and something will tug at you. And as much as you want to stay in this moment, you'll be thinking about a cigarette. So you'll get up, walk outside and light up. And it will feel really good, but you'll wish you were back inside, and you'll be so tired of trading off these moments for a smoke. If you don't smoke, you should know that smoking makes a prison out of perfectly normal situations - long flights, concerts, class, anything that lasts longer than a couple of hours. These are your enemy as a smoker. And any time you go on a date or to a job interview or to your grandparents' house, it will be accompanied by a pang of worry. You'll wash your hands and pull your shirt to your nose and hope they can't smell smoke. VEDANTAM: We also asked something from all of you. We asked that you call in with your own stories about how you managed to quit smoking. We were absolutely overwhelmed and moved by your responses. So many of you wrote and called with words of wisdom and encouragement. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Hi, this message is for Max. I was just on my way home listening to the resolutions podcast. And I was actually on the way home from my dad having surgery on his lungs for lung cancer. So I just wanted to wish Max good luck. And hopefully he's able to quit, and this isn't him in 50 years. My dad is 74, so. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: There's no need to badmouth your old self, but best to nurture the new direction with as many creative ways as you can come up with. I have no doubt you will succeed. It's been 28 years since the day I quit. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: The thing that really helped me was not to focus on the whole project, but only on steps. For instance, I kept repeating to me every time I had the urge of going out to smoke a cigarette, well, this one - you're not going to smoke it. So, I mean, I just concentrate my attention and my power on the single cigarette that I was craving. And that way, cigarette by cigarette, I successfully quit it. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: I threw out my cigarettes. And in that moment, I decided that not only was I going to quit smoking, but that I would become a non-smoker right then. And from then on, every time I would want a cigarette, I would ask myself why in the world a nonsmoker would want a cigarette. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Go to the places where you usually buy cigarettes and introduce yourself to the person behind the counter. And just let them know that you're trying to stop smoking. You don't have to tell them not to sell you cigarettes or anything like that, but just say to them that you're trying to stop smoking. It's going to be really hard for you to then go back there and buy cigarettes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: We're going to take a break now. When we come back, we're going to hear from Max. He kept an audio diary as he went along to document his triumphs and setbacks. NESTERAK: It's, like, this mental obsession. So you're kind of like, oh, should I have a granola No, I want to have a cigarette. Should I go for a walk? No, I want to have a cigarette. VEDANTAM: Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) NESTERAK: Quitting smoking is kind of like a really bad break up. At first, I'm OK. I feel relieved, happy even that I finally did it. This isn't so bad. I go to bed that night looking forward to waking up the next day as a new person. Tomorrow is January 1, 2016. It's going to be the first day of the rest of my so-much-better life. Of course, the first thing I think about when I wake up is a cigarette. I plan to go downstairs and poor myself a cup of coffee, bundle up in my winter coat and have the first cigarette of the day, which is, as any smoker will tell you, the best cigarette of the day. Then I remember what I had done - said I would quit smoking. And I do not stop remembering it. I started keeping an audio diary. Here's a clip. (SOUNDBITE OF AUDIO DIARY) NESTERAK: It's just - it's, like, this mental obsession. So you're kind of like, oh, should I have a granola bar? No, I want to have a cigarette. Should I go for a walk? No, I want to have a cigarette? Should I watch a movie? No, I want to have a cigarette. So (laughter) that's - it's just, like, this obsession is all you want, and it's all you can think about. I think back to the early days of the romance, when I would get lightheaded, tingly in my fingers and just feel giddy. I started smoking around the time I realized I was gay. I went to high school in suburban Colorado with a champion football team. And, well, by the time I started smoking at 14, I needed it. Sometimes I would inhale as much as I could, close my eyes and just let my head buzz while I held in the smoke. The withdraw feels like just the opposite. I'm sad and frustrated. My head aches. My muscles tighten up. My thoughts are foggy. I'm acutely aware that there's suffering in the world. When you're having a craving, you just - you don't think that you're ever going to feel differently or have felt differently. I try to embrace it. A craving comes, and I just lean into it. You have to love the burn almost, you know what I mean? Like, you - it sucks. It hurts. And you just kind of lean into it and you're like, yeah, like, this is what quitting feels like. And, yeah, so I'm loving the burn right now - loving, hating the burn right now. I'm chewing sugar-free gum and drinking seltzer water. NESTERAK: These are my sad romance song and cinnamon bun equivalents. I bask in the pain and let my mind do what it wants to do - think about how much it sucks to not have a cigarette. Then I think about something I heard about buffalo - that when Buffalo see a storm coming, they walk towards it rather than away from it because they know they'll get through it faster. I am the buffalo. It's, like, three minutes away from being 48 hours, so it's at the end of day two. Oh, there were some dark moments today. I don't know if I can take another day of this. I think about the money I've said on cigarettes that I'd have to donate to that horrible organization if I smoked. It's actually only $13. I think, if I'm going to relapse, I should do it now while there's so little at stake. Then I think about having to say I failed on this podcast. I google quitting smoking timeline. After 20 minutes, your blood pressure and heart rate will return to normal. After 12 hours, blood-oxygen level has increased to normal. Forty-eight hours - damaged nerve endings start to regrow and anger and irritability have peaked. Seventy-two hours - entire body is free of nicotine, number of cravings have peaked, lung function is improving. I make it to day 3. I go for a run, and I'm surprised at how much my lungs have already recovered. The cravings come less frequently, just like the quitting-smoking websites promise they will. I'm nearly three weeks into quitting smoking now. It's day 20, and the most amazing thing happens. I woke up, and I drank a glass of orange juice. I took a shower. I got dressed. I packed my bag for work. And, you know, as I'm about to head out, I realized that I hadn't thought about a cigarette the entire morning. I had literally gone through my entire routine without once thinking about a cigarette. And, of course, then I was thinking about a cigarette, but it was incredible because, for me, by that time, I would have already had a cigarette and would have been planning to have my next one right as I walked out the door. I've made it this far before. I quit for about six months when I was 18. And last year, I quit for 10 months. So this isn't even the longest I've gone without smoking. I google how many people successfully quit smoking. It says 90 percent of smokers who try to quit relapse in the first year. The last time I quit, I relapsed on a Black & Mild - one of those 60-cent cigars they sell at gas stations. I think I've only smoked one other Black & Mild in my life, when I was 16 at a house party. I bought it because they're strong, and you can buy one at a time. I thought if I could just have one really strong cigarette, it'd be enough to last me the rest of my life. The next day, I bought a pack of Camel Lights. This time, I know to stay away from Black & Milds. It's been about a month since I quit smoking, and I'm walking home from work. It's cold, but sunny. I'm happy. I see a guy about my age step out of his office and start walking in front of me. He reaches into his coat pocket and puts a cigarette to his mouth. Then he reaches into his other pocket, and I see him do that familiar pause to light up before he starts walking again. The smoke drifts back to me, and I'm just jealous that he's not doing a radio story about quitting smoking. He reminds me of how much I miss the ritual of the after-work cigarette. I've had a bunch of cravings like this, so I've had to call my friend Larry Hanson (ph) in Minneapolis. He's a former smoker and one of the support people Shankar suggested I line up before quitting. It's like - I don't know. It's like I wish I could smoke without any of the, like, consequences, you know? LARRY HANSON: But that's magical thinking, Max. Don't even go that - don't even go there. Yeah, don't even go there. I mean, that's foolish. We can't do it, you know? It's not in the stars for us. I couldn't, you know, light up a cigarette and just say, oh, I'll have a cigarette, and I won't have another one for six months or something like that. It wouldn't work that way for me. You know, I'm sure. And I don't want to even experiment and, you know, say, oh, would that really happen? You know, no, I don't care. I'm not going to try. NESTERAK: I asked Larry if it was hard for him to quit. HANSON: You know, I told you how I had tried to quit, and I would go buy cigarettes and then smoke one and - and then flush them down the toilet. And then, I - you know, I tried the various things. I tried tapering off, and then I tried going to smoke low - whatever those - you know, they were supposed to be, like - I don't know - diet cigarettes or something like that. NESTERAK: Then I ask him what I've been most scared to ask him. Does he still miss it? HANSON: Well in - you know, I mean, I feel - I feel great now. I mean, I'm, you know, 72 years old. I haven't smoked for more than 30 years, you know? And I know if I were still smoking now, it - it would - it - well, I just - I can't imagine it. But to answer your question, did - do I miss it? I don't really, you know? And, you know, when I was in Vienna back in November, I - they still allow smoking in in some cafes there. As soon as you walked in the door of the place, it reeked of smoke. And it's just not a pleasant kind of experience. And maybe that was a line that I crossed when - when I used to get a whiff of cigarette smoke and there would be this pang of remorse, you know, or, oh, that smells good. I wish I could have a cigarette right now. And then - I've passed that point now. And I - you know, I just go, oh, what's that smell? It stinks, you know. Yeah. NESTERAK: I have not reached that point yet. When I smell a cigarette, it still smells pretty good to me. But I'm so grateful I don't have to smoke anymore. Everytime I run, I'm grateful I don't smoke. I'm grateful I don't have to get up and leave my desk all the time. I'm grateful I don't need a cigarette when I feel stressed or sad or happy. I used to smoke every couple hours - every hour on the weekends. Last week, I looked up at the clock and couldn't believe how late it was. That rarely happened to me as a smoker, but it happens to me all the time now. It wasn't anything unusual. I cooked dinner with my roommate. We played a few games of Cribbage. And we were laughing about something or other as I ate my nightly bowl of cereal. Before, each of these moments were bookended by a cigarette. Now, I'm just here - present. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) NESTERAK: It's been 186 days without a cigarette, but I'm by no means out of the woods. I thought I'd be able to say I quit smoking, but I realize it's not something I get to say yet. I just get to say I'm not smoking today. But I think, one day, I'll get to the point where I can go to a beautiful place like Vienna, full of outdoor cafes with strong espresso and ashtrays at every table, and think those cigarettes, they just stink. VEDANTAM: As I listened to Max, I realized one really hard thing about giving up smoking is that you don't get to declare victory. You don't get to say, OK, I'm done. The victory is always provisional. But recently, I was speaking with Tom Frieden, who heads the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC. I told him about Max. Tom told me that getting to six months is huge. Turns out, every day you stay off smoking makes it less likely you'll ever go back. The longer you quit, the longer you quit. Max had one big source of inspiration these last six months that he isn't going to have going forward. That's you. Max knew we were going to put together this podcast six months after he stopped smoking, and he knew lots of you were waiting for it. He didn't want to tell you he'd failed. On the plus side, he's now put away more than a thousand dollars in that savings account, and he's going to donate all that money to that evil organization if he goes back to smoking. They're going to do terrible things with the money, Max - awful things. Don't let them do it. If you want to help Max, follow him on Twitter - @maxnesterak. He's agreed that if he ever goes back to smoking, he'll announce it the same day publicly on Twitter. I know you'll have his back.

Why did anyone care about this little curb? SCHWARTZ: Well, we do care about the Hayward Fault, which is really one of the major and most important faults in the San Francisco Bay area. In the - in probably the late 1950s, your standard sidewalk curb was built across the fault, and the fault is creeping. So that means it moves a little bit every year - maybe about 4 millimeters.

Many of you might know this drug as Tylenol. It's a pain killer that can take the edge off a headache or treat you when you have a fever. It also might have another effect. And let's talk about this with NPR social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam. And, Shankar, straight out, is this going to make me not want to take Tylenol, what you're about to tell me? SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: It might make you not want to take Tylenol. GREENE: All right, what's going on? VEDANTAM: It might make you not want to take Tylenol when you're talking with me, David. GREENE: Oh, even more interesting. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) I was speaking with Dominik Mischkowski. He's currently a researcher at the National Institutes of Health. He recently conducted a couple of double blind experiments. These are experiments where the volunteers are given either sugar pills or Tylenol, but neither the volunteers nor the researchers know which volunteers are getting which pill. Mischkowski and his advisers at Ohio State University, Jennifer Crocker and Baldwin Way, they played loud noises for the volunteers. Not surprisingly, volunteers given Tylenol experienced less physical discomfort than volunteers given the placebo. GREENE: Because they had been sort of treated preliminarily. And it would have - if noise was going to cause pain, it didn't cause as much to the people with Tylenol, OK. VEDANTAM: Exactly, Tylenol's a painkiller. GREENE: Got you. VEDANTAM: But here's the interesting thing - the researchers also measured the empathy that volunteers felt for the pain of other people. Here's Mischkowski. DOMINIK MISCHKOWSKI: We gave participants eight scenarios which described people in either physical pain or social pain. Physical pain meaning, for example, injuring the shin. Social pain would be experiencing rejection in a peer group. And we found that acetaminophen basically reduced empathy for the pain of those people. GREENE: Taking this painkiller made you not care as much about what other people were going through. VEDANTAM: That's right. Now, the effect is not huge, but Mischkowski told me there was about a 10 percent difference in both the physical discomfort volunteers experienced when they were subjected to the noise blast and in their empathic perception of the pain of someone else. GREENE: What exactly is happening here? Am I feeling great about myself because I'm in less pain, and that makes me not care if you're in pain? Or what is - what is happening? VEDANTAM: Well, here's the theory the researchers are playing with. There's been other work that suggests there are overlaps in how the brain processes physical and social pain. In 2010, for example, Nathan DeWall at the University of Kentucky and his colleagues found that volunteers given Tylenol experience less social pain as well as less physical pain. Here's Mischkowski. MISCHKOWSKI: When people experience physical pain - so, for example, having a hot probe on their arm - and then see somebody else experiencing the same pain or similar pain, then the same areas in the brain light up. VEDANTAM: So, David, when you think about empathy, empathy is really about feeling the pain of someone else. GREENE: I can feel your pain, yeah. VEDANTAM: You feel bad that someone else is suffering, exactly. If Tylenol has a capacity to reduce physical pain, it makes sense it could have an effect on our ability to experience emotional pain as well. GREENE: So is it just Tylenol, or we think this might be other painkillers as well doing this? VEDANTAM: So this study was focused just on Tylenol. I think it's reasonable to speculate, David, that other painkillers might have the same effect, if you buy the idea that physical pain and emotional pain are perceived the same way in the brain and painkillers can affect both. GREENE: Does this mean if you're going to the drug store to buy some Tylenol, like, make sure your friends or loved ones aren't around because you're not going to want to help them, or what? VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Well, the first thing to say is that the effects of Tylenol on empathy are somewhat modest. We're not talking of a 0 to 100 percent difference here. GREENE: OK. VEDANTAM: We're talking about maybe a 10 percent difference. But, you know, a quarter of the American population aged 18 to 65 uses acetaminophen or a drug containing acetaminophen every week. Not all people respond to a drug the same way. It probably has stronger effects on some people. Since the overall number of users is very large, it might be a side effect worth thinking about. GREENE: All right. That is NPR's social science correspondent, Shankar Vedantam. He's also the host of a podcast that explores the unseen patterns in human behavior. It's called Hidden Brain. He's also a tremendously empathetic colleague. Shankar, thank you. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Thanks, David. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  Nearly one-quarter of all Americans reach for a bottle of acetaminophen every single week. Many of you might know this drug as Tylenol. It's a pain killer that can take the edge off a headache or treat you when you have a fever. It also might have another effect. And let's talk about this with NPR social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam. And, Shankar, straight out, is this going to make me not want to take Tylenol, what you're about to tell me? SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: It might make you not want to take Tylenol. GREENE: All right, what's going on? VEDANTAM: It might make you not want to take Tylenol when you're talking with me, David. GREENE: Oh, even more interesting. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) I was speaking with Dominik Mischkowski. He's currently a researcher at the National Institutes of Health. He recently conducted a couple of double blind experiments. These are experiments where the volunteers are given either sugar pills or Tylenol, but neither the volunteers nor the researchers know which volunteers are getting which pill. Mischkowski and his advisers at Ohio State University, Jennifer Crocker and Baldwin Way, they played loud noises for the volunteers. Not surprisingly, volunteers given Tylenol experienced less physical discomfort than volunteers given the placebo. GREENE: Because they had been sort of treated preliminarily. And it would have - if noise was going to cause pain, it didn't cause as much to the people with Tylenol, OK. VEDANTAM: Exactly, Tylenol's a painkiller. GREENE: Got you. VEDANTAM: But here's the interesting thing - the researchers also measured the empathy that volunteers felt for the pain of other people. Here's Mischkowski. DOMINIK MISCHKOWSKI: We gave participants eight scenarios which described people in either physical pain or social pain. Physical pain meaning, for example, injuring the shin. Social pain would be experiencing rejection in a peer group. And we found that acetaminophen basically reduced empathy for the pain of those people. GREENE: Taking this painkiller made you not care as much about what other people were going through. VEDANTAM: That's right. Now, the effect is not huge, but Mischkowski told me there was about a 10 percent difference in both the physical discomfort volunteers experienced when they were subjected to the noise blast and in their empathic perception of the pain of someone else. GREENE: What exactly is happening here? Am I feeling great about myself because I'm in less pain, and that makes me not care if you're in pain? Or what is - what is happening? VEDANTAM: Well, here's the theory the researchers are playing with. There's been other work that suggests there are overlaps in how the brain processes physical and social pain. In 2010, for example, Nathan DeWall at the University of Kentucky and his colleagues found that volunteers given Tylenol experience less social pain as well as less physical pain. Here's Mischkowski. MISCHKOWSKI: When people experience physical pain - so, for example, having a hot probe on their arm - and then see somebody else experiencing the same pain or similar pain, then the same areas in the brain light up. VEDANTAM: So, David, when you think about empathy, empathy is really about feeling the pain of someone else. GREENE: I can feel your pain, yeah. VEDANTAM: You feel bad that someone else is suffering, exactly. If Tylenol has a capacity to reduce physical pain, it makes sense it could have an effect on our ability to experience emotional pain as well. GREENE: So is it just Tylenol, or we think this might be other painkillers as well doing this? VEDANTAM: So this study was focused just on Tylenol. I think it's reasonable to speculate, David, that other painkillers might have the same effect, if you buy the idea that physical pain and emotional pain are perceived the same way in the brain and painkillers can affect both. GREENE: Does this mean if you're going to the drug store to buy some Tylenol, like, make sure your friends or loved ones aren't around because you're not going to want to help them, or what? VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Well, the first thing to say is that the effects of Tylenol on empathy are somewhat modest. We're not talking of a 0 to 100 percent difference here. GREENE: OK. VEDANTAM: We're talking about maybe a 10 percent difference. But, you know, a quarter of the American population aged 18 to 65 uses acetaminophen or a drug containing acetaminophen every week. Not all people respond to a drug the same way. It probably has stronger effects on some people. Since the overall number of users is very large, it might be a side effect worth thinking about. GREENE: All right. That is NPR's social science correspondent, Shankar Vedantam. He's also the host of a podcast that explores the unseen patterns in human behavior. It's called Hidden Brain. He's also a tremendously empathetic colleague. Shankar, thank you. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Thanks, David.", "section": "Hidden Brain", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

It's about a woman who participated in an experiment. It gave her a whole new frame of reference, and that let her see the world in a completely different way. Here's NPR's Alix Spiegel. ALIX SPIEGEL, BYLINE: Until she was 54 years old, Kim (ph) was totally unaware that there were things in the world that she could not see. KIM: This was the whole problem. It was like I had no clue what the problem was. SPIEGEL: All Kim knew was that people were always responding in ways that she would never expect. It happened all the time. KIM: I was at summer camp, and there were two girls trying to put up the sail on the sailboat. And I'm always really good at doing those kind of stuff, and I could see what their problem was. So I remember walking up to them, and I wanted to help them, said something like, oh, I can show you how to do that. And they were mad at me. Why would they be mad when I'm trying to help them? SPIEGEL: Kim's brain is not great at seeing emotion. When she looks out at the world, she physically sees all the things that most people see. It's just that much of the emotion is subtracted. Though for most of her life, she didn't realize that, and so her interactions with other kids could be difficult. KIM: You know, taunting and name calling, and then it would progress to, you know, physical acts. SPIEGEL: Quick warning here - if you're triggered by stories about bullying, you might want to stop listening for a minute. What was your darkest moment? KIM: The worst thing that ever happened was, I was at summer camp, and I don't know what I did. I have no idea. But they actually bound and gagged me and took me out of the cabin at night in the rain and put me outside, and it was just awful. SPIEGEL: I'm so sorry. KIM: Yeah, I mean, you know, it's so hard when you have no idea why people treat you like this. SPIEGEL: This kind of bullying took place for years, but after high school, things did ease. There were still issues, but Kim had a good job and good friends. And then in 2008, someone close to her was diagnosed with what used to be called Asperger's syndrome, now known as autism spectrum disorder, so Kim decided to do some reading about it. KIM: Oh, my God. This is the way I think. SPIEGEL: She went online, found a test which measured Asperger's and clicked through the items. KIM: I'm good at social chit chat - disagree. SPIEGEL: Staring into the screen, it suddenly dawned on Kim that she could have Asperger's. She grew up in the '60s, so no one had ever suggested that before. Now, Kim has kept her Asperger's private in her professional life, which is why we're not using her full name. But eventually she did go to an Asperger's support group, and it was there that she heard about the experiment. KIM: They were saying there are some research studies being done, and there's one currently at Beth Israel Deaconess. So I thought, well, this might be interesting. SPIEGEL: That's when Kim met Dr. Lindsay Oberman. Oberman is a professor at Brown now, but when Kim met her, she was at Harvard, researching how a procedure called TMS affects people with Asperger's. LINDSAY OBERMAN: So TMS stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation. SPIEGEL: Basically in TMS you take this very fancy magnet, hold it to the scalp and send pulses through the skull to get brain cells to activate in a different way. They typically change for a very short period of time - between 15 and 40 minutes. And Dr. Oberman wanted to see if TMS could change the way that people like Kim process language. And so before and after the experiment, Kim was given language assessments. In one, she was asked to watch video vignettes of people talking. She vividly remembers watching the first. KIM: There was a guy sitting at a computer, and a woman walked up and said hi to him. And then he said, oh, John (ph) returned your DVDs. And then he said, do you want to check them? And she said, oh, OK. So she picks up the first DVD and opens it, and the camera shows that there's nothing in there. And then she picks up the second one and opens it, and it's empty again. And then the guy says, are they OK? And she goes, yeah, they're OK; I would lend them again. So I'm looking at this, and I'm thinking, oh, my gosh, I can't believe she'd actually be willing to lend the DVDs again after they were returned empty. Wow, she's really a generous person. SPIEGEL: And then came the magnet - a small device maybe 10 inches long shooting an invisible magnetic field in rhythmic bursts through her skull. KIM: OK, now we watch the same video again. So she walks up. They say hi. She opens the first video. It's empty. She's angry. She slams it down. She opens the second one. She's angry. She slams it down. He says to her, are they OK? And she says in a very sarcastic tone of voice, yes, they're OK. I would lend them again, clearly meaning, no way would I lend this guy any videos again. SPIEGEL: Wow. KIM: Everything that was intended in this went completely over my head, and now I saw it - completely missed the meaning of the whole thing until after the TMS. And then I saw the whole thing clearly. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SPIEGEL: Because TMS is so short-lived, Kim's ability to see this way only lasted for a very little while. By the time she drove home, it was gone. And I want to be very clear here and underline - TMS is not currently approved for autism spectrum disorders, and Dr. Oberman says people, particularly children, should steer clear of it at this point because as treatment, it is totally unproven. But even though TMS has not changed Kim's ability to see long-term, she says she's still happy she got it. She says she thinks a lot about one of the videos she was shown. In it, two employees were saying mean things to a fellow employee named Frank (ph). And Kim says the first time she watched it before the TMS, she couldn't answer any of the questions the researchers were asking about it. But afterwards, she understood not only the video but also one of the big mysteries that had dominated much of her life. KIM: It never made any sense to me as to why people would be mean to somebody else. Why would you be mean to somebody? And what I saw is that when the two employees were there and were talking together and then were giving Frank a hard time, the primary thing was not that they were trying to be mean to Frank. The primary thing is that they were bonding, building a bond between the two of them. And it was simply the means to do it was to be nasty to Frank. And then I was like, oh, maybe that's what these kids were doing when they were bullying me. SPIEGEL: It's much easier to live in a world which makes sense, where people are mean not just for fun but because they, like everyone else, want to belong and feel safe. Now that's the world that Kim lives in. Alix Spiegel, NPR News. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  Now a story from the new season of our program Invisibilia. It's about a woman who participated in an experiment.

President Obama is just one of many presidents who have tried to diversify the federal bench. So we've broken that barrier, which has now revealed another barrier. NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam is here. Shankar, what is it? SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: The barrier seems to be that black judges get overruled more often than white judges. INSKEEP: On appeal, you're saying? VEDANTAM: That's exactly right, Steve. INSKEEP: Why? VEDANTAM: Well, I was speaking with Maya Sen. She's a researcher at Harvard's Kennedy School. She told me she's just completed an analysis of about a thousand judges on the federal bench who were nominated by presidents ranging from Lyndon Johnson to Barack Obama. Sen looked at how often between the years 2000 and 2012 these judges' rulings were overturned on appeal by a higher court. And what she finds, remarkably, is that black judges are significantly more likely to be reversed on appeal than white judges. MAYA SEN: Another way to think about that is that if blacks were being reversed at whites' lower reversal rates, then approximately 2,800 black-authored decisions would actually have been upheld over that time period. VEDANTAM: Now, Steve, there are lots of reasons why you could get reversed. But in general, it means that higher courts are questioning your conclusions and legal reasoning. They could also be ideological disagreements. But in general, the appellate court is basically saying I don't buy the case that you've made. INSKEEP: Well, some people will ask if that's really a factor of race. You can look at statistics and see that Democratic presidents have appointed more black judges. You can presume that those judges tend to be more liberal as a group. Could it just be that they have a different view of the law than some of the appellate judges who may be white or other races who overrule them? VEDANTAM: I think that actually is the most obvious explanation - that there are just simply ideological differences that explain this. I spoke with Tom Miles. He's dean of the University of Chicago's law school. And he's familiar with Maya Sen's paper. He says that Sen tested the possibility that ideology is producing this result. . . THOMAS MILES: By looking at whether black Democratic judges are more likely to be overturned than white Democratic judges. And she finds even in that context, the racial gap exists. And so on the first inspection, it doesn't appear that ideology is the explanation for the result. INSKEEP: OK. So they control for this ideological difference in the way that he just described. And they still find a gap. What explanation is left? VEDANTAM: Well, you know, Steve, you and I have talked at length about the role of unconscious biases in different domains. This study doesn't allow us to test whether those biases are producing this outcome. But Tom Miles told me that the outcome is at least consistent with how we know unconscious biases work. Here he is again. MILES: It has a certain plausibility to it. But it's also one that has, I think, a disturbing implication for people who believe in the rule of law. VEDANTAM: You know, Sen told me it's possible that black judges who tend to be appointed by Democratic presidents are somehow different than white judges appointed by Democratic presidents. They might both be on the liberal side of the spectrum, but it could be that black judges are even more on the liberal side of the spectrum. Maybe they just simply have different perspectives. But here's the irony, Steve. Presidents have tried to diversify the judiciary based on the idea that a more diverse judiciary will have different points of view and this will help the courts better understand the diversity of the cases before them. Sen's results suggest that even if presidents and lawmakers want courts to be more diverse, everyone might not be on board with that idea. Here's Sen again. SEN: It seems to be true that these judges are voting in different directions, and they're they're introducing this diverse viewpoint. But what does that actually mean if that diverse viewpoint is then eventually overruled by higher courts and these higher courts are less diverse? VEDANTAM: You know, effectively, Steve, having a diverse bench might not produce the diversity of views that we want because the judiciary as a whole may not be willing or may not be able to accept those views. INSKEEP: It's a collective enterprise in the end. VEDANTAM: Exactly. INSKEEP: Shankar, thanks very much. VEDANTAM: Thanks, Steve.

You don't have to look far to see evidence of narcissism in our culture. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"I AM A GOD\")KANYE WEST: (Rapping) I am a god. Hurry up with my damn massage. DONALD TRUMP: I'm really rich. I actually think I have the best temperament. People love me. And you know what? I've been very successful. Everybody loves me.

You're, like, obsessed. KARDASHIAN: I just need - I need 1,200. VEDANTAM: Kanye West, Donald Trump and Kim Kardashian are only the tip of the iceberg. Our society is in the midst of a full-blown narcissism epidemic. It doesn't take a psychologist to see that, but we decided to talk to one anyway. JEAN TWENGE: We're more focused on the self. We're less focused on social rules. At the extreme, that can turn into this narcissistic attention seeking of, everybody, look at me and how great I am. VEDANTAM: This is Jean Twenge. She's a psychologist at San Diego State. She's analyzed data collected from millions of people over the last half century. TWENGE: We found that if you look at baby boomers in the '60s compared to millennials in more recent times, millennials are much more likely to say that they think they're above average. VEDANTAM: We'll talk about what this means for young people later in the conversation. But Jean Twenge says our culture as a whole - from reality TV to social media - has come to encourage an obsessive focus on the self. TWENGE: I think there are a lot of factors. You know, our culture has changed in so many ways. And the feature that I always come back to is we are a more individualistic culture now compared to what our culture was, say, in the 1950s. So we're more focused on the self. We're less focused on social roles. At the extreme, that can turn into this narcissistic attention seeking of, everybody, look at me and how great I am. VEDANTAM: And I'm wondering if this affects not just the people at the extreme ends of the spectrum, but people who are - you know, the rest of us. You have Facebook and Twitter and all kinds of mechanisms now to tell people what you had for dinner last night, what wonderful vacation you're going on, the amazing things that your kid is doing at school. There are all kinds of ways to boast about yourself to more and more people. TWENGE: Yeah, social networking really pulls forward the positive. It really encourages people to just focus on the good parts of themselves, which, you know, in some ways, is the definition of narcissism. Now, I'm not saying everybody on these sites is narcissistic per se, you know, but we do know from lots of studies now - five or six - that people who score high in narcissism have more friends on Facebook, for example. So the average person you're connected to on one of these sites is probably higher in narcissism than the average person you know in real life. And that molds the way people communicate in a way that really does seek attention, especially for all of these positive things. It is really a venue for bragging that just wasn't available 20 years ago. VEDANTAM: I'm fascinated by one point that you make in your book, which is a lot of this might start very early with a cultural emphasis on building self-esteem and on encouraging young people to follow their dreams. And at one level, that statement seems almost anodyne - that it's a good thing to encourage people to follow their dreams, to encourage people to believe in themselves and believe in what they're capable of doing. But you raise a number of examples or a number of concerns about the potential downside of encouraging people to believe in themselves and follow their dreams. Talk about that a little bit. TWENGE: Sure. So yes, we can see this. In the culture, there is this very strong emphasis on feeling good about yourself, the positive self-views. It's captured in a lot of phrases like, you can be anything you want to be, follow your dreams, you are special, believe in yourself and anything is possible. It is taken for granted that, to succeed, you must have very high self-esteem. The problem with that is it's not true, from many studies. So big - big research review looked at this, and people who score high in self-esteem are not necessarily any more successful than anybody else, especially when you take into account family background and things like that. You do find some effect that, for example, kids who do well in school develop high self-esteem. But the way our culture thinks about it is you should build up self-esteem for no particular reason. You're special just for being you, and that will lead to good things. It doesn't work that way. That puts the cart before the horse. VEDANTAM: And I'm wondering if it might even have an even more pernicious effect than that, which is that if you build up your self-esteem without actually the accomplishments and, you know, the effort required to build it up in a genuine fashion, it might actually dissuade you from doing the things that would actually lead to achievements. I mean, what psychological incentive do you have to work hard and achieve things that can build up your self-esteem when your self-esteem is, you know, sky-high to begin with? TWENGE: Exactly. And so that's - that's probably why self-esteem is a wash - that, on the one hand, it could be seen as, well, that means you'll go and take the initiative, but on the other, maybe you won't. If you're already great, why should you do anything? You know, another example that illustrates this is, in the U. S. , the ethnic group that has the lowest self-esteem is Asian-Americans. Those are the kids with the best academic performance, the adults with the highest educational attainment, lowest unemployment rate. It - of course, it's a cultural thing, but it really does really demonstrate in one piece of data how this idea that you have to be supremely self-confident to succeed just isn't true. VEDANTAM: You cite data in the book, looking at Google Books, and the use of the phrase, you can be anything, over a period of time. TWENGE: Yeah, so we looked at individualistic words and phrases in the Google Books database. We also looked at pronouns like I and me versus we and us to try to see this more broader cultural view about language use and how that might have changed over the last 50 or 60 years. This is a great resource you can look at. We looked at American books and found a pretty pronounced shift toward more individualistic language. So you are special, you know, I'm the best - all of those phrases went up - words like unique and personalize. I and the use of I, me and mine went up. The use of we and us went down by a little bit. One of the biggest increases was the use of you and yours. So a way that the author is directly speaking to the reader. So all very individualistic language, and it really shows how it goes beyond just this generational shift toward an overall cultural shift that is emphasizing the individual more. VEDANTAM: You explore the fact this begins right from the point at which parents give names to children. TWENGE: Yeah. So another nice, beautiful, big dataset - the Social Security Administration baby names dataset. Many people are familiar with this because they'll tell you, you know, which names are the most popular. We were interested in how many babies get popular names. And we found a pronounced shift in the percentage of babies who get, for example, one of the top 10 names. Back in the 50s, about a third of boys and about 25 percent of girls got just those ten most popular names. And now it's less than 10 percent. So it used to be that parents would give kids common names so they could fit in because that was considered a good thing. Now, the emphasis is let's give our child a unique name so he or she can stand out. And that, again, captures that emphasis on uniqueness, which is an integral part of individualism. VEDANTAM: The cultural shift toward greater individualism has had a profound effect on one group in particular - young people, the generation known as the millennials. Jean Twenge has analyzed survey data collected over a half-century that asks young people a number of questions to measure their levels of narcissism. TWENGE: So one is to say, do you think that you're above average compared to other people your age? And then there's a list of traits given. And we found that if you look at baby boomers in the '60s compared to millennials in more recent times, millennials are much more likely to say that they think they're above average in traits like drive to achieve, leadership ability, writing ability, general academic ability. Across the board, they say, yeah, I think I'm better than other people my age at this. And we wondered if it was demographic. We found out, no - that it wasn't. The groups that are more prominent in college populations now actually score lower on measures like that. We wondered if it was actual performance, but it's not. SAT scores are unchanged or down. But we did find evidence from another source to see the type of feedback that these students are given when they're in high school - their grades. And the percentage who graduate with an A-average from high school has doubled, which is another way that captures this emphasis that's placed on feeling good about yourself because if more people are A-students, more people feel good about themselves, even though performance is about the same and the amount of time high school students spend on homework has actually gone down. So it's not that they're working harder. VEDANTAM: I wonder if I can push back at you for just a moment. You know, when you - when you think about young people being more individualistic, being more assertive about their own expectations, I can also see this having a really good side to it. You know, if I'm thinking about young women today, I would imagine that young women probably have higher expectations about their employers, about their romantic partners, about, you know, who they interact with, that they're more assertive about the things that should be coming to them. And I would imagine that this has to be a good thing. TWENGE: Yeah, it's funny you'd mention that because that's how I got into this whole generational thing in the first place. The first few studies that I did were looking at changes in women's personality traits and roles. And that's exactly what we found - that women have become more assertive and more focused on - on leadership. And I think, within limits, that is a good thing that we have more gender equality, that we have women who are more willing to be assertive and that that's more socially acceptable. And when I did those first few papers, I - that was my view - that that was an unmitigated good. And then, as my research went on and I started to look at self-esteem and narcissism and some of the more extreme forms, I realized that it was a tradeoff - that it can be a very good thing to have some assertiveness and some self-confidence, but that it is also very possible for that to be taken too far - not just confidence, but overconfidence. So when it crosses into that overinflated sense of self, which is one definition of narcissism, that's when it can be problematic. VEDANTAM: I have to say, though, that this might not be limited to the 35-and-under crowd, you know, who are in the midst of a presidential election where there are a lot of candidates who are saying, you know, look at me. I'm the best. Things are going to be great under me. I know what I'm doing. I know better than other people. You don't see a lot of careful reflection and self-doubt and caution and, you know, other people know better than I do - you don't hear a lot of that. You hear a lot of bragging. TWENGE: Yeah, so there's actually a study that looked indirectly at presidential narcissism. They looked at historians' depictions of their personality and coded these four on a rubric that lined up with narcissistic personality. And sure enough, our presidents are a narcissistic bunch compared to the average American. But also, that's grown over time. More recent presidents are higher in those narcissistic traits compared to previous decades. Some of that is just the media pulse for this, that in a time when really what a presidential election is about is a public performance. It's not really about caring for other people. It's about a public performance. That polls for more narcissistic personality. VEDANTAM: Psychologist Jean Twenge. When we come back, Jean and I will talk about the downside of making young people feel that they are wildly special. TWENGE: When you talk to millennials, you can really see this disillusionment, that they were set up with this very buoyant view of what their future was going to be. And they ended up disappointed by what they found when they got to adulthood. VEDANTAM: Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Jean Twenge, you've painted a disturbing picture about rising levels of narcissism, personal ambition and individualism. What happens when people's sky-high impressions of themselves and their expectations, their self-image, what happens when all these things collide with reality? TWENGE: Well, it can be a difficult picture. So just for a little background first, we know from these surveys of high school students, for example, that twice as many expect to get, for example, like, a graduate and professional degree compared to boomers in the '70s, yet the same number of people will actually get those degrees. So expectations have grown, and reality has stayed about the same. So at some point, these expectations collide with reality. And that can potentially lead to unhappiness, and it can potentially lead to anxiety and depression and other mental health issues. So we looked at this with happiness recently. And we found a decline in happiness among adults age 30 and older, especially in the last 10 or 15 years. And that may be partially due to these expectations not being met. VEDANTAM: So you're finding something actually quite profoundly sad here, which is it's not just that this culture of individualism is not necessarily helping us when it comes to achievement, but it might actually be counterproductive when it comes to our mental health and our happiness. TWENGE: Yeah, so, you know, the happiness picture was especially interesting because adolescents are actually happier. So, you know, they have the happy individualism and the optimism compared to those, say, in the '90s. But then they hit this wall some time in their mid-20s to 30 when then in recent times, happiness is lower 'cause it used to be people over the age of 30 were significantly happier than those in their 20s. And they still are but by a much smaller margin than they used to be. It used to be growing up, you became more content. And that's not quite as true as it used to be. Then there's the bigger issue of anxiety and depression. And we see more of those issues coming up as well. And even at younger ages, you know, high school students are more likely to say they have trouble sleeping, that they have trouble concentrating. And these are psychosomatic symptoms of depression. VEDANTAM: So there's a real irony here - isn't it? - which is that the generation that has been taught you are special and can make a difference is reaching the conclusion that they are not special and they can't make a difference. And that must be very, very painful. TWENGE: I think so. And I think when you talk to millennials, you can really see this disillusionment and anger that they feel, I think rightly so, that they were set up with this very buoyant view of what their future was going to be. And they - I mean, this was true even before the Great Recession hit, that they ended up disappointed by what they found when they got to adulthood. And then the economic picture changed for the worse, and it became an even more difficult transition to adulthood. VEDANTAM: I want to ask you a personal question. You have children yourself, and you've done a lot of research looking at the potential perils of teaching children to be overly individualistic or narcissistic. What are you doing to change the way your own children think? TWENGE: So we talk a lot about hard work. We don't talk a lot about feeling special at all. It's funny, some people sometimes say to me, oh, do you tell your kids you're not special? Well, no, we just don't talk about it that much. When it does come up - my oldest one in particular, she does know what narcissism means. And we've talked about that. And so, you know, we've - 'cause she sees that. She sees it around her. She sees it in things that we see on TV. And kind of knowing what that is has helped us, you know, have a dialogue about, you know, well, there's the things that are really important, like having friends and doing well in school and spending time with your family. And then there's the things that people think are important that maybe aren't quite as important as everybody thinks they are, like getting lots of attention and looking perfect all the time. And then with my younger two, it's just more of a focus on I love you instead of you're special, which is what parents mean anyway. And then just really focusing on, OK, the way to get better is to work hard and that what you do does make a difference. But it's not just how you feel about yourself, it's what you do. VEDANTAM: What suggestions do you have for young people? We have a lot of millennials who listen to our podcast. What do you think young people can do to both learn from this research but also apply its findings to their own lives? TWENGE: So, you know, first, I really, you know, want folks to understand none of this is meant at all as a criticism. And it's not about blaming. It's about what do young people have to say? And how is that different from what previous generations said when they were the same age? What can we learn from that? How can we take that and understand, you know, have a clear-eyed view of the changes in our culture? So I think every generation - I'm a Gen Xer (ph), so we did the same thing. You know, we looked at our culture. We looked at ourselves and said, hey, you know, there's some things here that need to change. And there's some things here we want to keep. And I think every generation does that. So my hope is that millennials will do that and say, hey, you know, maybe I'm not going to tell my kids that they're so special and that they can be anything. Maybe I'm going to tell my kids that I love them, and we need to focus on working hard and making friends and those things that are more important in life. Maybe we'll see that cultural shift. VEDANTAM: After having done all this work looking at the rise of individualism and narcissism, when you go to a party or when you go to a classroom, are you actually counting off in your head saying, you know, narcissist, not a narcissist, individualist, not an individualist? I mean, are you keeping a running tally as you look at the news about, you know, how these personality traits are manifesting themselves in different people? TWENGE: Well, sometimes it's glaringly obvious, even people who don't have a background in narcissism, much less psychology, to see displays of narcissism in the current political scene. But in some cases, yes, there are some - sometimes there are ways that you can spot someone who has these personality traits. And, you know, some people have said to me, well, you know, is that really useful? You're just labeling people. But I think the history of psychology suggests that it's not just a label, it's that once you label it, then you can understand it because then you can draw on the huge body of research evidence to now, OK, that might help me predict what this person is going to do next. So that, you know, this guy I'm dating, you know, he tends to turn the conversation back around to himself. And he likes to brag about his status. What will happen next? Well, in three months, he's going to leave you for a younger model. That's what's going to happen next. So it's very useful to have an understanding of this trait, among other things. VEDANTAM: Do you apply it in your own life and in your own personal relationships of who you want to have as colleagues or friends? TWENGE: I did give my husband the narcissistic personality inventory on our fourth date. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). TWENGE: I'm not kidding. I wish I was, but I'm not. It was snuck in with a bunch of other personality questionnaires. But I did do that. And, yeah, he scored low, and the rest is history.

SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  This is HIDDEN BRAIN. You don't have to look far to see evidence of narcissism in our culture. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"I AM A GOD\") KANYE WEST: (Rapping) I am a god. Hurry up with my damn massage. DONALD TRUMP: I'm really rich. I actually think I have the best temperament. People love me. And you know what? I've been very successful. Everybody loves me. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"KEEPING UP WITH THE KARDASHIANS\") KIM KARDASHIAN: I have not done a selfie in this glam room. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: How many selfies are you going to do in one day? You're, like, obsessed. KARDASHIAN: I just need - I need 1,200. VEDANTAM: Kanye West, Donald Trump and Kim Kardashian are only the tip of the iceberg. Our society is in the midst of a full-blown narcissism epidemic. It doesn't take a psychologist to see that, but we decided to talk to one anyway. JEAN TWENGE: We're more focused on the self. We're less focused on social rules. At the extreme, that can turn into this narcissistic attention seeking of, everybody, look at me and how great I am. VEDANTAM: This is Jean Twenge. She's a psychologist at San Diego State. She's analyzed data collected from millions of people over the last half century. TWENGE: We found that if you look at baby boomers in the '60s compared to millennials in more recent times, millennials are much more likely to say that they think they're above average. VEDANTAM: We'll talk about what this means for young people later in the conversation. But Jean Twenge says our culture as a whole - from reality TV to social media - has come to encourage an obsessive focus on the self. TWENGE: I think there are a lot of factors.

So just for a little background first, we know from these surveys of high school students, for example, that twice as many expect to get, for example, like, a graduate and professional degree compared to boomers in the '70s, yet the same number of people will actually get those degrees. So expectations have grown, and reality has stayed about the same. So at some point, these expectations collide with reality. And that can potentially lead to unhappiness, and it can potentially lead to anxiety and depression and other mental health issues. So we looked at this with happiness recently. And we found a decline in happiness among adults age 30 and older, especially in the last 10 or 15 years. And that may be partially due to these expectations not being met. VEDANTAM: So you're finding something actually quite profoundly sad here, which is it's not just that this culture of individualism is not necessarily helping us when it comes to achievement, but it might actually be counterproductive when it comes to our mental health and our happiness. TWENGE: Yeah, so, you know, the happiness picture was especially interesting because adolescents are actually happier. So, you know, they have the happy individualism and the optimism compared to those, say, in the '90s. But then they hit this wall some time in their mid-20s to 30 when then in recent times, happiness is lower 'cause it used to be people over the age of 30 were significantly happier than those in their 20s. And they still are but by a much smaller margin than they used to be. It used to be growing up, you became more content. And that's not quite as true as it used to be. Then there's the bigger issue of anxiety and depression. And we see more of those issues coming up as well. And even at younger ages, you know, high school students are more likely to say they have trouble sleeping, that they have trouble concentrating. And these are psychosomatic symptoms of depression. VEDANTAM: So there's a real irony here - isn't it? - which is that the generation that has been taught you are special and can make a difference is reaching the conclusion that they are not special and they can't make a difference. And that must be very, very painful. TWENGE: I think so. And I think when you talk to millennials, you can really see this disillusionment and anger that they feel, I think rightly so, that they were set up with this very buoyant view of what their future was going to be. And they - I mean, this was true even before the Great Recession hit, that they ended up disappointed by what they found when they got to adulthood. And then the economic picture changed for the worse, and it became an even more difficult transition to adulthood. VEDANTAM: I want to ask you a personal question. You have children yourself, and you've done a lot of research looking at the potential perils of teaching children to be overly individualistic or narcissistic. What are you doing to change the way your own children think? TWENGE: So we talk a lot about hard work. We don't talk a lot about feeling special at all. It's funny, some people sometimes say to me, oh, do you tell your kids you're not special? Well, no, we just don't talk about it that much. When it does come up - my oldest one in particular, she does know what narcissism means. And we've talked about that. And so, you know, we've - 'cause she sees that. She sees it around her. She sees it in things that we see on TV. And kind of knowing what that is has helped us, you know, have a dialogue about, you know, well, there's the things that are really important, like having friends and doing well in school and spending time with your family. And then there's the things that people think are important that maybe aren't quite as important as everybody thinks they are, like getting lots of attention and looking perfect all the time. And then with my younger two, it's just more of a focus on I love you instead of you're special, which is what parents mean anyway. And then just really focusing on, OK, the way to get better is to work hard and that what you do does make a difference. But it's not just how you feel about yourself, it's what you do. VEDANTAM: What suggestions do you have for young people? We have a lot of millennials who listen to our podcast. What do you think young people can do to both learn from this research but also apply its findings to their own lives? TWENGE: So, you know, first, I really, you know, want folks to understand none of this is meant at all as a criticism. And it's not about blaming. It's about what do young people have to say? And how is that different from what previous generations said when they were the same age? What can we learn from that? How can we take that and understand, you know, have a clear-eyed view of the changes in our culture? So I think every generation - I'm a Gen Xer (ph), so we did the same thing. You know, we looked at our culture. We looked at ourselves and said, hey, you know, there's some things here that need to change. And there's some things here we want to keep. And I think every generation does that. So my hope is that millennials will do that and say, hey, you know, maybe I'm not going to tell my kids that they're so special and that they can be anything. Maybe I'm going to tell my kids that I love them, and we need to focus on working hard and making friends and those things that are more important in life. Maybe we'll see that cultural shift. VEDANTAM: After having done all this work looking at the rise of individualism and narcissism, when you go to a party or when you go to a classroom, are you actually counting off in your head saying, you know, narcissist, not a narcissist, individualist, not an individualist? I mean, are you keeping a running tally as you look at the news about, you know, how these personality traits are manifesting themselves in different people? TWENGE: Well, sometimes it's glaringly obvious, even people who don't have a background in narcissism, much less psychology, to see displays of narcissism in the current political scene. But in some cases, yes, there are some - sometimes there are ways that you can spot someone who has these personality traits. And, you know, some people have said to me, well, you know, is that really useful? You're just labeling people. But I think the history of psychology suggests that it's not just a label, it's that once you label it, then you can understand it because then you can draw on the huge body of research evidence to now, OK, that might help me predict what this person is going to do next. So that, you know, this guy I'm dating, you know, he tends to turn the conversation back around to himself. And he likes to brag about his status. What will happen next? Well, in three months, he's going to leave you for a younger model. That's what's going to happen next. So it's very useful to have an understanding of this trait, among other things. VEDANTAM: Do you apply it in your own life and in your own personal relationships of who you want to have as colleagues or friends? TWENGE: I did give my husband the narcissistic personality inventory on our fourth date. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). TWENGE: I'm not kidding. I wish I was, but I'm not. It was snuck in with a bunch of other personality questionnaires. But I did do that. And, yeah, he scored low, and the rest is history.

It uses the Tea Party to explore how much racial identity and attitudes towards minorities determine political leanings. NPR social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam has been looking at the study and joins us now Hey, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: And also from NPR's Code Switch team Gene Demby is here to talk with us about some of the larger themes this research brings up. Hey, Gene. GENE DEMBY, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: So, Shankar, let's start with you. Like any political movement, the Tea Party is big and encompasses a range of ideologies. Many people who sympathize with this group are motivated by a desire for low taxes or less government regulation. How does this study bring race into the conversation? VEDANTAM: So they first divided volunteers into two groups. One was shown a picture of President Obama. The second was shown a picture of Obama where his skin was artificially made to look darker than it actually is. Now, since these groups were created at random, they ought to be no difference between them in terms of the way they think about politics. But the researchers found that more whites in the group shown the picture of Obama with a darkened skin tone supported the Tea Party. Here's Stanford sociologist Robb Willer. ROBB WILLER: White Americans who saw the darkened picture of Barack Obama where his identity as a nonwhite American has been made more prominent, more salient to them were more likely to report that they supported the Tea Party. SHAPIRO: So interesting. And before we talk about what that means, they went on and did a second experiment that adds more to our understanding of this. What was the second experiment? VEDANTAM: That's right. So in another part of the experiment, Willer and his co-authors provided volunteers with information. In one case, they suggest that demographic changes are happening very rapidly in America. In another case, they suggest these demographic changes are happening relatively slowly. The researchers find that whites who got the feeling that demographic changes were happening quickly were more likely to say they support the Tea Party than whites who think the change is happening slowly. Willer and his colleagues think that some whites experience a feeling of anxiety and threat when confronted by these changing racial demographics. And that this sense of anxiety and threat might prompt them to be drawn to the Tea Party. SHAPIRO: Now, the Tea Party is not a huge force in the 2016 election, but a lot of the themes you're talking about in this experiment are very relevant to this campaign. And that's where I want to bring in Gene Demby from our Code Switch team. Gene, how do the themes of these experiments tie into the reporting you've been doing on this moment in American politics? DEMBY: Yeah. We've done a few stories on whiteness in our current political moment. Whiteness is a thing that is becoming explicit in people's understanding of themselves as white. So it sort of makes sense that here's this guy who's the president of the United States. He's incredibly prominent. For the first time in the history of the country, he is not a white person. He's sort of the avatar of this demographic change. And so he animates and activates a lot of anxieties around whiteness becoming explicit. SHAPIRO: Except why should demographic change inevitably prompt anxiety? VEDANTAM: I think that's the interesting question, Ari. And in fact, in another experiment that Willer and his colleagues conducted, they find that when you tell whites that blacks and Latinos are closing the income gap with whites, more whites are likely to support the Tea Party. So some whites perceive themselves as being in a zero-sum game with members of some minority groups. DEMBY: I find that fascinating only because I guess a lot of people even people who will not explicitly say that this is a zero-sum game understand on some subtextual level that what is happening is about the allocation of resources and that those things have always been sort of divvied up by race. SHAPIRO: Shankar, you've been looking into why there might be a disparity between people who say they are motivated by libertarian issues such as taxes or regulations and the research showing that race actually plays a role as well. Why do you think this disconnect exists? VEDANTAM: Well, there are really multiple possibilities, Ari. One is that people might not be telling surveyors what they actually think when it comes to race. But there's another possibility which is that people don't fully understand their own motivations. Here's how Willer put it. WILLER: Not only is it socially unacceptable to report racial prejudice if you have it, but it may be even unacceptable to report it or admit it to yourself. VEDANTAM: It might be that people are being entirely sincere when they say that race has nothing to do with the political choices they're making. What the research is pointing to is that without their awareness, it might be playing a factor. DEMBY: I mean, it makes sense. This has really fascinated me. I mean, it makes sense that especially because we know how people identify politically. The Republican Party at this point is almost entirely white - I think it's like around 90 percent white - that anything that is sort of supported by things on the right gets coded as white. And any ideas that are supported by people on the left is coded as part of this like march of multiculturalism. So it makes sense that if the Republican Party or even just the right broadly were to align itself with an idea that that would become implicitly about white people. SHAPIRO: Gene, it seems as though in this presidential election things that maybe used to be dog whistles or subtle cues have become more explicit. . . DEMBY: Yeah. SHAPIRO: . . . Whether we are talking about a wall with Mexico or limiting Muslim immigration. If we have evidence that people are subliminally motivated by race regardless, is there any advantage to having the conversation openly rather than pretending that race doesn't influence us? DEMBY: Well, there could be social consequences for you to saying it in public to other people. Donald Trump sort of gets to exist outside of that. And I think that's one of the reasons that people have gravitated towards him is because he can say the things they can't say. SHAPIRO: That's Gene Demby from our Code Switch podcast and Shankar Vedantam from our Hidden Brain podcast, which explores the unseen patterns in human behavior. Thanks to both of you. VEDANTAM: Thanks, Ari. DEMBY: Thank you. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  There's a new study about politics and racial bias.

I'm Terry Gross. It's summertime, when a lot of us head to the beach and try not to think about the man-eating sharks we've seen in movies like \"Jaws. \" Remember Hooper, the shark expert played by a young Richard Dreyfuss? (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"JAWS\")RICHARD DREYFUSS: (As Matt Hooper) What we are dealing with here is a perfect engine, an eating machine. It's really a miracle of evolution. All this machine does is swim and eat and make little sharks. And that's all. GROSS: Our guest today is a real-life Hooper of sorts. Dr. Neil Hammerschlag is a marine ecologist at the University of Miami, where he directs its Shark Research and Conservation Program. He spends a lot of time on and in the water. He's caught and tagged more than a thousand sharks for research and has studied and filmed some of the largest of the shark species, the great white and tiger sharks. The tags he implants in sharks transmit information about the health and behavior of these predatory animals. Hammerschlag has some tips on how to stay safe around them, and he'll explain how we're much more of a threat to sharks than they are to us. His work is featured in two of the episodes of The Discovery Channel's recent Shark Week. He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies. DAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, welcome to FRESH AIR. I'd like to start with an experience - and this is something that you mentioned in a TED talk - of an encounter with a shark about 10 years ago. What happened? NEIL HAMMERSCHLAG: Yeah. I mean, it was a beautiful late afternoon, early evening in the Bahamas. And I was on a boat - a live-aboard, meaning you kind of live and sleep on the boat. And we were diving throughout the day. We were actually looking for sharks, so we were baiting them in, trying to get close. And we had had limited success. We hadn't seen that many sharks. And so it was getting late. I went into the shower to kind of wash up, and I heard someone yell tiger shark. And I had never seen one before so - you know, I was a bit younger and more excited and I guess green. And I put on my snorkel gear and grabbed my camera, ran to the back of the boat and pretty much just cannonballed into the water and saw these huge two tiger sharks approaching me, 3-and-a-half-foot-wide heads coming close. One peeled off, but the other one moved right in towards me and came so close that actually, it couldn't even see me from looking dead on because like all fish, they kind of have the eyes on their - side of their head. So they're - it was so close that it had to rotate around to kind of eyeball me up and down. Then it rotated back and opened its mouth - and I was looking through its mouth down its, you know, gut and seeing its gills from the inside - closed its mouth again. It circled me several times. It swam off only to come back and do that all again. You know, come so close that it had to rotate around to eyeball me, swam circles around me, and kind of moved back off into the dark water because it was evening at that time. DAVIES: When the shark approached you, were you afraid? HAMMERSCHLAG: You know, I wasn't afraid, actually. It was such an intense encounter. You know, it was certainly thrilling, but it was more of a sense of kind of awe. It was opening its mouth, but it wasn't in pursuit. It wasn't, like, trying to bite me or anything. It was kind of standing still. And it was probably helping enable the shark to funnel water in its mouth and over its gills, or maybe it was some sort of communication. You know, I know from some of my past research a shark sometimes will kind of show off or show some dominance by opening and closing its mouth. DAVIES: I know from reading about you that you do a lot of research on tiger sharks near a place called Tiger Beach. It's in the Bahamas, right? You want to just describe it? HAMMERSCHLAG: Yeah. This is actually where this occurred. It was the first time I had ever been to Tiger Beach. Tiger Beach - although it's called a beach, it's nothing close to a beach. It's a shallow water area on the Little Bahama Bank in the Bahamas. And the reason - a friend of mine who found the area named Jim Abernethy, he nicknamed it Tiger Beach as - in hopes of misleading trophy fisherman who would - might be looking for big tiger sharks to maybe catch and kill them. So it was a way to mislead them. They would - might be going looking for a beach. But in fact, there's no land around. It's just a shallow water area. And surprisingly, it's averaged around 15 to 20 feet deep. However, you have numerous tiger sharks that are actually longer and bigger than the depth of the water there. You know, numerous animals that are over 15 feet swimming around there, and just a high density of tiger sharks. And what's amazing is usually an area doesn't have a lot of big predators. It takes a lot of food to support a single predator. So - a very large predator. So, you know, one area doesn't usually have a high density of these big, you know, kind of super predators swimming around. So to find a spot where it was dominated by these predators - and in fact, they happened to be all female. Well, the majority were female. It was really intriguing to me, so it kind of set off a pursuit - this research pursuit to try to figure out why there are so many big tiger sharks in this one shallow area, and why are they mostly female? You know, if it was really great for food, I would've thought we would also be seeing a lot of big male sharks. So that kind of sparked the interest there to make that a strong research priority. DAVIES: Right. In one of the Discovery Channel episodes of Shark Week, they focus on this place and your research at Tiger Beach and your work with tiger sharks. In one of these scenes in the Discovery Channel, you and some other divers are underwater. And I guess you're cleaning off an acoustic sensor that's on the bottom of the ocean, and this swarm of tiger sharks approach and come really close to you. And it looks pretty scary. Can you describe what was going on? HAMMERSCHLAG: Yeah, we were - it was - I have a series of underwater acoustic receivers. They're underwater hydrophones. And they're set up as listening stations. And what they're listening for are specific transmitter tags that I actually surgically implant in tiger sharks that send out a high-frequency sound that those listening stations are essentially underwater trying to receive. And so every now and then, we go to clean off and also download that data. So we were underwater, relatively shallow, cleaning off these underwater hydrophones, these receivers. And there were several tiger sharks - large tiger sharks - around. And they got really curious and inquisitive. There was some bait under the water that - you know, minced fish that were bringing tiger sharks nearby. And I think they just got really curious and started coming in pretty close. And we were having to - I wouldn't say it was aggressive, but it was pretty chaotic. There was just a lot more that were around than we - that was easy to keep, you know, your eye on. And so we were kind of having to push them away a bit and had to kind of get out of the water. DAVIES: Well, I mean, what you see on the video is - you hear the audio of one of the divers warning you and your fellow diver, who's cleaning off these acoustic sensors - you've got another one coming in on your right. Look, behind you, behind you. And there's a sense of urgency there. And then we see you or the divers turn, and then this massive shark comes up. And you put your hand on its nose and push it away. What's going on there? HAMMERSCHLAG: Yeah. I mean, these sharks are not afraid of anything. And they will come right in close. I mean, these things are - these individuals are built like tanks. I mean, they're 10-plus feet. You know, some of them were easily over 14, 15 feet. They've got this impressive weaponeering in terms of teeth. And they just don't have this kind of self-awareness of being afraid or - you know, they're very curious and inquisitive. And they'll come right in. And sometimes they'll bite you as exploration. They have a variety of senses, including touch. And they don't have, you know, finger tips like we do to feel things around. Often they use their teeth to feel things. And if they're coming in to give you even an exploratory bite, that's game over in the case of a tiger shark. So we have to be on our - totally aware and making sure that doesn't happen. And when you have five, six, seven tiger sharks swimming around - not to mention probably 10 other smaller species that are less of a concern - it's a lot to keep track of down there. And in one case, you know, these tiger sharks coming up behind you - you've just got to keep your head on a swivel and make sure that they don't actually end up getting too close because the thing is that when they get close, if you're keeping eye contact with them and kind of putting your camera between you and them, they often will turn away. They don't come in. But if you have your back turned to them, often they'll come in to check you out with an exploratory bite in some cases. And you don't want that to happen. So you - it - there is absolutely a sense of urgency if there's one behind you that you don't see. DAVIES: And what would an exploratory bite do? I mean, like, kittens will, like, gnaw at you. This - we're not talking about that. HAMMERSCHLAG: Well, it might not necessarily be aggressive. But the fact - when you have, you know, a couple thousand pounds of animal behind a bite on a head that's several - 4 feet wide, with a mouth that's got these teeth that are serrated, you know, razor sharp and powerful, even - as gentle as they want - would want to be in kind of biting you, it would - in terms of a tiger shark it would be devastating. Tiger sharks are pretty famous for being able to eat turtles. They're among one of the few species of sharks that because of their dentition and their size and the fact that their teeth are separated, they can cut through turtle bone, turtle shell. You know, they eat whales. They have the power and the tools to pretty much get through anything. So, you know, some wetsuit and skin is not going to be an issue if they end up trying to bite you. DAVIES: And so when one of these would come too close and you would put your hand on the shark's nose and push it away - you know, if we were out in the wild and a wild animal came to us, I think we would think of pushing them as something that would provoke them to attack. Is that not the case with sharks? HAMMERSCHLAG: Sharks are ambush predators. So if you happen to see a shark there's a good chance that it's already seen you for a little while. And so in most cases, they are going to not come very close. Most sharks don't like to come away. In most instances, in order to have - get sharks close up, you have to bait them or kind of attract them in with minced fish. If that's the case, they're interested in finding that fish and eating that fish. So you just don't want to get in the way of it. And, you know, I don't think most people are going to find a situation where they have to push away a shark. But if you do find yourself in a situation where - that you don't feel comfortable with a shark, the best thing to do is not run away or swim away. You know, that's what their food does. Their food runs away from them. The best thing to do is actually just approach them, maintain eye contact. And I wouldn't try to touch them or push them unless they came, you know, within - so close that that's what they were going to do to you. If they came to open their mouth that might be a situation where you - it would probably be good to push them away. But probably the most important thing is just to maintain very strong eye contact with them and kind of follow them around. And usually they're going to find that uncomfortable. DAVIES: So if you are swimming and you become aware of a shark - I mean, you can't maintain eye contact with a shark probably out of the water - what do you do? HAMMERSCHLAG: I would just move slowly, swimming kind of backwards so you're keeping the front of you towards the shark and, you know, kind of backing up slowly out of the water. DAVIES: OK, (laughter) I'll try and remember to do that. HAMMERSCHLAG: You know, that's what it seems like. . . DAVIES: (Laughter). HAMMERSCHLAG: . . . But people aren't going to really find themselves in that situation. You know, most sharks don't like people. The truth of the matter is that, you know, I spend a lot of time and energy trying to get sharks close to me either to - when I'm diving for fun to see them or when I'm doing research and trying to get them close for - to capture them or to study them. It's actually really difficult. In most cases, we have to bait them in. We have to go to the places we think they're going to be. We have to bait them in with minced fish to kind of attract them. And it's actually quite challenging to get them to come close to people. And it sometimes - it doesn't take very much to deter them. And it often is just saying hey, I see you and keeping eye contact because they're quite wary of that. A lot of the predatory sharks, including tiger sharks, are ambush predators. And when they know they're being watched they feel a bit uncomfortable and they're less likely to come close to you. DAVIES: Neil Hammerschlag is a marine ecologist and shark researcher at the University of Miami. We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with Neil Hammerschlag. He is a marine ecologist and shark researcher at the University of Miami. You've spent all this time in this area in the Bahamas where, as you've noted, there's a large concentration of tiger sharks, particularly females. Have you figured out why they might be there? HAMMERSCHLAG: I actually thought it would be linked to reproduction. So my colleague and I, James Sulikowski from the University of New England, we went out there with a high-definition ultrasound. And when we were capturing the sharks, we were running these ultrasounds on the sharks, in the field, to see if they were pregnant or not. And what we found is that a high proportion of the females are actually pregnant and mature. And what we think is that this Tiger Beach area serves as a gestation ground for some of these large pregnant tiger sharks. They're cold-blooded, and so they depend on the water temperature for their metabolism. And, in fact, warmer water helps speed up their gestation. These tiger sharks have gestation periods, meaning they're pregnant for over a year. And warmer water is going to actually help speed up that gestation. And their offspring will actually grow bigger, which is better. And so we think they're using the shallow water, warm, stable areas as a gestation ground to help with accelerating their pregnancies. DAVIES: So you found a maternity ward. HAMMERSCHLAG: That's what we think. DAVIES: How do you do an ultrasound on a shark? HAMMERSCHLAG: Carefully. DAVIES: (Laughter). HAMMERSCHLAG: But - and, you know, once we've got the shark secured on the boat, you know, we would kind of rotate it around so its abdomen was exposed. And we had a special portable ultrasound, high-definition ultrasound with a probe. And just as you would give, you know, someone a sonogram or an ultrasound, where you've got a probe and you're looking on the screen - but one of the cool things because of all the light around you when you're - when you're outside, they have actually got these special goggles that you put on your eye. They kind of look like these virtual reality goggles that you wear. That sees in kind of real time what the probe is looking at. So while you're moving that probe around the abdomen, in the uterus area of the tiger sharks, you're actually seeing that image. DAVIES: So let's talk a bit about these animals. How long have sharks been around on the planet? HAMMERSCHLAG: Sharks have been around on the planet, in some way or another, over 440 million years. That's 200 million years or so prior to any dinosaur walking the face of this planet. So these are ancient creatures that have been evolving for hundreds of millions of years to be the super predators that they are. DAVIES: Sharks are at the apex of a food chain. Does that make them a more valuable subject for study? HAMMERSCHLAG: Yeah. That's a - that's a great question. And the answer is, absolutely. Many shark species are top predators or live at the - kind of the apex of the food web. And because of that, what happens to the sharks and have - have consequences for the rest of the food chain. And right now, globally, many shark populations are declining due to overfishing. And there's this big concern is - what's going to happen to the rest of the food web, to the whole community of organisms, when you remove that top predator? DAVIES: Talk about the threats to sharks as a species. Now, are they deliberately fished or are they caught accidentally by long lines that are actually, you know, trying to get swordfish or other species? HAMMERSCHLAG: Sharks are faced by a number of threats. They're being faced by targeted fishing, in which sharks are being directly targeted and captured, mostly for their fins to actually make shark fin soup, which is an Asian delicacy, particularly consumed in China in the diaspora. However, sharks are being captured, pretty much globally, to supply the shark fin trade and the demand for shark fin soup. Sharks are also caught unintentionally, which is known as bycatch, in fisheries that are targeting swordfish or tuna. And then other threats include, you know, destruction of their nursery grounds. A lot of sharks use shallow water areas like mangroves and seagrass beds close to shore for their nursery grounds. They give birth there, and then the little baby sharks grow up in those safe and shallow water environments. But a lot of those, particularly here in our area in Florida, are being, you know, destroyed - built up into sea walls and marinas. And, you know, new threats include overfishing of their food that they like to eat. And now issues related to climate change. You know, how are these large sharks going to be dealing with changes in the water chemistry and the temperature? DAVIES: You have a number, something like 70 million sharks a year are caught and killed. Is that right? HAMMERSCHLAG: Right now, the latest estimates suggest an average of about 100 million sharks annually are being killed. DAVIES: Is that mostly for shark fin soup? HAMMERSCHLAG: Right now, the closest estimate is about an average of 100 million sharks a year are being killed globally. We're not sure exactly how many sharks are being directly targeted for their fins. But work that have actually counted the number of fins in the shark fin market suggest somewhere between 20 and over 70 million sharks annually are making their way through the shark fin trade. DAVIES: Wow. Why is shark fin soup considered a delicacy? HAMMERSCHLAG: It's mainly consumed as a cultural sign of wealth. It's a long-held tradition. It has no color, no taste, no smell in itself. In fact, to the soup itself has to be added, you know, chicken broth, beef or pork broth just to give it a taste. And many people who consume shark fin soup have no idea that it actually comes from sharks or that sharks are in any trouble or are declining as a result. DAVIES: Are there efforts to control this? HAMMERSCHLAG: Absolutely. Many countries around the world are taking action to limit the amount of shark finning. And there is a new legislation just proposed in Congress, in the U. S, to actually ban the trade and selling of fins. A shark fin ban was just introduced. That's making its way through Congress. And a lot of other places in the world are placing in regulations. However, you know, shark finning is a global phenomenon and as is the shark fin trade. But there's a lot of efforts to try to promote, you know, more conservation and to lower the demand of shark fin. GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with Dr. Neil Hammerschlag. He directs the University of Miami's Shark Research and Conservation program. After a break, they'll talk about how common shark attacks on humans really are. And we'll hear from Patti Niemi, percussionist with the San Francisco Opera Orchestra. She brought a couple of her instruments with her. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with Dr. Neil Hammerschlag about his work researching, tagging and tracking sharks. He directs the University of Miami's Shark Research and Conservation program. He's filmed some of the largest of these predators, like the great white shark and tiger sharks. And he was featured in two episodes of the Discovery Channel's recent Shark Week. DAVIES: How common are shark attacks on humans? HAMMERSCHLAG: So shark bites on human are actually quite uncommon. It's quite rare. If you think about how many people are using the water and the other risks, I mean, you have more of a chance of getting struck by lightning. You have more chance of dying from a vending machine falling on you. And you have more of a chance by being bitten by other people in New York City in a year than you do of getting bit by sharks. So their risk from shark is quite low. DAVIES: You know, in the movie \"Jaws,\" they introduced this idea of territoriality, that if a shark finds a beach where there's, you know, targets for attack, they'll stay there. Is there something to this? HAMMERSCHLAG: What I will say is there's something to the fact that sharks are opportunistic and that if there's a good food source for them, you know, I think that they're opportunistically going to take advantage of that food source. However, where those types of movies get it wrong is that sharks don't have any interest in humans as a food source. Humans are not on the shark's menu. And proof is the fact that how rare shark bite actually is. I mean, there'd be nothing easier for a shark than to kind of patrol the beaches during the summers and eat people if we're on the menu because it would be a pretty easy thing to do. But the fact that, you know, shark bite is so rare and there's so many people in the water just shows that we're not on the menu. DAVIES: Do sharks end up in urban areas sometimes? HAMMERSCHLAG: Yes, so we have a project here in Miami to look at the sharks' movement and health around urban areas and close to Miami including around the port where, you know, there's cruise ships or, you know, right up by Brickell or even downtown in the Miami River. So we have a pretty significant project right now that we call the urban shark project to really understand the behaviors of sharks around, you know, urban environments. DAVIES: They're not, like, domesticated like geese that get used to getting fed by people in a park, right? I mean, they don't attach themselves to civilization, do they? HAMMERSCHLAG: We don't know. But, you know, in some places in the world where fishermen go out for the day and catch, you know, a lot of different fishes and then come back to the marina and clean off their fish, their catch, and then dump the carcasses in the water, they've found that sharks start aggregating around those marinas. And as long as you're - keep on dumping your carcasses off the marinas, the sharks are going to stay there and do it. So there's certainly places that have found that sharks will, you know, feed and take advantage of those discards, those free meals, if they're being made available to them. DAVIES: When you've studied sharks in a particular area over time, have you been able to discern individual personalities in sharks? HAMMERSCHLAG: Absolutely. One of the really neat things is even within a species to see how much individual differences there are in personality. There are sharks that are, you know, really shy. And there's others that are really bold. And it has nothing to do with their length. You know, you could have two sharks of kind of the same size and some just are much more curious and inquisitive than others and some that are really shy and always keep their distance no matter what you do. DAVIES: And do you see the same ones more than once so you actually get to know them and identify them? HAMMERSCHLAG: Yeah so - yeah, there's sharks that I've in - for example, in Tiger Beach that I first dove with in 2003 and have almost on an annual basis seen this shark over the years and have been diving with her up until today and seen her put on a thousand pounds in the process. And, you know, you can see these really strong personalities where they come in really calm but very curious and, you know, have an absolute, pretty strong personality that you can almost identify the individual, you know, just based on the way they're moving in the water and the way they approach you. DAVIES: So when you get in the water and a familiar one appears, do you think they're recognizing you and saying, hey, Neil, you're back? HAMMERSCHLAG: I don't think that they're thinking that for me. But they certainly - I think they know what a, you know, what a diver is in the sense that it's not food. And they certainly - they know the situation of, you know, OK, you're just a diver. You're going to hang out here. But I don't think they recognize me. I'm not there as much. But, you know, it's pretty cool to be able to jump in the water and say, hey, look, there's Emma (ph) the tiger shark, you know? Oh, there's - you know, we have names for them like Emma, and Jamon (ph) and even one called Pickles (ph) and, you know - hey, look, check it out, it's Pickles or Emma or Jamon - you know? - or Hook (ph) is another one that's pretty common. And that's kind of cool to be able to do that, you know, over the course of years. DAVIES: You do a lot of tagging of sharks for research. And I want to talk about that. What tests do you perform? What samples do you take? What do you do to the shark while you have it? HAMMERSCHLAG: There's actually quite a long procedure. We actually have a lot of different samples and tests that we perform, but we do it over very quick amount of time. If you're watching what we do, it almost looks like a race car pit crew, where the car comes in and all these people kind of descend and do all these different tasks and then quickly sends that race car on its way. And that's the same thing that's happening with the shark. Immediately once we capture the shark and have secured it, the next thing we'll do is actually put a tag in the shark. And we have several different kinds of tags. We have some that are just identification tags that act like bar codes. There are other ones that are tags that send off - a pinging tag that - actually a transmitter that sends off high frequency sounds that have encoded information that are picked up by underwater receivers or hydrophones. And then we also use satellite tags that will attach to the shark's fin that will transmit to an orbiting Argo satellite when the sharks are moving through the water column and tell us where those animals are. We also take several measurements of the lengths of the sharks and the girths of the sharks, their body shape, including their tail shape and head shape to see how that changes between species or even within a species as they grow older. We draw blood from the shark to run several tests on the blood where we're looking at reproductive hormones to get an idea if they're mature. We can get an idea of their diet and their feeding behaviors based on the chemical signature in their blood. We also look at their health through doing some immune work. And we even look at their energy stores, given this idea of their nutrition. DAVIES: You spend so much time researching sharks and out on the water interacting with them directly. And I'm wondering how you feel about the, you know, the popular portrayal of sharks, especially in movies? I mean, \"Jaws,\" you know, scared the nation out of the water for years. Do you like that movie? HAMMERSCHLAG: You know, I'm personally entertained by \"Jaws. \" And I think it's a cool movie. And, you know, I think it's amazing how it put sharks into pop culture. DAVIES: I have to ask you, do you identify with Hooper, the Richard Dreyfuss character? He's the shark expert. HAMMERSCHLAG: Yeah, no, I don't. I don't. I guess - I don't really. There are other people that do. And there's a lot of shark people that really like \"Jaws. \" But at the same time, it's really unfortunate that that movie was made because it demonized sharks. And it certainly created - you know, people didn't really care about sharks. It wasn't on people's consciousness. And now after that movie came out, there's a lot of people who kind of wanted to rid the ocean of sharks and thought that any good shark was a dead shark. And that couldn't be further from the truth. We know now that sharks represent a very small risk to humans and that humans represent a much larger risk to sharks, we're removing them by the tens of millions a year. And we know now that that's not good for the functioning of marine ecosystems. DAVIES: In Australia, there's what's called the shark cull, where the idea is to reduce the population of sharks that are considered dangerous to swimmers. Tell us about that. HAMMERSCHLAG: This is very unfortunate. You know, in Australia right now, due to a bunch of, you know, high-profile shark bites on people that resulted in fatality, there's now pretty much a, you know, nation-wide cull that they are killing sharks, very large sharks. And I think it's very unfortunate because, you know, there's just very little evidence scientifically that that's going to work, unless you can reduce the population to such significant levels. And it's a shame because a public policy to just go out and kill sharks, you know, I think, is not a very strong one. It's not based in science, not based in conservation. You know, I think right now we need to be shark smart. For people who use the water, who use the beaches, it's not about limiting our sharks or preventing people from going in the water. It's about us using the water more smart. For people who have looked at trends in shark bites, what they show is that more reflects how people use the water than any behavior about sharks. And for example, you know, in California, shark bites that happen on people are usually surfers before 8:00 a. m. and after 5:00 p. m. And that's not because the sharks prefer eating early in the morning or late in the evening. It's that that's when surfers go surfing, before and after work. And, you know, this is when there's dark water, when, you know, there's some evidence that sharks are getting more active during that period and feeding and also when it's harder for the sharks to kind of distinguish people from maybe some other prey items like seals. So I think we need to be more smart about the way we use our water environment and try to reduce our risk by kind of behaving in a shark-smart way rather than trying to eliminate sharks. DAVIES: Well, Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, thanks so much for speaking with us. HAMMERSCHLAG: My pleasure. It's been really great. GROSS: Dr. Neil Hammerschlag directs the University of Miami's Shark Research and Conservation Program. He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies, who is also WHYY's senior reporter. After a break, we'll hear from Patti Niemi, percussionist with the San Francisco Opera Orchestra. She brought a couple of instruments with her. This is FRESH AIR. TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. It's summertime, when a lot of us head to the beach and try not to think about the man-eating sharks we've seen in movies like \"Jaws. \" Remember Hooper, the shark expert played by a young Richard Dreyfuss? (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"JAWS\") RICHARD DREYFUSS: (As Matt Hooper) What we are dealing with here is a perfect engine, an eating machine. It's really a miracle of evolution. All this machine does is swim and eat and make little sharks. And that's all. GROSS: Our guest today is a real-life Hooper of sorts. Dr. Neil Hammerschlag is a marine ecologist at the University of Miami, where he directs its Shark Research and Conservation Program. He spends a lot of time on and in the water. He's caught and tagged more than a thousand sharks for research and has studied and filmed some of the largest of the shark species, the great white and tiger sharks. The tags he implants in sharks transmit information about the health and behavior of these predatory animals. Hammerschlag has some tips on how to stay safe around them, and he'll explain how we're much more of a threat to sharks than they are to us. His work is featured in two of the episodes of The Discovery Channel's recent Shark Week. He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies. DAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, welcome to FRESH AIR. I'd like to start with an experience - and this is something that you mentioned in a TED talk - of an encounter with a shark about 10 years ago. What happened? NEIL HAMMERSCHLAG: Yeah. I mean, it was a beautiful late afternoon, early evening in the Bahamas. And I was on a boat - a live-aboard, meaning you kind of live and sleep on the boat. And we were diving throughout the day. We were actually looking for sharks, so we were baiting them in, trying to get close. And we had had limited success. We hadn't seen that many sharks. And so it was getting late. I went into the shower to kind of wash up, and I heard someone yell tiger shark. And I had never seen one before so - you know, I was a bit younger and more excited and I guess green. And I put on my snorkel gear and grabbed my camera, ran to the back of the boat and pretty much just cannonballed into the water and saw these huge two tiger sharks approaching me, 3-and-a-half-foot-wide heads coming close. One peeled off, but the other one moved right in towards me and came so close that actually, it couldn't even see me from looking dead on because like all fish, they kind of have the eyes on their - side of their head. So they're - it was so close that it had to rotate around to kind of eyeball me up and down. Then it rotated back and opened its mouth - and I was looking through its mouth down its, you know, gut and seeing its gills from the inside - closed its mouth again. It circled me several times. It swam off only to come back and do that all again. You know, come so close that it had to rotate around to eyeball me, swam circles around me, and kind of moved back off into the dark water because it was evening at that time. DAVIES: When the shark approached you, were you afraid? HAMMERSCHLAG: You know, I wasn't afraid, actually. It was such an intense encounter. You know, it was certainly thrilling, but it was more of a sense of kind of awe. It was opening its mouth, but it wasn't in pursuit. It wasn't, like, trying to bite me or anything. It was kind of standing still. And it was probably helping enable the shark to funnel water in its mouth and over its gills, or maybe it was some sort of communication. You know, I know from some of my past research a shark sometimes will kind of show off or show some dominance by opening and closing its mouth. DAVIES: I know from reading about you that you do a lot of research on tiger sharks near a place called Tiger Beach. It's in the Bahamas, right? You want to just describe it? HAMMERSCHLAG: Yeah. This is actually where this occurred. It was the first time I had ever been to Tiger Beach. Tiger Beach - although it's called a beach, it's nothing close to a beach. It's a shallow water area on the Little Bahama Bank in the Bahamas. And the reason - a friend of mine who found the area named Jim Abernethy, he nicknamed it Tiger Beach as - in hopes of misleading trophy fisherman who would - might be looking for big tiger sharks to maybe catch and kill them. So it was a way to mislead them. They would - might be going looking for a beach. But in fact, there's no land around. It's just a shallow water area. And surprisingly, it's averaged around 15 to 20 feet deep. However, you have numerous tiger sharks that are actually longer and bigger than the depth of the water there. You know, numerous animals that are over 15 feet swimming around there, and just a high density of tiger sharks. And what's amazing is usually an area doesn't have a lot of big predators. It takes a lot of food to support a single predator. So - a very large predator. So, you know, one area doesn't usually have a high density of these big, you know, kind of super predators swimming around. So to find a spot where it was dominated by these predators - and in fact, they happened to be all female. Well, the majority were female. It was really intriguing to me, so it kind of set off a pursuit - this research pursuit to try to figure out why there are so many big tiger sharks in this one shallow area, and why are they mostly female? You know, if it was really great for food, I would've thought we would also be seeing a lot of big male sharks. So that kind of sparked the interest there to make that a strong research priority. DAVIES: Right. In one of the Discovery Channel episodes of Shark Week, they focus on this place and your research at Tiger Beach and your work with tiger sharks. In one of these scenes in the Discovery Channel, you and some other divers are underwater. And I guess you're cleaning off an acoustic sensor that's on the bottom of the ocean, and this swarm of tiger sharks approach and come really close to you. And it looks pretty scary. Can you describe what was going on? HAMMERSCHLAG: Yeah, we were - it was - I have a series of underwater acoustic receivers. They're underwater hydrophones. And they're set up as listening stations. And what they're listening for are specific transmitter tags that I actually surgically implant in tiger sharks that send out a high-frequency sound that those listening stations are essentially underwater trying to receive. And so every now and then, we go to clean off and also download that data. So we were underwater, relatively shallow, cleaning off these underwater hydrophones, these receivers. And there were several tiger sharks - large tiger sharks - around. And they got really curious and inquisitive. There was some bait under the water that - you know, minced fish that were bringing tiger sharks nearby. And I think they just got really curious and started coming in pretty close. And we were having to - I wouldn't say it was aggressive, but it was pretty chaotic. There was just a lot more that were around than we - that was easy to keep, you know, your eye on. And so we were kind of having to push them away a bit and had to kind of get out of the water. DAVIES: Well, I mean, what you see on the video is - you hear the audio of one of the divers warning you and your fellow diver, who's cleaning off these acoustic sensors - you've got another one coming in on your right. Look, behind you, behind you. And there's a sense of urgency there. And then we see you or the divers turn, and then this massive shark comes up. And you put your hand on its nose and push it away. What's going on there? HAMMERSCHLAG: Yeah. I mean, these sharks are not afraid of anything. And they will come right in close. I mean, these things are - these individuals are built like tanks. I mean, they're 10-plus feet. You know, some of them were easily over 14, 15 feet. They've got this impressive weaponeering in terms of teeth. And they just don't have this kind of self-awareness of being afraid or - you know, they're very curious and inquisitive. And they'll come right in. And sometimes they'll bite you as exploration. They have a variety of senses, including touch. And they don't have, you know, finger tips like we do to feel things around. Often they use their teeth to feel things. And if they're coming in to give you even an exploratory bite, that's game over in the case of a tiger shark. So we have to be on our - totally aware and making sure that doesn't happen. And when you have five, six, seven tiger sharks swimming around - not to mention probably 10 other smaller species that are less of a concern - it's a lot to keep track of down there. And in one case, you know, these tiger sharks coming up behind you - you've just got to keep your head on a swivel and make sure that they don't actually end up getting too close because the thing is that when they get close, if you're keeping eye contact with them and kind of putting your camera between you and them, they often will turn away. They don't come in. But if you have your back turned to them, often they'll come in to check you out with an exploratory bite in some cases. And you don't want that to happen. So you - it - there is absolutely a sense of urgency if there's one behind you that you don't see. DAVIES: And what would an exploratory bite do? I mean, like, kittens will, like, gnaw at you. This - we're not talking about that. HAMMERSCHLAG: Well, it might not necessarily be aggressive. But the fact - when you have, you know, a couple thousand pounds of animal behind a bite on a head that's several - 4 feet wide, with a mouth that's got these teeth that are serrated, you know, razor sharp and powerful, even - as gentle as they want - would want to be in kind of biting you, it would - in terms of a tiger shark it would be devastating. Tiger sharks are pretty famous for being able to eat turtles. They're among one of the few species of sharks that because of their dentition and their size and the fact that their teeth are separated, they can cut through turtle bone, turtle shell. You know, they eat whales. They have the power and the tools to pretty much get through anything. So, you know, some wetsuit and skin is not going to be an issue if they end up trying to bite you. DAVIES: And so when one of these would come too close and you would put your hand on the shark's nose and push it away - you know, if we were out in the wild and a wild animal came to us, I think we would think of pushing them as something that would provoke them to attack. Is that not the case with sharks? HAMMERSCHLAG: Sharks are ambush predators. So if you happen to see a shark there's a good chance that it's already seen you for a little while. And so in most cases, they are going to not come very close. Most sharks don't like to come away. In most instances, in order to have - get sharks close up, you have to bait them or kind of attract them in with minced fish. If that's the case, they're interested in finding that fish and eating that fish. So you just don't want to get in the way of it. And, you know, I don't think most people are going to find a situation where they have to push away a shark. But if you do find yourself in a situation where - that you don't feel comfortable with a shark, the best thing to do is not run away or swim away. You know, that's what their food does. Their food runs away from them. The best thing to do is actually just approach them, maintain eye contact. And I wouldn't try to touch them or push them unless they came, you know, within - so close that that's what they were going to do to you. If they came to open their mouth that might be a situation where you - it would probably be good to push them away. But probably the most important thing is just to maintain very strong eye contact with them and kind of follow them around. And usually they're going to find that uncomfortable. DAVIES: So if you are swimming and you become aware of a shark - I mean, you can't maintain eye contact with a shark probably out of the water - what do you do? HAMMERSCHLAG: I would just move slowly, swimming kind of backwards so you're keeping the front of you towards the shark and, you know, kind of backing up slowly out of the water. DAVIES: OK, (laughter) I'll try and remember to do that. HAMMERSCHLAG: You know, that's what it seems like. . . DAVIES: (Laughter). HAMMERSCHLAG: . . . But people aren't going to really find themselves in that situation. You know, most sharks don't like people. The truth of the matter is that, you know, I spend a lot of time and energy trying to get sharks close to me either to - when I'm diving for fun to see them or when I'm doing research and trying to get them close for - to capture them or to study them. It's actually really difficult. In most cases, we have to bait them in. We have to go to the places we think they're going to be. We have to bait them in with minced fish to kind of attract them. And it's actually quite challenging to get them to come close to people. And it sometimes - it doesn't take very much to deter them. And it often is just saying hey, I see you and keeping eye contact because they're quite wary of that. A lot of the predatory sharks, including tiger sharks, are ambush predators. And when they know they're being watched they feel a bit uncomfortable and they're less likely to come close to you. DAVIES: Neil Hammerschlag is a marine ecologist and shark researcher at the University of Miami. We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with Neil Hammerschlag. He is a marine ecologist and shark researcher at the University of Miami. You've spent all this time in this area in the Bahamas where, as you've noted, there's a large concentration of tiger sharks, particularly females. Have you figured out why they might be there? HAMMERSCHLAG: I actually thought it would be linked to reproduction. So my colleague and I, James Sulikowski from the University of New England, we went out there with a high-definition ultrasound. And when we were capturing the sharks, we were running these ultrasounds on the sharks, in the field, to see if they were pregnant or not. And what we found is that a high proportion of the females are actually pregnant and mature. And what we think is that this Tiger Beach area serves as a gestation ground for some of these large pregnant tiger sharks. They're cold-blooded, and so they depend on the water temperature for their metabolism. And, in fact, warmer water helps speed up their gestation. These tiger sharks have gestation periods, meaning they're pregnant for over a year. And warmer water is going to actually help speed up that gestation. And their offspring will actually grow bigger, which is better. And so we think they're using the shallow water, warm, stable areas as a gestation ground to help with accelerating their pregnancies. DAVIES: So you found a maternity ward. HAMMERSCHLAG: That's what we think. DAVIES: How do you do an ultrasound on a shark? HAMMERSCHLAG: Carefully. DAVIES: (Laughter). HAMMERSCHLAG: But - and, you know, once we've got the shark secured on the boat, you know, we would kind of rotate it around so its abdomen was exposed. And we had a special portable ultrasound, high-definition ultrasound with a probe. And just as you would give, you know, someone a sonogram or an ultrasound, where you've got a probe and you're looking on the screen - but one of the cool things because of all the light around you when you're - when you're outside, they have actually got these special goggles that you put on your eye. They kind of look like these virtual reality goggles that you wear. That sees in kind of real time what the probe is looking at. So while you're moving that probe around the abdomen, in the uterus area of the tiger sharks, you're actually seeing that image. DAVIES: So let's talk a bit about these animals. How long have sharks been around on the planet? HAMMERSCHLAG: Sharks have been around on the planet, in some way or another, over 440 million years. That's 200 million years or so prior to any dinosaur walking the face of this planet. So these are ancient creatures that have been evolving for hundreds of millions of years to be the super predators that they are. DAVIES: Sharks are at the apex of a food chain. Does that make them a more valuable subject for study? HAMMERSCHLAG: Yeah. That's a - that's a great question. And the answer is, absolutely. Many shark species are top predators or live at the - kind of the apex of the food web. And because of that, what happens to the sharks and have - have consequences for the rest of the food chain. And right now, globally, many shark populations are declining due to overfishing. And there's this big concern is - what's going to happen to the rest of the food web, to the whole community of organisms, when you remove that top predator? DAVIES: Talk about the threats to sharks as a species. Now, are they deliberately fished or are they caught accidentally by long lines that are actually, you know, trying to get swordfish or other species? HAMMERSCHLAG: Sharks are faced by a number of threats. They're being faced by targeted fishing, in which sharks are being directly targeted and captured, mostly for their fins to actually make shark fin soup, which is an Asian delicacy, particularly consumed in China in the diaspora. However, sharks are being captured, pretty much globally, to supply the shark fin trade and the demand for shark fin soup. Sharks are also caught unintentionally, which is known as bycatch, in fisheries that are targeting swordfish or tuna. And then other threats include, you know, destruction of their nursery grounds. A lot of sharks use shallow water areas like mangroves and seagrass beds close to shore for their nursery grounds. They give birth there, and then the little baby sharks grow up in those safe and shallow water environments. But a lot of those, particularly here in our area in Florida, are being, you know, destroyed - built up into sea walls and marinas. And, you know, new threats include overfishing of their food that they like to eat. And now issues related to climate change. You know, how are these large sharks going to be dealing with changes in the water chemistry and the temperature? DAVIES: You have a number, something like 70 million sharks a year are caught and killed. Is that right? HAMMERSCHLAG: Right now, the latest estimates suggest an average of about 100 million sharks annually are being killed. DAVIES: Is that mostly for shark fin soup? HAMMERSCHLAG: Right now, the closest estimate is about an average of 100 million sharks a year are being killed globally. We're not sure exactly how many sharks are being directly targeted for their fins. But work that have actually counted the number of fins in the shark fin market suggest somewhere between 20 and over 70 million sharks annually are making their way through the shark fin trade. DAVIES: Wow. Why is shark fin soup considered a delicacy? HAMMERSCHLAG: It's mainly consumed as a cultural sign of wealth. It's a long-held tradition. It has no color, no taste, no smell in itself. In fact, to the soup itself has to be added, you know, chicken broth, beef or pork broth just to give it a taste. And many people who consume shark fin soup have no idea that it actually comes from sharks or that sharks are in any trouble or are declining as a result. DAVIES: Are there efforts to control this? HAMMERSCHLAG: Absolutely. Many countries around the world are taking action to limit the amount of shark finning. And there is a new legislation just proposed in Congress, in the U. S, to actually ban the trade and selling of fins. A shark fin ban was just introduced. That's making its way through Congress. And a lot of other places in the world are placing in regulations. However, you know, shark finning is a global phenomenon and as is the shark fin trade. But there's a lot of efforts to try to promote, you know, more conservation and to lower the demand of shark fin. GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with Dr. Neil Hammerschlag. He directs the University of Miami's Shark Research and Conservation program. After a break, they'll talk about how common shark attacks on humans really are. And we'll hear from Patti Niemi, percussionist with the San Francisco Opera Orchestra. She brought a couple of her instruments with her. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with Dr. Neil Hammerschlag about his work researching, tagging and tracking sharks. He directs the University of Miami's Shark Research and Conservation program. He's filmed some of the largest of these predators, like the great white shark and tiger sharks. And he was featured in two episodes of the Discovery Channel's recent Shark Week. DAVIES: How common are shark attacks on humans? HAMMERSCHLAG: So shark bites on human are actually quite uncommon. It's quite rare. If you think about how many people are using the water and the other risks, I mean, you have more of a chance of getting struck by lightning. You have more chance of dying from a vending machine falling on you. And you have more of a chance by being bitten by other people in New York City in a year than you do of getting bit by sharks. So their risk from shark is quite low. DAVIES: You know, in the movie \"Jaws,\" they introduced this idea of territoriality, that if a shark finds a beach where there's, you know, targets for attack, they'll stay there. Is there something to this? HAMMERSCHLAG: What I will say is there's something to the fact that sharks are opportunistic and that if there's a good food source for them, you know, I think that they're opportunistically going to take advantage of that food source. However, where those types of movies get it wrong is that sharks don't have any interest in humans as a food source. Humans are not on the shark's menu. And proof is the fact that how rare shark bite actually is. I mean, there'd be nothing easier for a shark than to kind of patrol the beaches during the summers and eat people if we're on the menu because it would be a pretty easy thing to do. But the fact that, you know, shark bite is so rare and there's so many people in the water just shows that we're not on the menu. DAVIES: Do sharks end up in urban areas sometimes? HAMMERSCHLAG: Yes, so we have a project here in Miami to look at the sharks' movement and health around urban areas and close to Miami including around the port where, you know, there's cruise ships or, you know, right up by Brickell or even downtown in the Miami River. So we have a pretty significant project right now that we call the urban shark project to really understand the behaviors of sharks around, you know, urban environments. DAVIES: They're not, like, domesticated like geese that get used to getting fed by people in a park, right? I mean, they don't attach themselves to civilization, do they? HAMMERSCHLAG: We don't know. But, you know, in some places in the world where fishermen go out for the day and catch, you know, a lot of different fishes and then come back to the marina and clean off their fish, their catch, and then dump the carcasses in the water, they've found that sharks start aggregating around those marinas. And as long as you're - keep on dumping your carcasses off the marinas, the sharks are going to stay there and do it. So there's certainly places that have found that sharks will, you know, feed and take advantage of those discards, those free meals, if they're being made available to them. DAVIES: When you've studied sharks in a particular area over time, have you been able to discern individual personalities in sharks? HAMMERSCHLAG: Absolutely. One of the really neat things is even within a species to see how much individual differences there are in personality. There are sharks that are, you know, really shy. And there's others that are really bold. And it has nothing to do with their length. You know, you could have two sharks of kind of the same size and some just are much more curious and inquisitive than others and some that are really shy and always keep their distance no matter what you do. DAVIES: And do you see the same ones more than once so you actually get to know them and identify them? HAMMERSCHLAG: Yeah so - yeah, there's sharks that I've in - for example, in Tiger Beach that I first dove with in 2003 and have almost on an annual basis seen this shark over the years and have been diving with her up until today and seen her put on a thousand pounds in the process. And, you know, you can see these really strong personalities where they come in really calm but very curious and, you know, have an absolute, pretty strong personality that you can almost identify the individual, you know, just based on the way they're moving in the water and the way they approach you. DAVIES: So when you get in the water and a familiar one appears, do you think they're recognizing you and saying, hey, Neil, you're back? HAMMERSCHLAG: I don't think that they're thinking that for me. But they certainly - I think they know what a, you know, what a diver is in the sense that it's not food. And they certainly - they know the situation of, you know, OK, you're just a diver. You're going to hang out here. But I don't think they recognize me. I'm not there as much. But, you know, it's pretty cool to be able to jump in the water and say, hey, look, there's Emma (ph) the tiger shark, you know? Oh, there's - you know, we have names for them like Emma, and Jamon (ph) and even one called Pickles (ph) and, you know - hey, look, check it out, it's Pickles or Emma or Jamon - you know? - or Hook (ph) is another one that's pretty common. And that's kind of cool to be able to do that, you know, over the course of years. DAVIES: You do a lot of tagging of sharks for research. And I want to talk about that. What tests do you perform? What samples do you take? What do you do to the shark while you have it? HAMMERSCHLAG: There's actually quite a long procedure. We actually have a lot of different samples and tests that we perform, but we do it over very quick amount of time. If you're watching what we do, it almost looks like a race car pit crew, where the car comes in and all these people kind of descend and do all these different tasks and then quickly sends that race car on its way. And that's the same thing that's happening with the shark. Immediately once we capture the shark and have secured it, the next thing we'll do is actually put a tag in the shark. And we have several different kinds of tags. We have some that are just identification tags that act like bar codes. There are other ones that are tags that send off - a pinging tag that - actually a transmitter that sends off high frequency sounds that have encoded information that are picked up by underwater receivers or hydrophones. And then we also use satellite tags that will attach to the shark's fin that will transmit to an orbiting Argo satellite when the sharks are moving through the water column and tell us where those animals are. We also take several measurements of the lengths of the sharks and the girths of the sharks, their body shape, including their tail shape and head shape to see how that changes between species or even within a species as they grow older. We draw blood from the shark to run several tests on the blood where we're looking at reproductive hormones to get an idea if they're mature. We can get an idea of their diet and their feeding behaviors based on the chemical signature in their blood. We also look at their health through doing some immune work. And we even look at their energy stores, given this idea of their nutrition. DAVIES: You spend so much time researching sharks and out on the water interacting with them directly. And I'm wondering how you feel about the, you know, the popular portrayal of sharks, especially in movies? I mean, \"Jaws,\" you know, scared the nation out of the water for years. Do you like that movie? HAMMERSCHLAG: You know, I'm personally entertained by \"Jaws. \" And I think it's a cool movie. And, you know, I think it's amazing how it put sharks into pop culture. DAVIES: I have to ask you, do you identify with Hooper, the Richard Dreyfuss character? He's the shark expert. HAMMERSCHLAG: Yeah, no, I don't. I don't. I guess - I don't really. There are other people that do. And there's a lot of shark people that really like \"Jaws. \" But at the same time, it's really unfortunate that that movie was made because it demonized sharks. And it certainly created - you know, people didn't really care about sharks. It wasn't on people's consciousness. And now after that movie came out, there's a lot of people who kind of wanted to rid the ocean of sharks and thought that any good shark was a dead shark. And that couldn't be further from the truth. We know now that sharks represent a very small risk to humans and that humans represent a much larger risk to sharks, we're removing them by the tens of millions a year. And we know now that that's not good for the functioning of marine ecosystems. DAVIES: In Australia, there's what's called the shark cull, where the idea is to reduce the population of sharks that are considered dangerous to swimmers. Tell us about that. HAMMERSCHLAG: This is very unfortunate. You know, in Australia right now, due to a bunch of, you know, high-profile shark bites on people that resulted in fatality, there's now pretty much a, you know, nation-wide cull that they are killing sharks, very large sharks. And I think it's very unfortunate because, you know, there's just very little evidence scientifically that that's going to work, unless you can reduce the population to such significant levels. And it's a shame because a public policy to just go out and kill sharks, you know, I think, is not a very strong one. It's not based in science, not based in conservation. You know, I think right now we need to be shark smart. For people who use the water, who use the beaches, it's not about limiting our sharks or preventing people from going in the water. It's about us using the water more smart. For people who have looked at trends in shark bites, what they show is that more reflects how people use the water than any behavior about sharks. And for example, you know, in California, shark bites that happen on people are usually surfers before 8:00 a. m. and after 5:00 p. m. And that's not because the sharks prefer eating early in the morning or late in the evening. It's that that's when surfers go surfing, before and after work. And, you know, this is when there's dark water, when, you know, there's some evidence that sharks are getting more active during that period and feeding and also when it's harder for the sharks to kind of distinguish people from maybe some other prey items like seals. So I think we need to be more smart about the way we use our water environment and try to reduce our risk by kind of behaving in a shark-smart way rather than trying to eliminate sharks. DAVIES: Well, Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, thanks so much for speaking with us. HAMMERSCHLAG: My pleasure. It's been really great. GROSS: Dr. Neil Hammerschlag directs the University of Miami's Shark Research and Conservation Program. He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies, who is also WHYY's senior reporter.

I'm Guy Raz. So imagine a big, thick book about the size of a dictionary. And inside that book, each and every page filled with just four letters. . . SAM STERNBERG: Just four letters. RAZ: . . . Printed over and over - A, G, C and T. STERNBERG: That's right - four letters of DNA. RAZ: DNA. . . STERNBERG: The same four letters that every species on the planet has. RAZ: . . . Is made up of four letters, each representing a chemical compound, arranged in just such a way to make you you. STERNBERG: This is really where the information comes from - is not the four letters, but exactly how they're connected to each other. So is it AGCT or AAAG or AACT or AAAT? RAZ: This, by the way, is Sam Sternberg. STERNBERG: I study gene editing technology. RAZ: And Sam says if you printed up all of the A's and G's and C's and T's it takes to complete your entire genetic code - which, by the way, is a lot of letters. . . STERNBERG: The genome is 3. 2 or so billion letters of DNA. RAZ: . . . You would have a lot of pages. STERNBERG: If you had every page filled with A's, G's, C's and T's you'd have 800 dictionaries' worth of genetic code, something like that. RAZ: For one person? STERNBERG: For one person. RAZ: So could you say that everything about us - our physical traits, the color of our eyes, our characteristics, our personality traits - come from four chemicals? STERNBERG: I would say that. RAZ: Wow. STERNBERG: And essentially all the information to turn a single fertilized egg cell into an adult human is contained within that singular genome. RAZ: Now, here's what's really crazy. Sixty years ago, we didn't even know what the genome was. The answer to the question what is life was a mystery. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)JAMES WATSON: And that, of course, has been a question I wanted to know. You know, Darwin explained life after it got started, but what was the essence of life? RAZ: What was the essence of life? That was the question answered by James Watson, who spoke about it on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WATSON: And. . . RAZ: And Watson, along with his partner, Francis Crick, discovered the essence of who we are. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WATSON: Well, we got the answer on the 28th of February '53. RAZ: That was when Watson and Crick discovered the hidden language of DNA. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WATSON: You know, if you just put A next to T and G next to C, you have a copying mechanism. So we saw how genetic information is carried, and it's the order of the four bases. RAZ: Watson and Crick's discovery helped us eventually to figure out how those four letters added up to 800 dictionaries for one human, which led to another huge milestone on the journey to understanding who we are. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Earlier today at the White House, President Clinton announced the completion of the mapping of the human genome. RAZ: This was in June of 2000. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BILL CLINTON: More than a thousand researchers across six nations have revealed nearly all 3 billion letters of our miraculous genetic code. I congratulate all of you on this stunning and humbling achievement. RAZ: And with the mapping of the human genome, we now had our greatest understanding yet of those 800 dictionaries and how all of the information in them adds up to a person. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CLINTON: With this profound new knowledge, humankind is on the verge of gaining immense new power to heal. Genome science will have a real impact on all our lives and even more on the lives of our children. RAZ: And so now years on, the next big thing is almost here. STERNBERG: Back then, we - you know, the government spent $3 billion to get that first genome sequenced. And now we're talking about companies that are offering your complete genome for just $1,000. RAZ: Wow. STERNBERG: And so I think we're going to continue to see our knowledge relating those four letters back to various traits increase in the coming years. RAZ: What this means is that scientists are now closing in on the day when they'll be able to easily access the 3 billion letters of code that make you you and then isolate, even change a particular chain of letters responsible for certain diseases or even certain physical or personality traits. STERNBERG: There are many diseases whose genetic causes have been pinpointed precisely. The most common genetic diseases - cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Huntington's disease - we've known about those, you know, since the '80s and '90s. RAZ: And presumably, we can pinpoint things that aren't diseases at all. STERNBERG: Sure. To the shape of our noses. . . RAZ: Yeah. STERNBERG: . . . There was a recent paper that was published, 23andMe just released a study defining the associations between gene variants and whether or not you're a morning person. RAZ: Wow. STERNBERG: So we're talking about the kinds of things that. . . RAZ: Wow. STERNBERG: . . . You chat about at the water cooler or on your way to get a coffee. And we're beginning to understand the DNA sequences that can explain those behaviors. It's pretty mind-boggling. RAZ: Who we are, what makes us us - it's one of the oldest questions out there. But new technology means we've never been closer to answering it in all kinds of ways that would've been unthinkable just a few years ago. So today on the show, ideas from science, psychology and philosophy about why we are who we are. RAZ: So Sam Sternberg worked in the lab that developed one of the most groundbreaking innovations in gene editing. You may have heard of it. It's called CRISPR. And Sam described why it's such a big deal on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)STERNBERG: We've known for over half a century that DNA contains the blueprints to make all living things. The genome can tell us a lot about ourselves, about our ancestry, our traits and our disease susceptibilities. But there are things in the genome that you might not want to find out. For example, with two misspelled versions of a gene called APOE4, your chance of developing Alzheimer's disease is more than 10 times above average. And with a single diseased copy of the Huntington gene, you're virtually guaranteed Huntington's disease, a devastating form of neurodegeneration. And in both of these cases, there aren't currently any effective prevention or treatment options. And so this leaves many wondering, is this information even worth knowing? Well, what if we could do more than just learn that information by reading the genome but actually rewrite the genome to cure genetic diseases at their source? What if editing the letters of DNA were as simple and easy as fixing typos in Microsoft Word? This is no longer science fiction, thanks to a new tool called CRISPR-Cas9. In the last three years, scientists have delivered CRISPR-Cas9 to human cells and precisely fixed the genetic mutations that cause cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, muscular dystrophy and Huntington's disease. Genome editing in animals and cells is teaching us more about how cancers progress and revealing promising new drug targets. And companies have already raised almost a billion dollars to apply CRISPR-Cas9 as a therapy in patients. The CRISPR-Cas9 technology was co-invented in my Ph. D. lab at the University of California, Berkeley. And many consider it to be one of the biggest breakthroughs of the last couple decades. But five years ago, when I started my Ph. D. with Jennifer Doudna, CRISPR wasn't a technology at all. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: I mean, so you're saying this technology didn't even exist five years ago. I mean, how fast has this become a huge deal? STERNBERG: So when I started my Ph. D. in Jennifer's lab, that was 2010. You wouldn't find a single mention of CRISPR in, you know, the lay media unless it was talking about a vegetable crisper. But in the scientific literature, we're really talking a few dozen articles. So it was about maybe one a month was coming out. We now are at a point today where every day we have around five or 10 articles being published. I think you won't - will not find a biologist in the world that doesn't know about CRISPR. And you probably won't find many left that aren't actively using CRISPR. . . RAZ: Wow. STERNBERG: . . . To study whatever biological question they go after in their laboratories because ultimately we're interested in understanding how life works. And if we know that DNA encodes life, then what better than a tool to rewrite that DNA and study what the effects are. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: OK. The technical details of how CRISPR-Cas9 works are complicated. CRISPR, for instance, is an acronym for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats. And Cas9 is the key protein that makes it all work. But what you need to know is that CRISPR/Cas9 makes it easy and relatively inexpensive to edit genes in precise ways - any genes in any living thing from bacteria to people. STERNBERG: You know, coming back to the four letters of DNA, think about those 800 dictionaries filled with the same four letters. And now imagine that you have to search for a single page, and not just single page but a single letter on that page and mark that site for a change. And maybe not any change but an A to a T, not an A to a G or an A to a C. So for decades, this was the kind of pie-in-the-sky science fiction idea that we could dream about doing, but no one was going to be able to do it because it just seemed like it would never be possible. RAZ: So - but now with CRISPR, basically you can just go into the body, find that chain of letters causing a disease or something and then just cut out one or two letters and replace it with the right letter? STERNBERG: Absolutely. That's exactly what it does. And I'll just add one caveat. It's not been demonstrated yet in human patients. So if you had just said the same thing for human cells in a petri dish, absolutely. With human patients comes the additional challenge of getting to the right cells. And that's the same challenge that every drug has to contend with, this issue of delivery. And now it's just a matter of figuring out how to do that inside patients. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)STERNBERG: Now, the next frontier will be really using this tool to improve human health. Can we achieve this ultimate goal of curing a genetic disease at its source at the level of DNA instead of just treating the downstream symptoms? Imagine a future in which we use stem cell technology together with CRISPR-Cas9 to remove diseased cells from a patient, repair them in the lab and then transplant those corrected cells back into the body. Clinical trials are already underway that offer a cure for HIV/AIDS by editing the DNA in blood cells taken from HIV positive patients. And I expect we're going to see more and more clinical trials with CRISPR entering the pipeline in the next few years. What really got folks speaking this past year was the report in May that, for the first time ever, scientists used CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the DNA in human embryos. And unlike therapy in adult patients, this would introduce heritable changes that could be passed on to subsequent generations. You can imagine the controversy that this has provoked. And many fear that this technology could be abused, that it would usher in an era of eugenics where designer babies where a select few could pick and choose the best genes for their offspring. Others would say if we deny unborn children a technology that could ease human suffering or eradicate a disease, it would be immoral. CRISPR-Cas9 is forcing us to rethink what kind of world we want to live in. And there are weighty ethical issues to discuss about how we should use this technology and how it should be regulated. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: That's Sam Sternberg. When we come back in just a minute, a little more about how gene editing could change who we are and how we should feel about that. On the show today, ideas about what makes us us. I'm Guy Raz. And you're listening to the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today - ideas about who we are, what makes us us. And we've been talking to biochemist Sam Sternberg, who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR-Cas9 could make it cheap and easy to create humans who are - you're basically talking, like, superheroes - right? - like, perfect vision, superhuman strength, perfect SAT scores. . . STERNBERG: That's the. . . RAZ: . . . Right? Sorry. STERNBERG: That's the - yeah, yeah. I think that's the science fictionalization of what CRISPR could allow. We have long lists of gene variants associated with certain traits. And some of those are silly, like whether or not you're a morning person. But we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable, like having extra-strong bones or leaner muscles or lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of coronary heart disease. And as those lists continue to grow, we now have a technology that could, in theory, allow an individual to upgrade their genome. RAZ: But why would that be the science fiction version, if it seems like the technology is so promising? Like, if there was a, you know, way to make a child more resilient to pain or give us all higher IQs, you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things, right? STERNBERG: I think they will. I think the challenge, then, is to think about how we can ensure that that technology, if it becomes available, is used safely - because we're certainly not there yet - but also, I think, equitably. There's a great example in the world of HIV/AIDS. So it turns out 1 to 2 percent of all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have essentially masks their cells. And the HIV virus can't get inside. So what if you now delivered it into a fertilized egg cell - into a human embryo - so that that future child, even though neither of his or her parents have that mutation, will still have HIV immunity? We might assume - of course they would want that. But it's still a game-changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just select the traits they'll inherit from the parents - something we can already do with IVF and genetic testing - but kind of installing new variants into their genome that they would never have gotten from their parents. RAZ: It's like a pre-emptive solution for something that may never come to fruition. Like, we are just saying, hey, just in case, we're going to give you immunity against this thing that you may or may not ever need. STERNBERG: Absolutely. So do you consider that an enhancement? Or is that disease prevention? - 'cause, you know, many people see - they divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of two different categories, one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement. But I think there are many that fall right smack dab in the middle. So yeah, with this HIV immunity gene, CCR5, that's disease prevention. But it's preventing a disease that you may never get. So in a way, it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage. And I'll just state again - that's a gene variant that exists naturally but only 1 to 2 percent of humans have. RAZ: Yeah. STERNBERG: So it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning. RAZ: Right. But I mean, a part of me wonders. Should we be doing that? You know what I mean? Like, there's a process that just kind of has sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution. And we would completely be upending that. STERNBERG: That's certainly one way of looking at it. And yet, evolution is inherently cruel. For someone that has a genetic disease, that's kind of a crummy hand that they've been dealt. So I think this comes down to the question of - how sacred is the genome? And is it something that should remain untouched, untainted, left alone? Of course, what we do in any one patient - that's a lifesaver for that patient. But when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years, now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual but that individual's children and their children and their children and their children. And so that's where I think you have this very weighty issue of directing future evolution. You know, even saying that sounds hyperbolic - it sounds like science fiction. But I think the technology will get to a point where you could use it in embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday, gene variants associated with higher IQ or being a morning person, if that's what you'd like to be. That's where things really take off. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Sam Sternberg is working on a book about all this. It's called \"A Crack In Creation: Gene Editing And The Unthinkable Power To Control Evolution. \" You can check out his TED Talk at ted. com. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. So imagine a big, thick book about the size of a dictionary. And inside that book, each and every page filled with just four letters. . . SAM STERNBERG: Just four letters. RAZ: . . . Printed over and over - A, G, C and T. STERNBERG: That's right - four letters of DNA. RAZ: DNA. . . STERNBERG: The same four letters that every species on the planet has. RAZ: . . . Is made up of four letters, each representing a chemical compound, arranged in just such a way to make you you. STERNBERG: This is really where the information comes from - is not the four letters, but exactly how they're connected to each other. So is it AGCT or AAAG or AACT or AAAT? RAZ: This, by the way, is Sam Sternberg. STERNBERG: I study gene editing technology. RAZ: And Sam says if you printed up all of the A's and G's and C's and T's it takes to complete your entire genetic code - which, by the way, is a lot of letters. . . STERNBERG: The genome is 3. 2 or so billion letters of DNA. RAZ: . . . You would have a lot of pages. STERNBERG: If you had every page filled with A's, G's, C's and T's you'd have 800 dictionaries' worth of genetic code, something like that. RAZ: For one person? STERNBERG: For one person. RAZ: So could you say that everything about us - our physical traits, the color of our eyes, our characteristics, our personality traits - come from four chemicals? STERNBERG: I would say that. RAZ: Wow. STERNBERG: And essentially all the information to turn a single fertilized egg cell into an adult human is contained within that singular genome. RAZ: Now, here's what's really crazy. Sixty years ago, we didn't even know what the genome was. The answer to the question what is life was a mystery. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) JAMES WATSON: And that, of course, has been a question I wanted to know. You know, Darwin explained life after it got started, but what was the essence of life? RAZ: What was the essence of life? That was the question answered by James Watson, who spoke about it on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) WATSON: And. . . RAZ: And Watson, along with his partner, Francis Crick, discovered the essence of who we are. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) WATSON: Well, we got the answer on the 28th of February '53. RAZ: That was when Watson and Crick discovered the hidden language of DNA. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) WATSON: You know, if you just put A next to T and G next to C, you have a copying mechanism. So we saw how genetic information is carried, and it's the order of the four bases. RAZ: Watson and Crick's discovery helped us eventually to figure out how those four letters added up to 800 dictionaries for one human, which led to another huge milestone on the journey to understanding who we are. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Earlier today at the White House, President Clinton announced the completion of the mapping of the human genome. RAZ: This was in June of 2000. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BILL CLINTON: More than a thousand researchers across six nations have revealed nearly all 3 billion letters of our miraculous genetic code. I congratulate all of you on this stunning and humbling achievement. RAZ: And with the mapping of the human genome, we now had our greatest understanding yet of those 800 dictionaries and how all of the information in them adds up to a person. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: With this profound new knowledge, humankind is on the verge of gaining immense new power to heal. Genome science will have a real impact on all our lives and even more on the lives of our children. RAZ: And so now years on, the next big thing is almost here. STERNBERG: Back then, we - you know, the government spent $3 billion to get that first genome sequenced. And now we're talking about companies that are offering your complete genome for just $1,000. RAZ: Wow. STERNBERG: And so I think we're going to continue to see our knowledge relating those four letters back to various traits increase in the coming years. RAZ: What this means is that scientists are now closing in on the day when they'll be able to easily access the 3 billion letters of code that make you you and then isolate, even change a particular chain of letters responsible for certain diseases or even certain physical or personality traits. STERNBERG: There are many diseases whose genetic causes have been pinpointed precisely. The most common genetic diseases - cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Huntington's disease - we've known about those, you know, since the '80s and '90s. RAZ: And presumably, we can pinpoint things that aren't diseases at all. STERNBERG: Sure. To the shape of our noses. . . RAZ: Yeah. STERNBERG: . . . There was a recent paper that was published, 23andMe just released a study defining the associations between gene variants and whether or not you're a morning person. RAZ: Wow. STERNBERG: So we're talking about the kinds of things that. . . RAZ: Wow. STERNBERG: . . . You chat about at the water cooler or on your way to get a coffee. And we're beginning to understand the DNA sequences that can explain those behaviors. It's pretty mind-boggling. RAZ: Who we are, what makes us us - it's one of the oldest questions out there. But new technology means we've never been closer to answering it in all kinds of ways that would've been unthinkable just a few years ago. So today on the show, ideas from science, psychology and philosophy about why we are who we are. RAZ: So Sam Sternberg worked in the lab that developed one of the most groundbreaking innovations in gene editing. You may have heard of it. It's called CRISPR. And Sam described why it's such a big deal on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) STERNBERG: We've known for over half a century that DNA contains the blueprints to make all living things. The genome can tell us a lot about ourselves, about our ancestry, our traits and our disease susceptibilities. But there are things in the genome that you might not want to find out. For example, with two misspelled versions of a gene called APOE4, your chance of developing Alzheimer's disease is more than 10 times above average. And with a single diseased copy of the Huntington gene, you're virtually guaranteed Huntington's disease, a devastating form of neurodegeneration. And in both of these cases, there aren't currently any effective prevention or treatment options. And so this leaves many wondering, is this information even worth knowing? Well, what if we could do more than just learn that information by reading the genome but actually rewrite the genome to cure genetic diseases at their source? What if editing the letters of DNA were as simple and easy as fixing typos in Microsoft Word? This is no longer science fiction, thanks to a new tool called CRISPR-Cas9. In the last three years, scientists have delivered CRISPR-Cas9 to human cells and precisely fixed the genetic mutations that cause cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, muscular dystrophy and Huntington's disease. Genome editing in animals and cells is teaching us more about how cancers progress and revealing promising new drug targets. And companies have already raised almost a billion dollars to apply CRISPR-Cas9 as a therapy in patients. The CRISPR-Cas9 technology was co-invented in my Ph. D. lab at the University of California, Berkeley. And many consider it to be one of the biggest breakthroughs of the last couple decades. But five years ago, when I started my Ph. D. with Jennifer Doudna, CRISPR wasn't a technology at all. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: I mean, so you're saying this technology didn't even exist five years ago. I mean, how fast has this become a huge deal? STERNBERG: So when I started my Ph. D. in Jennifer's lab, that was 2010. You wouldn't find a single mention of CRISPR in, you know, the lay media unless it was talking about a vegetable crisper. But in the scientific literature, we're really talking a few dozen articles. So it was about maybe one a month was coming out. We now are at a point today where every day we have around five or 10 articles being published. I think you won't - will not find a biologist in the world that doesn't know about CRISPR. And you probably won't find many left that aren't actively using CRISPR. . . RAZ: Wow. STERNBERG: . . . To study whatever biological question they go after in their laboratories because ultimately we're interested in understanding how life works. And if we know that DNA encodes life, then what better than a tool to rewrite that DNA and study what the effects are. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: OK. The technical details of how CRISPR-Cas9 works are complicated. CRISPR, for instance, is an acronym for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats. And Cas9 is the key protein that makes it all work. But what you need to know is that CRISPR/Cas9 makes it easy and relatively inexpensive to edit genes in precise ways - any genes in any living thing from bacteria to people. STERNBERG: You know, coming back to the four letters of DNA, think about those 800 dictionaries filled with the same four letters. And now imagine that you have to search for a single page, and not just single page but a single letter on that page and mark that site for a change. And maybe not any change but an A to a T, not an A to a G or an A to a C. So for decades, this was the kind of pie-in-the-sky science fiction idea that we could dream about doing, but no one was going to be able to do it because it just seemed like it would never be possible. RAZ: So - but now with CRISPR, basically you can just go into the body, find that chain of letters causing a disease or something and then just cut out one or two letters and replace it with the right letter? STERNBERG: Absolutely. That's exactly what it does. And I'll just add one caveat. It's not been demonstrated yet in human patients. So if you had just said the same thing for human cells in a petri dish, absolutely. With human patients comes the additional challenge of getting to the right cells. And that's the same challenge that every drug has to contend with, this issue of delivery. And now it's just a matter of figuring out how to do that inside patients. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) STERNBERG: Now, the next frontier will be really using this tool to improve human health. Can we achieve this ultimate goal of curing a genetic disease at its source at the level of DNA instead of just treating the downstream symptoms? Imagine a future in which we use stem cell technology together with CRISPR-Cas9 to remove diseased cells from a patient, repair them in the lab and then transplant those corrected cells back into the body. Clinical trials are already underway that offer a cure for HIV/AIDS by editing the DNA in blood cells taken from HIV positive patients. And I expect we're going to see more and more clinical trials with CRISPR entering the pipeline in the next few years. What really got folks speaking this past year was the report in May that, for the first time ever, scientists used CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the DNA in human embryos. And unlike therapy in adult patients, this would introduce heritable changes that could be passed on to subsequent generations. You can imagine the controversy that this has provoked. And many fear that this technology could be abused, that it would usher in an era of eugenics where designer babies where a select few could pick and choose the best genes for their offspring. Others would say if we deny unborn children a technology that could ease human suffering or eradicate a disease, it would be immoral. CRISPR-Cas9 is forcing us to rethink what kind of world we want to live in. And there are weighty ethical issues to discuss about how we should use this technology and how it should be regulated. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: That's Sam Sternberg. When we come back in just a minute, a little more about how gene editing could change who we are and how we should feel about that. On the show today, ideas about what makes us us. I'm Guy Raz. And you're listening to the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today - ideas about who we are, what makes us us.

STEVEN PINKER: OK (laughter). RAZ: By the way, do you have the answer? Do you know who we are? PINKER: I know who I am. (Laughter) But, you know, I have an inkling of who we are. RAZ: This is Steven Pinker. PINKER: I am a professor of psychology at Harvard University. And I write books on language, mind and human nature. RAZ: So yeah, what is it that makes us who we are? PINKER: Well, there are some intricately complex circuitry in the brain, fabricated over millions of years by natural selection, that equips us with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are. RAZ: OK. There's a lot to unpack here. So to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just said and to understand what accounts for the differences between us, we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out. So Steven, can you help us with this? PINKER: OK. I'll do my best. RAZ: OK. Just to get us started, human beings have debated nature versus nurture for hundreds, even thousands of years. That is whether who we are - our personalities, our behaviors - are either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us, that when we're born, our minds are basically like blank slates. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PINKER: And that all of its structure comes from socialization, culture, parenting, experience. RAZ: That was Steven Pinker on the TED stage back in 2002. And this idea of the blank slate, it was especially popular in the second half of the 20th century. And it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like this. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PINKER: Man has no nature, from the historian Jose Ortega y Gasset. Man has no instincts, from the anthropologist Ashley Montagu. The human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to none, from the late scientist Stephen Jay Gould. Now, why should it have been such an appealing notion? Well, there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial. The foremost is that if we are blank slates, then, by definition, we are equal because zero equals zero equals zero. But if something is written on the slate, then some people could have more of it than others. And according to this line of thinking, that would justify discrimination and inequality. Another political fear of human nature is that if we were blank slates, we can perfect mankind, the age-old dream of the perfectibility of our species through social engineering, whereas if we're born with certain instincts, then perhaps some of them might condemn us to selfishness, prejudice and violence. First of all, there are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind is a blank slate. And some of them just come from common sense. As many people have told me over the years, anyone who's had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperaments and talents. It doesn't all come from the outside. Oh, and anyone who has both a child and a house pet has surely noticed that the child exposed to speech will acquire a human language, whereas the house pet won't, presumably because of some innate difference between them. (LAUGHTER)PINKER: And anyone who's ever been in a heterosexual relationship knows that the minds of men and the minds of women are not indistinguishable. RAZ: So for years, the debate about nature versus nurture has been just that, a debate. It's one or the other. But Steven Pinker has mainly argued that this shouldn't be a debate, that who we are comes down to both our genes and our environment. PINKER: It's a mistake to think that if there is an effect of the environment that shows that we're blank slates. Or conversely, if there is such a thing as human nature, then we are robots. And we're programmed to walk into walls and be completely insensitive to our environment. It's just the wrong way to think about it. RAZ: The right way to think about it, he says, starts with our genome. PINKER: Well, the fact that we behave like humans and not like orangutans or chimpanzees or squirrels is very much determined by our genome. RAZ: So our genome sets us apart from animals. But it also sets us apart from each other. PINKER: The differences between two individuals shows a pretty strong statistical effect of our genes. RAZ: But then here's where environment comes in. PINKER: Aside from the fact that we have unique genomes, we have a unique history of development. That is, the process by which our brain gets wired up in utero and the first few years of life is not dictated down to the last synapse by the genes. But there's space for random twists and turns in the wiring up of the brain that make even identical twins somewhat different. And of course, we have our unique lifelines. We have a unique trajectory of experience as we make our way through the world and make decisions. And the decisions affect the way the world treats us, including other people. And we take away lessons from how we've been treated. And so we set off with a combination of our unique genome and our chain of experiences. RAZ: OK. Just to clarify, our environment is helping mold our genes. PINKER: Oh, obviously. That is, if I was brought up as an Apache or as a Japanese samurai or as a Romanian peasant in the 14th century, there would be differences, undoubtedly, compared to who I am now. RAZ: So we just talked to Sam Sternberg about, you know, like, how being a morning person is possibly embedded in our genetic code. So what else are we probably born with? PINKER: So we know that intelligence has a big heritable component, which doesn't mean that it is completely determined by our genes. But it does mean that some of the differences among people can be attributed to differences among their genes. We know that differences in personality - how conscientious, how agreeable, how neurotic, how extroverted - are influenced by our genome. And even behavioral traits such as, how likely are you to be a smoker or an alcoholic - all of them show some influence of our genetic endowment. RAZ: And even though we can now probe our genomes to actually test some of these things out, Steven Pinker says there's another slightly bizarre, old-fashioned method. PINKER: Such as looking at similarities between identical twins who were separated at birth. RAZ: Because identical twins separated at birth share all of their genes but, of course, not their environments. PINKER: And they show that there is a pretty hefty statistical influence of the genes. That is, if you know what one identical twin is like, you can make a lot of predictions about the other one who he or she may never have met, who may have grown up an ocean and a culture away. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PINKER: My favorite example is of a pair of twins, one of whom was brought up as a Catholic in a Nazi family in Germany. The other was brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad. When they walked into the lab in Minnesota, they were wearing identical navy blue shirts with epaulets. Both of them like to dip buttered toast in coffee. Both of them kept rubber bands around their wrists. Both of them flushed the toilet before using it, as well as after. And both of them like to surprise people by sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them jump. (LAUGHTER)PINKER: Now, the story might seem too good to be true, but when you would administer batteries of psychological tests, you get the same results. Namely, identical twins separated at birth show quite astonishing similarities. RAZ: That's just unbelievable. So then, like, even things, like, habits or personality quirks are more or less assigned at birth? PINKER: Well, they're influenced at birth. I wouldn't say they're assigned because there are probably some unpredictable changes that occur as the brain kind of gels in the first couple of years of life. There are changes that unfold over the lifespan. Whether they are a response to outside forces or if they're just the way that the brain spontaneously develops, we don't really know. RAZ: Yeah. PINKER: There are certainly ways in which anyone can be damaged. If you undergo trauma or abuse, that can leave lasting scars. But I think there is certainly a - there are statistical forces. There's definitely pressure that makes one person different from another across the board. RAZ: Yeah. I mean, when you think about, like, who you are, I mean, do you think you're the same person that you were when you were a child or teenager or in your 20s as you are now? PINKER: I do see myself as basically the same kind of person. I like the same music. I like the same foods. I like the same pastimes. I have similar kinds of interests. And research on personality shows that there's a substantial amount of continuity in a person's character as they go through life. But there are certain changes that I see in myself that probably occur in most people as they get older. RAZ: Yeah. PINKER: We get less neurotic. We get nicer. We get less anxious as we get older, all of us. But still, if one person is more anxious than another at the age of 20, he'll probably be more anxious than the other person at the age of 70 as well, even if both of them are less anxious across the board. RAZ: So, I mean, if we are more or less the same, right, at 20 or at 70, is it even possible to make big changes to who we are? PINKER: I think we have the capacity to change our behavior, which is really what counts. I don't think that there's a lot of room to change who we are in the sense of a fundamentally nervous person becoming constitutionally calm and easygoing. But certainly, there are methods of, say, cognitive behavior therapy. . . RAZ: Yeah. PINKER: . . . That are provably effective at reducing anxiety and phobias and treating depression. RAZ: Yeah. PINKER: And the thing is that those don't appeal to some ethereal, immaterial soul. They are ways of acting on our neural circuitry. We have to keep in mind that our neural circuitry is so intricately complex and has been shaped by evolution to interact with the world through our social mechanisms of interacting - through language, through facial expression, through body language - that there are ways of changing our feelings and thoughts by the old-fashioned route of conversation and example and art and evidence-based psychotherapy. So there is scope for a range of behavior within the envelope of a given personality type. And we can probe the outside of the envelope that the genes make available to us. RAZ: Do you - when you think about what animates a person, do you think that it can be figured out pretty logically, or do you think that huge parts of it are just mysterious? PINKER: Huge parts of it are certainly mysterious because the interactions are so unfathomably complex. RAZ: Yeah. PINKER: There are 10 to a hundred billion cells in the brain connected by a hundred trillion synapses. And no one can keep track of all of them, even in a computer simulation. We also know that chance plays an enormous role above and beyond the role of either genes or environments. We can see this in identical twins who are brought up together, not the exotic cases of the twins separated at birth, but just the kind of twins that all of us know. If you know a pair of twins, you know that they're more similar than two people plucked off the street at random, but they're unique individuals. RAZ: Yeah. PINKER: They're - they - you won't - you don't confuse them when once you know them. RAZ: And sometimes, they're not friends. PINKER: And sometimes, they're not friends, indeed. Now, how do you account for those differences? It's not their genes, at least not the ones they inherited from their parents. There could be some - a few mutations that each one idiosyncratically acquired. It's not their - by and large, their environments because they grew up under the same parents, the same school, the same house, the same older sibs, same younger sibs. You're really forced to the conclusion that there's an enormous role for chance, for the roll of the dice in who we become because two people who have everything in common both in the genes and the environmental level nonetheless don't turn out to be indistinguishable. RAZ: Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker has given several TED talks, including this one about the blank slate. You can find all of them at ted. com. More ideas about What Makes Us Us - that's in just a minute. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:  On today's show, we're asking a very important question, which is - who are we? STEVEN PINKER: OK (laughter). RAZ: By the way, do you have the answer? Do you know who we are? PINKER: I know who I am. (Laughter) But, you know, I have an inkling of who we are. RAZ: This is Steven Pinker. PINKER: I am a professor of psychology at Harvard University. And I write books on language, mind and human nature. RAZ: So yeah, what is it that makes us who we are? PINKER: Well, there are some intricately complex circuitry in the brain, fabricated over millions of years by natural selection, that equips us with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are. RAZ: OK. There's a lot to unpack here. So to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just said and to understand what accounts for the differences between us, we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out. So Steven, can you help us with this? PINKER: OK. I'll do my best. RAZ: OK. Just to get us started, human beings have debated nature versus nurture for hundreds, even thousands of years. That is whether who we are - our personalities, our behaviors - are either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us, that when we're born, our minds are basically like blank slates. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PINKER: And that all of its structure comes from socialization, culture, parenting, experience. RAZ: That was Steven Pinker on the TED stage back in 2002. And this idea of the blank slate, it was especially popular in the second half of the 20th century. And it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like this. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PINKER: Man has no nature, from the historian Jose Ortega y Gasset. Man has no instincts, from the anthropologist Ashley Montagu. The human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to none, from the late scientist Stephen Jay Gould. Now, why should it have been such an appealing notion? Well, there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial. The foremost is that if we are blank slates, then, by definition, we are equal because zero equals zero equals zero. But if something is written on the slate, then some people could have more of it than others. And according to this line of thinking, that would justify discrimination and inequality. Another political fear of human nature is that if we were blank slates, we can perfect mankind, the age-old dream of the perfectibility of our species through social engineering, whereas if we're born with certain instincts, then perhaps some of them might condemn us to selfishness, prejudice and violence. First of all, there are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind is a blank slate. And some of them just come from common sense. As many people have told me over the years, anyone who's had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperaments and talents. It doesn't all come from the outside. Oh, and anyone who has both a child and a house pet has surely noticed that the child exposed to speech will acquire a human language, whereas the house pet won't, presumably because of some innate difference between them. (LAUGHTER) PINKER: And anyone who's ever been in a heterosexual relationship knows that the minds of men and the minds of women are not indistinguishable. RAZ: So for years, the debate about nature versus nurture has been just that, a debate. It's one or the other. But Steven Pinker has mainly argued that this shouldn't be a debate, that who we are comes down to both our genes and our environment. PINKER: It's a mistake to think that if there is an effect of the environment that shows that we're blank slates. Or conversely, if there is such a thing as human nature, then we are robots. And we're programmed to walk into walls and be completely insensitive to our environment. It's just the wrong way to think about it. RAZ: The right way to think about it, he says, starts with our genome. PINKER: Well, the fact that we behave like humans and not like orangutans or chimpanzees or squirrels is very much determined by our genome. RAZ: So our genome sets us apart from animals. But it also sets us apart from each other. PINKER: The differences between two individuals shows a pretty strong statistical effect of our genes. RAZ: But then here's where environment comes in. PINKER: Aside from the fact that we have unique genomes, we have a unique history of development. That is, the process by which our brain gets wired up in utero and the first few years of life is not dictated down to the last synapse by the genes. But there's space for random twists and turns in the wiring up of the brain that make even identical twins somewhat different. And of course, we have our unique lifelines. We have a unique trajectory of experience as we make our way through the world and make decisions. And the decisions affect the way the world treats us, including other people. And we take away lessons from how we've been treated. And so we set off with a combination of our unique genome and our chain of experiences. RAZ: OK. Just to clarify, our environment is helping mold our genes. PINKER: Oh, obviously. That is, if I was brought up as an Apache or as a Japanese samurai or as a Romanian peasant in the 14th century, there would be differences, undoubtedly, compared to who I am now. RAZ: So we just talked to Sam Sternberg about, you know, like, how being a morning person is possibly embedded in our genetic code. So what else are we probably born with? PINKER: So we know that intelligence has a big heritable component, which doesn't mean that it is completely determined by our genes. But it does mean that some of the differences among people can be attributed to differences among their genes. We know that differences in personality - how conscientious, how agreeable, how neurotic, how extroverted - are influenced by our genome. And even behavioral traits such as, how likely are you to be a smoker or an alcoholic - all of them show some influence of our genetic endowment. RAZ: And even though we can now probe our genomes to actually test some of these things out, Steven Pinker says there's another slightly bizarre, old-fashioned method. PINKER: Such as looking at similarities between identical twins who were separated at birth. RAZ: Because identical twins separated at birth share all of their genes but, of course, not their environments. PINKER: And they show that there is a pretty hefty statistical influence of the genes. That is, if you know what one identical twin is like, you can make a lot of predictions about the other one who he or she may never have met, who may have grown up an ocean and a culture away. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PINKER: My favorite example is of a pair of twins, one of whom was brought up as a Catholic in a Nazi family in Germany. The other was brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad. When they walked into the lab in Minnesota, they were wearing identical navy blue shirts with epaulets. Both of them like to dip buttered toast in coffee. Both of them kept rubber bands around their wrists. Both of them flushed the toilet before using it, as well as after. And both of them like to surprise people by sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them jump. (LAUGHTER) PINKER: Now, the story might seem too good to be true, but when you would administer batteries of psychological tests, you get the same results. Namely, identical twins separated at birth show quite astonishing similarities. RAZ: That's just unbelievable. So then, like, even things, like, habits or personality quirks are more or less assigned at birth? PINKER: Well, they're influenced at birth. I wouldn't say they're assigned because there are probably some unpredictable changes that occur as the brain kind of gels in the first couple of years of life. There are changes that unfold over the lifespan. Whether they are a response to outside forces or if they're just the way that the brain spontaneously develops, we don't really know. RAZ: Yeah. PINKER: There are certainly ways in which anyone can be damaged. If you undergo trauma or abuse, that can leave lasting scars. But I think there is certainly a - there are statistical forces. There's definitely pressure that makes one person different from another across the board. RAZ: Yeah. I mean, when you think about, like, who you are, I mean, do you think you're the same person that you were when you were a child or teenager or in your 20s as you are now? PINKER: I do see myself as basically the same kind of person. I like the same music. I like the same foods. I like the same pastimes. I have similar kinds of interests. And research on personality shows that there's a substantial amount of continuity in a person's character as they go through life. But there are certain changes that I see in myself that probably occur in most people as they get older. RAZ: Yeah. PINKER: We get less neurotic. We get nicer. We get less anxious as we get older, all of us. But still, if one person is more anxious than another at the age of 20, he'll probably be more anxious than the other person at the age of 70 as well, even if both of them are less anxious across the board. RAZ: So, I mean, if we are more or less the same, right, at 20 or at 70, is it even possible to make big changes to who we are? PINKER: I think we have the capacity to change our behavior, which is really what counts. I don't think that there's a lot of room to change who we are in the sense of a fundamentally nervous person becoming constitutionally calm and easygoing. But certainly, there are methods of, say, cognitive behavior therapy. . . RAZ: Yeah. PINKER: . . . That are provably effective at reducing anxiety and phobias and treating depression. RAZ: Yeah. PINKER: And the thing is that those don't appeal to some ethereal, immaterial soul. They are ways of acting on our neural circuitry. We have to keep in mind that our neural circuitry is so intricately complex and has been shaped by evolution to interact with the world through our social mechanisms of interacting - through language, through facial expression, through body language - that there are ways of changing our feelings and thoughts by the old-fashioned route of conversation and example and art and evidence-based psychotherapy. So there is scope for a range of behavior within the envelope of a given personality type. And we can probe the outside of the envelope that the genes make available to us. RAZ: Do you - when you think about what animates a person, do you think that it can be figured out pretty logically, or do you think that huge parts of it are just mysterious? PINKER: Huge parts of it are certainly mysterious because the interactions are so unfathomably complex. RAZ: Yeah. PINKER: There are 10 to a hundred billion cells in the brain connected by a hundred trillion synapses. And no one can keep track of all of them, even in a computer simulation. We also know that chance plays an enormous role above and beyond the role of either genes or environments. We can see this in identical twins who are brought up together, not the exotic cases of the twins separated at birth, but just the kind of twins that all of us know.

And on that and most other questions, philosopher John Searle. . . JOHN SEARLE: Hello. RAZ: . . . Is a pretty straight shooter. SEARLE: Now try to speak a bit louder if you can. RAZ: Sure. You can hear me OK? SEARLE: Now you can. Yeah. RAZ: OK. I was far away from the microphone. How are you? SEARLE: Well, I'm OK, a bit - well, let's say hung-over. How about that? RAZ: You're hung-over? What were you drinking? SEARLE: Well, we had a pretty good dinner last night. And also I'm still - that's on top of jetlag. I got back from Europe a few days ago. But other than that, almost awake. How about that? RAZ: (Laughter) That's great. But are you - but are you conscious? SEARLE: Well, the truth of the matter is I am the decisive authority on that. And the answer is yes. RAZ: (Laughter) OK, good. John Searle's been teaching philosophy at UC Berkeley since. . . SEARLE: '59, right. RAZ: . . . More than 50 years. SEARLE: Seems like yesterday. But anyway. . . RAZ: John's one of the leading experts on consciousness. I've heard it described as sort of, like, the movie that we always have playing in our head. That's what consciousness is. SEARLE: Well, OK. I don't like the movie metaphor because that suggests that there is a distinction between the movie and the guy watching the movie, and that's not true. We are the movie. It is the ongoing flow of conscious experiences that constitutes the magnificent feature of human life. RAZ: But so little is known about consciousness, about why being you feels like something. And that's partly because consciousness and where it comes from is a relatively new question. At least. . . SEARLE: That's right. RAZ: . . . In science. SEARLE: When I first got interested, I used to go and talk to the brain-stabbers, you know, these neurobiologists and tell them look, what the hell am I paying you guys to do? Get busy, and solve the problem of consciousness. And a standard answer I got was, not a suitable subject for science. Science is about objective phenomena. RAZ: Yeah. Like, well - this is for - this isn't real science. SEARLE: Too kooky. RAZ: Yeah, kooky. SEARLE: And that's a mistake to think that. And now that has changed. We're now at a stage where consciousness - a perfectly respectable scientific problem like any other. RAZ: So here's one of the biggest questions about consciousness, whether it's simply a product of the human brain or whether it's something more, whether our conscious mind lives on after we die, whether it was somewhere else before we came to be. Now, John Searle definitely comes down on one side of the question. SEARLE: Consciousness is a biological process like, digestion or photosynthesis or the secretion of bile. And what we need to do is figure out how the brain does it as a biological piece of machinery. RAZ: John explains exactly what he means on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SEARLE: Why consciousness? Well, it is the most important aspect of our lives for a very simple logical reason. Namely, it's a necessary condition on anything being important in our lives that we're conscious. I've - haven't yet given you a definition. You can't do this if you don't give a definition. People always say consciousness is very hard to define. I think it's rather easy to define, if you're not trying to give a scientific definition. We're not ready for a scientific definition. But here's a common sense definition. Consciousness consists of all those states of feeling or sentience or awareness. It begins in the morning when you wake up from a dream of asleep. And it goes on all day until you fall asleep or die or otherwise become unconscious. Dreams are a form of consciousness on this definition. Now, that's the common sense definition. That's our target. If you're not talking about that, you're not talking about consciousness. OK. Now, why, then, is this curious reluctance and curious hostility to consciousness? Well, I think it's a combination of two features of our intellectual culture. But in fact, they share a common set of assumptions. One feature is the tradition of religious dualism. Consciousness is not a part of the physical world. It's a part of the spiritual world. It belongs to the soul. And the soul is not a part of the physical world. That's the tradition of God, the soul and immortality. There's another tradition that thinks it's opposed to this but accepts the worst assumption. That tradition thinks that we are heavy-duty, scientific materialists. Consciousness is not a part of the physical world. Either it doesn't exist at all, or it's something else - a computer program or some damfool thing. But in any case, it's not part of science. And I used to get into an argument that really gave me a stomachache. Here's how it went. Science is objective. Consciousness is subjective. Therefore, there cannot be a science of consciousness. OK. So that's - these twin traditions are paralyzing us. It's very hard to get out of these twin traditions. And I have only one real message in this lecture. And that is all of our conscious states, without exception, are caused by lower-level neural biological processes in the brain. And they are realized, in the brain, as higher-level or system features. RAZ: So how does consciousness originate in our biology? SEARLE: Well, we don't know the details of how the brain produces consciousness, but we know it does. And that's the stunning thing about our life. Each of us is conscious. And we have that peculiar form of consciousness, which is human consciousness. And the way that it's possible is because of the neuronal configuration of the brain. However, for me to say it that way is really just a blank check. We don't know the details of how it works. And I think it's kind of one of those scandals of intellectual life is we do not know how brain processes cause and sustain consciousness. But we know they do. And that's the important fact for this discussion right now is we are conscious beasts. Consciousness is produced in the brain, and it's maintained in the brain. RAZ: It is amazing. There you are in Berkeley. I'm in Washington, D. C. Here we are having a conversation. And it - as I speak, something is making me do this. Something is making me say these words and. . . SEARLE: Yeah. RAZ: . . . Think about this in a specific way. And that is just mind-boggling. SEARLE: Yeah. Well, OK. Here's the wonderful thing that you put your finger on right now. And that is this combination that we share, this enormous, shared background with other human beings. And yet, at the same time, each of us is absolutely unique. RAZ: Yeah. SEARLE: So it's this marvelous combination that I am part of a great river of humanity that stretches back - well, not merely thousands, but millions of years and that, on top of that, I have my own individuality. I can express my own uniqueness. RAZ: But do we have any idea what causes it? Like, what gives us consciousness? SEARLE: OK. A Darwinian natural selection has produced this enormous specialization among primates. And somehow or other, we lucked out. I mean, I think other primates are marvelous, but I have no desire to be a chimpanzee or an orangutang because I think we've got it made in the sense that we have this remarkable feature of human consciousness. So evolution has given us this fantastic property. But I - of course, evolution only works if there is a underlying substratum. We have the Atomic Theory of Matter. It eventually generates big carbon-based molecules. At some point, some of those became alive and out of life grew human animal existence and finally human consciousness. And consciousness is an ordinary part of the physical world, and it's this tradition of thinking that the world divides into two kinds, the mental and the physical, and the mental is not studiable the way the physical is. That's a silly review, and I think we've overcome it. And now we've got to get busy and solve the problem of consciousness. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SEARLE: All right. But now we get into some harder questions. Let's specify the exact features of consciousness. Well, the first feature is it's real and irreducible. You can't get rid of it. You see, the distinction between reality and illusion is a distinction between how things consciously seem to us and how they really are. It consciously seems like there's a - I like the French arc en ciel. It seems like there's an arch in the sky. Or it seems like the sun is setting over the mountains. It consciously seems to us, but that's not really happening. But for that distinction between how things consciously seem and how they really are, you can't make that distinction for the very existence of consciousness because where the very existence of consciousness is concerned, if it consciously seems to you that you are conscious, you are conscious. (LAUGHTER)SEARLE: I mean, if a bunch of experts come to me and say we are heavy duty neurobiologists and we've done a study of you, Searle, and we're convinced you are not conscious. You are a very cleverly constructed robot. I don't think, well, maybe these guys are right, you know? I don't think that for a moment because - I mean, Descartes may have made a lot of mistakes, but he was right about this. You cannot doubt the existence of your own consciousness. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: OK. So we still cannot explain consciousness from a scientific perspective. SEARLE: Yeah. RAZ: But my question to you is if we could figure this out, right, in the same way, like, we pulled together and figured out the human genome. SEARLE: Yeah. RAZ: If we could figure out consciousness, could we recreate it? I mean, we could - we could we create artificial versions of ourselves, like conscious versions? SEARLE: I don't see why not. Now, I don't think we're anywhere near this. And there may be theoretical obstacles that make it impossible. But as far as we know, the brain is an organ like any other. And if you understand how it works, then you can do it artificially in the same way that you can do an artificial heart. But if you think biologically, and I'm urging that we should think biologically, then it seems to me there's no obstacle in principle to two achievements. One is we have a complete understanding of how the brain does it. We're a long way from that, but I think it's a reasonable research project. And secondly, we have at least the possibility of doing it artificially. RAZ: I mean (laughter) I mean, it seems that there is no attribute of being human that tells us more about a human, an individual human, than a consciousness. SEARLE: Well, OK, but we are not the only beasts that are conscious. We know that the primates are conscious. I'm pretty certain all the mammals are conscious. So it isn't just us, but we have special forms of consciousness, special forms of society, special forms of culture, that other animals don't have. And all of those are expressed in our consciousness. RAZ: I mean, our ability to be introspective, our ability to have this conversation. SEARLE: Absolutely. Take away consciousness and NPR's out of business. . . RAZ: Out of business. SEARLE: . . . As is the University of California. RAZ: Yeah. SEARLE: So the idea that some or other consciousness can be ignored or it doesn't matter - consciousness matters more than anything simply because if something is important, something matters only relative to consciousness. So people ask me sometimes, well, what's the function of consciousness? Why does it matter? And that's a crazy question. It's like saying, what's the function of life or why does life matter? Because everything else matters in relation to consciousness. RAZ: Could there just be some mystery about it? I mean, could the consciousness process be something that really can't be figured out? SEARLE: Well, that's always possible. We make this assumption - and we have to make it - that everything's understandable by us. Now, we know that that must be false for a very simple reason. Our brains are selected for hunter-gatherer environments. And as far as we know, there hasn't been any substantial change in the genome for 30,000 years or so. But we have every reason to suppose that there are limits to our brain's capacity to understand reality. We don't know in advance what the limits are, so we have to keep pushing forward as if there were no limits. And then we'll discover what the limits might be.

And I used to get into an argument that really gave me a stomachache. Here's how it went. Science is objective. Consciousness is subjective. Therefore, there cannot be a science of consciousness. OK. So that's - these twin traditions are paralyzing us. It's very hard to get out of these twin traditions. And I have only one real message in this lecture. And that is all of our conscious states, without exception, are caused by lower-level neural biological processes in the brain. And they are realized, in the brain, as higher-level or system features. RAZ: So how does consciousness originate in our biology? SEARLE: Well, we don't know the details of how the brain produces consciousness, but we know it does. And that's the stunning thing about our life. Each of us is conscious. And we have that peculiar form of consciousness, which is human consciousness. And the way that it's possible is because of the neuronal configuration of the brain. However, for me to say it that way is really just a blank check. We don't know the details of how it works. And I think it's kind of one of those scandals of intellectual life is we do not know how brain processes cause and sustain consciousness. But we know they do. And that's the important fact for this discussion right now is we are conscious beasts. Consciousness is produced in the brain, and it's maintained in the brain. RAZ: It is amazing. There you are in Berkeley. I'm in Washington, D. C. Here we are having a conversation. And it - as I speak, something is making me do this. Something is making me say these words and. . . SEARLE: Yeah. RAZ: . . . Think about this in a specific way. And that is just mind-boggling. SEARLE: Yeah. Well, OK. Here's the wonderful thing that you put your finger on right now. And that is this combination that we share, this enormous, shared background with other human beings. And yet, at the same time, each of us is absolutely unique. RAZ: Yeah. SEARLE: So it's this marvelous combination that I am part of a great river of humanity that stretches back - well, not merely thousands, but millions of years and that, on top of that, I have my own individuality. I can express my own uniqueness. RAZ: But do we have any idea what causes it? Like, what gives us consciousness? SEARLE: OK. A Darwinian natural selection has produced this enormous specialization among primates. And somehow or other, we lucked out. I mean, I think other primates are marvelous, but I have no desire to be a chimpanzee or an orangutang because I think we've got it made in the sense that we have this remarkable feature of human consciousness. So evolution has given us this fantastic property. But I - of course, evolution only works if there is a underlying substratum. We have the Atomic Theory of Matter. It eventually generates big carbon-based molecules. At some point, some of those became alive and out of life grew human animal existence and finally human consciousness. And consciousness is an ordinary part of the physical world, and it's this tradition of thinking that the world divides into two kinds, the mental and the physical, and the mental is not studiable the way the physical is. That's a silly review, and I think we've overcome it. And now we've got to get busy and solve the problem of consciousness. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SEARLE: All right. But now we get into some harder questions. Let's specify the exact features of consciousness. Well, the first feature is it's real and irreducible. You can't get rid of it. You see, the distinction between reality and illusion is a distinction between how things consciously seem to us and how they really are. It consciously seems like there's a - I like the French arc en ciel. It seems like there's an arch in the sky. Or it seems like the sun is setting over the mountains. It consciously seems to us, but that's not really happening. But for that distinction between how things consciously seem and how they really are, you can't make that distinction for the very existence of consciousness because where the very existence of consciousness is concerned, if it consciously seems to you that you are conscious, you are conscious. (LAUGHTER) SEARLE: I mean, if a bunch of experts come to me and say we are heavy duty neurobiologists and we've done a study of you, Searle, and we're convinced you are not conscious. You are a very cleverly constructed robot. I don't think, well, maybe these guys are right, you know? I don't think that for a moment because - I mean, Descartes may have made a lot of mistakes, but he was right about this. You cannot doubt the existence of your own consciousness. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: OK. So we still cannot explain consciousness from a scientific perspective. SEARLE: Yeah. RAZ: But my question to you is if we could figure this out, right, in the same way, like, we pulled together and figured out the human genome. SEARLE: Yeah. RAZ: If we could figure out consciousness, could we recreate it? I mean, we could - we could we create artificial versions of ourselves, like conscious versions? SEARLE: I don't see why not. Now, I don't think we're anywhere near this. And there may be theoretical obstacles that make it impossible. But as far as we know, the brain is an organ like any other. And if you understand how it works, then you can do it artificially in the same way that you can do an artificial heart. But if you think biologically, and I'm urging that we should think biologically, then it seems to me there's no obstacle in principle to two achievements. One is we have a complete understanding of how the brain does it. We're a long way from that, but I think it's a reasonable research project. And secondly, we have at least the possibility of doing it artificially. RAZ: I mean (laughter) I mean, it seems that there is no attribute of being human that tells us more about a human, an individual human, than a consciousness. SEARLE: Well, OK, but we are not the only beasts that are conscious. We know that the primates are conscious. I'm pretty certain all the mammals are conscious. So it isn't just us, but we have special forms of consciousness, special forms of society, special forms of culture, that other animals don't have. And all of those are expressed in our consciousness. RAZ: I mean, our ability to be introspective, our ability to have this conversation. SEARLE: Absolutely. Take away consciousness and NPR's out of business. . . RAZ: Out of business. SEARLE: . . . As is the University of California. RAZ: Yeah. SEARLE: So the idea that some or other consciousness can be ignored or it doesn't matter - consciousness matters more than anything simply because if something is important, something matters only relative to consciousness. So people ask me sometimes, well, what's the function of consciousness? Why does it matter? And that's a crazy question. It's like saying, what's the function of life or why does life matter? Because everything else matters in relation to consciousness. RAZ: Could there just be some mystery about it? I mean, could the consciousness process be something that really can't be figured out? SEARLE: Well, that's always possible. We make this assumption - and we have to make it - that everything's understandable by us. Now, we know that that must be false for a very simple reason. Our brains are selected for hunter-gatherer environments. And as far as we know, there hasn't been any substantial change in the genome for 30,000 years or so. But we have every reason to suppose that there are limits to our brain's capacity to understand reality. We don't know in advance what the limits are, so we have to keep pushing forward as if there were no limits. And then we'll discover what the limits might be.

But what if a dinosaur actually sounded like this? (SOUNDBITE OF DINOSAUR COOING)WERTHEIMER: According to new research, that cooing is much more likely what a dinosaur sounded like. Julia Clarke is a professor of paleontology and the lead author of a new study that may debunk the dinosaur's roar. She joins me now from KUT in Austin, Texas. Welcome to our program. JULIA CLARKE: It's my pleasure. WERTHEIMER: We've been going on the assumption - I suppose largely from movies - that dinosaurs made a big noise. They're such big creatures. Why do you think we're wrong. CLARKE: Most dinosaur sounds are based on models that are more like lions and tigers and bears. And we know that the two groups of animals alive today that are most closely related to extinct dinosaurs are birds and crocodilians. In fact, birds are living dinosaurs. WERTHEIMER: So you look at the way birds make noises? CLARKE: Exactly. That's what we did in this particular study. We looked at one aspect of vocal behavior, which is whether the mouth is open or closed. And we looked at living dinosaurs - birds. We have 10,000 species today. Most of them vocalize, sing with an open mouth. But some birds produce sound with a closed mouth. They actually inflate different structures that allow them to resonate, often at lower frequencies than many other birds. But we also needed to look at alligators and crocodiles as the closest cousins to dinosaurs. WERTHEIMER: Well, I have actually heard alligators bellow and make a terrific noise. CLARKE: Well, exactly, and that bellow is a closed-mouth sound. So when we think of our T. rex, we don't need to imagine just simple cooing. But there are a variety of generally low frequency sounds that are produced in this way. WERTHEIMER: Do you think there are other things about dinosaurs that we've gotten wrong for a long time? CLARKE: Well, for many, many years, we imagined dinosaurs as these scaly, you know, green kind of slick guys. WERTHEIMER: Reptilian. CLARKE: Reptilian, exactly, and now we know that many species of dinosaurs had feathers or simple filaments that seem to be feather precursors in some cases. WERTHEIMER: Do your findings come from the relatively recent discovery that some dinosaurs had feathers? Is this sort of, like, the next step? CLARKE: We are sort of taking the next. In the last 10 years, we've discovered that we can gain insight into the colors of dinosaurs and how they may have used visual signals in important contexts. And so what we wanted to ask is, can we gain insight into the vocal communication that extinct dinosaurs might have had? WERTHEIMER: Well, so what's next for you in your research? CLARKE: There's a lot more to study. For example, living birds, they essentially sing from the heart. Their vocal organ is deep in the chest. And we and crocodiles, our vocal folds are in our mouth. So we don't know when this transition occurred. And my collaborators include physiologists and developmental biologists, and we're looking at this question of how we get birdsong and how we get the vocal organ of birds in time. So that's where I'm excited to go next. We're going to find out a lot more about this, I think, in the next couple years. WERTHEIMER: Julia Clarke is a paleontologist at the University of Texas in Austin. She joined me from KUT in that city. Miss Clarke, thank you very much. CLARKE: Oh, it's a pleasure to be here.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. It's summertime, so we felt we had to start our show with a scene from the iconic summer vacation movie, where, in the 1980s, the Griswolds are packed into their station wagon. It's pouring rain. Everything has gone wrong. They're on this disastrous road trip to a moose-centric theme park. The wife and kids suggest that it's perhaps time to just go home. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION\")DANA BARRON: (As Audrey Griswold) I don't want to be in the car anymore. I want to go home. BEVERLY D'ANGELO: (As Ellen Griswold) Clark, under the circumstances, I wouldn't mind if we just went home. VEDANTAM: But the dad, Chevy Chase, has other ideas. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION\")CHEVY CHASE: (As Clark Griswold) We're 10 hours from the fun park, and you want to bail out. Well, I'll tell you something - this is no longer a vacation. It's a quest. It's a quest for fun. I'm going to have fun, and you're going to have fun. We're all going to have so much [expletive] fun we'll need plastic surgery to remove our goddamn smiles. (Laughter) I've got to be crazy. I'm on a pilgrimage to see a moose. Praise Marty Moose. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Summer vacations - we wait for them all year. We pour time, energy and money into planning them. Expectations run unreasonably high. Coming up, a summer edition of Stopwatch Science - how to plan a vacation, what vacations can reveal about your stock portfolio and why vacations can be bad for your waistline. DANIEL PINK, BYLINE: If you're like me, Shankar, vacations bring to mind two words - creeping obesity. VEDANTAM: Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. I'm joined now by Daniel Pink. He's the author of several books about human behavior. But on our show, as you know, his title is senior Stopwatch Science correspondent. Welcome, Dan. PINK: Thank you, Shankar. It's great to be here. VEDANTAM: All right, so on Stopwatch Science, Dan and I give one another 60 seconds to summarize interesting social science research. As we approach the one-minute mark, our producers will bring up the music - sometimes gently, sometimes loudly - to let us know our time is running out. Our topic today is vacations. This week we'll tell you why it's so important to take one and how to get the most out of your vacation. You know, Dan, whenever I'm with you, I actually feel like I'm on vacation. PINK: Ah, is that why you're in a swimsuit? (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: Exactly. PINK: All righty, all right, all right, all right, let's do some science. VEDANTAM: All right, Dan, your first 60 seconds starts now. PINK: Shankar, everyone here at NPR headquarters knows that you're an upstanding citizen who never, ever would use his work computer for personal tasks. VEDANTAM: They do? PINK: But some people aren't as scrupulous as you. And when it comes to vacation planning, that might be costing them. Wei Zhang of Iowa State University an Ajay Kalra of Rice University looked at a large trove of data from an online hotel reservation site. They found that people who booked leisure travel during work hours selected higher-quality hotels than those who booked during non-work hours. But once the vacation was over, those making reservations from the office ended up less satisfied with their hotel choice. Now, it's not clear exactly what's going on here, but one explanation seems plausible. When we're at work, we're more likely to be stressed out and depleted and therefore less likely to be vigilant. So instead of pushing hard to find a great deal, we settle for an OK deal that we later regret. Whatever the reason, though, the message is clear - don't shop for travel at work. VEDANTAM: So let me understand this correctly. They're saying that because people are stressed out and busy or maybe especially in need of a vacation when they're at work, they go online. They see something really snazzy, interesting, beautiful, and they say, yeah, I'm going to buy that. But then, when they actually go there, they find that if they had shopped around for another 10 minutes, they could have found something that was actually a better deal. PINK: Right, but we have only one deal here on Stopwatch Science. And that's a deal that involves 60 seconds. And those 60 seconds begin right now. VEDANTAM: All right, when we think about great vacations, we often think about going to unusual places - maybe going to a place that few other people have gone. Maybe you're already doing this. You're listening to this podcast right now on a beach in Tahiti. One advantage of unusual vacations is that we can then post pictures on Facebook or come home and tell our friends all about our amazing vacation. Now, since they haven't been to these wonderful locales, they will be eager listeners for our stories, right? PINK: So we think. VEDANTAM: No, they won't. Gus Cooney and Dan Gilbert at Harvard along with Timothy Wilson at the University of Virginia find that when people have amazingly unique experiences, they're often less happy afterward. Why? Your friends don't want to hear you drone on about getting on that Space X flight. They're talking to each other about the block party in the neighborhood that you missed, so you feel socially isolated. Social isolation matters more to your happiness than your vacation destination. PINK: This is very interesting. So how did they do this? Did they send one group of people to the Caribbean and another group to the banks of the Olentangy River in central Ohio? VEDANTAM: (Laughter) They both sound pretty exotic to me, Dan. But, no, that's not what they did. This was a social psychology experiment, which means it was done on the cheap. What they did is they brought in volunteers into a laboratory and they sat the majority of them down together to watch a very mediocre movie. And they sat one person down to watch an absolutely fantastic, riveting movie. And then they put the whole group together to talk. And the person who'd watched the amazing movie wanted to talk about the amazing movie that he or she had watched, but of course, none of the others had seen the amazing movie, and they didn't really want to talk about it. They wanted to talk about what a silly experiment this was. The others bonded with each other, and the person who watched the great movie ended up feeling isolated. PINK: I see. And so how does this play into this idea that experiences are more valuable to us than goods? VEDANTAM: That's interesting because there is a lot of research showing that experiences are more valuable than things when you're buying yourself gifts. But I've actually come by recent work, Dan, that actually finds that the reason experiences are often better than things as gifts is that experiences are inherently often social. If you're going on an experience and actually enjoying it entirely by yourself, it's not clear that it actually is much better than just buying yourself a new television set or a new car. It's the social aspect of experiences that makes them better. PINK: This is why when I do Stopwatch Science by myself at home, it's no fun. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: All right, speaking of unique and extraordinary experiences, Dan, I hope your next 60 seconds doesn't leave me feeling socially isolated. PINK: OK, if you're like me, Shankar, vacations bring to mind two words - creeping obesity. That's the medical concept for what happens to many of us in middle age. We don't become overweight overnight. Instead, we gain a pound or two each year. And before long, that person in the mirror looks a little different. Well, according to a recent paper in the journal Physiology and Behavior, our vacations could be part of the problem. These researchers studied 122 adults who'd gone on vacations of between one and three weeks. They find that these folks each gained nearly a pound on vacation and that the extra weight was still there 6 weeks later. Now, the reason is intriguing. Turns out people are more physically active on vacation, so inactivity wasn't the cause. The real culprit was that vacationers increased their calorie consumption in excess of their activity, especially in the form of alcohol. VEDANTAM: Oh yeah, of course. PINK: So if you want to avoid weight gain while on holiday, try to drink less. Although that might be tough if you're on a family vacation. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) So this makes total sense to me, Dan. I often feel that I'm significantly more active when I'm on vacations, but I have noticed that I don't lose weight while I'm on vacations. And it's probably because I'm just eating and drinking more. PINK: Right, and especially the drinking part. This - this paper showed something like a doubling in alcohol consumption during the weeks that people are away. So they're living it up, but they're paying for it later in creeping obesity. So speaking of creeping, your moment has crept to us right now. And your 60 seconds begins right now. VEDANTAM: All right, vacations can be fun. They can be relaxing. But they can also be very useful signals. Think about your own behavior. If you're the boss of a company and you're on vacation, is your company likely to make big moves that rock the boat? Not likely. Or let's say you're the boss and things are falling apart at work. Now, you might have to cancel your vacation to deal with the crisis. In other words, paying attention to when the boss goes on vacation can be a market signal. PINK: Interesting. VEDANTAM: David Yermack at NYU tracked when CEOs go on vacation by merging records of corporate jet flights and where CEOs of various companies are known to have vacation properties. He finds that CEOs are more likely to go on vacation right after their companies announce good news. And he also finds that stock prices for a company are less volatile when the CEO is on break. In other words, if you and I were running a hedge fund, Dan, we might want to keep better track of which CEOs are hitting the beach this summer and which ones are canceling their travel plans. PINK: Yeah, this is a great study. This is really interesting. So do you think that investors, funds are actually using this kind of information to make bets on companies? VEDANTAM: I think they might be, except it probably isn't easy to come by all the information that David Yermack pulled together. It's also probably the case that the signal is a small signal. So the only way to really be successful at this is if you apply the strategy over a very, very lengthy period of time. And in the long-run, the law of averages will work in your favor. Now, the law of averages don't necessarily work in your favor on Stopwatch Science because we have only 60 seconds to pull things off. And your next 60 seconds, Dan, starts right now. PINK: Vacations can recharge the mind and replenish the soul. But once we're back on the job, how long do the positive effects last? Two German psychologists tackled that question in the Journal of Organizational Behavior. The researchers chose a profession with lots of stress and high burnout rates - teachers. They had teachers fill out questionnaires the day before a two-week vacation, and then three more times after the vacation had ended and they were back on the job. First, the good news - when the teachers returned to the classroom after their break, they were more engaged in their jobs and significantly less emotionally exhausted. The vacation worked. Now, the less-good news - that positive boost faded away after only about four weeks. A month after returning to work, they were generally back to their pre-vacation levels of engagement and exhaustion. Now, we can't leap to universal conclusions here. Maybe there's something unique about teachers or Germans. But if the benefits of time off do fade out so quickly, perhaps we should all be taking more vacations. VEDANTAM: There's something terribly sad about that story, Dan, because it really suggests that we have these dreams about what vacations will do. And even when those dreams come true, what you're saying is that the effects are likely to be very short-lived. PINK: That's what it seems like. And you know what? We've seen that before in other areas. If you look at weight, generally people return to what's called their set point of weight. And, you know, they might lose some here, gain some here. But in general, they return to that set point. Even if you look at this measure of subjective well-being, how happy we are, you know, what? Something really bad happens to you, it drops. Something really great happens to you, it goes up. But then it returns to that same level. VEDANTAM: Which sort of leads to the question of, actually, what's the point of taking a vacation at all if you're going to come back to who you are at the end of it? Maybe you should just stay home. PINK: Maybe you should just stay at work and just keep working and working and working until you grind yourself into full despair and don't even hit your set point. That's a great suggestion. I'm sure our listeners would love it. I'm hoping that your next one is a little bit more uplifting, Shankar. Your 60 seconds start right now. VEDANTAM: All right, we did a podcast episode recently about Alaska, looking at climate change. I went there on vacation with my family recently. And when you're in Alaska, Dan, with all those mountains and glaciers and vast, open spaces, you can't help but notice that you're a very, very small animal on a very, very big planet. Now, we've all felt this. You've looked up at the sky on a dark night. You've seen the Milky Way, or you listened to a beautiful piece of music. You feel a sense of majesty, a sense of awe. Paul Piff, Dacher Keltner and many other researchers have found that awe not only does wonderful things for you, but that it helps you do wonderful things for others. Volunteers induced to feel awe act more altruistically, more ethically. They stop thinking of themselves and their problems as bigger or more important than others. So if you're on vacation right now, whether that's a hike around the neighborhood or a hike around the Grand Canyon, remember that one of the most important things you can do is to let yourself get caught up in the moment. Feel grateful. Feel awe. It's one of the ways vacations can make us better people. PINK: Interesting. So if you're at that block party rather than the Space X flight, look up in the air, wave to the other guy who's miserable on that Space X, and look at the clouds and just sort of get a sense of awe with your friends and your family. VEDANTAM: Yeah, I think so. This is the thing - I think many of us believe that the source of awe is in the things that we're seeing and the things that we're noticing. But in many ways, I think the source of the awe is in ourselves. It's in our ability, our orientation to actually look at the world and appreciate how marvelous it is. PINK: Yeah. Also, based on that study, I really think that there's a lesson for the Alaska Department of Tourism. They should have a campaign that says welcome to Awe-laska (ph). VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: That's yours, folks in Juneau, for the taking. VEDANTAM: So there's some marketing advice from Dan Pink. And there you have it. Book your next vacation at home. Pick the neighborhood block party over the Space X flight. Drink less while you're on vacation. Try to keep that vacation bliss going a little longer after you get back, perhaps by soaking up lots of awe-inspiring moments. Finally, if any of you see Dan Pink hastily cancel his vacation plans at the last minute, you can be fairly confident that the HIDDEN BRAIN hedge fund that we run together is about to tank. Dan, thank you for joining me. PINK: It's always a pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This episode of hidden brain was produced by Max Nesterak and Chris Benderev and edited by Jenny Schmidt.

I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is NPR. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. It's summertime, so we felt we had to start our show with a scene from the iconic summer vacation movie, where, in the 1980s, the Griswolds are packed into their station wagon. It's pouring rain. Everything has gone wrong. They're on this disastrous road trip to a moose-centric theme park. The wife and kids suggest that it's perhaps time to just go home. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION\") DANA BARRON: (As Audrey Griswold) I don't want to be in the car anymore. I want to go home. BEVERLY D'ANGELO: (As Ellen Griswold) Clark, under the circumstances, I wouldn't mind if we just went home. VEDANTAM: But the dad, Chevy Chase, has other ideas. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION\") CHEVY CHASE: (As Clark Griswold) We're 10 hours from the fun park, and you want to bail out. Well, I'll tell you something - this is no longer a vacation. It's a quest. It's a quest for fun. I'm going to have fun, and you're going to have fun. We're all going to have so much [expletive] fun we'll need plastic surgery to remove our goddamn smiles. (Laughter) I've got to be crazy. I'm on a pilgrimage to see a moose. Praise Marty Moose. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Summer vacations - we wait for them all year. We pour time, energy and money into planning them. Expectations run unreasonably high. Coming up, a summer edition of Stopwatch Science - how to plan a vacation, what vacations can reveal about your stock portfolio and why vacations can be bad for your waistline. DANIEL PINK, BYLINE: If you're like me, Shankar, vacations bring to mind two words - creeping obesity. VEDANTAM: Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. I'm joined now by Daniel Pink. He's the author of several books about human behavior. But on our show, as you know, his title is senior Stopwatch Science correspondent. Welcome, Dan. PINK: Thank you, Shankar. It's great to be here. VEDANTAM: All right, so on Stopwatch Science, Dan and I give one another 60 seconds to summarize interesting social science research. As we approach the one-minute mark, our producers will bring up the music - sometimes gently, sometimes loudly - to let us know our time is running out. Our topic today is vacations. This week we'll tell you why it's so important to take one and how to get the most out of your vacation. You know, Dan, whenever I'm with you, I actually feel like I'm on vacation. PINK: Ah, is that why you're in a swimsuit? (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: Exactly. PINK: All righty, all right, all right, all right, let's do some science. VEDANTAM: All right, Dan, your first 60 seconds starts now. PINK: Shankar, everyone here at NPR headquarters knows that you're an upstanding citizen who never, ever would use his work computer for personal tasks. VEDANTAM: They do? PINK: But some people aren't as scrupulous as you. And when it comes to vacation planning, that might be costing them. Wei Zhang of Iowa State University an Ajay Kalra of Rice University looked at a large trove of data from an online hotel reservation site. They found that people who booked leisure travel during work hours selected higher-quality hotels than those who booked during non-work hours. But once the vacation was over, those making reservations from the office ended up less satisfied with their hotel choice. Now, it's not clear exactly what's going on here, but one explanation seems plausible. When we're at work, we're more likely to be stressed out and depleted and therefore less likely to be vigilant. So instead of pushing hard to find a great deal, we settle for an OK deal that we later regret. Whatever the reason, though, the message is clear - don't shop for travel at work. VEDANTAM: So let me understand this correctly. They're saying that because people are stressed out and busy or maybe especially in need of a vacation when they're at work, they go online. They see something really snazzy, interesting, beautiful, and they say, yeah, I'm going to buy that. But then, when they actually go there, they find that if they had shopped around for another 10 minutes, they could have found something that was actually a better deal. PINK: Right, but we have only one deal here on Stopwatch Science. And that's a deal that involves 60 seconds. And those 60 seconds begin right now. VEDANTAM: All right, when we think about great vacations, we often think about going to unusual places - maybe going to a place that few other people have gone. Maybe you're already doing this. You're listening to this podcast right now on a beach in Tahiti. One advantage of unusual vacations is that we can then post pictures on Facebook or come home and tell our friends all about our amazing vacation. Now, since they haven't been to these wonderful locales, they will be eager listeners for our stories, right? PINK: So we think. VEDANTAM: No, they won't. Gus Cooney and Dan Gilbert at Harvard along with Timothy Wilson at the University of Virginia find that when people have amazingly unique experiences, they're often less happy afterward. Why? Your friends don't want to hear you drone on about getting on that Space X flight. They're talking to each other about the block party in the neighborhood that you missed, so you feel socially isolated. Social isolation matters more to your happiness than your vacation destination. PINK: This is very interesting. So how did they do this? Did they send one group of people to the Caribbean and another group to the banks of the Olentangy River in central Ohio? VEDANTAM: (Laughter) They both sound pretty exotic to me, Dan. But, no, that's not what they did. This was a social psychology experiment, which means it was done on the cheap. What they did is they brought in volunteers into a laboratory and they sat the majority of them down together to watch a very mediocre movie. And they sat one person down to watch an absolutely fantastic, riveting movie. And then they put the whole group together to talk. And the person who'd watched the amazing movie wanted to talk about the amazing movie that he or she had watched, but of course, none of the others had seen the amazing movie, and they didn't really want to talk about it. They wanted to talk about what a silly experiment this was. The others bonded with each other, and the person who watched the great movie ended up feeling isolated. PINK: I see. And so how does this play into this idea that experiences are more valuable to us than goods? VEDANTAM: That's interesting because there is a lot of research showing that experiences are more valuable than things when you're buying yourself gifts. But I've actually come by recent work, Dan, that actually finds that the reason experiences are often better than things as gifts is that experiences are inherently often social. If you're going on an experience and actually enjoying it entirely by yourself, it's not clear that it actually is much better than just buying yourself a new television set or a new car. It's the social aspect of experiences that makes them better. PINK: This is why when I do Stopwatch Science by myself at home, it's no fun. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: All right, speaking of unique and extraordinary experiences, Dan, I hope your next 60 seconds doesn't leave me feeling socially isolated. PINK: OK, if you're like me, Shankar, vacations bring to mind two words - creeping obesity. That's the medical concept for what happens to many of us in middle age. We don't become overweight overnight. Instead, we gain a pound or two each year. And before long, that person in the mirror looks a little different. Well, according to a recent paper in the journal Physiology and Behavior, our vacations could be part of the problem. These researchers studied 122 adults who'd gone on vacations of between one and three weeks. They find that these folks each gained nearly a pound on vacation and that the extra weight was still there 6 weeks later. Now, the reason is intriguing. Turns out people are more physically active on vacation, so inactivity wasn't the cause. The real culprit was that vacationers increased their calorie consumption in excess of their activity, especially in the form of alcohol. VEDANTAM: Oh yeah, of course. PINK: So if you want to avoid weight gain while on holiday, try to drink less. Although that might be tough if you're on a family vacation. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) So this makes total sense to me, Dan. I often feel that I'm significantly more active when I'm on vacations, but I have noticed that I don't lose weight while I'm on vacations. And it's probably because I'm just eating and drinking more. PINK: Right, and especially the drinking part. This - this paper showed something like a doubling in alcohol consumption during the weeks that people are away. So they're living it up, but they're paying for it later in creeping obesity. So speaking of creeping, your moment has crept to us right now. And your 60 seconds begins right now. VEDANTAM: All right, vacations can be fun. They can be relaxing. But they can also be very useful signals. Think about your own behavior. If you're the boss of a company and you're on vacation, is your company likely to make big moves that rock the boat? Not likely. Or let's say you're the boss and things are falling apart at work. Now, you might have to cancel your vacation to deal with the crisis. In other words, paying attention to when the boss goes on vacation can be a market signal. PINK: Interesting. VEDANTAM: David Yermack at NYU tracked when CEOs go on vacation by merging records of corporate jet flights and where CEOs of various companies are known to have vacation properties. He finds that CEOs are more likely to go on vacation right after their companies announce good news. And he also finds that stock prices for a company are less volatile when the CEO is on break. In other words, if you and I were running a hedge fund, Dan, we might want to keep better track of which CEOs are hitting the beach this summer and which ones are canceling their travel plans. PINK: Yeah, this is a great study. This is really interesting. So do you think that investors, funds are actually using this kind of information to make bets on companies? VEDANTAM: I think they might be, except it probably isn't easy to come by all the information that David Yermack pulled together. It's also probably the case that the signal is a small signal. So the only way to really be successful at this is if you apply the strategy over a very, very lengthy period of time. And in the long-run, the law of averages will work in your favor. Now, the law of averages don't necessarily work in your favor on Stopwatch Science because we have only 60 seconds to pull things off. And your next 60 seconds, Dan, starts right now. PINK: Vacations can recharge the mind and replenish the soul. But once we're back on the job, how long do the positive effects last? Two German psychologists tackled that question in the Journal of Organizational Behavior. The researchers chose a profession with lots of stress and high burnout rates - teachers. They had teachers fill out questionnaires the day before a two-week vacation, and then three more times after the vacation had ended and they were back on the job. First, the good news - when the teachers returned to the classroom after their break, they were more engaged in their jobs and significantly less emotionally exhausted. The vacation worked. Now, the less-good news - that positive boost faded away after only about four weeks. A month after returning to work, they were generally back to their pre-vacation levels of engagement and exhaustion. Now, we can't leap to universal conclusions here. Maybe there's something unique about teachers or Germans. But if the benefits of time off do fade out so quickly, perhaps we should all be taking more vacations. VEDANTAM: There's something terribly sad about that story, Dan, because it really suggests that we have these dreams about what vacations will do. And even when those dreams come true, what you're saying is that the effects are likely to be very short-lived. PINK: That's what it seems like. And you know what? We've seen that before in other areas. If you look at weight, generally people return to what's called their set point of weight. And, you know, they might lose some here, gain some here. But in general, they return to that set point. Even if you look at this measure of subjective well-being, how happy we are, you know, what? Something really bad happens to you, it drops. Something really great happens to you, it goes up. But then it returns to that same level. VEDANTAM: Which sort of leads to the question of, actually, what's the point of taking a vacation at all if you're going to come back to who you are at the end of it? Maybe you should just stay home. PINK: Maybe you should just stay at work and just keep working and working and working until you grind yourself into full despair and don't even hit your set point. That's a great suggestion. I'm sure our listeners would love it. I'm hoping that your next one is a little bit more uplifting, Shankar. Your 60 seconds start right now. VEDANTAM: All right, we did a podcast episode recently about Alaska, looking at climate change. I went there on vacation with my family recently. And when you're in Alaska, Dan, with all those mountains and glaciers and vast, open spaces, you can't help but notice that you're a very, very small animal on a very, very big planet. Now, we've all felt this. You've looked up at the sky on a dark night. You've seen the Milky Way, or you listened to a beautiful piece of music. You feel a sense of majesty, a sense of awe. Paul Piff, Dacher Keltner and many other researchers have found that awe not only does wonderful things for you, but that it helps you do wonderful things for others. Volunteers induced to feel awe act more altruistically, more ethically. They stop thinking of themselves and their problems as bigger or more important than others. So if you're on vacation right now, whether that's a hike around the neighborhood or a hike around the Grand Canyon, remember that one of the most important things you can do is to let yourself get caught up in the moment. Feel grateful. Feel awe. It's one of the ways vacations can make us better people. PINK: Interesting. So if you're at that block party rather than the Space X flight, look up in the air, wave to the other guy who's miserable on that Space X, and look at the clouds and just sort of get a sense of awe with your friends and your family. VEDANTAM: Yeah, I think so. This is the thing - I think many of us believe that the source of awe is in the things that we're seeing and the things that we're noticing.

ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Millions of microbes live in our bodies and do all sorts of things to help us live long, healthy lives. But Andrew Moeller of the University of California, Berkeley, had a question. Where did we get our microbes? ANDREW MOELLER: Not just the question of where each individual gets their bacteria from during their life, but where did the species of bacteria that populate humans come from originally? STEIN: So Moeller and his colleagues deciphered the evolution of our microbes by analyzing the DNA and bacteria living in the guts of humans and our closest relatives, like. . . (SOUNDBITE OF CHIMPANZEE CHATTER)STEIN: . . . Chimps. . . (SOUNDBITE OF BONOBO CHATTER)STEIN: . . . And bonobos. . . (SOUNDBITE OF GORILLA GRUNTING)STEIN: . . . And gorillas. MOELLER: We found that the evolutionary relationships among human chimpanzee and gorilla gut bacteria mirror the evolutionary relationships among humans, chimpanzees and gorillas. STEIN: When our evolution took a different path from gorillas 15 million years ago, the bacteria in our guts and the guts of gorillas parted ways, too. And when we evolved into humans instead of chimps or bonobos about 5 million years ago, our microbes evolved right along with us. MOELLER: Our bacteria seem to be evolving with us over time. They've been passed down from generation to generation over millions of years just like our genes have been. They're a part of us just like our genome is a part of us and are a part of what make us uniquely human. MARGARET MCFALL-NGAI: That's, in my mind, pretty profound. STEIN: Margaret McFall-Ngai is a biologist at the University of Hawaii. MCFALL-NGAI: What's really amazing about this is it really at some level changes the idea of what we think of as a human. A human is not just the genes and cells that make up the human body that are uniquely human but also the cells that are microbial. We are an ecosystem. MCFALL-NGAI: A complicated ecosystem of human cells and genes and microbial cells and genes that all evolved an intimate relationship together over the eons. Martin Blaser of New York University says that helps explain how our microbes got involved in so many things our bodies do, how our immune systems work, how our metabolisms are regulated. MARTIN BLASER: It tells us that the microbes in the human body are not accidental. They're not recent, but they're really a part of our ancestry. These are strong indications that these microbes are important to us. Otherwise it's not clear that they would've stuck around for such a long time. STEIN: But not all our microbes have stuck around. Some have gone extinct, and that may be part of the reason some diseases are skyrocketing. BLASER: There's more and more evidence of ongoing extinctions in humans of microbes, and we and others have linked this loss to the rise of modern diseases like asthma, like obesity, like diabetes. STEIN: So Blaser and others say we need to be way more careful how we use antibiotics and do other things to better protect the microbes we evolved with. Rob Stein, NPR News.

The bug that bugs most people? The fly, of course, but one Swedish man has spent three decades chasing after flies. He's collected hundreds of examples of hoverflies. That's a family of fly that looks more like a bee or a wasp. What kind of person would do such a thing? FREDRIK SJOBERG: My name is Fredrik Sjoberg, and I've been an amateur entomologist all my life. I was very small, maybe 4 or 5 years old, when I started to kill insects and collect them. And as all entomologists, I stopped when I was around 15, 16, for the simple reason that it's very difficult to make an impression on girls with dead insects. But then I got into it again when I had a family of my own. I started to collect flies - hoverflies. Hoverflies look like someone else, mostly like wasps or other insects that could harm you. The place I live since 30 years is an island in the archipelagos of Stockholm called Runmaro. It's a wonderful island with nine lakes and huge forests. So I have this house by the lake, and there are thousands of hoverflies, but I don't have to run around to find them. I had been collecting hoverflies on this island for so many years, and I had discovered almost all of them. But in a way, I was a bit fed up with it because I could spend a whole summer without finding any new species. And then one day, I found the Callicera. Callicera is - those are among the rarest and most mystical hoverflies in the world. They are big and colored in gold and brass, very metallic. The story about the Callicera goes - I had been to a party the day before. So in the morning - early in the morning - I had a hangover, but I decided anyway to take a walk. I didn't bring my net, so I only had this pooter, a small sucking instrument, if I happened to find some interesting fly. My kids once tried to describe this instrument as something in between a piccolo flute and an opium pipe. And I was standing there in this morning sun, and suddenly I saw the first Callicera all my life. And in one second I got sober and I just concentrated to catch it. Collecting things is a matter of bragging, making an impression on others. And it's more or less difficult to make an impression on people with flies. But another Swedish hoverfly collector and I - we formed the Callicera Club because he also had one. And we meet once in a while to eat good food and drink expensive wines, so this is the uppermost aristocracy of the hoverfly society. SIMON: That was Fredrik Sjoberg, author of \"Fly Trap\" and apparently a member of the exclusive Callicera Club.

Wendy Chase is a speech therapist who helps transgender men and women find their voice. She's the director of the University of Connecticut Speech and Hearing Clinic. She joins us now from member station WNPR in Hartford. Thanks so much for being with us. WENDY CHASE: It's a pleasure to be here. SIMON: What do you say to your patients about why speech therapy might be a good idea? CHASE: Most of our patients are seeking to allow the world to perceive them in the way that they want to be perceived. And communication really is a very critical component of that perception, particularly when there is not a visual cue. It's important for there to be safe places to practice and try things out, and the speech therapy room can be one of those places. But more importantly, we want folks to be able to change their voice in a way that is safe and doesn't do damage long-term to their vocal chords. SIMON: What do they have to look out for? What do you do? CHASE: Well, what you do - particularly with the male-to-female transition, you're actually stressing your vocal chords, and they can be damaged through excess use. And you'll end up with any number of issues from swelling and inflammation to actual development of a nodule on the vocal chord. And then you've got a much bigger problem. SIMON: We have a clip of one of your patients. Why don't we play that now? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I guess my current car, the Volkswagen Passat that I just bought, 'cause it's a very comfortable car. SIMON: Tell us a little bit about this person and what you have to do. CHASE: The clip there is several months into treatment for this individual in their early 50s, who is making a transition after a very long career using his voice and now needs to move to using her voice. And it's been a challenge because so many of the communication behaviors are so ingrained. It took another nine to 12 months to achieve a voice that was satisfactory for this individual. CHASE: What did you tell her to do? CHASE: We raised the pitch a little bit, and then we add resonance to have the air flow resonate not in her chest, but up in her head. And then she worked on things like using a rising intonation at the end of sentences and asking more questions as opposed to just giving information during a conversation. SIMON: Well, I mean, of course, the implication of that is that women ask more questions while we guys just. . . CHASE: (Laughter). SIMON: . . . Bowl ahead and tell. . . CHASE: Provide more information (laughter). Well, I think the battle here is for an individual to find what makes them feel most confident - that the listener can stop paying attention to what gender identity they might have and listen to the content of their speech and not be distracted by how they speak or their pitch. And what it entails is using a wide variety of, unfortunately sometimes, gender stereotypes to, yeah, say, guess what? Men do this a little bit more. Women do this a little bit more. What would you like to do? SIMON: Well, what happens when you're dealing with somebody, and, you know, you try and get them to take on some qualities in their speech that you would agree are stereotypical? CHASE: Well, it's not ever my decision what qualities the client will take on. It's my job to introduce information that the client may not have thought of and say, where are you on the scale of this type of a behavior? And where do you want to go with it, if anywhere? SIMON: Wendy Chase is the director of the University of Connecticut Speech and Hearing Clinic. Thanks so much for being with us. CHASE: Thank you.

I'm Guy Raz. ASTRO TELLER: Right here? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yes. TELLER: Sweet. RAZ: So let's introduce a guy named Astro Teller. Hello. Is that Astro Teller? TELLER: It is. RAZ: Which is kind of a perfect name for someone with Astro Teller's job. TELLER: I'd like to think so. RAZ: Astro works at a place known only as X. TELLER: People ask a lot about secrecy and how much secrecy we have at X. And there are things that we're working on at X that we don't talk about publicly. And I think people misunderstand why we don't talk about them, and it's related to the issue of failure. RAZ: Failure. . . TELLER: One of my favorite topics. RAZ: . . . Is a big deal at X, but let's back up. X is run by Google, and when Astro first started working there, he sat down with Larry Page, one of the company's co-founders, and they tried to come up with a way to describe what they would do at X, what secret stuff they'd be working on. TELLER: So I said, well, are we taking research? Is that like basically what we're doing? And he said no. Are we making business units? And he said not really. Are we an incubator? Sort of not really. So I was just trying these things out on him, and when I said are we taking moonshots? He said, that's what we're doing. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK, VIDEO PLAYING)JOHN F KENNEDY: Why, some say, the moon? RAZ: Here's Astro. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK, VIDEO PLAYING)KENNEDY: Why choose this as our goal? TELLER: 1962 at Rice University. KENNEDY: We choose to go to the moon. TELLER: JFK told the country. . . KENNEDY: We choose to go to the moon. TELLER: . . . About a dream he had, a dream to put a person on the moon by the end of the decade. KENNEDY: We choose to go to the moon in this. . . TELLER: No one knew if it was possible to do, but he made sure a plan was put in place to do it if it was possible. That's how great dreams are. Great dreams aren't just visions. They're visions coupled to strategies for making them real. At X, I have the incredible good fortune to work at a moonshot factory. We use the word moonshots to remind us to keep our visions big, to keep dreaming. And we use the word factory to remind ourselves that we want to have concrete visions, concrete plans to make them real. But I have a secret for you. The moonshot factory is a messy place, but rather than avoid the mess, pretend it's not there. We've tried to make that our strength. We spend most of our time breaking things and trying to prove that we're wrong. That's it. That's the secret. Run at all the hardest parts of the problem first. Get excited and cheer. Hey, how are we going to kill our project today? RAZ: This philosophy of chasing after failure is what Google is using to build its driverless car which started development in X, but so did Google Glass. Remember that? Not exactly a huge success. So what makes the difference between success and failure? And when failure is what you wind up with, how do you learn from it? How do you recover from it? Well, today on the show, stories and ideas about learning from failure and how to think differently about what happens when you fall flat on your face. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JON FORTT: It's one of the most hyped tech products that most people couldn't actually buy. RAZ: So let's talk about Google Glass for a second. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FORTT: A wearable computer that takes photos and video, searches the web and responds to voice commands. RAZ: Like we said, it was first developed at X. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: One of the most highly anticipated tech gadgets. RAZ: It was supposed to be a huge thing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FORTT: An estimated 10,000 people in a pilot program are already users. RAZ: But the features. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JAY WAXENBERG: I'm excited to have the GPS like right in my eye. I'm excited to be able to pull up the images. Like, if I can Google something. RAZ: These things were not enough to make it a success. And so Google quietly stopped production of the prototype and moved the project out of X. TELLER: I think there were some things about what we did that were fantastic, and there are things that we did that I don't think we should repeat. And we can appreciate the parts of it that were good and make clear notes to ourselves about the parts of it that we wish that we would do differently next time. RAZ: But failure is hard. It's not - it's not fun. I mean, this sounds really great and positive the way you're talking about it. But isn't it pretty hard to get people to be - you know, to become really excited about failing at something? I mean, how do you do that? TELLER: There are a lot of different ways to do it. But here's an example - the first time I stood a team at X up on stage in front of everyone at X and said, this team has done more to further innovation at X by ending their project than any one of you sitting in your seats has done in the last quarter. There was, like, an uncomfortable silence. So then I say, and we're giving them all bonuses for having ended their project. All those people sitting in the seats are feeling even more like wait, what? Then I say, hey, guys, take a vacation. And when you get back, the world is your oyster. Find some new project to jump into. And everyone thinks I've lost my mind. But the tenth time I did that, like, no one even thinks about it. They just get a standing ovation every time. I don't even have to say the speech anymore because it's part of the culture now. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TELLER: I want to show you a few of the projects that we've had to leave behind on the cutting room floor and also a few of the gems that at least so far have not only survived that process but have been accelerated by it. Last year, we killed a project in automated vertical farming. Vertical farming uses 10 times less water and a hundred times less land than conventional farming. But unfortunately, we couldn't get staple crops, like grains and rice, to grow this way. So we killed the project. Here's another huge problem - we pay enormous costs in resources and environmental damage to ship goods worldwide. Economic development of landlocked countries is limited by lack of shipping infrastructure. The radical solution - a lighter-than-air variable buoyancy cargo ship. But it turned out that it was going to cost close to $200 million to design and build the first one. Two-hundred-million dollars is just way too expensive because X is structured with these tight feedback loops of making mistakes and learning and new designs. We can't spend $200 million to get the first data point about whether we're on the right track or not. If there's an Achilles' heel in one of our projects, we want to know it now, up front, not way down the road. So we killed this project, too. Discovering a major flaw in a project doesn't always mean that it ends the project. Sometimes it actually gets us on to a more productive path. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: You know, it sounds like a lot of this is about how you look at it, right? Like, you know, you guys didn't fail, but you hit a snag that then forced you to shift your perspective. TELLER: Yeah. I mean, I think - you're right, of course. It helps me that I've reframed what I think of as real failure. I think of real failure as the point at which you know what you're working on is the wrong thing to be working on or that you're working on it in the wrong way. You can't call the work up to the moment where you figure it out that you're doing the wrong thing failing. That's called learning. And once you frame it that way, there's this moment where if you stop now, if you course correct now, you can be shame free. But if you keep going forward, the shame starts to build. RAZ: How do you know when it's time to, like, pull the plug and say, you know what guys - this isn't going to work. Let's just, like, fail hard and move on. TELLER: That's the really, really tough part, of course. . . RAZ: Yeah. TELLER: . . . Because reasonable people often totally disagree. . . RAZ: I bet. TELLER: . . . About when that point has been reached. RAZ: They're like what are you doing to us, Astro? TELLER: So there are times when we're trying something and it doesn't work, and we try a different way to solve the same problem or de-risk the technology. And that doesn't work also. And then we try a third way. Should we try a fourth way? That's the hard part. That's what we spend a decent amount of time arguing over. There are frequently times where I will look at a project and be confident that it's going in the wrong direction. I will say gently that I think so. And then I will step away. First of all, I'm wrong a bunch of the time. And also, if we're expecting them to do these hard things, they need to own it. If it's done to them, it feels like a catastrophe. When they do it, it actually can be empowering. RAZ: One of the most ambitious projects to come out of X in the last few years is a project called Loon, as in balloon. And it started with this idea. . . TELLER: If you were to make what you could think of as a super-small, super-cheap satellite and tie it to a balloon and put it up into the stratosphere, you would have a couple huge benefits. RAZ: First benefit - such a device would not work like a satellite much higher up in space. It wouldn't need a cell tower. It could send data directly to your phone. TELLER: And the nice secondary effect, you can have an idea about what either the balloon would be like or this payload - the thing underneath it, which is like this little baby satellite - about how you could make it better, make a new version and have it up again in a week. The turnaround time for satellites is five to 10 years. RAZ: Wow. TELLER: Think about the learning loop of one week compared to five to 10 years. RAZ: Astro hopes that X's Loon project could be a way to get internet access to millions of people all over the world who don't have it and get it to them through a network of balloons floating around the world. So for years now Astro and his team have thrown themselves at the challenges of this idea, learning really fast and expecting, even hoping to fail. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TELLER: So since 2012, the Loon team has prioritized the work that seems the most difficult and so the most likely to kill their project. And we're going to fly over places like Indonesia for real service testing this year. The only way to get people to work on big risky things, audacious ideas and have them run at all the hardest parts of the problem first is if you make that the path of least resistance for them. We work hard at X to make it safe to fail. They get applause from their peers, hugs and high-fives from their manager, me in particular. They get promoted for it. We have bonused every single person on teams that ended their projects, from teams as small as two to teams of more than 30. We believe in dreams at The Moonshot Factory. But enthusiastic skepticism is not the enemy of boundless optimism. It's optimism's perfect partner. It unlocks the potential in every idea. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Astro Teller, check out his entire talk on X at ted. com. More ideas about learning from failure in just a minute, I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR.

Last week, we met Kit Parker, a biophysicist who put his academic career on hold to fight in Afghanistan. When Parker returned, he was determined to explain the signature wound of recent wars, an invisible brain injury caused by blast waves from roadside bombs. The military had assumed the damage was purely psychological. Parker had a hunch that blast waves were affecting individual brain cells. NPR's Jon Hamilton explained how the Harvard scientist set out to test his idea. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: Kit Parker was convinced that somehow, the energy from a bomb was physically disrupting entire networks in the brain. KIT PARKER: Networks that allow you to recognize your grandmother's face, to count your change at a fast food restaurant. HAMILTON: And Parker was pretty sure the trouble started when special proteins in brain cells began sending abnormal signals. But proving this was going to take years of costly research. Parker needed money. So in 2006, he went to see Dr. Geoffrey Ling at the military's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in Arlington, Va. Parker says he and Ling just got each other. PARKER: Geoff and I both carried a gun for a living. That might be part of it (laughter). It changes - once you've carried a gun for a living, it kind of changes your perspective on everything. HAMILTON: Also, both men were world class scientists and unconventional thinkers. Parker brought Ling a prototype of a device that could simulate the effect of a blast wave on brain tissue. It's a tube about the size of a scuba tank. And when I visit Ling. . . GEOFFREY LING: I've got to show you this, man. HAMILTON: . . . He still has it. LING: This is the Kit Parker blast chamber. What it is is in this thing, what you're able to do is blow the pressure wave with the exact same pressure time profile as a blast would be, which is critical. HAMILTON: If Parker was right, that pressure wave would cause the special proteins in brain cells to malfunction. Ling says he liked the idea of funding someone with a highly personal stake in the research. LING: I mean, this guy had a Ph. D. from Vanderbilt. This guy was on the faculty of Harvard. And yet, he stopped and said our country's under attack. I'm going to go do something about it. And when he came home, he said, I'm not done. HAMILTON: With money from DARPA, Parker's lab got to work. His team tweaked brain cells in every way imaginable while monitoring signals coming from the special proteins. The lab worked with a sense of urgency. Parker says by this time, IEDs had become the weapon of choice for attacking coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. PARKER: The IED is a great weapon system because it hits us at our scientific weak point, and that's the brain. They have a good weapon. HAMILTON: Parker got a reminder of that in 2009, the year he returned to Afghanistan. This time, he was part of an Army effort to figure out how to protect troops from IEDs. Parker was assigned to a platoon looking for bombs along major travel routes. And one day in the Tangi Valley, they found one the hard way. PARKER: Had an IED blow up, blew over an MRAP vehicle. Four dudes inside, four concussions, brain injuries. Some of these guys were even blown up a dozen times. HAMILTON: When Parker returned to his lab, the brain injury research was mostly done. Finally, he would find out whether his hunch had paid off. PARKER: And we were right. We nailed it. HAMILTON: In 2011, Parker's lab published two papers on how blast waves lead to unhealthy signals in the brain. One explained how these signals could cause the brain's blood vessels to constrict long after an explosion. The other paper showed how the signals could start a cascade of events that would ultimately disrupt the connections among brain cells. Geoffrey Ling at DARPA says those papers helped show that the damage from blast waves wasn't just psychological. LING: It was a fundamental insight that Kit did through that project. And that was just amazing. HAMILTON: Now that the research was published, Parker was certain pharmaceutical companies would be eager to use the findings to develop drugs for TBIs. He was wrong. PARKER: I was surprised. I was very surprised. HAMILTON: The drug companies were gun shy. They'd lost billions on failed drugs for brain diseases like Alzheimer's, and they weren't ready to take on traumatic brain injury. PARKER: No one wanted to get in the fight. HAMILTON: Flash forward to the present. Parker is addressing the several dozen researchers who work in his disease biophysics lab. PARKER: Come on, take bold steps. Only the bold win. HAMILTON: Parker's joking. He's just trying to get the team lined up for their annual picture. PARKER: Tall people in the back. Short people up front. HAMILTON: But for many of the people here, military jargon is second nature. And blast injuries are more than an academic pursuit. When everyone sits down for lunch, Parker points out a few of his people. PARKER: Stacey got back about a year ago from Afghanistan. John Ferrier was in the Air Force in Afghanistan. Angie Greer was in Iraq and got a Bronze Star over there. HAMILTON: Greer, who came to the lab a couple of years ago, says she saw IED explosions on a daily basis and a lot of traumatic brain injuries. ANGIE GREER: We lost one soldier to blast. So the research system here, it's special to me. HAMILTON: Parker has made a point of recruiting scientists who've been in combat. PARKER: There's a bond between me and the ones who are overseas. It's pretty strong. I don't really know how to describe it. You love them. HAMILTON: Parker's new mission is to figure out how to interrupt the cascade of events that starts with a bomb blast and ends with a damaged brain. BEN MAOZ: In this lab, we are working on a traumatic brain injury. HAMILTON: So members of his team are sifting through thousands of proteins looking for the ones that might make an easy target for a drug. Ben Maoz is a postdoc who served in the Israeli military. MAOZ: So it's basically, it's a needle in a haystack to trying to understand exactly what protein is doing and when and where. And we don't know the answer. Funding for this research is scarce now that the U. S. has less involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. Parker says there's not much interest in battlefield brain injuries, even though tens of thousands of veterans are still trying to recover from these wounds. PARKER: It's painful for me, personally, because you get this impression that, you know, no one cares. And it sucks. It's an awful feeling. It's, like, the war's over. And now people are worried about football players again. HAMILTON: But Parker says there's no chance he and the other veterans in his lab will stop searching for a treatment.

I'm Terry Gross. People often think of the brain as being like a computer. But according to my guest, neuroscientist Dean Burnett, that's only true if you imagine a computer that decided some information in its memory was more important than other information for reasons that were never made clear or a computer that filed information in a manner that didn't make any logical sense or a computer that kept opening your more personal and embarrassing files without being asked. Burnett is the author of the new book \"Idiot Brain: What Your Head Is Really Up To. \" It focuses on some of the more illogical behaviors the brain produces. He lives in Wales, where he's based at Cardiff University's Center for Medical Education and teaches in the psychiatry department. He writes the science blog \"Brain Flapping\" for the British newspaper The Guardian. Dean Burnett, welcome to FRESH AIR. DEAN BURNETT: Thank you for having me. GROSS: So in that analogy that you make between the brain and a computer, you say your brain would be like a computer that decided it didn't really like the information you'd stored. So the computer altered it for you - to suit your purposes, to suit your preferences. And you say your memory is egotistical - that the brain tweaks and adjusts the information it stores to make you look better. What's an example of what you mean there? BURNETT: Well, I think the classic example is like someone claiming they caught a fish this big, holding their arms out. And oh, the obvious joke is that they didn't really. That's actually just exaggeration. But all of you will think that's just someone lying to try and look better. But a lot of research suggests that we actually - whenever we remember something, we will tend to embellish if we're telling someone about it. We'll embellish it slightly to make us look a bit better. Or we'll make it a bit more impressive as a story. But every time you do that, the memory itself - it's got a good chance of itself being edited. It's being adjusted. So the actual underlying memory is replaced by this updated version that you have created to convey something which makes you look better. And that seems to be happening constantly - that we think back on things and we sort of interpret them in different ways to make us feel better about ourselves - make us feel more accomplished, more involved, more capable and more important than we actually were. Because our memory is the only record of it, that often goes unnoticed. GROSS: In writing about memory, you write about the difference between short-term memory and long-term memory. And short-term memory really doesn't hold very much. I mean, from how you describe it, it holds less than I even thought. BURNETT: Yeah. That's sort of one of those mainstream ideas of how memory is structured and works, which is not quite correct - in that short-term memory - you see a lot of films and, like, TV shows. They sort of portray short-term memory as something from an hour ago or, like, that same day. Where it's actually - short-term memory is 30 seconds to a minute. Anything longer than that tends to actually now be officially a long-term memory 'cause it takes the brain. . . GROSS: Whoa whoa whoa. Anything longer than a minute is officially long-term memory? BURNETT: Essentially, yes. GROSS: That means my long-term memory is worse than I thought (laughter). BURNETT: Yeah. It's a strange - 'cause short-term memory is essentially patterns of activity in places like the frontal cortex. It's like a firework display. Or, like, I liken it to writing - like writing a shopping list in the foam on your coffee. You can sort of do it. And it's something that'll stay legible for a minute. But generally, quickly, it'll fade away, whereas a long-term memory actually is, like, the neurons and the brain cells connecting together to form a new memory. But that takes time. That takes like 30 seconds to a minute for that to actually be achieved and the stories to actually happen. So in the interim, we have this short-term memory, which is sort of holding the pattern just in place, waiting for the memory to be formed or for the information to be replaced. And that you can - you obviously know that happens a lot because when you sort of get up to go to the kitchen to get something, and then when you get there, you think, why am I in here now? - and then you have no - you can't remember why you came in there in the first place. All you know is that you're there now. And that's, like, an example of a short-term memory being sort of lost rather than - it's stored - despite the fact that you actually have acted on it already. GROSS: So I found this very interesting. You say in your book that there's evidence to suggest that nearly everything we experience is stored in long-term memory in some form. And here's why I find that interesting. This is the kind of thing that happens to me a lot. Like, one of our producers will come up to me and say, do you know that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah? And then I'll say, in all honesty, that sounds familiar. I don't know if I know that. (LAUGHTER)BURNETT: Yeah. GROSS: And as my producer starts explaining, I slowly start to remember that yeah, I did know that. And I realize that I once knew this thing. Then I'd forgotten it. But there's still some kind of vague imprint of that memory in my mind. And the more I hear about it, the more the memory starts to resurface. Is that what you're talking about? BURNETT: Yeah, that's quite a lot of evidence to suggest that there is different types of memory - something called familiarity and the difference between that and recall - 'cause with familiarity, it's like you say you know you know something. But you don't have any more information than that. All you know is that this has been encountered previously. GROSS: Yes (laughter). BURNETT: Yeah. So again, like, using the computer analogy - if you do a Google search, and then some things pop up and some of them are, like, already purple, it's - oh, I've been to that site before. You don't know what that site has on it. You don't know what it was for. It could be something dodgy. Maybe you were drunk at the time. I don't know. But you just know that you've been there before. But it's when you actually open, like, the file or open the store that you actually understand what's going on in there. So it's the same - like the name thing again - or, like, when you meet someone and they have a very familiar face. You think, I know this person. I know - why do I know them? And then they'll tell you some details and then fill in, say a few more things. And they'll say something. And you go, oh, yes. That's why - because at that point, there's enough familiarities occurred to sort of reach the threshold - the recall threshold - where it's not just knowing you have the memory. Now the memory itself is actually activated. And it all comes flooding back. It's a very strange sensation of, like - oh, yes. And I remember all that. And they all - the actual memory itself is triggered 'cause enough familiarity happened. So the activity leading to that memory has gone past a certain point. And the whole thing is set off. And we have, like, the vivid experiences coming back to you. Oh, yes. I met him here. And then we did that. And that was 10 years ago - and so on, so on, so on. So there are lots of - the brain has a good sort of rule of thumb for new and old. Like, that's a new thing. That's an old thing. That's a new thing. That's an old thing - because when you actually need the detail information itself, that's when you need to trigger the recall threshold, for want of a better description. GROSS: OK. So the downside for me is I have a lot of memories that I will only remember if somebody tells me that information again. And then it'll start to surface. So on the downside, I've forgotten that memory. But on the positive side, once I hear it the second time, I think I'm more likely to remember it and keep it as a more permanent memory. Am I deluding myself or is that neurologically probable? BURNETT: No. That makes perfect sense because we remember certain things and not other things. And that's sort of a constant problem because we'd like to remember the things - like if you're revising for a test or an exam. That's the stuff you want to remember. But abstract information, which is just like intangible data - that isn't something the brain has really evolved to process. It can do it. But it's not its preferred form of information. It's more about experiences and things with a strong emotional attachment - any emotionally vivid memories like your first bike, you know, your first date with your partner, your wedding day. These are all things which have strong emotional resonance. So they have a lot more attachments in the brain. Like, every single memory has lots of different links to it. So there are lots of different ways to trigger it. So if you have, like, an old memory which you don't actually - haven't really thought about. That's fair enough. So it's got a limited amount of connections to make it accessible. But then when you - no - are reminded of it by talking to a person, you go, oh, yes. So then it all comes flooding back. That's a new sensation. That's - now you associate that memory with this experience of not being able to remember something and then remembering the person, then being happy that you remembered them. So, you know, you're forming lots of new connections to it. So that actually does make perfect sense in that the act of having a sudden, vivid recollection would, in fact, increase the likelihood that the memory will be more a bit more resilient from then on. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is neurologist Dean Burnett. He's the author of the new book \"Idiot Brain: What Your Head Is Really Up To. \" Let's take a short break. And then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is neurologist Dean Burnett, author of the new book \"Idiot Brain. \" He's based at the University of Cardiff Centre for Medical Education, and he's a lecturer in psychiatry and writes a blog for The Guardian called \"Brain Flapping. \"So it's summertime, which means a lot of people are going on vacation, and a lot of those vacationers are going to be driving, many of them with children in the car. And I think children are especially prone to motion sickness. You have a very interesting explanation for why we can get motion sickness in a moving vehicle. BURNETT: Yes. It's one of those things which people - it's such a common thing, I think a lot of people don't give it much thought. But when you think about it, moving shouldn't make us sick. We move around all the time. We're a very mobile species. So why - you know, why would moving suddenly make us want to throw up? And one theory is - and that's the most salient theory at the moment - is that it's caused by a sensory confusion in the brain and that when you're walking - you know, like us humans tend to do a lot - there's a lot of distinct signals being relayed to the brain that can - like the thalamus, where all the sensory information is put together and sort of, you know, fed to the other parts of the brain. So when you're walking, you've got this, oh, the left, right, up, down sort of sensation. You've got the muscular system doing its thing and relaying all the signals to the brain. And you've also got the balance sensors in your ears, like, little tiny little tubes full of fluid. And the motion of that fluid tells us where we're going. So, like, if we're upside down, we can tell. And if we're going fast, we can tell because this fluid just obeys the laws of physics. And also, you've got your eyes, and the world's going past at a certain rate. All these things are sensory information which is fed into the, like, the thalamus area, which integrates all the sensory information together to give us an opinion or give us a view of what's happening in the world around us. So we think, oh, well I moving. This is good. That's what I should be doing. Excellent, all is well. When you're in a vehicle - and vehicles aren't something we've really evolved to deal with because, obviously, they're a very, very recent addition to the world, and evolution takes a long time to catch up with anything. So when we're in a vehicle like a car or a train or a ship especially, you're not actually physically moving. Your body is still. You're sat down. Like, say you've got no signals from the muscles saying we are moving right now. Your muscles are saying we are stationary. And also your eyes - if you are sitting in a ship, like, you're looking at a static environment, so there's no information for the eyes to say we are moving. It's just, oh, everything is still. But the fluids in your ears, they obey the laws of physics. And they are sort of rocking and around and sloshing because you are actually moving. So what's happening there is the brain's getting mixed messages. It's getting signals from the muscles and the eyes saying we are still and signals from the balance sensors saying we're in motion. Both of these cannot be correct. There's a sensory mismatch there. And in evolutionary terms, the only thing that can cause a sensory mismatch like that is a neurotoxin or poison. So the brain thinks, essentially, it's been being poisoned. When it's been poisoned, the first thing it does is get rid of the poison, aka throwing up. And as a result - so, like, as soon as the brain gets confused by anything like that, it says, oh, I don't know what to do, so just be sick, just in case. And as a result, we get motion sickness because of the brain's constantly worried about being poisoned. GROSS: Oh, and it is so incredibly not helpful - not your explanation, but. . . (LAUGHTER)GROSS: . . . The sickness. BURNETT: No, it's. . . GROSS: So. . . . BURNETT: . . . Inconvenient to say the least. GROSS: So I think it's true that you're more likely to get motion sickness if you're reading in a moving vehicle, not an airplane? This is what I found to be true, just that queasy feeling. I know - like, when I was growing up, I could not read in a car. I could not read in a bus. But I could read in a train, and I could read in a plane. BURNETT: Is that a Dr. Seuss book? GROSS: (Laughter) Yes, yes it is. BURNETT: (Laughter) Could you, could you, on a plane? Could you, could you in a train? GROSS: (Laughter) So is there any - I'm assuming that this is a common experience, and it's not just me. But perhaps it's just me. BURNETT: Well, it makes - again, given the explanation I provide, that does make perfect sense because you are - it's not just you're in the vehicle now. When you're reading a book, you are staring at something right in front of you, so you're shutting out a lot of external visual information. Now when you're in a car - a lot of people don't get motion sickness because the brain can effectively intuit this, though some people just are prone to it. It's just a quirk of development. But you - when you're in a car, you can look out the window. You can see things going by. You can see the passage and movement itself, so that sort of balances the system. The brain's going, oh, look, things moving - I must be moving - and then sort of calms down the sickness response. But when you're reading, you're looking at sort of a small, static square. And, you know, the external information which would say you're moving, that's shut out even more than it would otherwise be. And you're focusing straight ahead, and your vision's directed elsewhere. So it sort of increases the sensory mismatch, which is causing the sickness in the first place because you are sort of dead - you're looking at a fixed point. And you've got no visual information to try and help, you know, allay the brain's concerns. So yeah, that would make perfect sense. GROSS: So I think a lot of people outgrow motion sickness. And is that because your brain, over time, adjusts to the mixed message that it's getting when the vehicle is moving, but your body is staying still? BURNETT: That's probably what's happening, yeah? It's - children are - generally tend to be more prone to things like - which are involve, technically, the brain getting things wrong, things like sleepwalking. Children are far more prone to sleepwalking and things like that and motion sickness. That's because their brains are still developing. They're still being shored up. They're still being refined. They're still forming all the connections they will need for the rest of their lives. And - this means their systems aren't so efficient yet. So gradually and over time, they will sort of lose the excessive part. They'll refine the more useful components. And as a result, like, the more - the less helpful things the brain does will sort of be slowly fading away because the brain becomes a bit more focused and a bit more refined and efficient over time as we age. GROSS: So how much is intelligence based on having a good memory? Like, if you have a hard time remembering things you've learned, then you can't build on those things. You can't use those things to synthesize, you know, an analysis of, you know, a text or politics or whatever. So are memory and intelligence intertwined and dependent on each other? BURNETT: Yes, to a certain extent. A lot of psychologists differentiate between two types of intelligence. There's crystallized intelligence, which is like things you remember, things you've learned and the information you have access to. So someone on a quiz show, for example, would be - you know, someone who's a champion of a quiz show, they would have very high crystallized intelligence because they can just remember all this information, all these facts and recall them at a moment's notice as and when they need to. So that's a very high crystallized intelligence. But that's not the only element of intelligence. There's also something we call fluid intelligence. And that's the ability to apply the information, the ability to work with it, the ability to process it. So let's say Sherlock Holmes - like, he's presented with three different things. And he can go ah - put these things together. They show that the killer was there at midnight, and he had a brown dog. And that's more like fluid intelligence because taking abstract information and processing it and working with it and applying it to the situation in front of you - so crystallized intelligence is, like, the information you have. Fluid intelligence would be your ability to use that information and extrapolate from it and to apply it in real world situations. So the two are quite different in many ways. Like, fluid intelligence, a lot of research suggests, that declines as we get older just because our brains just age and become slightly less efficient over time with just general wear and tear, whereas crystallized intelligence doesn't seem to have any ceiling on it. It just keeps expanding as we get older, assuming, of course, our brains still keep working as they should and no new degeneration occurs. GROSS: I thought it was the other way around - that your ability to synthesize things does not decrease with age, but your ability to just kind of, like, memorize things and retrieve facts does. BURNETT: Well, a lot of people sort of claim that, yes. But a lot of the research suggests that it's actually the other way around in that you can - I think it's more a case of you can't stop remembering things. Like, you don't reach the age 65 and suddenly don't remember anything from that point on because, obviously, that's not what happens, unless you have some sort of serious disorder, of course. But, anyway, you can carry on building up information over time. When you're 80 years old, you remember what happened yesterday or the day before. And you remember way to go, and you remember your appointments. So you can still build on the crystallized intelligence. It's just that the parts which process information tend to get a bit rusty. So that - according to the science, that's one argument anyway. But as I say in the book a lot, with most neuroscience claims and studies, you'll find another one which says the opposite pretty easily because it's a very confusing organ. GROSS: Do you think of yourself as having a good memory? BURNETT: I think I would say that I do have a good memory, but not for everything because, like, the brain does seem to have a tendency to specialize or to have preferences for the things it likes to remember in its process. Some people are better at maths. Some people are better at music and things, whereas I, too, I guess, tend to have a good memory for episodes of \"The Simpsons\" or jokes I've heard or people I've met recently and, like, anecdotes. But things like household organization and bills to pay, I tend to have a rather poor memory for these things as my wife will constantly tell me. So yeah, I have good memory in some ways and not in others. GROSS: So you write a blog for The Guardian called \"Brain Flapping. \"BURNETT: Yeah. GROSS: What's the most commented on post that you've written? BURNETT: This - it came as a surprise the first time, but it shouldn't have in hindsight. I've written about a lot of things like trying to deal with some controversial subjects like transgender issues - that was quite a hot-button one and immigration, whether it's good or bad; and same-sex marriage got a lot of responses. But the most controversial post I did in terms of the most angry comments I got was whether or not you should put milk in your tea before the water or after. GROSS: (Laughter). BURNETT: That is such - it was the most British thing you'll ever hear, I know. But that is like - that was the most - even my parents got involved in that one, which they never normally do. GROSS: Wait. So what was your argument? BURNETT: Well, there's a study which says you should put milk in first, but that actually only applies to if you use it from a teapot in a sort of bone china cup because, obviously, it takes the heat off the tea so the cup doesn't fracture. But if you use a mug, then it's a different process, and it went down into the chemistry of it. And it came down to the fact that you should put it first or last, depends on how you like it because it's all about taste perception and the ritual and the psychology behind it. But that diplomatic copout wasn't enough for some people. They decided that I should hear, in no uncertain terms, how wrong I was. GROSS: So which do you do? BURNETT: Me, I put milk in second actually. But I might actually be kicked out of the country for this, but I can't tell either way. And that's not something a British person wants to hear. But yes, I'm not actually fussed either way. I can take it both ways. GROSS: Nice to know that tea is click bait in England. BURNETT: (Laughter) Very much so. GROSS: Dean Burnett, thank you so much for talking with us. BURNETT: No problem at all. Thank you very much for having me, Terry. GROSS: Dean Burnett is the author of the book \"Idiot Brain: What Your Head Is Really Up To. \" He writes the science blog \"Brain Flapping\" for the British newspaper The Guardian. After we take a short break, we'll hear from comic Ali Wong whose comedy special is frank and funny on subjects ranging from being Asian-American to her sex life and being pregnant. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. People often think of the brain as being like a computer. But according to my guest, neuroscientist Dean Burnett, that's only true if you imagine a computer that decided some information in its memory was more important than other information for reasons that were never made clear or a computer that filed information in a manner that didn't make any logical sense or a computer that kept opening your more personal and embarrassing files without being asked. Burnett is the author of the new book \"Idiot Brain: What Your Head Is Really Up To. \" It focuses on some of the more illogical behaviors the brain produces. He lives in Wales, where he's based at Cardiff University's Center for Medical Education and teaches in the psychiatry department. He writes the science blog \"Brain Flapping\" for the British newspaper The Guardian. Dean Burnett, welcome to FRESH AIR. DEAN BURNETT: Thank you for having me. GROSS: So in that analogy that you make between the brain and a computer, you say your brain would be like a computer that decided it didn't really like the information you'd stored. So the computer altered it for you - to suit your purposes, to suit your preferences. And you say your memory is egotistical - that the brain tweaks and adjusts the information it stores to make you look better. What's an example of what you mean there? BURNETT: Well, I think the classic example is like someone claiming they caught a fish this big, holding their arms out. And oh, the obvious joke is that they didn't really. That's actually just exaggeration. But all of you will think that's just someone lying to try and look better. But a lot of research suggests that we actually - whenever we remember something, we will tend to embellish if we're telling someone about it. We'll embellish it slightly to make us look a bit better. Or we'll make it a bit more impressive as a story. But every time you do that, the memory itself - it's got a good chance of itself being edited. It's being adjusted. So the actual underlying memory is replaced by this updated version that you have created to convey something which makes you look better. And that seems to be happening constantly - that we think back on things and we sort of interpret them in different ways to make us feel better about ourselves - make us feel more accomplished, more involved, more capable and more important than we actually were. Because our memory is the only record of it, that often goes unnoticed. GROSS: In writing about memory, you write about the difference between short-term memory and long-term memory. And short-term memory really doesn't hold very much. I mean, from how you describe it, it holds less than I even thought. BURNETT: Yeah. That's sort of one of those mainstream ideas of how memory is structured and works, which is not quite correct - in that short-term memory - you see a lot of films and, like, TV shows. They sort of portray short-term memory as something from an hour ago or, like, that same day. Where it's actually - short-term memory is 30 seconds to a minute. Anything longer than that tends to actually now be officially a long-term memory 'cause it takes the brain. . . GROSS: Whoa whoa whoa. Anything longer than a minute is officially long-term memory? BURNETT: Essentially, yes. GROSS: That means my long-term memory is worse than I thought (laughter). BURNETT: Yeah. It's a strange - 'cause short-term memory is essentially patterns of activity in places like the frontal cortex. It's like a firework display. Or, like, I liken it to writing - like writing a shopping list in the foam on your coffee. You can sort of do it. And it's something that'll stay legible for a minute. But generally, quickly, it'll fade away, whereas a long-term memory actually is, like, the neurons and the brain cells connecting together to form a new memory. But that takes time. That takes like 30 seconds to a minute for that to actually be achieved and the stories to actually happen. So in the interim, we have this short-term memory, which is sort of holding the pattern just in place, waiting for the memory to be formed or for the information to be replaced. And that you can - you obviously know that happens a lot because when you sort of get up to go to the kitchen to get something, and then when you get there, you think, why am I in here now? - and then you have no - you can't remember why you came in there in the first place. All you know is that you're there now. And that's, like, an example of a short-term memory being sort of lost rather than - it's stored - despite the fact that you actually have acted on it already. GROSS: So I found this very interesting. You say in your book that there's evidence to suggest that nearly everything we experience is stored in long-term memory in some form. And here's why I find that interesting. This is the kind of thing that happens to me a lot. Like, one of our producers will come up to me and say, do you know that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah? And then I'll say, in all honesty, that sounds familiar. I don't know if I know that. (LAUGHTER) BURNETT: Yeah. GROSS: And as my producer starts explaining, I slowly start to remember that yeah, I did know that. And I realize that I once knew this thing. Then I'd forgotten it. But there's still some kind of vague imprint of that memory in my mind. And the more I hear about it, the more the memory starts to resurface. Is that what you're talking about? BURNETT: Yeah, that's quite a lot of evidence to suggest that there is different types of memory - something called familiarity and the difference between that and recall - 'cause with familiarity, it's like you say you know you know something. But you don't have any more information than that. All you know is that this has been encountered previously. GROSS: Yes (laughter). BURNETT: Yeah. So again, like, using the computer analogy - if you do a Google search, and then some things pop up and some of them are, like, already purple, it's - oh, I've been to that site before. You don't know what that site has on it. You don't know what it was for. It could be something dodgy. Maybe you were drunk at the time. I don't know. But you just know that you've been there before. But it's when you actually open, like, the file or open the store that you actually understand what's going on in there. So it's the same - like the name thing again - or, like, when you meet someone and they have a very familiar face. You think, I know this person. I know - why do I know them? And then they'll tell you some details and then fill in, say a few more things. And they'll say something. And you go, oh, yes. That's why - because at that point, there's enough familiarities occurred to sort of reach the threshold - the recall threshold - where it's not just knowing you have the memory. Now the memory itself is actually activated. And it all comes flooding back. It's a very strange sensation of, like - oh, yes. And I remember all that. And they all - the actual memory itself is triggered 'cause enough familiarity happened. So the activity leading to that memory has gone past a certain point. And the whole thing is set off. And we have, like, the vivid experiences coming back to you. Oh, yes. I met him here. And then we did that. And that was 10 years ago - and so on, so on, so on. So there are lots of - the brain has a good sort of rule of thumb for new and old. Like, that's a new thing. That's an old thing. That's a new thing. That's an old thing - because when you actually need the detail information itself, that's when you need to trigger the recall threshold, for want of a better description. GROSS: OK. So the downside for me is I have a lot of memories that I will only remember if somebody tells me that information again. And then it'll start to surface. So on the downside, I've forgotten that memory. But on the positive side, once I hear it the second time, I think I'm more likely to remember it and keep it as a more permanent memory. Am I deluding myself or is that neurologically probable? BURNETT: No. That makes perfect sense because we remember certain things and not other things. And that's sort of a constant problem because we'd like to remember the things - like if you're revising for a test or an exam. That's the stuff you want to remember. But abstract information, which is just like intangible data - that isn't something the brain has really evolved to process. It can do it. But it's not its preferred form of information. It's more about experiences and things with a strong emotional attachment - any emotionally vivid memories like your first bike, you know, your first date with your partner, your wedding day. These are all things which have strong emotional resonance. So they have a lot more attachments in the brain. Like, every single memory has lots of different links to it. So there are lots of different ways to trigger it. So if you have, like, an old memory which you don't actually - haven't really thought about. That's fair enough. So it's got a limited amount of connections to make it accessible. But then when you - no - are reminded of it by talking to a person, you go, oh, yes. So then it all comes flooding back. That's a new sensation. That's - now you associate that memory with this experience of not being able to remember something and then remembering the person, then being happy that you remembered them. So, you know, you're forming lots of new connections to it. So that actually does make perfect sense in that the act of having a sudden, vivid recollection would, in fact, increase the likelihood that the memory will be more a bit more resilient from then on. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is neurologist Dean Burnett. He's the author of the new book \"Idiot Brain: What Your Head Is Really Up To. \" Let's take a short break. And then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is neurologist Dean Burnett, author of the new book \"Idiot Brain. \" He's based at the University of Cardiff Centre for Medical Education, and he's a lecturer in psychiatry and writes a blog for The Guardian called \"Brain Flapping. \" So it's summertime, which means a lot of people are going on vacation, and a lot of those vacationers are going to be driving, many of them with children in the car. And I think children are especially prone to motion sickness. You have a very interesting explanation for why we can get motion sickness in a moving vehicle. BURNETT: Yes. It's one of those things which people - it's such a common thing, I think a lot of people don't give it much thought. But when you think about it, moving shouldn't make us sick. We move around all the time. We're a very mobile species. So why - you know, why would moving suddenly make us want to throw up? And one theory is - and that's the most salient theory at the moment - is that it's caused by a sensory confusion in the brain and that when you're walking - you know, like us humans tend to do a lot - there's a lot of distinct signals being relayed to the brain that can - like the thalamus, where all the sensory information is put together and sort of, you know, fed to the other parts of the brain. So when you're walking, you've got this, oh, the left, right, up, down sort of sensation. You've got the muscular system doing its thing and relaying all the signals to the brain. And you've also got the balance sensors in your ears, like, little tiny little tubes full of fluid. And the motion of that fluid tells us where we're going. So, like, if we're upside down, we can tell. And if we're going fast, we can tell because this fluid just obeys the laws of physics. And also, you've got your eyes, and the world's going past at a certain rate. All these things are sensory information which is fed into the, like, the thalamus area, which integrates all the sensory information together to give us an opinion or give us a view of what's happening in the world around us. So we think, oh, well I moving. This is good. That's what I should be doing. Excellent, all is well. When you're in a vehicle - and vehicles aren't something we've really evolved to deal with because, obviously, they're a very, very recent addition to the world, and evolution takes a long time to catch up with anything. So when we're in a vehicle like a car or a train or a ship especially, you're not actually physically moving. Your body is still. You're sat down. Like, say you've got no signals from the muscles saying we are moving right now. Your muscles are saying we are stationary. And also your eyes - if you are sitting in a ship, like, you're looking at a static environment, so there's no information for the eyes to say we are moving. It's just, oh, everything is still. But the fluids in your ears, they obey the laws of physics. And they are sort of rocking and around and sloshing because you are actually moving. So what's happening there is the brain's getting mixed messages. It's getting signals from the muscles and the eyes saying we are still and signals from the balance sensors saying we're in motion. Both of these cannot be correct. There's a sensory mismatch there. And in evolutionary terms, the only thing that can cause a sensory mismatch like that is a neurotoxin or poison. So the brain thinks, essentially, it's been being poisoned. When it's been poisoned, the first thing it does is get rid of the poison, aka throwing up. And as a result - so, like, as soon as the brain gets confused by anything like that, it says, oh, I don't know what to do, so just be sick, just in case. And as a result, we get motion sickness because of the brain's constantly worried about being poisoned. GROSS: Oh, and it is so incredibly not helpful - not your explanation, but. . . (LAUGHTER) GROSS: . . . The sickness. BURNETT: No, it's. . . GROSS: So. . . . BURNETT: . . . Inconvenient to say the least. GROSS: So I think it's true that you're more likely to get motion sickness if you're reading in a moving vehicle, not an airplane? This is what I found to be true, just that queasy feeling. I know - like, when I was growing up, I could not read in a car. I could not read in a bus. But I could read in a train, and I could read in a plane. BURNETT: Is that a Dr. Seuss book? GROSS: (Laughter) Yes, yes it is. BURNETT: (Laughter) Could you, could you, on a plane? Could you, could you in a train? GROSS: (Laughter) So is there any - I'm assuming that this is a common experience, and it's not just me. But perhaps it's just me. BURNETT: Well, it makes - again, given the explanation I provide, that does make perfect sense because you are - it's not just you're in the vehicle now. When you're reading a book, you are staring at something right in front of you, so you're shutting out a lot of external visual information. Now when you're in a car - a lot of people don't get motion sickness because the brain can effectively intuit this, though some people just are prone to it. It's just a quirk of development.

So it sort of increases the sensory mismatch, which is causing the sickness in the first place because you are sort of dead - you're looking at a fixed point.

You can't use those things to synthesize, you know, an analysis of, you know, a text or politics or whatever. So are memory and intelligence intertwined and dependent on each other? BURNETT: Yes, to a certain extent. A lot of psychologists differentiate between two types of intelligence.

So that's a very high crystallized intelligence. But that's not the only element of intelligence. There's also something we call fluid intelligence. And that's the ability to apply the information, the ability to work with it, the ability to process it. So let's say Sherlock Holmes - like, he's presented with three different things.

And we're here to talk about this with NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam, who is a parent himself. Hi, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So parents have trouble practicing what they preach? VEDANTAM: Absolutely right, David. I was talking to Anya Samek. She used to be at the University of Wisconsin when I talked to her. She's now at the University of Southern California. She ran some very interesting experiments involving parents. She had volunteers who are parents come in to play a game. Each volunteer was told to toss two coins. If both came down the same way, so let's say heads, the volunteer got a prize. Here was the catch. No one monitored how the coins actually landed. So volunteers were free to report that they had succeeded and got the prize. The law of probability predicts only 25 percent of the volunteers should have had two coins come down the same way. But here's Samek. ANYA SAMEK: We actually find that people cheat a lot. So we expect 25 percent of the time people will win. They actually win 40 percent of the time. GREENE: So does that mean 15 percent of these parents were just outright lying? VEDANTAM: That's exactly right. Now, here's the interesting thing. Samek and her co-authors Daniel Houser, John List, Marco Piovesan, and Joe (ph) Winter sometimes had the parents play the game with their kids present. They find that parents cheat less when they're playing the game with their kids. So presumably. . . GREENE: That's great. VEDANTAM: . . . They're trying to set a good example for their kids by not cheating. But here's the interesting thing, David. The gender of the child who was with the parent made a big difference. Here's what Samek found. SAMEK: We actually see that the entire effect of parents acting more honestly when a child is in the room is driven by daughters. So parents seek to model honest behavior to their daughters but not to their sons. GREENE: What? What is happening there? Why are they trying to be better role models for daughters and not their sons? VEDANTAM: Well, it's not clear. It's possible that parents believe, and there's actually some research to back this up, that women are held to higher ethical standards than men. I actually did a story about this for All Things Considered some time ago. So it's possible they are offering guidance to their children based on the societal double standard when it comes to men and women. One really interesting thing that Samek and her colleagues find, David, is that parents are also more likely to cheat when they're alone and when they feel that children are going to be the beneficiaries of their cheating. And there's been other work to back up this idea. When we can tell ourselves that lying and cheating are really forms of love and altruism, it makes it easier for us to practice deception. GREENE: That's amazing. And how many kids do you have, Shankar? VEDANTAM: Just one and I'm a wonderful role model. GREENE: A daughter? VEDANTAM: Yes. GREENE: Yes, and you're a wonderful role model. And if you had a son, you would be as well. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). GREENE: Thanks, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Thank you, David.

(SOUNDBITE OF LEO ARNAUD'S \"BUGLER'S DREAM\")VEDANTAM: The pageantry, the dreams, breathtaking victories - for fans, it's an event of extraordinary drama - athletes from across the globe competing at the very highest level, at the limits of human endurance. Social scientists find the games equally compelling for what they reveal about human behavior. DAVID MATSUMOTO: When a match ends, the winners and losers do something. That's immediate, automatic. It's unconscious. They have no control of it. It just happens. About a second later, then they come to their senses, and they realize that they're on stage. And whatever rules they've learned to manage their expressions kick in then. VEDANTAM: Coming up, what the Olympics can teach us about human behavior from a professor who's also an Olympic judo coach. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: My guest today is David Matsumoto. He's a professor of psychology at San Francisco State University. He's used the Olympics as a laboratory for psychological observations. But he's also been a part of the Olympics. David's coached the U. S. Olympic judo team, and his daughter has competed in the games. I'm going to talk to him today, first about his research and then about what a sharp-eyed psychologist might observe about human behavior at the Games. David, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. MATSUMOTO: Thank you so much for having me. VEDANTAM: You photographed 84 athletes from 34 countries who were competing in the 2004 Athens Olympics judo competitions. And you photographed them at the moments when they won or lost their matches. What did you find? MATSUMOTO: Well, what you find is that people all around the world show exactly the same types of expressions depending upon whether they won or lost. So those who won a match or won a medal, for example, invariably showed some kind of enjoyment smile. And those who lost the last match showed nothing sometimes. Some of them showed sadness. Some of them showed some kind of distress. But the interesting thing about these findings is that those patterns vary depending upon whether they won or lost, but did not vary across any of the countries or cultures that the athletes came from. VEDANTAM: Now, most laypeople would not necessarily be surprised by this. They would sort of say yeah, sure, people win. They sort of look the same. But why is this interesting from a scientific perspective? MATSUMOTO: Well, it's interesting because - actually, before our study, there were many, many studies that have shown that similar types of patterns of findings, cross-cultural similarities in these expressions. But there was never a study that was done in what we call an ecologically valid environment - out in the real world - to show that people actually do this stuff in the real world outside of a psychology laboratory. And I was just very, very fortunate to be able to do this study at the Olympics, which is a perfect social-psychological laboratory. VEDANTAM: In some ways, the study was basically making the argument, I suppose, that, at least in the moment of triumph, people's reactions were shaped by what seemed like biologically innate imperatives. MATSUMOTO: Yeah, that's exactly right. However, that study by itself fell a little short. So in actuality, we had the second study, which studied the Paralympic athletes. And in - every sport in the Paralympics has a different disability. For judo, it's blindness. And so we compared the expressions of the blind athletes to those of the sighted athletes, and we found exactly the same things. VEDANTAM: So these are athletes who've been blind, some of them, presumably, blind from birth. They presumably haven't really. . . MATSUMOTO: Let's make it even clearer than that. We had athletes who are congenitally blind, so blind from birth. There's no presumption about what they've seen. They've been impossible to see those expressions. And the fact that they produce the same things on their faces for certain emotions and then in their bodies for triumph absolutely suggests that these things are biologically innate. VEDANTAM: What did the facial expression of triumph look like? MATSUMOTO: Well, triumph is actually a whole-body response and involves the expansion of the chest, raising the hands, oftentimes with a fist, a little bit of fierce or aggressive look in the face and oftentimes a stern gaze at some kind of target. VEDANTAM: Now, one of the things you found, which I found really fascinating, was yes, you do find evidence that some of these expressions are biologically innate. But you also find that culture plays a huge role at the Olympics. Tell me about that part of the study. MATSUMOTO: What we did was study the expressions across time. So even though we were using a camera, we were using a camera that was shooting eight photographs a second. And so across a number of seconds, we can see how expressions transform across time. So immediately when a match ends, the winners and losers do something. That's immediate, automatic. It's unconscious. They have no control of it. It just happens. About a second later, then they come to their senses, and they realize that they're on stage. And whatever rules they've learned to manage their expressions kick in then. And it's that second expression or third expression, sometimes, where you see these vast cultural differences. Some athletes are smiling. Some athletes show nothing. Some athletes start crying. Some athletes do something else. But it's very interesting how you see the change at that point but cultural invariance at the beginning. VEDANTAM: You find that, even though you have this range of emotions that kicks in after the first second or the first couple of seconds, these are not random. These actually are, in some ways, culturally determined - that you actually find athletes from certain countries behave predictably differently than athletes from other countries. MATSUMOTO: Yes. We were able to identify the various patterns of that cultural variation later on. So there are the neutralizers, those who kind of show nothing. As stereotypes, you can think of eastern Soviet bloc - or old Soviet bloc countries, Eastern Europe, those who have some communist history in them - Cuba, for example - are like that. You can think of the deamplifiers (ph), those who show something but it's muted a little bit. There are a lot of North American, Western kind of cultures that do that. There's those that smile a lot after something, even those that are - have something negative. You can think of the East Asians as something like that. So yes, there are these very interesting cultural, geographic variations in how the major patterns go in the cultural regulation. VEDANTAM: So in other words, people express what really maybe is happening inside them. But then, the culture kicks in and says here's the way you ought to behave. . . MATSUMOTO: Yes. VEDANTAM: . . . In this situation. MATSUMOTO: That's exactly what it is. And that - and the reason why most of us don't see that immediate reaction is because when something happens, we're often looking at the thing that happened. So by the time we look at the person who it happened to, they're already on the cultural regulation part. And it's people like us, who have a camera on that person all the time, who are watching the immediate reactions who can get the immediate reaction. VEDANTAM: One of the most celebrated studies looking at the Olympics - we've featured it elsewhere on HIDDEN BRAIN - this is a study by Thomas Gilovich at Cornell along with Victoria Medvec and Scott Madey. He analyzed the expressions on the faces of medal winners in the Barcelona Olympics. And he found that, in general, bronze-medal winners looked happier than silver-medal winners. I'm going to let you tell me why that might be the case, but also how your own research both amplified and has a nuance to that finding. MATSUMOTO: Well, we found exactly the same things. Actually, one of the great things about our study is that, not only were we able to study the expressions of the athletes right when they won or lost - right when they're on the mat - we could follow them 30 minutes later in the medal ceremony. So we saw what the same person did who had the same result. But it's - now the social context is different. And you're exactly right, the silver medalist - everybody on the podium smiles, so there's no question about it because this is a very public, televised thing. But if you measure the exact muscles that are moving in the smiles, you'll find that - let's call the silver-medal smiles more of the miserable smile. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). MATSUMOTO: . . . Because they've got a lot of other things going on. You can see the - you won't see the crinkle in the eyes. Sometimes, you'll see there's a downturning of the lips because they're really trying to control some negative feelings along with a smile. So some of them looked miserable when they're smiling. VEDANTAM: And Gilovich would argue this is because the silver-medal winners are comparing themselves to the gold-medal winners. . . MATSUMOTO: Exactly. VEDANTAM: . . . And saying if I only had gone half a second faster - if I'd only jumped a little bit faster, I could have been - I could be a gold-medal winner. MATSUMOTO: That's exactly right. And so the - when you get to the bronze medalists, they have more reason to be happier because the alternative is nothing, whereas a silver medalist. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). MATSUMOTO: . . . The alternative was the gold. And so, in our study, we also found that the bronze medalists had more of the enjoyment smiles than the silver medalists did. The only exceptions that we found to this bronze medalist thing that I thought was really interesting when I looked back at her data, there are some bronze medalists who did not look very happy. And these were generally the winners of the world championships of the previous year who came into the Olympics as the favorite, and they had to settle for a bronze. So because they had to settle for bronze, they were not as happy as those who are getting a bronze and they - you know, a lot of them didn't expect to get a medal, or they were just happy to get a medal. VEDANTAM: Fascinating. When we come back, I'm going to ask David about his own experience at the Olympics and what a psychologist might learn from being a coach and being a parent of an Olympian. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHRIS BENDEREV, BYLINE: Hi, I'm Chris Benderev, one of the producers of HIDDEN BRAIN. Here's a great way to listen to our show, NPR One. It's an app for your phone, kind of like Pandora but for public radio. It's full of news and stories from your favorite podcasters, NPR and the local station that you call your own. Whenever you're ready to listen, NPR One has something great just for you. Find it on your app store, NPR O-N-E. All right, now back to Shankar's interview with psychology professor David Matsumoto on the science behind Olympic athletes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Give me some sense of the scale of what's happening in an athlete on the judo mat in the Olympics. I mean, physiologically, what's happening to them? MATSUMOTO: I'll tell you exactly what's happening because we've actually studied this kind of thing. You know, if you and I are sitting down here right now having this conversation, if we clocked our heart rate, for healthy and normal, we're probably both 60, 72, something like that. Since we're doing something that's really exciting right now, maybe we're at 80 or something. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). MATSUMOTO: If you imagine yourself taking a jog, you might be at 70 percent of your max heart rate, which would maybe be at 130, 140, depending upon your age. In a judo match, we've actually clocked athletes heart rates around 200 beats a minute. VEDANTAM: Wow. And these are highly conditioned athletes. MATSUMOTO: Highly - you've got to be highly conditioned to be at 200 beats a minute. And this is 200 beats a minute in combat conditions. Now, think about what I'm saying. You're going to be at 200 beats a minute in combat conditions, thinking clearly, being on your game, knowing exactly what you're doing technically, strategically and everything else. To get to that point, it's not easy. It's nothing that we can sit around and talk about. It's nothing that I can really sit here and kind of help you like a traditional psychologist would. To tell you the truth, I've got to get you to be really physical. And I've got to train your body to tolerate the lactic acid that your body generates as I get you to that profile. VEDANTAM: How do you get athletes, as a coach, to actually keep thinking when their bodies are in the state of hyperarousal? MATSUMOTO: Well, first of all, you have to get them to be used to that state of hyperarousal. So there's a long period of time - I mean, we're talking - it'll takes several years of what we call periodized training to get an athlete to be at peak physical condition. Once you're there or along the way you're there, what you can do is then add in some drills - cognitive drills - for athletes to do once they're at that level. So, for example, I can create a situation where I'll get an athlete's heart rate up to 200. You know, it's not easy. It's not fun. You don't want to be that person. But once you're there, I can have you do a crossword puzzle. All right. One of the things that we used to do is we used to have people run around a track sprinting the 800 meters around the track. And once they come off the track, untie these humongous ropes with knots in them which is entirely frustrating to do. But, you know, you've got to deal with the frustration when your heart is going at 200 beats a minute to do this little complex cognition task. VEDANTAM: One of the things that I find so fascinating is that so much of the Olympics actually happens out of sight of the TV cameras. So athletes have to get ready. They have to warm up. In fact, just getting to your competition itself can be a struggle, especially if you're competing on Day One. MATSUMOTO: Well, you're exactly right because most of the public who watch these sports, who are great, by the way - we wouldn't be here without our fans. But most of the public just turns on the TV and can see this peak performance. And competition really is maybe the third thing that the athletes are worrying about. Maybe it's the main thing, but it's always the third thing. The first thing that we're always worrying about - No. 1 is making weight because in Judo, you've got a weight division. And so - and everyone is - we call it walking-around weight. Everyone's walking-around weight is heavier than what their weight division is. So you've got to be on a program to cut down to a certain amount right before you're weighing in. Then you - everyone's got a routine to cut to weigh in. And it's not fun cutting weight, and it's not fun being with 20 people who are starving themselves. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). MATSUMOTO: And if you have to be in starvation mode for a week, 10 days, whatever that is, it's a miserable experience. Now, some people do that better than others, but it's not the thing that you think that you want to be doing with your life (unintelligible) most of the time. VEDANTAM: So that's the first thing that the athlete's thinking about. What's the second? MATSUMOTO: The second thing is jetlag. So if the Olympics are in Rio, and if you're coming from where I live, which is San Francisco, you're four hours away. And so you have to think about the four-hour difference. If the Olympics were in Athens, like they were in 2004, now we're talking about a 10-hour difference. Olympics are going to be in Tokyo in 2020. And now we're talking about a nine-hour difference the other way if you're in San Francisco. And these are big differences because if you're talking about peak performance, you want people to be rested well, fed well, in peak mental condition. And it's especially difficult if you're competing on day one. And you want to be in the opening ceremonies. And the thing that people don't know about the opening ceremonies is it usually ends at around midnight wherever the host country is. And everyone's got to get on a bus that the local committee sets up. And it's just chaos. It's just a zoo. So many athletes get lost. Buses don't know where to go. And so you might get on your bus at 12 o'clock. And you might be back in the village at 3 a. m. And you might have a 6 a. m. weigh-in time. And so, obviously, if you did that, it kind of screws you up for that competition. VEDANTAM: It turns out that flying east and flying west to get to the games is not the same thing - that in some ways, it's better for the human body if you happen to be flying in one direction, rather than the other. MATSUMOTO: Yes. In fact, it's easier to go in one direction, rather than another, because our bodies are built to function better on a 25-hour cycle than a 24-hour cycle. VEDANTAM: Huh. MATSUMOTO: That's why it's easier for us to stay up longer than it is to get up earlier. And how that translates to travel is - when we travel west, our time zones are getting later. So we're. . . VEDANTAM: You just have to stay up a little bit later. MATSUMOTO: You just have to stay up a little later. And that's easier. When we travel east - like, I came from San Francisco, and here I am in D. C. now - that's a three-hour time zone. So this morning I had to be at a certain place at 7 o'clock, which is 4 o'clock my time, which means I have to get up at 3 o'clock my time, which is more difficult. So yes, we take these kinds of factors into account. VEDANTAM: You know, I think when people think about the Olympics who haven't been there, it seems very glamorous, very fun. You know, you're on this world stage. Everyone's watching you. Everyone's cheering for you. Everyone's hoping that you do well. And they clap for you when you succeed. And you're at peak performance. And it seems like it's sort of a glorious time in your life and the life of, you know, the coaching staff and so on. Is that how it actually feels when you're there? MATSUMOTO: Well, I can't speak for everybody else. I got to say that I never felt that glorious times in the four Olympics and the 12 world championships that I've been to because as a coaching staff member, first of all, you're not done with your feelings until everyone's done competing. And unfortunately, I never had the situation where everyone on my team got a gold medal. And if that happened, then, I think, after the competition, everything is glorious. But no matter how good our team did, whether it's my local team or the Olympic team or whatever team you're talking about, if there's one person that didn't make it - you know, if there's one person that didn't get what they wanted - I felt it. I could have nine players take a gold. And one person took a silver. Of course, I'm happy. But it lingers for me. I think that's true for a lot of people. And I'll give you a good example of this. When my daughter made the Olympic team in 2008, at the Olympic trials, her competitor in the finals was another woman from my dojo. And so as a judo instructor, you have two of your players in the finals of the Olympic trials. You know, you're golden because no matter who wins, someone from your dojo is going to go and be on the Olympic team. VEDANTAM: So one of the competitors is your daughter. MATSUMOTO: One of them is my daughter. And the other one is my student who I treat like a daughter. And on top of that, when we're in competition, I don't have a daughter. I have a player. You know, and my daughter knew that. And we all knew that. And I treated my daughter like anybody else in competition or after competition. She - you know, she's my daughter. But when we're in competition, she's another player. And I got to treat her like I treat everybody else. And so anyway, we have these two players coming up. And I have mixed feelings about that. You know, when my daughter won, I was happy for her. But I was very sad for my other player who lost. So after that, it was a very bittersweet thing to have occurred. And yeah, I mean, I don't want to take anything from my daughter as a parent. If I could compartmentalize my feeling as - solely as a parent - yeah, great. I'm happy. But no one can compartmentalize 100 percent. Or I couldn't. And so as a parent, I felt good. As an instructor, I felt good and bad. And it's mixed-up feelings that one had. And I still have it to this day. I remember it very clearly right now. VEDANTAM: When you watch the Olympics now - and let's say you're not at the Olympics. Let's say you're not going to - are you going to Rio? MATSUMOTO: No. VEDANTAM: OK. So when you watch the Olympics on television now, what is it that you're watching? What is it that you pay attention to, knowing all that you know as a psychologist who studied the Olympics, as a coach who's coached at the Olympics, as a parent at the Olympics? What do you look for now? MATSUMOTO: I look at a lot of things, to tell you the truth. And when I see peak performance of any type - doesn't have to be sports. Even when I look at dancers or somebody who's really good at doing something that's difficult to do, they make it look so easy. And I automatically think about the sweat and the tears and the blood and the effort for years that that person put in to be able to do that - that we saw that was just effortless. When you're at competition, you're talking about, you know, a few minutes, an hour, of years of preparation. And you can't divorce your memories from those years of preparation. Those things overwhelm me, actually. VEDANTAM: And so when you're thinking about the athletes, you're actually thinking about all of those - the times that we're not seeing on television - all of the waking up at 4 o'clock in the morning and practicing on the weekends and giving up other aspects of your life - and not just for the people who win but also for everybody else who is there. MATSUMOTO: Absolutely. I mean, everyone's made a huge sacrifice. And of course, the player or the athlete is always the No. 1 sacrificer. But think about all their support staff. For us, for every player that we had on the mat, we had a support team of 10 or 20 just to get that person on the mat. And so behind one person, there's an army. And everyone's on the same team. And they never share the limelight. They never get the spotlight. They just share in the knowledge that they help this person have a peak performance. And when that person wins, everyone feels good. And when that person loses, everyone feels awful. And it's all those people, as well as the athletes, that my heart actually reaches out to when I see these things.

He's used the Olympics as a laboratory for psychological observations. But he's also been a part of the Olympics. David's coached the U. S. Olympic judo team, and his daughter has competed in the games. I'm going to talk to him today, first about his research and then about what a sharp-eyed psychologist might observe about human behavior at the Games. David, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. MATSUMOTO: Thank you so much for having me. VEDANTAM: You photographed 84 athletes from 34 countries who were competing in the 2004 Athens Olympics judo competitions. And you photographed them at the moments when they won or lost their matches. What did you find? MATSUMOTO: Well, what you find is that people all around the world show exactly the same types of expressions depending upon whether they won or lost. So those who won a match or won a medal, for example, invariably showed some kind of enjoyment smile. And those who lost the last match showed nothing sometimes. Some of them showed sadness. Some of them showed some kind of distress. But the interesting thing about these findings is that those patterns vary depending upon whether they won or lost, but did not vary across any of the countries or cultures that the athletes came from. VEDANTAM: Now, most laypeople would not necessarily be surprised by this. They would sort of say yeah, sure, people win. They sort of look the same. But why is this interesting from a scientific perspective? MATSUMOTO: Well, it's interesting because - actually, before our study, there were many, many studies that have shown that similar types of patterns of findings, cross-cultural similarities in these expressions. But there was never a study that was done in what we call an ecologically valid environment - out in the real world - to show that people actually do this stuff in the real world outside of a psychology laboratory. And I was just very, very fortunate to be able to do this study at the Olympics, which is a perfect social-psychological laboratory. VEDANTAM: In some ways, the study was basically making the argument, I suppose, that, at least in the moment of triumph, people's reactions were shaped by what seemed like biologically innate imperatives. MATSUMOTO: Yeah, that's exactly right. However, that study by itself fell a little short. So in actuality, we had the second study, which studied the Paralympic athletes. And in - every sport in the Paralympics has a different disability. For judo, it's blindness. And so we compared the expressions of the blind athletes to those of the sighted athletes, and we found exactly the same things. VEDANTAM: So these are athletes who've been blind, some of them, presumably, blind from birth. They presumably haven't really. . . MATSUMOTO: Let's make it even clearer than that. We had athletes who are congenitally blind, so blind from birth. There's no presumption about what they've seen. They've been impossible to see those expressions. And the fact that they produce the same things on their faces for certain emotions and then in their bodies for triumph absolutely suggests that these things are biologically innate. VEDANTAM: What did the facial expression of triumph look like? MATSUMOTO: Well, triumph is actually a whole-body response and involves the expansion of the chest, raising the hands, oftentimes with a fist, a little bit of fierce or aggressive look in the face and oftentimes a stern gaze at some kind of target. VEDANTAM: Now, one of the things you found, which I found really fascinating, was yes, you do find evidence that some of these expressions are biologically innate. But you also find that culture plays a huge role at the Olympics. Tell me about that part of the study. MATSUMOTO: What we did was study the expressions across time. So even though we were using a camera, we were using a camera that was shooting eight photographs a second. And so across a number of seconds, we can see how expressions transform across time. So immediately when a match ends, the winners and losers do something. That's immediate, automatic. It's unconscious. They have no control of it. It just happens. About a second later, then they come to their senses, and they realize that they're on stage. And whatever rules they've learned to manage their expressions kick in then. And it's that second expression or third expression, sometimes, where you see these vast cultural differences. Some athletes are smiling. Some athletes show nothing. Some athletes start crying. Some athletes do something else. But it's very interesting how you see the change at that point but cultural invariance at the beginning. VEDANTAM: You find that, even though you have this range of emotions that kicks in after the first second or the first couple of seconds, these are not random. These actually are, in some ways, culturally determined - that you actually find athletes from certain countries behave predictably differently than athletes from other countries. MATSUMOTO: Yes. We were able to identify the various patterns of that cultural variation later on. So there are the neutralizers, those who kind of show nothing. As stereotypes, you can think of eastern Soviet bloc - or old Soviet bloc countries, Eastern Europe, those who have some communist history in them - Cuba, for example - are like that. You can think of the deamplifiers (ph), those who show something but it's muted a little bit. There are a lot of North American, Western kind of cultures that do that. There's those that smile a lot after something, even those that are - have something negative. You can think of the East Asians as something like that. So yes, there are these very interesting cultural, geographic variations in how the major patterns go in the cultural regulation. VEDANTAM: So in other words, people express what really maybe is happening inside them. But then, the culture kicks in and says here's the way you ought to behave. . . MATSUMOTO: Yes. VEDANTAM: . . . In this situation. MATSUMOTO: That's exactly what it is. And that - and the reason why most of us don't see that immediate reaction is because when something happens, we're often looking at the thing that happened. So by the time we look at the person who it happened to, they're already on the cultural regulation part. And it's people like us, who have a camera on that person all the time, who are watching the immediate reactions who can get the immediate reaction. VEDANTAM: One of the most celebrated studies looking at the Olympics - we've featured it elsewhere on HIDDEN BRAIN - this is a study by Thomas Gilovich at Cornell along with Victoria Medvec and Scott Madey. He analyzed the expressions on the faces of medal winners in the Barcelona Olympics. And he found that, in general, bronze-medal winners looked happier than silver-medal winners. I'm going to let you tell me why that might be the case, but also how your own research both amplified and has a nuance to that finding. MATSUMOTO: Well, we found exactly the same things. Actually, one of the great things about our study is that, not only were we able to study the expressions of the athletes right when they won or lost - right when they're on the mat - we could follow them 30 minutes later in the medal ceremony. So we saw what the same person did who had the same result. But it's - now the social context is different. And you're exactly right, the silver medalist - everybody on the podium smiles, so there's no question about it because this is a very public, televised thing. But if you measure the exact muscles that are moving in the smiles, you'll find that - let's call the silver-medal smiles more of the miserable smile. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). MATSUMOTO: . . . Because they've got a lot of other things going on. You can see the - you won't see the crinkle in the eyes. Sometimes, you'll see there's a downturning of the lips because they're really trying to control some negative feelings along with a smile. So some of them looked miserable when they're smiling. VEDANTAM: And Gilovich would argue this is because the silver-medal winners are comparing themselves to the gold-medal winners. . . MATSUMOTO: Exactly. VEDANTAM: . . . And saying if I only had gone half a second faster - if I'd only jumped a little bit faster, I could have been - I could be a gold-medal winner. MATSUMOTO: That's exactly right. And so the - when you get to the bronze medalists, they have more reason to be happier because the alternative is nothing, whereas a silver medalist. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). MATSUMOTO: . . . The alternative was the gold. And so, in our study, we also found that the bronze medalists had more of the enjoyment smiles than the silver medalists did. The only exceptions that we found to this bronze medalist thing that I thought was really interesting when I looked back at her data, there are some bronze medalists who did not look very happy. And these were generally the winners of the world championships of the previous year who came into the Olympics as the favorite, and they had to settle for a bronze. So because they had to settle for bronze, they were not as happy as those who are getting a bronze and they - you know, a lot of them didn't expect to get a medal, or they were just happy to get a medal. VEDANTAM: Fascinating. When we come back, I'm going to ask David about his own experience at the Olympics and what a psychologist might learn from being a coach and being a parent of an Olympian. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CHRIS BENDEREV, BYLINE: Hi, I'm Chris Benderev, one of the producers of HIDDEN BRAIN. Here's a great way to listen to our show, NPR One. It's an app for your phone, kind of like Pandora but for public radio. It's full of news and stories from your favorite podcasters, NPR and the local station that you call your own. Whenever you're ready to listen, NPR One has something great just for you. Find it on your app store, NPR O-N-E. All right, now back to Shankar's interview with psychology professor David Matsumoto on the science behind Olympic athletes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Give me some sense of the scale of what's happening in an athlete on the judo mat in the Olympics. I mean, physiologically, what's happening to them? MATSUMOTO: I'll tell you exactly what's happening because we've actually studied this kind of thing. You know, if you and I are sitting down here right now having this conversation, if we clocked our heart rate, for healthy and normal, we're probably both 60, 72, something like that. Since we're doing something that's really exciting right now, maybe we're at 80 or something. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). MATSUMOTO: If you imagine yourself taking a jog, you might be at 70 percent of your max heart rate, which would maybe be at 130, 140, depending upon your age. In a judo match, we've actually clocked athletes heart rates around 200 beats a minute. VEDANTAM: Wow. And these are highly conditioned athletes. MATSUMOTO: Highly - you've got to be highly conditioned to be at 200 beats a minute. And this is 200 beats a minute in combat conditions. Now, think about what I'm saying. You're going to be at 200 beats a minute in combat conditions, thinking clearly, being on your game, knowing exactly what you're doing technically, strategically and everything else. To get to that point, it's not easy. It's nothing that we can sit around and talk about. It's nothing that I can really sit here and kind of help you like a traditional psychologist would. To tell you the truth, I've got to get you to be really physical. And I've got to train your body to tolerate the lactic acid that your body generates as I get you to that profile. VEDANTAM: How do you get athletes, as a coach, to actually keep thinking when their bodies are in the state of hyperarousal? MATSUMOTO: Well, first of all, you have to get them to be used to that state of hyperarousal. So there's a long period of time - I mean, we're talking - it'll takes several years of what we call periodized training to get an athlete to be at peak physical condition. Once you're there or along the way you're there, what you can do is then add in some drills - cognitive drills - for athletes to do once they're at that level. So, for example, I can create a situation where I'll get an athlete's heart rate up to 200. You know, it's not easy. It's not fun. You don't want to be that person. But once you're there, I can have you do a crossword puzzle. All right. One of the things that we used to do is we used to have people run around a track sprinting the 800 meters around the track. And once they come off the track, untie these humongous ropes with knots in them which is entirely frustrating to do. But, you know, you've got to deal with the frustration when your heart is going at 200 beats a minute to do this little complex cognition task. VEDANTAM: One of the things that I find so fascinating is that so much of the Olympics actually happens out of sight of the TV cameras. So athletes have to get ready. They have to warm up. In fact, just getting to your competition itself can be a struggle, especially if you're competing on Day One. MATSUMOTO: Well, you're exactly right because most of the public who watch these sports, who are great, by the way - we wouldn't be here without our fans. But most of the public just turns on the TV and can see this peak performance. And competition really is maybe the third thing that the athletes are worrying about. Maybe it's the main thing, but it's always the third thing. The first thing that we're always worrying about - No. 1 is making weight because in Judo, you've got a weight division. And so - and everyone is - we call it walking-around weight. Everyone's walking-around weight is heavier than what their weight division is. So you've got to be on a program to cut down to a certain amount right before you're weighing in. Then you - everyone's got a routine to cut to weigh in. And it's not fun cutting weight, and it's not fun being with 20 people who are starving themselves. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). MATSUMOTO: And if you have to be in starvation mode for a week, 10 days, whatever that is, it's a miserable experience. Now, some people do that better than others, but it's not the thing that you think that you want to be doing with your life (unintelligible) most of the time. VEDANTAM: So that's the first thing that the athlete's thinking about. What's the second? MATSUMOTO: The second thing is jetlag. So if the Olympics are in Rio, and if you're coming from where I live, which is San Francisco, you're four hours away. And so you have to think about the four-hour difference. If the Olympics were in Athens, like they were in 2004, now we're talking about a 10-hour difference. Olympics are going to be in Tokyo in 2020. And now we're talking about a nine-hour difference the other way if you're in San Francisco. And these are big differences because if you're talking about peak performance, you want people to be rested well, fed well, in peak mental condition. And it's especially difficult if you're competing on day one. And you want to be in the opening ceremonies. And the thing that people don't know about the opening ceremonies is it usually ends at around midnight wherever the host country is. And everyone's got to get on a bus that the local committee sets up. And it's just chaos. It's just a zoo. So many athletes get lost. Buses don't know where to go. And so you might get on your bus at 12 o'clock. And you might be back in the village at 3 a. m. And you might have a 6 a. m. weigh-in time. And so, obviously, if you did that, it kind of screws you up for that competition. VEDANTAM: It turns out that flying east and flying west to get to the games is not the same thing - that in some ways, it's better for the human body if you happen to be flying in one direction, rather than the other. MATSUMOTO: Yes. In fact, it's easier to go in one direction, rather than another, because our bodies are built to function better on a 25-hour cycle than a 24-hour cycle. VEDANTAM: Huh. MATSUMOTO: That's why it's easier for us to stay up longer than it is to get up earlier. And how that translates to travel is - when we travel west, our time zones are getting later. So we're. . . VEDANTAM: You just have to stay up a little bit later. MATSUMOTO: You just have to stay up a little later. And that's easier. When we travel east - like, I came from San Francisco, and here I am in D. C. now - that's a three-hour time zone. So this morning I had to be at a certain place at 7 o'clock, which is 4 o'clock my time, which means I have to get up at 3 o'clock my time, which is more difficult. So yes, we take these kinds of factors into account. VEDANTAM: You know, I think when people think about the Olympics who haven't been there, it seems very glamorous, very fun. You know, you're on this world stage. Everyone's watching you. Everyone's cheering for you. Everyone's hoping that you do well. And they clap for you when you succeed. And you're at peak performance. And it seems like it's sort of a glorious time in your life and the life of, you know, the coaching staff and so on. Is that how it actually feels when you're there? MATSUMOTO: Well, I can't speak for everybody else. I got to say that I never felt that glorious times in the four Olympics and the 12 world championships that I've been to because as a coaching staff member, first of all, you're not done with your feelings until everyone's done competing. And unfortunately, I never had the situation where everyone on my team got a gold medal. And if that happened, then, I think, after the competition, everything is glorious. But no matter how good our team did, whether it's my local team or the Olympic team or whatever team you're talking about, if there's one person that didn't make it - you know, if there's one person that didn't get what they wanted - I felt it. I could have nine players take a gold. And one person took a silver. Of course, I'm happy. But it lingers for me. I think that's true for a lot of people. And I'll give you a good example of this. When my daughter made the Olympic team in 2008, at the Olympic trials, her competitor in the finals was another woman from my dojo. And so as a judo instructor, you have two of your players in the finals of the Olympic trials. You know, you're golden because no matter who wins, someone from your dojo is going to go and be on the Olympic team. VEDANTAM: So one of the competitors is your daughter. MATSUMOTO: One of them is my daughter. And the other one is my student who I treat like a daughter. And on top of that, when we're in competition, I don't have a daughter. I have a player. You know, and my daughter knew that. And we all knew that. And I treated my daughter like anybody else in competition or after competition. She - you know, she's my daughter. But when we're in competition, she's another player. And I got to treat her like I treat everybody else. And so anyway, we have these two players coming up. And I have mixed feelings about that. You know, when my daughter won, I was happy for her. But I was very sad for my other player who lost. So after that, it was a very bittersweet thing to have occurred. And yeah, I mean, I don't want to take anything from my daughter as a parent. If I could compartmentalize my feeling as - solely as a parent - yeah, great. I'm happy. But no one can compartmentalize 100 percent. Or I couldn't. And so as a parent, I felt good. As an instructor, I felt good and bad. And it's mixed-up feelings that one had. And I still have it to this day. I remember it very clearly right now. VEDANTAM: When you watch the Olympics now - and let's say you're not at the Olympics. Let's say you're not going to - are you going to Rio? MATSUMOTO: No. VEDANTAM: OK. So when you watch the Olympics on television now, what is it that you're watching? What is it that you pay attention to, knowing all that you know as a psychologist who studied the Olympics, as a coach who's coached at the Olympics, as a parent at the Olympics? What do you look for now? MATSUMOTO: I look at a lot of things, to tell you the truth. And when I see peak performance of any type - doesn't have to be sports. Even when I look at dancers or somebody who's really good at doing something that's difficult to do, they make it look so easy. And I automatically think about the sweat and the tears and the blood and the effort for years that that person put in to be able to do that - that we saw that was just effortless. When you're at competition, you're talking about, you know, a few minutes, an hour, of years of preparation. And you can't divorce your memories from those years of preparation. Those things overwhelm me, actually. VEDANTAM: And so when you're thinking about the athletes, you're actually thinking about all of those - the times that we're not seeing on television - all of the waking up at 4 o'clock in the morning and practicing on the weekends and giving up other aspects of your life - and not just for the people who win but also for everybody else who is there. MATSUMOTO: Absolutely. I mean, everyone's made a huge sacrifice. And of course, the player or the athlete is always the No. 1 sacrificer. But think about all their support staff. For us, for every player that we had on the mat, we had a support team of 10 or 20 just to get that person on the mat. And so behind one person, there's an army. And everyone's on the same team. And they never share the limelight. They never get the spotlight. They just share in the knowledge that they help this person have a peak performance. And when that person wins, everyone feels good. And when that person loses, everyone feels awful. And it's all those people, as well as the athletes, that my heart actually reaches out to when I see these things. VEDANTAM: David Matsumoto, I want to thank you for joining me today on HIDDEN BRAIN. MATSUMOTO: My pleasure. Thank you.

This is the Rawlings plant in Dodgeville, a humble little saw mill about an hour's drive west of Albany. About 40 people work here. They've handcrafted baseball bats made from ash wood for more than a century. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: The Giants win the pennant. The Giants win the pennant. MANN: The home run in 1951, the famous shot heard around the world that lifted the New York Giants over the Brooklyn Dodgers, it was hit with one of these bats. They're still a favorite with Major Leaguers. RON VANDER GROEF: Andrew Romine, Rob Refsnyder, Manny Machado. MANN: Ron Vander Groef, Rawlings plant manager, flips through his current roster of players. He says ash is popular because these bats don't shatter as easily as other woods. A lot of the famed Louisville Slugger bats are also made from ash trees cut in New York and Pennsylvania. But now an emerald green invasive bug that looks sort of like a fancy grasshopper is threatening forests from Michigan to New York. The larva chew layers of healthy bark into pulp. GROEF: If the ash borer is not controlled, it'll wipe out the entire species of white ash. We will not be able to make any more pro bats or retail bats or anything out of white ash because it will be gone. MANN: This won't end baseball as we know it. You can still make a pretty decent bat from birch or maple. But scientists say this is a kind of wakeup call for something a lot bigger. DEBORAH MCCULLOUGH: It's bordering on catastrophic. MANN: Deborah McCullough at Michigan State University was one of the first entomologists to realize that emerald ash borers had invaded. She's hopeful that some white ash will survive. But in some areas, 90 percent of these trees have died. MCCULLOUGH: When you start losing entire species, the effects cascade through the whole ecosystem. MANN: So next time you see a baseball bat shatter in a big game, it may be that ball player was forced to swing maple instead of ash. And it won't just be America's pastime that's changed. America's great eastern forests are changing too. For NPR News, I'm Brian Mann in New York's Adirondack Mountains. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  An insect is destroying forests.

We will not be able to make any more pro bats or retail bats or anything out of white ash because it will be gone. MANN: This won't end baseball as we know it. You can still make a pretty decent bat from birch or maple. But scientists say this is a kind of wakeup call for something a lot bigger. DEBORAH MCCULLOUGH: It's bordering on catastrophic. MANN: Deborah McCullough at Michigan State University was one of the first entomologists to realize that emerald ash borers had invaded. She's hopeful that some white ash will survive. But in some areas, 90 percent of these trees have died. MCCULLOUGH: When you start losing entire species, the effects cascade through the whole ecosystem. MANN: So next time you see a baseball bat shatter in a big game, it may be that ball player was forced to swing maple instead of ash. And it won't just be America's pastime that's changed. America's great eastern forests are changing too. For NPR News, I'm Brian Mann in New York's Adirondack Mountains.", "section": "Environment", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

Science correspondent Joe Palca steps back and asks the big question. What is a wave anyway? JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Yes, I know. A scientist can tell you all about waves, but I wasn't sure a scientist could answer my questions about waves because if you think about it, waves are kind of puzzling. At least I think they're kind of puzzling. Is a wave a thing, or is it the description of a thing? Well, rather than pester a scientist with my somewhat philosophical questions, I decided to pester a philosopher. S. Marc Cohen is emeritus professor of philosophy at the University of Washington. He's sympathetic to my befuddlement. S MARC COHEN: There's something about waves that can get you into kind of a mental funk because you look at a wave. You can see them. You look out on the water, and the wave moves across the water. Something's moving through space. PALCA: OK, I get that. COHEN: But what is the wave exactly? So you'll scurry off to a physics textbook, and it'll say that a wave is a disturbance that moves through a medium from one location to another. PALCA: OK, I get that, too. COHEN: So it's really not a thing. It's not made of stuff like a chair is made of wood or a football is made of leather. But when a wave moves through the water, it's not really made of water. It's a wave in the water. PALCA: Oh, OK. So Cohen says from a philosophical standpoint, you're better off thinking of a wave as a phenomenon, a thing that happens, sort of like an event. COHEN: Not what we Aristotelians would call a substance like a football or an armadillo. PALCA: So a wave in the water is not like an armadillo - got it. But hold on a minute. If a wave is a disturbance moving through a medium, what about light waves? They're a disturbance, and they can travel through empty space. Cohen says his explanation only applies to physical waves, not electromagnetic waves or light waves. COHEN: It's really mysterious how they get to move through empty space where there is no medium. But if you want the answer to that question, you'd better talk to a scientist, not a philosopher. PALCA: I was afraid it might come to that.

My colleague, social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam, is here to talk about the effects that social media has on our brains. Hi, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: Is this bad news you're about to give me? VEDANTAM: You know, it depends on your point of view. GREENE: All right. VEDANTAM: Researchers took teenagers, stuck them in the brain scanner and observed them as they engaged with social media. Lauren Sherman - she's a researcher at UCLA - she told me that she and her colleagues wanted to analyze the effects that social media has on young minds. They had the intuition that, besides all the conversations that happen on social media, there was something about mediums like Twitter and Instagram that was qualitatively different than interactions in the physical world. LAUREN SHERMAN: Suddenly, there are these interactions that have a little number on them, whether it's a like or a retweet or a favorite. And I was really curious how that quantifiable interaction was affecting the way that teens perceived information online. GREENE: I see. So we're looking specifically at, like, likes and numbers of likes. And, I guess, how much do they matter? VEDANTAM: Well, they matter a lot. Sherman and her colleagues, Ashley Payton, Leanna Hernandez, Patricia Greenfield and Mirella Dapretto, they scanned the brains of a few dozen adolescents as they watched what looked like an Instagram feed. The feed showed them photos that they had taken and photos supposedly taken by their friends. In reality, the other pictures were pictures the researchers had selected. Sherman and her colleagues found that when a photo had more likes, it generated greater activation in the reward centers of the brain. This was true of all photos, including photos the kids had taken themselves. SHERMAN: When teens saw their own pictures had received many likes, they showed a greater activation in an area of the brain called the nucleus accumbens. And this is an area that's part of the brain's reward circuitry. GREENE: Reward circuitry - that's the part of the brain that's making you feel good about yourself. VEDANTAM: Precisely. GREENE: Is this that surprising? I mean, if you see a photo and one of your photos that you took has a lot of likes, you're feeling good about yourself, so that part of the brain would be active. VEDANTAM: I think that is what you would intuitively expect to see, but the research also produced some really interesting nuances, David. Researchers manipulated the pictures supposedly taken by the friends of the teenagers so adolescents saw different pictures that were supposedly popular. So you might see a picture and see that it had 50 likes, and I might see the very same picture and see that it received only five likes. The brains of the teenagers responded very strongly to the pictures deemed popular, regardless of which pictures they were. In fact, the researchers asked the adolescents to themselves like photos that they admired. And they found that if a teen saw a picture with lots of likes, she tended to like it herself. If another teen saw the same picture with only a few likes, he tended not to like it himself. GREENE: Oh, interesting. So it really can have a snowballing effect. VEDANTAM: Exactly. And the remarkable thing is that this was also true of the photos that the teenagers had taken themselves. Rather than make up their own minds about which of their own pictures they liked, teens deferred to the opinions of their peers. So, you know, in some ways, this study is confirming what we've known - peer pressure matters a lot, especially when you're 14. GREENE: And probably when you're older, too.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. We hear a lot about winners at the Olympics, but most athletes at the games come home losers. Today, we're going to take a look at what losing does to athletes, to fans and to teams. Dan Pink is going to join me later in this episode. But first, we're going to start with a story of one athlete. JIMMY PEDRO: So I actually started judo since I can remember. I mean, literally the day I could walk is when I was on a judo mat. My dad was a judo instructor, and he owned a judo school in Peabody, Mass. So I literally walked into the sport and started practicing at the age of 5. I started competing at the age of 6. VEDANTAM: This is Jimmy Pedro. As a young child, he was groomed for glory by his dad, who was a judo coach. His father had tried but never made it to the Olympics. PEDRO: Ever since I was a young kid, you know, my goal and his goal was sort of to help me get to the Olympics. VEDANTAM: Jimmy competed on the U. S. judo team in the 1992 Olympic Games, but he didn't win a medal. In 1996 in Atlanta, he made it to the medal stand. He won bronze. After that Olympics, Jimmy Pedro's trajectory kept rising. He won first place in the 1999 judo world championship. In 2000, heavily favored to win, Jimmy flew to the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. PEDRO: Sydney was very tough for me. You know, you're 1999 world champion. A year later, you're going to the Olympic Games. No American has ever won gold in the sport of judo. Sort of all of the media attention and focus is on Jimmy Pedro to bring home America's first gold medal ever. I was in, you know, every publication, newspaper. Everybody was picking me to win gold. I had been on a great win streak heading into that Olympics, and I wanted it so badly. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Almost immediately, things didn't go according to plan. PEDRO: I lose my first fight in the Sydney Olympics. And then - I told my coach when I came off the mat, I said, I just don't feel right. I don't know what to tell you. I just - my body just doesn't feel right today. I don't have it. He said all right. Well, let's just get up for the next one. And I strung together four wins in a row, and I set up a bronze-medal match. And, you know, confident going into the bronze-medal match. I had just won four in a row. I still don't feel great, but I'm winning. Who cares? Let's go get a medal. And lo and behold, I walked out. In the very first 30 seconds of the match, I get thrown to my mack (ph) - match over. I lose. I finished fifth in Sydney. So you go from, you know, America's hope to win a gold, having sacrificed four more years of your life since Atlanta. And now you come back and fail and don't even step up onto the podium of your third Olympic Games. I felt like a complete and utter failure. And it was very devastating. And I didn't get over that moment for a very, very long time. VEDANTAM: The loss was publicly devastating. The New York Times devoted an entire article to the disappointing performance. In it, Jimmy's coach said, quote, \"it just wasn't meant to be. I don't know what to say. \"(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Jimmy Pedro felt like a loser after the Sydney Games. But you could look at it another way. He was judged to be the fifth-best judo player in the whole world. That's got to count for something, right? PEDRO: When you're a competitive athlete, you can't see it that way. When you have your sights set on a goal and you give everything you possibly have to reach that goal, especially when you've done it before - you know, I've stepped - I stepped up on the podium before. So I know what the feeling was like. I wanted that so badly again. When it doesn't happen, it's absolute rejection. It's absolute failure. And there's really no consolation to say, well, it's still successful. You made it three Olympics. It's not enough. I was not satisfied. I was not happy. And it really - just couldn't deal with defeat. I had to succeed. VEDANTAM: After the Sydney Olympics, for the first time since he was 5, Jimmy Pedro quit competitive judo. He stopped training every day. He got an office job at Monster. com. Two years passed. And then, in 2002, his job brought him to Salt Lake City to help out with the Winter Olympics. One night, as he watched a speed skater receive a gold medal on the podium, Jimmy Pedro had an epiphany. PEDRO: I saw him step up on the podium. And at that moment, when they're putting the medal around his neck, I looked at my boss from Monster. com and I said - you know what? - I'm going back to the Olympics again. I called my wife from medals plaza in Salt Lake City. Creed was playing in the background. I picked up the phone. I said, Marie, you're not going to believe where I am right now. But I'm at the Olympic Games. I'm watching this kid get his gold medal. I have to do this again. VEDANTAM: Jimmy's wife gave him the green light. Jimmy began to train again. (SOUNDBITE OF THE 2004 SUMMER OLYMPICS)UNIDENTIFIED COMMENTATOR: (Foreign language spoken). VEDANTAM: In 2004 in Athens in the bronze-medal competition, Jimmy faced down his opponent? PEDRO: Then in the end, he ended up tapping out and quitting, you know. And that's when - the moment I knew I had won my second Olympic medal. (SOUNDBITE OF THE 2004 SUMMER OLYMPICS)UNIDENTIFIED COMMENTATOR: Jimmy Pedro (foreign language spoken). PEDRO: I was going to step up on the podium. I was going to end my career on a high note and as a success instead of a failure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Jimmy Pedro retired from judo after the 2004 Olympics. He now coaches the U. S. Olympic Judo Team. And as part of that job, he spends a lot of time talking with young athletes, athletes who've trained their whole lives, just like he did. We ask Jimmy what he plans to tell young judo players who don't medal at Rio. PEDRO: I don't know. It's going to be a hard conversation. You know, the conversation is really focused on, hey, let's look at things. Did you do everything in your power to be the best athlete you could be? If that answer is yes, then you can look yourself in the mirror and say, hey, I gave it my all. It just wasn't meant to be. It wasn't meant to be. VEDANTAM: We reminded Jimmy that it wasn't meant to be was the same thing his coach told The New York Times in 2000 after that devastating loss in Sydney. PEDRO: Yes. You have to be able to rationalize it or justify it and make sense of it. Otherwise, you'll drive yourself crazy with second-guessing. And there has to be some stronger power, some stronger reason out there as to why it didn't happen. I think - and that's the only way you can justify it. You know? VEDANTAM: Coming up, Dan Pink and I play Stopwatch Science. Today's topic - what losing, whether in sports or in politics, can do to you. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Welcome back. This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. I'm joined now by Daniel Pink. He's the author of several books about human behavior. On this show, his title is senior Stopwatch Science correspondent. Welcome, Dan. DANIEL PINK, BYLINE: Thank you, Shankar. VEDANTAM: On stop Stopwatch Science, Dan and I give one another 60 seconds to summarize interesting social science research. As we approach the one-minute mark, our producers this time are going to bring up the Olympic anthem, signaling it's time for us to stop. Our topic today is losing. How does losing affect our emotions? How does it affect our health? But also, how can losing help us win? Now, I've had extensive experience throughout my life with losing, but Dan is a stranger to defeat. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: So we're going to see if he has anything useful to say. Dan, if you're ready, your first 60 seconds starts now. PINK: Sports isn't just about sports, right? It's about big things - values, respect, honor. And the Olympics may represent the apotheosis of this belief. Bring countries together on the playing field rather than the battlefield, and the real winner is world harmony. Well, a 2013 paper in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology sprinkles a few rain drops on this idealistic parade. Four German scholars tracked the attitudes of high school students in Germany before and after two huge soccer competitions, the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European soccer championships. They found that when the German national team lost a match, the teenagers' views of people from the winning country soured. So when Italy eliminated Germany in the World Cup, the students became more prejudiced toward Italians. When Spain defeated Germany in the finals of the European Championships, they grew more biased against Spaniards. Meanwhile, in both cases, the German youth opinions of other foreigners - Brazilian, Polish, French - remain more or less the same. So yes, the Olympics can stir warm feelings, but only if your team wins. VEDANTAM: In other words, most of the time, since most countries are losers in the Olympics - not winners - the Olympics must be, then, a net gain for prejudice in the world. PINK: It could be that this grand experience all about social harmony might be achieving the exact opposite. VEDANTAM: Oh, that's brilliant. PINK: And that puts me in the Olympic spirit. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: Speaking of the Olympic spirit, you now have the 60-second Stopwatch Science competition heat four that begins right now. VEDANTAM: All right. Losing may not just increases your hostility towards people who beat you. It might also increase your waistline. Yann Cornil and Pierre Chandon from INSEAD looked at what happens to fans when their teams lose. They specifically examined the 2004 and 2005 NFL seasons in the United States. People in cities with losing teams buy more unhealthy food in the days following a defeat. On Sunday - this is game day - consumption in winning cities and losing cities - about the same. On Tuesdays - about the same. But on Monday, the day after the game, the researchers find that saturated fat consumption increases by about 16 percent in losing cities. Consumption increases by 28 percent in the most football-crazy cities. And the effect is stronger when the team plays against a closely matched competitor and loses narrowly. In contrast, they find that saturated fat consumption decreases by 10 percent following a victory. Why is this happening? You lose, and you look for things to compensate for your feelings of heartbreak and loss. So if you live in Ohio and you're a fan of the Cleveland Browns, it may be time to follow Dan's lead and move. PINK: Oh, that's - that's harsh to us Buckeyes. No, I left central Ohio - the Columbus area - for reasons unrelated to the Browns. But I think the better solution is just to keep eating those French fries, keep eating those doughnuts. And eventually - eventually - this season, perhaps - the Browns will win the Super Bowl. VEDANTAM: All right, so that's Dan's winning strategy. Let's see what his strategy is for his next segment, which starts right now. PINK: Well, my fellow Ohio natives might remember the 1980 Cleveland Browns - a football team that ended up in so many close games, they became known as the Kardiac Kids. I thought about that team when I read this next study from 2013, in which four physicians and medical researchers analyzed whether closely fought super bowl games affect the heart health of fans. For part of the research, they chose the 2008 Super Bowl. You might remember it. That's when the New York Giants, in the final minute of a dramatic game, upset the then-undefeated New England Patriots. The researchers found that in Massachusetts, home of the Patriots, the week after the loss, heart-related deaths increased by about 20 percent compared with the previous year. The New York region, home of the winners, showed no change in heart deaths at all. Patriot fans, as many people know, are among the most intense in the NFL. And that devastating Super Bowl loss might truly have broken their hearts. VEDANTAM: You know, Dan, I wonder if this is the reason why, for many sports fans, when their teams are losing, it's almost easier just to turn off the television and stop watching, that it's just unbearable for fans to watch their teams lose. And it might just be that people are actually acting in their rational self-interest in terms of their health. PINK: It could be. This reminds me - I mean, sometimes I just have to turn off the TV during the Major League Baseball playoffs for my beloved Washington Nationals because I can't take it anymore. I think what's interesting here, though, in terms of the science, is how seriously we take this. You're talking about people eating unhealthy food. I'm talking about heart-related deaths going up. It's just a game. It's a bunch of people. They don't know me. I don't know them. They're playing a kid's game. Why do we take it so seriously that it's affecting our health? It's a fascinating question. I think it's one of the things that makes sports so appealing as a subject of study. VEDANTAM: You know, and the next year, the same players that are playing for the Nationals are going to be playing for another team. You're really arguing about laundry. PINK: Right, exactly. You're - that's a great Jerry Seinfeld line. You're rooting for laundry. But still, it's laundry that somehow matters. But what matters even more than the laundry of professional sports, Shankar, is whether you can stick to your time. Your 60 seconds begins right now. VEDANTAM: Speaking of broken hearts, it breaks my heart when people come in late and interrupt the game by asking me who's winning. That's because social science research suggests we don't really have to ask people about the score. It's painted on the face of players. Now, probably, it's painted on the faces of sports fans as well, although the research didn't study that question. Researchers Philip Furley at the German Sports University Cologne and Geoffrey Schweizer at the University of Heidelberg found that we can usually tell who's winning and who's losing just by looking at the players. College students had to watch only four seconds of a bunch of sports games - either basketball or table tennis - to know who was winning and who was losing. Even when the students were not familiar with either game, they were able to tell not only who was winning, but whether the game was close or a blowout. Now, I imagine there are probably exceptions to this rule. I don't know if you've noticed, Dan, but all the politicians running for president always seem to look delighted, no matter how bad things are for their campaigns. PINK: You know what? I think that's actually a nice contrast between politics and sports because sports doesn't have that kind of artificial layer on it. So you watch an NBA game and you look at the bench, and you can tell immediately whether that team has - has lost. And these are grown-ups. These are adults. And they're sad because they lost a game involving throwing a ball through a hoop. VEDANTAM: And, in fact, they would look like idiots if they looked cheerful when their team was losing, except we somehow seem to give politicians a pass on this. PINK: I guess so because I guess we - our expectations of athletes are much higher than our expectations of politicians. VEDANTAM: And my expectations of you are even higher. . . PINK: Oh, boy. VEDANTAM: . . . Than my expectations of athletes, Dan. Your next 60 seconds starts right now. PINK: The title of this study poses an intriguing question - can losing lead to winning? To find out, Jonah Berger of the University of Pennsylvania and Devin Pope of the University of Chicago analyzed more than 18,000 games in the National Basketball Association - the NBA - looking in particular at the score at halftime. They discovered the teams that were losing by one point at halftime were actually more likely to win the game than teams that were leading by 1 point. Now, at some level, this makes no sense. Teams that are behind at the half end up losing the vast majority of time, but a 1-point deficit was the exception. In fact, being down by 1 at the midpoint was about half as valuable as having the home-court advantage. VEDANTAM: Wow. PINK: This study shows how context affects motivation. If you're ahead of your opponent, you might become complacent. If you're way behind, you might give up. But if you're losing by just a little, you might work harder to close the gap and turn losing into winning. VEDANTAM: You know, I absolutely love that study, Dan. And as you were speaking, the analogy that sprang to mind was an analogy from education, which is when you're trying to teach a student, you really just want to stay one step ahead of the student. Give the student a feeling that if they just ran a little bit harder, they could catch up. Get too far ahead or get too far behind, and you end up discouraging the student. But when you give the student the sense that if they just ran a little bit faster they could catch up, that's when you're in the sweet spot. PINK: I think the search for that sweet spot is really essential, whether we're parents or teachers or coaches or even if we're navigating our own lives. I mean, I think about this myself and say to myself, you know, play like you're one point behind. I think that's great guidance for doing anything really well. So now, let me turn it over to you. Shankar, you have 59 seconds. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: . . . For this next one. VEDANTAM: All right, we've talked a lot about losing in the context of sports, and that makes sense. But winning and losing can also have powerful effects in many other domains of life. Lamar Pierce at Washington University in St. Louis and his colleagues wanted to know how badly voters feel when their political party loses a presidential election. They used data of people's self-reported happiness during the week before and after the 2012 presidential election. Now, there's lots of debate about the best way to measure happiness, but simply asking people is one way to do it. The researchers found that Democrats weren't noticeably more happy following Barack Obama's re-election, but Republicans were absolutely devastated. Now, Democrats probably felt the same way in 2004 when George W. Bush was re-elected, although this study didn't look at that election. PINK: Now there, at least in a political race, people might be reasoning somewhat rationally, saying, oh, my, if the Democrats won, my taxes are going to go up. If the Republicans won, that means that the social safety net is going to be shredded. But there is something about being in the zero-sum contest where one person wins and one person loses. When you're on the short end of that, it feels really, really bad, whether it is an NBA game or whether it's a presidential election. VEDANTAM: And there's a lot of research, I think, from political psychology that actually argues that much of the way we relate to politics is very similar to the way we relate to sports teams. So even though, at a rational level, people will say they care about policy and whether this policy wins or that policy loses, at some level, they are reacting to the political parties the same way that you react to the Washington Nationals or the New York Yankees. PINK: I hate the Yankees. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: All right, so there you have it. Winning makes you broad-minded, and losing makes you prejudiced. Winning makes you eat salads, and losing makes you eat cheese steaks. Losing isn't just bad for your pride and your waistline. It might even put you in the hospital with a heart attack. Players in sports often wear the signs of victory and defeat on their faces, and losing by a little can help you come back to win. And finally, if your party loses the presidential election, America might be great again, but you certainly will not be. Dan, thank you for joining me. PINK: Always a pleasure.

Over the next two weeks, Planet Money is buying crude oil straight from the source and following it all the way to your gas tank. You can find Planet Money at npr. org/podcasts and on the NPR One app. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  This HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. We hear a lot about winners at the Olympics, but most athletes at the games come home losers. Today, we're going to take a look at what losing does to athletes, to fans and to teams. Dan Pink is going to join me later in this episode. But first, we're going to start with a story of one athlete. JIMMY PEDRO: So I actually started judo since I can remember. I mean, literally the day I could walk is when I was on a judo mat. My dad was a judo instructor, and he owned a judo school in Peabody, Mass. So I literally walked into the sport and started practicing at the age of 5. I started competing at the age of 6. VEDANTAM: This is Jimmy Pedro. As a young child, he was groomed for glory by his dad, who was a judo coach. His father had tried but never made it to the Olympics. PEDRO: Ever since I was a young kid, you know, my goal and his goal was sort of to help me get to the Olympics. VEDANTAM: Jimmy competed on the U. S. judo team in the 1992 Olympic Games, but he didn't win a medal. In 1996 in Atlanta, he made it to the medal stand. He won bronze. After that Olympics, Jimmy Pedro's trajectory kept rising. He won first place in the 1999 judo world championship. In 2000, heavily favored to win, Jimmy flew to the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. PEDRO: Sydney was very tough for me. You know, you're 1999 world champion. A year later, you're going to the Olympic Games. No American has ever won gold in the sport of judo. Sort of all of the media attention and focus is on Jimmy Pedro to bring home America's first gold medal ever. I was in, you know, every publication, newspaper. Everybody was picking me to win gold. I had been on a great win streak heading into that Olympics, and I wanted it so badly. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Almost immediately, things didn't go according to plan. PEDRO: I lose my first fight in the Sydney Olympics. And then - I told my coach when I came off the mat, I said, I just don't feel right. I don't know what to tell you. I just - my body just doesn't feel right today. I don't have it. He said all right. Well, let's just get up for the next one. And I strung together four wins in a row, and I set up a bronze-medal match. And, you know, confident going into the bronze-medal match. I had just won four in a row. I still don't feel great, but I'm winning. Who cares? Let's go get a medal. And lo and behold, I walked out. In the very first 30 seconds of the match, I get thrown to my mack (ph) - match over. I lose. I finished fifth in Sydney. So you go from, you know, America's hope to win a gold, having sacrificed four more years of your life since Atlanta. And now you come back and fail and don't even step up onto the podium of your third Olympic Games. I felt like a complete and utter failure. And it was very devastating. And I didn't get over that moment for a very, very long time. VEDANTAM: The loss was publicly devastating. The New York Times devoted an entire article to the disappointing performance. In it, Jimmy's coach said, quote, \"it just wasn't meant to be. I don't know what to say. \" (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Jimmy Pedro felt like a loser after the Sydney Games. But you could look at it another way. He was judged to be the fifth-best judo player in the whole world. That's got to count for something, right? PEDRO: When you're a competitive athlete, you can't see it that way. When you have your sights set on a goal and you give everything you possibly have to reach that goal, especially when you've done it before - you know, I've stepped - I stepped up on the podium before. So I know what the feeling was like. I wanted that so badly again. When it doesn't happen, it's absolute rejection. It's absolute failure. And there's really no consolation to say, well, it's still successful. You made it three Olympics. It's not enough. I was not satisfied. I was not happy. And it really - just couldn't deal with defeat. I had to succeed. VEDANTAM: After the Sydney Olympics, for the first time since he was 5, Jimmy Pedro quit competitive judo. He stopped training every day. He got an office job at Monster. com. Two years passed. And then, in 2002, his job brought him to Salt Lake City to help out with the Winter Olympics. One night, as he watched a speed skater receive a gold medal on the podium, Jimmy Pedro had an epiphany. PEDRO: I saw him step up on the podium. And at that moment, when they're putting the medal around his neck, I looked at my boss from Monster. com and I said - you know what? - I'm going back to the Olympics again. I called my wife from medals plaza in Salt Lake City. Creed was playing in the background. I picked up the phone. I said, Marie, you're not going to believe where I am right now. But I'm at the Olympic Games. I'm watching this kid get his gold medal. I have to do this again. VEDANTAM: Jimmy's wife gave him the green light. Jimmy began to train again. (SOUNDBITE OF THE 2004 SUMMER OLYMPICS) UNIDENTIFIED COMMENTATOR: (Foreign language spoken). VEDANTAM: In 2004 in Athens in the bronze-medal competition, Jimmy faced down his opponent? PEDRO: Then in the end, he ended up tapping out and quitting, you know. And that's when - the moment I knew I had won my second Olympic medal. (SOUNDBITE OF THE 2004 SUMMER OLYMPICS) UNIDENTIFIED COMMENTATOR: Jimmy Pedro (foreign language spoken). PEDRO: I was going to step up on the podium. I was going to end my career on a high note and as a success instead of a failure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Jimmy Pedro retired from judo after the 2004 Olympics. He now coaches the U. S. Olympic Judo Team. And as part of that job, he spends a lot of time talking with young athletes, athletes who've trained their whole lives, just like he did. We ask Jimmy what he plans to tell young judo players who don't medal at Rio. PEDRO: I don't know. It's going to be a hard conversation. You know, the conversation is really focused on, hey, let's look at things. Did you do everything in your power to be the best athlete you could be? If that answer is yes, then you can look yourself in the mirror and say, hey, I gave it my all. It just wasn't meant to be. It wasn't meant to be. VEDANTAM: We reminded Jimmy that it wasn't meant to be was the same thing his coach told The New York Times in 2000 after that devastating loss in Sydney. PEDRO: Yes. You have to be able to rationalize it or justify it and make sense of it. Otherwise, you'll drive yourself crazy with second-guessing. And there has to be some stronger power, some stronger reason out there as to why it didn't happen. I think - and that's the only way you can justify it. You know? VEDANTAM: Coming up, Dan Pink and I play Stopwatch Science. Today's topic - what losing, whether in sports or in politics, can do to you. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Welcome back. This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. I'm joined now by Daniel Pink. He's the author of several books about human behavior. On this show, his title is senior Stopwatch Science correspondent. Welcome, Dan. DANIEL PINK, BYLINE: Thank you, Shankar. VEDANTAM: On stop Stopwatch Science, Dan and I give one another 60 seconds to summarize interesting social science research. As we approach the one-minute mark, our producers this time are going to bring up the Olympic anthem, signaling it's time for us to stop. Our topic today is losing. How does losing affect our emotions? How does it affect our health? But also, how can losing help us win? Now, I've had extensive experience throughout my life with losing, but Dan is a stranger to defeat. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: So we're going to see if he has anything useful to say. Dan, if you're ready, your first 60 seconds starts now. PINK: Sports isn't just about sports, right? It's about big things - values, respect, honor. And the Olympics may represent the apotheosis of this belief. Bring countries together on the playing field rather than the battlefield, and the real winner is world harmony. Well, a 2013 paper in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology sprinkles a few rain drops on this idealistic parade. Four German scholars tracked the attitudes of high school students in Germany before and after two huge soccer competitions, the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European soccer championships. They found that when the German national team lost a match, the teenagers' views of people from the winning country soured. So when Italy eliminated Germany in the World Cup, the students became more prejudiced toward Italians. When Spain defeated Germany in the finals of the European Championships, they grew more biased against Spaniards. Meanwhile, in both cases, the German youth opinions of other foreigners - Brazilian, Polish, French - remain more or less the same. So yes, the Olympics can stir warm feelings, but only if your team wins. VEDANTAM: In other words, most of the time, since most countries are losers in the Olympics - not winners - the Olympics must be, then, a net gain for prejudice in the world. PINK: It could be that this grand experience all about social harmony might be achieving the exact opposite. VEDANTAM: Oh, that's brilliant. PINK: And that puts me in the Olympic spirit. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: Speaking of the Olympic spirit, you now have the 60-second Stopwatch Science competition heat four that begins right now. VEDANTAM: All right. Losing may not just increases your hostility towards people who beat you. It might also increase your waistline. Yann Cornil and Pierre Chandon from INSEAD looked at what happens to fans when their teams lose. They specifically examined the 2004 and 2005 NFL seasons in the United States.

In contrast, they find that saturated fat consumption decreases by 10 percent following a victory. Why is this happening? You lose, and you look for things to compensate for your feelings of heartbreak and loss. So if you live in Ohio and you're a fan of the Cleveland Browns, it may be time to follow Dan's lead and move. PINK: Oh, that's - that's harsh to us Buckeyes. No, I left central Ohio - the Columbus area - for reasons unrelated to the Browns. But I think the better solution is just to keep eating those French fries, keep eating those doughnuts.

All they have to do is find it. NPR science correspondent Joe Palca has been exploring scientists' passion for discovery as part of his series Joe's Big Idea. Today he brings us a story of a celestial treasure hunt to find Planet Nine. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Nobody's actually seen the new planet. The reason astronomers think it's out there is the strange behavior of some smallish objects orbiting in the outer reaches of the solar system. By studying the so-called extreme Kuiper Belt objects, astronomers have deduced that the gravity of something big, something ten times more massive than the Earth, seems to be tugging on them, altering their paths around the sun. Caltech astronomer Mike Brown says it's hard to know exactly where that tug is coming from. MIKE BROWN: We don't have complete orbits of any of our objects yet. So if you could wait 15,000 years, I could pinpoint exactly where Planet Nine is. PALCA: For now, all Brown can do is map out a swath of sky where his computer model says the new planet might be. And that's one of the problems with Brown's predictions for the new planet. They're based on just a handful of small objects. And some astronomers are skeptical there's enough evidence to make a credible treasure map. Brown's Caltech colleague Konstantin Batygin says they were aware that invoking a new planet to explain the strange behavior of their objects would expose them to ridicule. There have been a lot of wild goose chases in the search for new planets. KONSTANTIN BATYGIN: We worked hard for about a year to try and find some other explanation. BROWN: Because we were kind of tired of everybody always saying, there must be a planet. There must be a planet. There must be a planet, even - we were tired of ourselves having said it several times. PALCA: When did it go from, oh, that's ridiculous to, wait a minute, maybe that's not ridiculous? BROWN: So that was at a - there was a moment when that happened. PALCA: Brown says the moment came because of something unexpected their computer model predicted. The model said not only would a giant planet explain the behavior of distant objects, such a planet would also tilt the orbits of some objects closer to the sun by 90 degrees. And did such objects exist? One day, Brown found an astronomical survey that appeared to have them. BATYGIN: We went over to Mike's office. And. . . BROWN: I had the predictions from the computer model on. And I put the new objects on top of the predictions, and they sat exactly where they were supposed to sit. BATYGIN: It was this moment where you sit back, and you recognize that this is actually real. BROWN: Not just this cute little math anymore. BATYGIN: For the first time, we actually believe ourselves. This planet is really out there. PALCA: Batygin and Brown aren't the only ones convinced there's something to look for. Scott Sheppard is an astronomer at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D. C. He was the first to notice the strange behavior of the distant objects and suggest a new planet might be responsible. Like Brown and Batygin, he expects the new planet to be in an orbit much, much farther out than Neptune. But he expects it may be visible later this year, and he'll be using large telescopes to search the most promising patches of sky. SCOTT SHEPPARD: We're both aware that this big object could be out there. We're both interested in very similar science. We're not teaming up, but we also don't want to compete against each other. So what we have agreed to do is share our field. So if we observe a certain area of sky, there's no reason for anyone else to observe that sky again. PALCA: There's an interesting dynamic here. On the one hand, Sheppard would like someone to find the planet because it would vindicate the predictions that it's out there. SHEPPARD: Of course - yeah, you just want to find it. And anyone would want it to be them, for sure. But it would be nice just to find it, just to know that what we're seeing out there is real. PALCA: Caltech's Mike Brown says he feels the same way. BROWN: We want it found. I would rather that somebody finds it tomorrow than that we find it in 10 years. I'd rather I find it tomorrow, I mean, to be honest. PALCA: It would be oddly fitting if Brown did find the new planet since he had a major role in demoting Pluto from planetary status a decade ago. Right now, Brown says finding the planet is basically a matter of luck. You happen to pick the right patch of sky, you win. We may know who got lucky by the end of the year - or maybe not.

UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Cheering). SHAPIRO: People stand up, then they sit down. If everyone plays along, you can make a wave go all the way around full circle. We've been reporting on all kinds of waves this summer as part of a special series. As NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports, the kind of wave done by sports fans has caught the attention of physicists. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The wave has been looping around stadiums since at least the early 1980s. Illes Farkas first started pondering it back in 2001. ILLES FARKAS: It was summer. It was really hot. And there was something in town. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He can't really remember what - maybe a swimming competition? What he does remember is seeing the audience do the wave and wondering, how did tens of thousands of people burst into this unplanned but highly coordinated movement? FARKAS: So it was basically out of curiosity, an odd summer project. And then it turned into something very serious. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Back then, he was a graduate student in physics. Now he's at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest. He says it's only natural that he and a couple of scientific pals would be drawn to a crowd doing the wave. FARKAS: The reason why we got interested in stadium waves was that people, apparently, very often behave like particles. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Particles obeying a few simple rules can create seemingly complex phenomena, like ice melting. FARKAS: And in a very similar way, surprisingly, humans do similar things. GREENFIELDBOYCE: To find out what simple rules produce the wave, he and his colleagues got videos of stadium crowds from TV stations. They analyzed more than a dozen waves. They also built computer models and zeroed in on three key parameters - the distance between audience members, how many neighbors an audience member could see. . . FARKAS: And the third one was the readiness or probability of an individual to start standing up assuming that others nearby are already standing. GREENFIELDBOYCE: What they learned appeared in the prestigious scientific journal Nature. A wave typically rolls clockwise, moving at a speed of about 20 seats per second. To keep going, it needs to be wide, stretching from the top rows to the bottom seats. Interestingly, though, starting a wave doesn't take that many people. FARKAS: It was surprising that the number of individuals necessary for triggering a wave is actually quite low. So it was on the order of 20, 30, 35 people. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The key is to strike when the mood of the crowd is just right. A critical moment in a close game is probably not a good time to try. FARKAS: Waves actually happen quite often when there's nothing interesting happening or when people are very enthusiastic. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Like when their team is clearly going to win. So if you're out at the stadium and your side is way ahead, get some buddies and try a little wave experiment of your own. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

You know what I mean? Well, we have NPR blogger Adam Frank, and we asked you to send in your big questions about physics, astronomy or science in general so that we can give you some short answers or rather so Adam can give you some short answers. Hi, Adam. ADAM FRANK, BYLINE: Hey. SHAPIRO: This question comes from Bob MacNeal. Adam, take it away. FRANK: Bob asks, what accounts for the strength of Earth's magnetic field, and how does it compare to Venus and Mars. And also what about its longevity? How long does it last? SHAPIRO: OK, Adam, let's break this down bit by bit. When I think of Earth's magnetic field, I think of - OK, we've got a North and South pole, and if you take a compass that has a little piece of metal in it, it'll point north using that magnetic field. But what is it actually? FRANK: OK, well, basically what a magnetic field is, is it's a force. It's basically a force field which extends through space. And what's happening in the earth is that stuff happening in the core is generating that magnetic field. And you know, you can detect it with your compass, but there's much more to it. In fact one of the things that the magnetic field is doing is it's protecting us from radiation coming from the sun. SHAPIRO: OK, let's talk about the next part of the question now, which is how Earth's magnetic field compares to Mars and Venus. FRANK: Yeah, well, the interesting thing is neither Mars nor Venus really has much of a magnetic field at all. They're thousands of times or more weaker than the Earth's field. SHAPIRO: Why is Earth's so much stronger then? FRANK: Well, it's all about what's happening in the Earth's core. So you know, thousands of miles below our feet, the core of the Earth is actually - it's so hot that it's made of iron and nickel, and it's molten. It's flowing. And you know, we all know that metal makes good conductors, right? Well, here we've got flowing metal, and that's essentially a current, right? When you run a current through a wire, what you're actually get - is that generates magnetic field. So in the center of the Earth, since the Earth is spinning, all that molten, liquid iron is splashing around and spinning around. That creates huge currents, and those huge currents create the huge magnetic field that we have. SHAPIRO: Well, thank you, Earth's magnetic field. FRANK: (Laughter) I agree. Let's send it a card.

We know that. Now, Sally Helm from our Planet Money podcast brings us the story of how they get here, about big changes in the world of shipping and how a phone call in the middle of the night inspired a technological shift. SALLY HELM, BYLINE: Ryan Petersen used to make money like this - he and his brother would buy inexpensive stuff in China. They'd have it shipped to the U. S. , and they'd sell it on eBay for a higher price. One time, they bought a bunch of mopeds off of a Chinese website, and they paid to ship the mopeds across the ocean. One night, Petersen got a call. RYAN PETERSEN: I am asleep in my bed at 4 o'clock in the morning. I get a call from China, asking me where such and such document is. I thought that was your job to know where it was, or at least someone. You know, wow, very confusing. And I don't need to be doing that at 4 o'clock in the morning. HELM: The call was from a freight forwarder. You can think of freight forwarders like travel agents for international shipping. So if you're shipping a bunch of mopeds from China, a freight forwarder will make sure that those mopeds get picked up at the moped factory and taken to a port and put on a ship. And then, a freight forwarder will make sure that the mopeds get on a truck and go to another warehouse. It's a lot of work. Petersen didn't know much about freight forwarding at this point, but he thought there has got to be a better way. PETERSEN: I just couldn't even imagine. We have the Internet. Like, why is there this piece of paper that's required for me to go pick up the goods? But that's still the default. HELM: Petersen thought he could build a new kind of company, one that used software to do some of the work that freight forwarders do. But he wasn't sure if anyone would be interested in that, so he decided to test it. He built a mock-up of a website advertising this service, just to see what the response would be. And one day, he checked his email and saw that he had gotten a sign-up from the world's biggest oil company, Saudi Aramco. So Saudi Aramco, like, signs up for this service and just hears nothing - never hears back from you? PETERSEN: Yeah, no - never got a word back. HELM: Petersen wasn't ready to offer this service for real yet, but he says he could tell that he had identified a real problem. Freight forwarders were stuck in this era of faxes and phone calls. So he spent the next couple of years learning everything that he could about freight forwarding as it was. And then he got some funding from some big names, including Google Ventures, and he launched his company, Flexport. They're based in San Francisco, and they use software to automate some parts of the shipping process. So, for example, an employee will get an automatic reminder if they're missing some crucial document. And customers can track their shipments on a central dashboard. Now, Flexport isn't the only company that's trying to bring freight forwarding into the Internet age. I talked to Mike Simon. He's a consultant who's worked in logistics for decades, and he said that, more than ever, big freight-forwarding companies are embracing technology. He said he expects that, eventually, technology will put some people in freight forwarding out of a job, but. . . MIKE SIMON: Hasn't happened yet. I mean, the freight-forwarding industry is growing because global commerce continues to grow. HELM: The new startup, Flexport, is growing, too. They have 700 clients. Founder Ryan Petersen says they expect to make $75 million in revenue in 2016. Petersen will tell you that he's not trying to replace all the people in freight forwarding. Flexport has hundreds of employees in San Francisco, New York, Amsterdam and Hong Kong. I visited the New York office, and I did spot one physical piece of paper, but most of the people there were looking at screens. Sally Helm, NPR News.

HELM: The call was from a freight forwarder. You can think of freight forwarders like travel agents for international shipping. So if you're shipping a bunch of mopeds from China, a freight forwarder will make sure that those mopeds get picked up at the moped factory and taken to a port and put on a ship. And then, a freight forwarder will make sure that the mopeds get on a truck and go to another warehouse. It's a lot of work. Petersen didn't know much about freight forwarding at this point, but he thought there has got to be a better way. PETERSEN: I just couldn't even imagine. We have the Internet. Like, why is there this piece of paper that's required for me to go pick up the goods? But that's still the default. HELM: Petersen thought he could build a new kind of company, one that used software to do some of the work that freight forwarders do. But he wasn't sure if anyone would be interested in that, so he decided to test it. He built a mock-up of a website advertising this service, just to see what the response would be. And one day, he checked his email and saw that he had gotten a sign-up from the world's biggest oil company, Saudi Aramco. So Saudi Aramco, like, signs up for this service and just hears nothing - never hears back from you? PETERSEN: Yeah, no - never got a word back. HELM: Petersen wasn't ready to offer this service for real yet, but he says he could tell that he had identified a real problem. Freight forwarders were stuck in this era of faxes and phone calls. So he spent the next couple of years learning everything that he could about freight forwarding as it was. And then he got some funding from some big names, including Google Ventures, and he launched his company, Flexport. They're based in San Francisco, and they use software to automate some parts of the shipping process. So, for example, an employee will get an automatic reminder if they're missing some crucial document. And customers can track their shipments on a central dashboard. Now, Flexport isn't the only company that's trying to bring freight forwarding into the Internet age. I talked to Mike Simon. He's a consultant who's worked in logistics for decades, and he said that, more than ever, big freight-forwarding companies are embracing technology. He said he expects that, eventually, technology will put some people in freight forwarding out of a job, but. . . MIKE SIMON: Hasn't happened yet. I mean, the freight-forwarding industry is growing because global commerce continues to grow. HELM: The new startup, Flexport, is growing, too. They have 700 clients. Founder Ryan Petersen says they expect to make $75 million in revenue in 2016. Petersen will tell you that he's not trying to replace all the people in freight forwarding. Flexport has hundreds of employees in San Francisco, New York, Amsterdam and Hong Kong. I visited the New York office, and I did spot one physical piece of paper, but most of the people there were looking at screens.

Incomes for the wealthy are rising faster than incomes for the poor. There's also new social science research that suggests the rich might also be getting richer for another reason. And to talk about that, we're joined by NPR's social science correspondent, Shankar Vedantam. Shankar, hello as always. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So even more good news for people with a lot of money. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) It appears so, David. This has to do with the cost of things that people buy. I was talking with Xavier Jaravel. He's a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford. He's just analyzed the prices of goods in department stores, drugstores and grocery stores - massive amount of data. He finds an important difference in changes in the price of goods purchased by wealthy people and by the poor. Here he is. XAVIER JARAVEL: I found that the products purchased mainly by the poor were increasing in price much more quickly than those purchased by the wealthy. GREENE: He's talking about inflation here. Stuff that people who are poor are buying - the prices of that stuff is just rising much more quickly than other stuff? VEDANTAM: That's right. Now, obviously, he's not saying this applies to every single product on the market. But on average, he finds that inflation is rising faster for the poor than it does for the rich. JARAVEL: Inflation is 60 basis points lower. So it's a bit more than half a percentage point of inflation difference between high-income households who make above $100,000 a year - relative to low-income households who make below $30,000 a year. GREENE: Now, Shankar, explain this to me because we talk about the rate of inflation in a nation's economy. So I mean, to me, as a layman, I would expect all inflation to be sort of the same. Why the difference? VEDANTAM: Well, he thinks this is happening because of competition - or rather, the lack of competition - among manufacturers who make products for the rich and those who make products for the poor. So if you're a manufacturer, David, you're paying attention to who can afford to buy the stuff that you make. And you're also paying attention to your potential market. As income inequality has risen and wealthy people make more money, manufacturers start trying to acquire more of those customers because they are the ones with the disposable income. As more manufacturers try to compete for these customers, there's more competition and more innovation in these high-end product categories. More competition tends to hold prices down. On the other hand, if you're making products that are largely purchased by the poor, there's less room for growth in this market, which attracts fewer manufacturers, which, in turn, means less competition and eventually higher prices. GREENE: People have less money at the lower end. And so manufacturers are like, I'm not going to make money from that group. So I'm going to focus more on high-end. VEDANTAM: And it's not just about having less money. It's just about the rate at which the available market is increasing or holding static. So there are large numbers of poor people, of course. But the wealthy have become wealthier very fast in recent years. And so the potential disposable income that the wealthy have is growing very rapidly, which suggests that there's an appetite for manufacturers to reach those customers. GREENE: More competition, then, keeps the prices at the high-end down. Is there an example you could give us here? VEDANTAM: Yeah. One good example turns out to be beer. The size of the craft beer market, which caters to wealthier people, is exploding at about 20 percent a year. On the other hand, the market for big-name beers, like Miller, for example, is growing maybe 1 to 2 percent a year. Now, lots of manufacturers want a piece of the craft beer market. Jaravel told me that as a result of all the competition in the craft beer market, craft beer prices are rising more slowly than big-name beers, which are largely consumed by poorer people. So effectively, the rich are not just seeing their incomes rise more quickly than the poor. They're seeing the prices of the things they buy rise more slowly than do the poor - both of which, of course, collectively exacerbate income inequality. GREENE: You know, like a cruel irony here - it seems like. VEDANTAM: It does, indeed. GREENE: Shankar, thanks as always. VEDANTAM: Thank you, David. GREENE: That is a voice you hear often on this program, Shankar Vedantam, NPR's social science correspondent. He is also the host of a podcast that explores the unseen patterns in human behavior. It is called Hidden Brain. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  We know there is growing income inequality in the United States. Incomes for the wealthy are rising faster than incomes for the poor.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GREENE: Nice. Today, it is gravitational waves. Now, Einstein predicted that these waves must roll across the entire universe. But as NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports, it took 100 years to actually find one. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: In February, the announcement finally came, and it made headlines around the world. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DAVID REITZE: Ladies and gentlemen, we have detected gravitational waves. We did it. (APPLAUSE)BRUMFIEL: The waves came from two black holes, which collided long ago. The ripples fanned out across the fabric of space and time, distorting the very dimensions we live in. Now, fact is most of us didn't notice. So how did scientists detect them? To find out, I went to see where they did it. It's just off Interstate 12, in Livingston Parish, La. To get there, you head through town, past the Gold and Guns pawn shop and up a country road. There's a rusted, old pickup truck and another rusted, old pickup truck, even more rusted than the first one. Turn onto an empty lane lined with pine trees, and keep going. Oh, I think I see some buildings up ahead. This is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory That's kind of a mouthful, so scientists just call it LIGO. Physicist Joe Giaime is in charge here. He says measuring waves in space-time might sound complicated, but the basic concept is pretty simple. JOE GIAIME: The thing we're measuring is length. Everybody kind of knows what length is. BRUMFIEL: Because gravitational waves warp space, they literally change how long things are. And LIGO is basically the world's most complicated tape measurer. We walk up a little hill overlooking the machine. A drab, concrete pipe stretches off towards the flat Louisiana horizon. Giaime explains that this is one of LIGO's two arms. GIAIME: And the other one is - juts off from the main building at a - at a right angle from the one we're on. BRUMFIEL: So it's a giant L? GIAIME: It's a giant L. That's right. BRUMFIEL: When a gravitational wave passes by, one arm of the L gets a little shorter. The other one gets a little longer. The machine measures the difference. That's all there is to it, at least in theory. In practice, it's a lot tougher. By the time gravitational waves get to Earth, they stretch and shrink dimensions by less than a thousandth of the width of a subatomic particle. And on Earth, there are lots of bigger waves that can drown them out, like seismic waves from earthquakes. A big quake anywhere on the planet can set this whole machine shaking. GIAIME: And so we just stop and wait it out. BRUMFIEL: The machine is so sensitive, it can feel the vibrations from passing trucks, falling trees, even storms in faraway oceans. Overcoming all this background noise is the real trick to LIGO. And to see how they do that, we get into Giaime's car and set off on a road alongside the concrete tube. As we drive, he explains that inside the tube is a laser. The beam travels two-and-a-half miles to the end of the tunnel, where there's a mirror. Then, the laser bounces off the mirror and goes back. GIAIME: So it's pretty boring what's going on here in the middle. BRUMFIEL: The light's just going back and forth and back and forth, basically? GIAIME: That's right. BRUMFIEL: The laser light constantly monitors the length of the tube. We reach the end of the arm. There's a little building with a mirror inside. We head in. We have to wear hairnets and booties over our shoes. That's because these mirrors are perfectly adjusted and carefully controlled. GIAIME: Contamination can ruin all those things. BRUMFIEL: So basically don't touch anything. GIAIME: Well, you won't get anywhere near it. Don't worry about that (laughter). BRUMFIEL: We go through a second door. In this room, there's a big, steel tank. The mirror is inside. GIAIME: The mirror weighs about 100 pounds, I guess. BRUMFIEL: It hangs in a vacuum, isolated from the noisy world, just waiting for a gravitational wave to stretch the tube. The search started over a decade ago, but for a long time, LIGO didn't see anything. GIAIME: Up until last year, you know, we would give tours here to little kids, who, at the end of the tour, would look us in the eye and say, you know, so what have you seen? What have you measured? And the answer is nothing - nothing yet. BRUMFIEL: And Giaime began to get nervous. He had moments of doubt. GIAIME: I can certainly say, personally, that I was wondering whether maybe there was some misunderstanding about - about what was out there in the universe. BRUMFIEL: But he and the rest of the team kept at it, upgrading the lasers, tweaking the mirrors. And finally, on September 14 at 5:51 a. m. , a wave passed through the detector. The whole machine vibrated, like a giant tuning fork listening to space and time. (SOUNDBITE OF CHIRP)BRUMFIEL: That's it. That weird, little chirp is the space-time distortion changing the length of LIGO's tunnels. Moments later, an identical detector in Washington state picked it up, too. (SOUNDBITE OF CHIRP)BRUMFIEL: That's all that's left of the massive wave created when the two black holes collided billions of years ago. It's small now, but at the moment of the merger, the power released was greater than all the stars combined. It truly was the biggest wave in the universe. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News.

I'm Terry Gross. You may think you know who you are, but you don't really unless you're aware of the fact that there are trillions of microbes living on and in you. They affect your digestion, immunity, body weight and overall health. Scientists are researching what those microbes do and how we might be able to improve our health by manipulating the balance of those microbes. The ecosystem of microbes within humans and animals is the subject of the new book \"I Contain Multitudes\" by science writer Ed Yong. He writes about science for The Atlantic and writes a science blog hosted by National Geographic called \"Not Exactly Rocket Science. \"Ed Yong, welcome to FRESH AIR. So as you say, our body is really an ecosystem. What are some of the different communities of microbes on and in our bodies? ED YONG: Well, there are tens of trillions of them all together, but they vary from one part to the other because, for example, my forearm is a quite a dry environment. It's a bit parched like a desert whereas something like my mouth or the inside of my nose is a hot and humid environment that's more like a rain forest. And each of these places harbors a very different community of microbes. GROSS: And a lot of those bacteria - a lot of those microbes are good guys, helping your body do what it needs to do. But as you point out, if one of the good guy bacteria gets into the wrong spot, it becomes a bad guy. YONG: That's right. We've had this long-standing idea that microbes are germs, are enemies that we need to destroy lest they destroy us. But actually we're coming to realize that many of these microbes are profoundly important for our lives. But I wanted to get across in the book that there isn't really any such thing as a good microbe or a bad microbe. They just live with us. They are our partners in life and they can often do us tremendous amounts of good. They can help to digest our food and tune our immune system and protect us from disease. But if they get in the wrong place or if our relationship with them breaks down, then they might also do us harm. GROSS: So when we're talking about the microbes in the microbiome, obviously we're talking about bacteria. What else are we including in that? YONG: So bacteria form the majority of them, but there are also another group of microbes called Archaea, which look very similar but are actually very, very different. There are single-celled fungi. There are protists. There are viruses, too, in huge numbers. Some people might not think of them as part of the microbiome, but they are there, too, and they are incredibly influential. GROSS: I want to talk with you about probiotics. So many people take probiotics in the hopes of having a healthy gut. And among scientists who actually study the microbiome, which is the microbes living in the gut, it's actually pretty controversial whether probiotics accomplish anything. So let's start with what are probiotics supposed to do? YONG: So probiotics are products that contain beneficial microbes, and they have all sorts of health claims attached to them, but actually if you look at the evidence behind these products, they tend to be a bit medically underwhelming. So they're good for certain types of infectious diarrhea but not a huge amount else. And even regulators in the U. S. and the - and in Europe have taken a dim view of many of these health claims. And I think that's because probiotics contain typically small numbers of microbes, much fewer than already exist in your body. A lot of these species are being chosen for historical reasons because they're easy to manufacture and package, not because they're excellent at establishing themselves in the gut. And often they're very industrialized, very proprietary strains. You know, they enter and then they disappear or they pass through. They don't have a huge amount of impact. And yet, the idea behind probiotics, the idea that we might be able to give ourselves beneficial bacteria that improve our health, that idea has a lot of potential, and it is solid. But we are still in the very early stages of working out how to do this. It is about engineering an entire ecosystem. It's about - it's as complicated some say, like, changing a coral reef or a grassland. It's a - it's about sculpting a world. GROSS: So when we take a probiotic that we bought in a store, are the bacteria in that probiotic likely to repopulate in our gut? YONG: No, they're not. Typically, they don't manage to establish themselves, and they don't last for a long time, so they're not very good colonizers. GROSS: And are they microbes that typically live in our gut? YONG: They're microbes that can be found in the gut. But they're not - they're not the A-listers. They're not the ones that are especially common or especially good at colonizing the gut. GROSS: What about yogurt, which usually has active cultures in it, probiotic cultures? YONG: Same thing. Studies have shown that you swallow them and those bacteria then disappear. They - I think of them as, like, a breeze that blows between two open windows. It might rattle a couple of objects in the way, but it doesn't have a lasting impact. GROSS: You're depressing me. (LAUGHTER)YONG: I'm sorry. GROSS: OK. When you take antibiotics, the antibiotics kill off a lot of the bacteria in your body, including ones that you would prefer to have and some of those bacteria that you'd prefer to have live in your gut. And I think that's at least one of the reasons why taking antibiotics can lead to diarrhea because it kills off some of the bacteria that keeps your gut in balance. And that's usually a time when even doctors who don't especially believe in probiotics still recommend that you take it. So what's the common wisdom now among scientists who are actually studying this about the value of taking probiotics as an antidote to antibiotics? YONG: Well, so some types of antibiotic-associated diarrhea involve this very nasty, weedy bacterium called Clostridium difficile, or C. diff, which is very good in invading guts that have been repeatedly assaulted with antibiotics and can cause recurring intractable cases of diarrhea. And actually one of the best treatments for C. diff - oh, and in fact, one of the most successful microbiome-based treatments we have is a thing called a fecal transplant. A fecal transplant is almost exactly what it sounds like. You're trying to take the stool from a healthy donor and implant it into the gut of someone who's sick. And you are doing that almost as a way of resetting their inner ecosystem, of replacing a community that has been faltering, much like trying to re-turf a lawn that's been overrun with dandelions or other weeds. GROSS: And how is that being done now? It's been in its experimental stages, but I think they're kind of perfecting ways of doing it without being - without it being as gross as it sounds. YONG: So the traditional way is to use actual stool and it can be delivered either up the bum or down the nose via a tube. And, you know, it does have this ick factor attached to it. But it is also spectacularly effective at treating infections of Clostridium difficile - C. diff - this very invasive, weedy bacterium that can cause recurring severe diarrhea. In one now classic study, some 20 - or 27 percent of people who took a common antibiotic were cured of C. diff infections whereas those who receive fecal transplant, about 94 percent of them were cured. So we're in this weird position where the number one treatment for C. diff is a number two. And. . . GROSS: (Laughter). YONG: . . . Fecal transplants are - have been - have done wonders for this particular condition. Whether it works for other diseases - so in - so following the successes with C. diff, scientists and doctors have tried fecal transplants for a large number of other conditions that have been linked to the microbiomes, things like inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome. And there, the results are less - certainly less successful, a bit less consistent. And that's probably because those types of diseases - those ecosystems inside us - are more difficult to reset. So others - other researchers are now trying to take the concept behind fecal transplants and refine it to pull out the bacteria and other microbes that are conferring the benefits to the recipients without having to bother with the gross fecal bit. So several companies have developed pills that are - you can think of them either as, like, pared-down stool or souped-up probiotics, right? So they are communities of microbes that are meant to replicate a lot of the benefits of doing a stool. But recently, one of the most leading contenders for these fake poop pills flunked out of a major clinical trial, which I think emphasizes how little we know still about why this age-old procedure actually works and how early we are in the process of actually manipulating our microbiomes in order to improve our health. GROSS: Did you say this was an age-old procedure? YONG: Yeah. Well, it first started - I think the first records were from China several centuries ago. And people have sort of rediscovered it time and again. And it's only become - I'm not going to say popular - but certainly more prominent in the last 10 - maybe even five - years or so. GROSS: So why is it that a fecal transplant might be more effective than a probiotic pill? YONG: So there, you're using a much wider community of microbes. And you are giving them in large numbers. And you're using the ones that are naturally there in the gut anyway. So it's a much more realistic community to implant in a person. But, you know, the real answer to this question is we still don't entirely know. We don't really know which components of stool - which members of that community - are really doing good, how they might interact with the native microbes in a recipient's gut or with the gut itself, with the immune system of the host. There are still so many questions that we have left to answer. All we know is that for this one particular condition, C. diff infections, it seems to be a very, very good treatment with few known side effects, if any. And that's very cheap. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is science writer Ed Yong. His new book is called \"I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us And A Grander View Of Life. \" Let's take a short break. And then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is science writer Ed Yong. His new book is called \"I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us And A Grander View Of Life. \" He also writes about science for The Atlantic and has a science blog for National Geographic called \"Not Exactly Rocket Science. \"Microbes can contribute to our immune system. And you describe how microbes can trigger inflammation. And microbes can also suppress inflammation. Can you give us a sense of the interplay between those two sets of microbes and how they regulate our immune system, for better and for worse? YONG: Right. So we typically think of the immune system as this militaristic force that defends us from the microbes in the world around us. And yet we see that certain types of microbes help to build parts of the immune system. And then they also calibrate it. So they strike this balance between reacting - between protecting ourselves from infections - but also not overreacting. So they help - some species help to stop the immune system from going berserk at harmless things in our environment like pollen or dust, things that might trigger allergies. And that balance between inflammation and anti-inflammation is very much affected by our microbes. They set that tipping point, much like the thermostat in my house might control the temperature of a room and keep it stable. GROSS: So this interaction between microbes that suppress inflammation and those that trigger it are being studied in germ-free mice, mice that are meant to have a controlled environment within them because they're germ free. How do you create a germ-free mouse? YONG: You raise them in the sterile isolators, these plastic bubbles that are completely disconnected from the microbial world. The mice are the only things living inside them. They have sterile food, sterile water. Anything that's put in gets sterilized before it's connected to these chambers. And I think that makes these mice some of the strangest animals on the planet. I visited one of the facilities that raises them. And I held one not with my bare hands but with this black rubber glove that protrudes into their plastic bubble. And this is an animal that, unlike anything else - unlike you or me or an elephant or an - anything - has no microbe. It's like a silhouette that hasn't been filled in yet. And because of that, it has a lot of problems. It has different - it has problems with its bones, its blood vessels, its gut, its behavior. It testifies, I think, to just how important microbes are for sculpting and shaping our bodies and how much can go wrong if we live our lives in their absence. GROSS: So what kind of experiments on immunity and inflammation are being conducted on these germ-free mice? YONG: And so, for example, you can give them specific microbes and see which types of immune cells rise to the fore, like what - whether you see an inflammatory or anti-inflammatory response. And we can see that certain microbes can actually tune down inflammation which is an odd concept because I think we think of microbes as foreign, as other, as things that trigger information. Whereas we see with rodent experiments that some species that live with us are actually capable of quenching inflammatory fires, so they are capable of calming the immune system and saying I come in peace. GROSS: What are the implications of this for autoimmune diseases, diseases in which the body attacks healthy body cells? YONG: So theres a growing body of evidence suggesting that early exposures to a wide range of microbes is important for carefully building and calibrating our immune systems to strike that balance between immune reactions and not going nuts at the things in the world around us. And, perhaps, by avoiding contact with microbes either by living in urban environments or by sanitizing our worlds too much, we are breaking our contact with all of these old friends that we rely upon to tune our immunity, leaving us ill-prepared for dealing with all the challenges of the wider world, for dealing with all the stuff that might then trigger an immune response. GROSS: What you're talking about, too, here is the theory that when children are born - when babies are born and they pass through the vaginal canal, they get exposed to a whole set of microbes that a baby needs to develop a healthy microbiome and that babies who are delivered through a C-section do not get exposed to the same microbes. Can you talk a little bit about that and what the latest thinking on that is? YONG: Sure. So the womb is a sterile environment and we - and babies first encounter microbes when they pass through the vaginal canal during birth, and they set the tone for all the other microbes that then colonize the child. If you are born through a C-section, you encounter a different set of microbes that might come from say the skin or the hospital environment. So we see different communities in babies that are born from different roots. Now, what that means for a child's future health is still very much unclear. We see from studies in adults that people who were born through C-sections or through normal vaginal roots don't actually end up with vastly different communities of microbes on their bodies. So it seems that in the long run, a lot of these differences shake themselves out. But whether those temporary differences can affect our health, whether they change the way our body develops at a very crucial point in our lives is very much an open question. We don't know the answers to that yet. GROSS: Well, I'm glad that the C-section babies seem to catch up because a lot of women have to have C-sections, and I'd hate to think that they have to feel guilty that their babies aren't going to have healthy microbiomes as a result of that. YONG: Right. I don't want to demonize anything, and I don't think microbiome science is in this - is in a mature enough state to make people worry or feel guilty about their health choices yet or their life decisions. And it's helpful to think of the body as these sets of grand ecosystems. You know, if you change a jungle or a grassland, you know, it's not going to go wildly off course through simple means. Often, you need to ding these things multiple times from multiple stresses, say, pollution or fire or whatever before they go - they shift into an irreversible new state. So ecosystems are resilient. They can absorb a lot of change, and the same is true for the microbiome. If you ding it with, say, antibiotics, if you change it through, say, a C-section. It will move. It will change, but often it bounces back. And the big questions are, you know, what sorts of changes do you need in order to really change it? And do those little changes matter in the short term? And I think we don't know. GROSS: My guest is Ed Yong, author of the new book \"I Contain Multitudes\" about the trillions of microbes that live in and on us. After we take a short break, we'll talk about the microbes in breast milk and how bacteria are being used to prevent mosquito-borne illnesses like Zika and dengue fever. And as the Olympics near the conclusion, Milo Miles has a review of an album from a Brazilian bossa nova ensemble. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Ed Yong, author of the new book \"I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us And A Grander View Of Life. \" It's about the trillions of microbes that live in and on humans and animals and how this ecosystem affects our digestion, immunity and general health. When we left off, we were talking about how this ecosystem is affected by the microbes you're exposed to as an infant. For example, scientists are studying how babies are colonized by bacteria during childbirth as the babies pass through the vaginal canal. I think scientists are also investigating the difference between breast feeding and bottle feeding when it comes to developing a healthy microbiome in an infant. What are some of the differences between the bacterial makeup or the microbe make - microbial makeup of breast milk - human breast milk - versus cow's milk? YONG: Well, so human breast milk seems like a very straightforward way of nourishing a baby. But actually about 10 percent of breast milk consists of these sugars, these complex sugars that babies can't digest at all. And they are there to nourish the microbes in the baby's gut. There are specific strains, including one called the. . . GROSS: I'm going to stop you here, so part of breast milk is to feed the microbes (laughter). YONG: That's right, yeah. GROSS: That's kind of fascinating. YONG: It's amazing, isn't it? I think this is why I love the science of the microbiome because it takes very familiar things like breast feeding and casts them in a completely different light. So breast milk isn't just a way of nourishing an infant. It's a way of nourishing babies' first microbes. It's really a way of engineering an entire world inside a baby's body. You know, breastfeeding mother is a sculptor of ecosystems. GROSS: And cow's milk doesn't have that? YONG: Human milk, for reasons that are still unclear, seems to have a much wider range of these sugars than the milk of any other mammal. There are very specific strains of microbes, including one called B infantis that have evolved to digest these sugars with great efficiency. So in the guts of breastfed infants these microbes tend to dominate. And they have benefits for the baby, too. They feed the baby's gut cells in return. They help to seal up the lining of the gut, and they reduce inflammation. So they have - they have tremendous benefits. And by nourishing those microbes, mothers are also helping their own kids. GROSS: I want to get back to talking about the germ-free mice and the use of mice that are living in germ-free bubbles so that scientists can experiment on them, exposing them to certain microbes to see what the response is. One of the things that scientists are studying in this kind of germ-free mouse is obesity and body weight. Would you give us a sense of the kinds of experiments being done relating to body weight with these germ-free mice? YONG: Sure. So about 10 years ago, in some very classic experiments, scientists took microbes that were from obese and lean individuals and put them in the sterile mice. So the mice that received the obese community's put on more weight than their counterparts who received the lean ones. And that was a seminal finding. It really showed that perhaps these microbes aren't just, you know, going along for the ride. Maybe they're actually grabbing the wheel now and then. Maybe they are seriously influencing our weight, the way we deal with the energy in our food. The thing is that the links between obesity and the microbiome are actually very complicated. And even though there's been 10 years of research, there are still a lot of things we don't know. So people have found differences in the microbe communities between people who are fat and lean. So you get different species that rise to the fore in different groups. But there aren't consistent differences between studies. So it's still really hard to say what, say, a, quote, unquote, \"obese microbiome\" looks like, let alone how you might want to manipulate it. And one critical study that was done, again with these germ-free mice, showed that if you take the microbes from a lean individual and put them in a rodent that has put on too much weight, then that rodent will lose weight but only if it also eats a traditionally healthy diet that's full of plants and fiber. And I think that shows that the microbiome might be deeply influenced in our lives, but it doesn't provide any easy solutions to health problems. When the first wave of studies came out about 10 years ago, headlines were full of things like, you know, blame microbes for your weight or maybe we'll be able to take some probiotic that immediately causes us to lose weight. And I think it's nowhere near that simple. The microbiome is not a panacea for our health problems. It doesn't explain them all in their entirety. I think it just shows how important microbes are in our lives and what a strong influence they have. GROSS: And this is why someone - and I forget who it is - gives an award that's named the Overselling the Microbiome Award (laughter). YONG: (Laughter) That's right, yeah. His name is Jonathan Eisen. He's a wonderful microbiologist. He's a true champion, an evangelist for microbes. But he's also very skeptical, and I think with good reason for a lot of the claims that are surrounding the microbiome. This is one of the most fashionable areas, the hottest areas of modern biology. And the microbiome has been linked to all sorts of health problems. But a lot of those studies are still correlative. We still don't know whether the microbes are leading to the disorders, whether they're a consequence of them, whether it's both or neither. And we are still at this very early stage of understanding our partnerships with the microbes that share our lives. We know they're important. But how important are they? And in what ways, and how might we be able to influence them? GROSS: So when it comes to microbiome research, it seems like we're still kind of in the infancy of it. We know enough to know this is a really promising field. We might learn a lot about foods to eat and not eat, about things to expose ourselves and not to expose ourselves to. We might find new cures for autoimmune diseases. But right now, it seems like it's still in the formative stages, very experimental. YONG: Yeah, very much so. We've known about microbes for over 350 years. But the science of the human microbiome has really only taken off in the last decade or so. And there's so much we don't know. We don't still have a full catalog of the species that live inside us. We still don't really understand what makes my microbiome different to yours. What explains those variations between people - much less what a good microbiome looks like or how you might get to that stage. But I think the potential there is huge because the microbiome is theoretically very flexible. We should be able to change it. We just don't quite know how yet. And maybe one of the quicker wins with microbiome science might be to use the microbiome as a sort of diagnostic tool, of looking at it and say what you're more likely to develop - this disease or that disorder - or to use it to influence our treatment. So we know that microbes within us affect how well medicines work in our body. We know that a lot of different drugs, from the hottest new cancer immunotherapy drugs to obvious things like acetaminophen can work in some people and not in others because of which microbes they carry. And maybe we might also be able to find ways of influencing the microbiome without needing to add or subtract strains. So there's one group that does a lot of work on heart disease. And we give - if you have a high risk of heart disease, your doctor might prescribe you a statin, which is a drug that's designed to target enzymes involved in cholesterol metabolism that are made by your own body. But bacteria can also affect the way you deal with cholesterol, and they could also contribute to the risk of heart disease in that way. And now some - one group of scientists has developed a molecule that can stop these bacteria from leading to rises in cholesterol. So maybe in the future you might get a combination of two drugs from your doctor, a statin to treat the human half of you and another chemical to affect the microbial half. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is science writer Ed Yong. His new book is called \"I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us And A Grander View Of Life. \" Let's take a short break. Then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is science writer Ed Yong. His new book is called \"I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us And A Grander View Of Life. \" He also writes about science for The Atlantic and does a science blog for National Geographic called \"Not Exactly Rocket Science. \" Not everybody has a favorite microbe, but you do (laughter). YONG: Yes. GROSS: Tell us what it is. YONG: I do. It is called Wolbachia. It was discovered in 1924, and it was found inside a common brown mosquito by two scientists, Hertig and Wolbach. And for decades, no one knew what it did or how common it was, whether it was important. It was largely neglected. And then scientists realized that actually it's incredibly common. It's not found in humans, but it is found in some 4 in 10 species of insects and other arthropods, which are themselves the most numerous and most diverse animals on the planet. So Wolbachia is extraordinarily successful, and it does all sorts of incredible things. So in some hosts, it is a parasite that has a thing out for males because Wolbachia only passes down from mothers to daughters, and so males are a complete dead end to it. In some - in some species, like woodlice, it converts males into females. In others, it kills males outright so that the females outnumber males by 100 to 1. And in some wasps, Wolbachia allows them to reproduce by cloning themselves, so they have no need for males whatsoever. But in some cases, this thing is also an ally. It is a mutualist. It allows some caterpillars that eat leaves to stop the leaves from turning yellow. It actually holds back the progress of fall so that these - its hosts can have more to eat. And it has properties that are really important to us humans. So Wolbachia is found in parasitic worms that cause debilitating tropical diseases like elephantiasis and river blindness. And by finding drugs that can kill Wolbachia, scientists are finally looking for and discovering effective ways of curing and treating these illnesses. GROSS: But what about mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and Zika? There seems to be some relevance there, too. YONG: That's right. Wolbachia turns out to be a really powerful way of controlling mosquito-borne diseases. So scientists in Australia have spent about 25 years trying to load this bacterium into Aedes aegypti, the tiger mosquito, the one that spreads dengue and yellow fever and infamously now Zika. And they've been trying to do this because Wolbachia seems to prevent these insects from transmitting the viruses behind these diseases. And Wolbachia is so good at spreading through a wild population that if you release a small number of these infected mosquitoes, they ought to fly off into the distance and then within months Wolbachia should be everywhere, thus rendering this entire community of insects unable to spread disease. They - the bacterium changes them from vectors into dead ends. And this was tried for the first time in 2011 in several suburbs of Australia. And this team showed indeed that Wolbachia rises to dominance in these natural populations, and they're now trying this approach in big megacities around the world, in places like Brazil and Colombia and Indonesia and Vietnam. And there are so many. . . GROSS: Places with mosquito issues. YONG: Places with mosquito issues, places with severe dengue problems. The approach was initially developed in order to eliminate dengue fever, but it seems to work against Zika, as well against a lot of other mosquito-borne diseases, and it has tremendous advantages. The - unlike, say, insecticides, which are toxic and need to be continuously resprayed, Wolbachia in these mosquitoes seems to have no problems, no safety risks. And it sustains itself. Once you release the insects, they go off on their business and you don't need to keep on replenishing them. GROSS: So you're not messing with the mosquitoes' genetics. You're introducing a bacteria? YONG: That's right. There is no genetic modification. These mosquitoes are not GMOs to speak of. They've been simply united with a bacterium that is already present in a large proportion of other insects. GROSS: So now that you see your body as housing huge communities of microbes, how has that changed your life? Has it changed, like, what you eat or how you behave or what you expose yourself to? YONG: I'm certainly less fearful of the microbial world than I would have been 20 years ago. You know, I don't - I wash my hands of course, but I don't over-scrub them. I don't use sanitizers. But, you know, really what writing this book has given me is a broader perspective of the world around me. So I always loved the natural world. You know, I was that kid who went to zoos all the time. I would watch wildlife documentaries and read books about nature. And now I understand that all this biology which I thought I knew, all these creatures, these elephants and hawks and fish that I was fascinated by, these things I could see with my eyes, are actually deeply and profoundly influenced by things that I cannot see. And I know that if I go to a zoo now that every animal and every visitor in that zoo is in fact a zoo in its own right. GROSS: Give us an example of an animal that you see differently now. YONG: There are - in the very deep oceans, there are environments called hydrothermal vents, these belching chimneys of superheated water. And there's a worm that lives in these vents called riftia and it's - it can grow a few metres long, and it has these beautiful red gills that look like someone's pushed a tube of lipstick out all the way. And this worm lives in this environment, which just hasn't got any food, but it has microbes in its body. A lot of its body, probably the majority of it, consists of bacteria. They grab minerals from the vent environment and use these to create nutrients. And that is entirely how the worm sustains itself. This animal has lost its mouth and it's gut because why bother having a digestive system at all when you don't need to eat when you have microbes inside you to provide you with all your energy? And I think that's just a stunning example of how intimate the animals can evolve to rely upon their microbes. This is a creature that would not be able to survive at all without the multitudes inside it. GROSS: Don't you wonder what the world looks like from the point of view of the microbes that you write about, like, if one of the microbes was writing this book, how different it would be (laughter)? YONG: I feel like we wouldn't even get a mention. GROSS: (Laughter). YONG: We are just this footnote, this icing on the - on this gigantic microbial cake. You know, in the book, I talk about how if you condense the history of the Earth into a single calendar year, so the Earth was created in the first of January and we are now in the 31 of December just before the stroke of midnight, then humans arose about 30 minutes ago. And even all the multicellular creatures, the things we can see, all the animals and plants we're familiar with, only arose a couple of months back whereas bacteria probably first evolved, say, at the start of March. So for the vast majority of life on Earth, everything was microbial. You know, bacteria have been the rulers of the planet for most of the Earth's history, and they are still the rulers of the planet. They still govern the movements of chemicals all around the world. They are in every possible habitat. They are omnipresent, and they are hugely influential. And in many ways, our bodies, the bodies of every other animals or our cities that we are so proud of, all of these are just more habitats for bacteria and other microbes to inhabit. GROSS: Ed Yong, thank you so much. YONG: Thank you very much for having me. GROSS: Ed Yong's new book about the microbes within us is called \"I Contain Multitudes. \" After we take a short break, Milo Miles will review an album by a Brazilian bossa nova ensemble. This is FRESH AIR. TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. You may think you know who you are, but you don't really unless you're aware of the fact that there are trillions of microbes living on and in you. They affect your digestion, immunity, body weight and overall health. Scientists are researching what those microbes do and how we might be able to improve our health by manipulating the balance of those microbes. The ecosystem of microbes within humans and animals is the subject of the new book \"I Contain Multitudes\" by science writer Ed Yong. He writes about science for The Atlantic and writes a science blog hosted by National Geographic called \"Not Exactly Rocket Science. \" Ed Yong, welcome to FRESH AIR. So as you say, our body is really an ecosystem. What are some of the different communities of microbes on and in our bodies? ED YONG: Well, there are tens of trillions of them all together, but they vary from one part to the other because, for example, my forearm is a quite a dry environment. It's a bit parched like a desert whereas something like my mouth or the inside of my nose is a hot and humid environment that's more like a rain forest. And each of these places harbors a very different community of microbes. GROSS: And a lot of those bacteria - a lot of those microbes are good guys, helping your body do what it needs to do. But as you point out, if one of the good guy bacteria gets into the wrong spot, it becomes a bad guy. YONG: That's right. We've had this long-standing idea that microbes are germs, are enemies that we need to destroy lest they destroy us. But actually we're coming to realize that many of these microbes are profoundly important for our lives. But I wanted to get across in the book that there isn't really any such thing as a good microbe or a bad microbe. They just live with us. They are our partners in life and they can often do us tremendous amounts of good. They can help to digest our food and tune our immune system and protect us from disease. But if they get in the wrong place or if our relationship with them breaks down, then they might also do us harm. GROSS: So when we're talking about the microbes in the microbiome, obviously we're talking about bacteria. What else are we including in that? YONG: So bacteria form the majority of them, but there are also another group of microbes called Archaea, which look very similar but are actually very, very different. There are single-celled fungi. There are protists. There are viruses, too, in huge numbers. Some people might not think of them as part of the microbiome, but they are there, too, and they are incredibly influential. GROSS: I want to talk with you about probiotics. So many people take probiotics in the hopes of having a healthy gut. And among scientists who actually study the microbiome, which is the microbes living in the gut, it's actually pretty controversial whether probiotics accomplish anything. So let's start with what are probiotics supposed to do? YONG: So probiotics are products that contain beneficial microbes, and they have all sorts of health claims attached to them, but actually if you look at the evidence behind these products, they tend to be a bit medically underwhelming. So they're good for certain types of infectious diarrhea but not a huge amount else. And even regulators in the U. S. and the - and in Europe have taken a dim view of many of these health claims. And I think that's because probiotics contain typically small numbers of microbes, much fewer than already exist in your body. A lot of these species are being chosen for historical reasons because they're easy to manufacture and package, not because they're excellent at establishing themselves in the gut. And often they're very industrialized, very proprietary strains. You know, they enter and then they disappear or they pass through. They don't have a huge amount of impact. And yet, the idea behind probiotics, the idea that we might be able to give ourselves beneficial bacteria that improve our health, that idea has a lot of potential, and it is solid. But we are still in the very early stages of working out how to do this. It is about engineering an entire ecosystem. It's about - it's as complicated some say, like, changing a coral reef or a grassland. It's a - it's about sculpting a world. GROSS: So when we take a probiotic that we bought in a store, are the bacteria in that probiotic likely to repopulate in our gut? YONG: No, they're not. Typically, they don't manage to establish themselves, and they don't last for a long time, so they're not very good colonizers. GROSS: And are they microbes that typically live in our gut? YONG: They're microbes that can be found in the gut. But they're not - they're not the A-listers. They're not the ones that are especially common or especially good at colonizing the gut. GROSS: What about yogurt, which usually has active cultures in it, probiotic cultures? YONG: Same thing. Studies have shown that you swallow them and those bacteria then disappear. They - I think of them as, like, a breeze that blows between two open windows. It might rattle a couple of objects in the way, but it doesn't have a lasting impact. GROSS: You're depressing me. (LAUGHTER) YONG: I'm sorry. GROSS: OK. When you take antibiotics, the antibiotics kill off a lot of the bacteria in your body, including ones that you would prefer to have and some of those bacteria that you'd prefer to have live in your gut. And I think that's at least one of the reasons why taking antibiotics can lead to diarrhea because it kills off some of the bacteria that keeps your gut in balance. And that's usually a time when even doctors who don't especially believe in probiotics still recommend that you take it. So what's the common wisdom now among scientists who are actually studying this about the value of taking probiotics as an antidote to antibiotics? YONG: Well, so some types of antibiotic-associated diarrhea involve this very nasty, weedy bacterium called Clostridium difficile, or C. diff, which is very good in invading guts that have been repeatedly assaulted with antibiotics and can cause recurring intractable cases of diarrhea. And actually one of the best treatments for C. diff - oh, and in fact, one of the most successful microbiome-based treatments we have is a thing called a fecal transplant. A fecal transplant is almost exactly what it sounds like. You're trying to take the stool from a healthy donor and implant it into the gut of someone who's sick. And you are doing that almost as a way of resetting their inner ecosystem, of replacing a community that has been faltering, much like trying to re-turf a lawn that's been overrun with dandelions or other weeds. GROSS: And how is that being done now? It's been in its experimental stages, but I think they're kind of perfecting ways of doing it without being - without it being as gross as it sounds. YONG: So the traditional way is to use actual stool and it can be delivered either up the bum or down the nose via a tube. And, you know, it does have this ick factor attached to it. But it is also spectacularly effective at treating infections of Clostridium difficile - C. diff - this very invasive, weedy bacterium that can cause recurring severe diarrhea. In one now classic study, some 20 - or 27 percent of people who took a common antibiotic were cured of C. diff infections whereas those who receive fecal transplant, about 94 percent of them were cured. So we're in this weird position where the number one treatment for C. diff is a number two. And. . . GROSS: (Laughter). YONG: . . . Fecal transplants are - have been - have done wonders for this particular condition. Whether it works for other diseases - so in - so following the successes with C. diff, scientists and doctors have tried fecal transplants for a large number of other conditions that have been linked to the microbiomes, things like inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome. And there, the results are less - certainly less successful, a bit less consistent. And that's probably because those types of diseases - those ecosystems inside us - are more difficult to reset. So others - other researchers are now trying to take the concept behind fecal transplants and refine it to pull out the bacteria and other microbes that are conferring the benefits to the recipients without having to bother with the gross fecal bit. So several companies have developed pills that are - you can think of them either as, like, pared-down stool or souped-up probiotics, right? So they are communities of microbes that are meant to replicate a lot of the benefits of doing a stool. But recently, one of the most leading contenders for these fake poop pills flunked out of a major clinical trial, which I think emphasizes how little we know still about why this age-old procedure actually works and how early we are in the process of actually manipulating our microbiomes in order to improve our health. GROSS: Did you say this was an age-old procedure? YONG: Yeah. Well, it first started - I think the first records were from China several centuries ago. And people have sort of rediscovered it time and again. And it's only become - I'm not going to say popular - but certainly more prominent in the last 10 - maybe even five - years or so. GROSS: So why is it that a fecal transplant might be more effective than a probiotic pill? YONG: So there, you're using a much wider community of microbes. And you are giving them in large numbers. And you're using the ones that are naturally there in the gut anyway. So it's a much more realistic community to implant in a person. But, you know, the real answer to this question is we still don't entirely know. We don't really know which components of stool - which members of that community - are really doing good, how they might interact with the native microbes in a recipient's gut or with the gut itself, with the immune system of the host. There are still so many questions that we have left to answer. All we know is that for this one particular condition, C. diff infections, it seems to be a very, very good treatment with few known side effects, if any. And that's very cheap. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is science writer Ed Yong. His new book is called \"I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us And A Grander View Of Life. \" Let's take a short break. And then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is science writer Ed Yong. His new book is called \"I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us And A Grander View Of Life. \" He also writes about science for The Atlantic and has a science blog for National Geographic called \"Not Exactly Rocket Science. \" Microbes can contribute to our immune system. And you describe how microbes can trigger inflammation. And microbes can also suppress inflammation. Can you give us a sense of the interplay between those two sets of microbes and how they regulate our immune system, for better and for worse? YONG: Right. So we typically think of the immune system as this militaristic force that defends us from the microbes in the world around us. And yet we see that certain types of microbes help to build parts of the immune system. And then they also calibrate it. So they strike this balance between reacting - between protecting ourselves from infections - but also not overreacting. So they help - some species help to stop the immune system from going berserk at harmless things in our environment like pollen or dust, things that might trigger allergies. And that balance between inflammation and anti-inflammation is very much affected by our microbes. They set that tipping point, much like the thermostat in my house might control the temperature of a room and keep it stable. GROSS: So this interaction between microbes that suppress inflammation and those that trigger it are being studied in germ-free mice, mice that are meant to have a controlled environment within them because they're germ free. How do you create a germ-free mouse? YONG: You raise them in the sterile isolators, these plastic bubbles that are completely disconnected from the microbial world. The mice are the only things living inside them. They have sterile food, sterile water. Anything that's put in gets sterilized before it's connected to these chambers. And I think that makes these mice some of the strangest animals on the planet. I visited one of the facilities that raises them. And I held one not with my bare hands but with this black rubber glove that protrudes into their plastic bubble. And this is an animal that, unlike anything else - unlike you or me or an elephant or an - anything - has no microbe. It's like a silhouette that hasn't been filled in yet. And because of that, it has a lot of problems. It has different - it has problems with its bones, its blood vessels, its gut, its behavior. It testifies, I think, to just how important microbes are for sculpting and shaping our bodies and how much can go wrong if we live our lives in their absence. GROSS: So what kind of experiments on immunity and inflammation are being conducted on these germ-free mice? YONG: And so, for example, you can give them specific microbes and see which types of immune cells rise to the fore, like what - whether you see an inflammatory or anti-inflammatory response. And we can see that certain microbes can actually tune down inflammation which is an odd concept because I think we think of microbes as foreign, as other, as things that trigger information. Whereas we see with rodent experiments that some species that live with us are actually capable of quenching inflammatory fires, so they are capable of calming the immune system and saying I come in peace. GROSS: What are the implications of this for autoimmune diseases, diseases in which the body attacks healthy body cells? YONG: So theres a growing body of evidence suggesting that early exposures to a wide range of microbes is important for carefully building and calibrating our immune systems to strike that balance between immune reactions and not going nuts at the things in the world around us. And, perhaps, by avoiding contact with microbes either by living in urban environments or by sanitizing our worlds too much, we are breaking our contact with all of these old friends that we rely upon to tune our immunity, leaving us ill-prepared for dealing with all the challenges of the wider world, for dealing with all the stuff that might then trigger an immune response. GROSS: What you're talking about, too, here is the theory that when children are born - when babies are born and they pass through the vaginal canal, they get exposed to a whole set of microbes that a baby needs to develop a healthy microbiome and that babies who are delivered through a C-section do not get exposed to the same microbes. Can you talk a little bit about that and what the latest thinking on that is? YONG: Sure. So the womb is a sterile environment and we - and babies first encounter microbes when they pass through the vaginal canal during birth, and they set the tone for all the other microbes that then colonize the child. If you are born through a C-section, you encounter a different set of microbes that might come from say the skin or the hospital environment. So we see different communities in babies that are born from different roots. Now, what that means for a child's future health is still very much unclear. We see from studies in adults that people who were born through C-sections or through normal vaginal roots don't actually end up with vastly different communities of microbes on their bodies. So it seems that in the long run, a lot of these differences shake themselves out. But whether those temporary differences can affect our health, whether they change the way our body develops at a very crucial point in our lives is very much an open question. We don't know the answers to that yet. GROSS: Well, I'm glad that the C-section babies seem to catch up because a lot of women have to have C-sections, and I'd hate to think that they have to feel guilty that their babies aren't going to have healthy microbiomes as a result of that. YONG: Right. I don't want to demonize anything, and I don't think microbiome science is in this - is in a mature enough state to make people worry or feel guilty about their health choices yet or their life decisions. And it's helpful to think of the body as these sets of grand ecosystems. You know, if you change a jungle or a grassland, you know, it's not going to go wildly off course through simple means. Often, you need to ding these things multiple times from multiple stresses, say, pollution or fire or whatever before they go - they shift into an irreversible new state. So ecosystems are resilient. They can absorb a lot of change, and the same is true for the microbiome. If you ding it with, say, antibiotics, if you change it through, say, a C-section. It will move. It will change, but often it bounces back. And the big questions are, you know, what sorts of changes do you need in order to really change it? And do those little changes matter in the short term? And I think we don't know. GROSS: My guest is Ed Yong, author of the new book \"I Contain Multitudes\" about the trillions of microbes that live in and on us. After we take a short break, we'll talk about the microbes in breast milk and how bacteria are being used to prevent mosquito-borne illnesses like Zika and dengue fever. And as the Olympics near the conclusion, Milo Miles has a review of an album from a Brazilian bossa nova ensemble. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Ed Yong, author of the new book \"I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us And A Grander View Of Life. \" It's about the trillions of microbes that live in and on humans and animals and how this ecosystem affects our digestion, immunity and general health. When we left off, we were talking about how this ecosystem is affected by the microbes you're exposed to as an infant. For example, scientists are studying how babies are colonized by bacteria during childbirth as the babies pass through the vaginal canal. I think scientists are also investigating the difference between breast feeding and bottle feeding when it comes to developing a healthy microbiome in an infant. What are some of the differences between the bacterial makeup or the microbe make - microbial makeup of breast milk - human breast milk - versus cow's milk? YONG: Well, so human breast milk seems like a very straightforward way of nourishing a baby. But actually about 10 percent of breast milk consists of these sugars, these complex sugars that babies can't digest at all. And they are there to nourish the microbes in the baby's gut. There are specific strains, including one called the. . . GROSS: I'm going to stop you here, so part of breast milk is to feed the microbes (laughter). YONG: That's right, yeah. GROSS: That's kind of fascinating. YONG: It's amazing, isn't it? I think this is why I love the science of the microbiome because it takes very familiar things like breast feeding and casts them in a completely different light. So breast milk isn't just a way of nourishing an infant. It's a way of nourishing babies' first microbes. It's really a way of engineering an entire world inside a baby's body. You know, breastfeeding mother is a sculptor of ecosystems. GROSS: And cow's milk doesn't have that? YONG: Human milk, for reasons that are still unclear, seems to have a much wider range of these sugars than the milk of any other mammal. There are very specific strains of microbes, including one called B infantis that have evolved to digest these sugars with great efficiency. So in the guts of breastfed infants these microbes tend to dominate. And they have benefits for the baby, too. They feed the baby's gut cells in return. They help to seal up the lining of the gut, and they reduce inflammation. So they have - they have tremendous benefits. And by nourishing those microbes, mothers are also helping their own kids. GROSS: I want to get back to talking about the germ-free mice and the use of mice that are living in germ-free bubbles so that scientists can experiment on them, exposing them to certain microbes to see what the response is. One of the things that scientists are studying in this kind of germ-free mouse is obesity and body weight. Would you give us a sense of the kinds of experiments being done relating to body weight with these germ-free mice? YONG: Sure. So about 10 years ago, in some very classic experiments, scientists took microbes that were from obese and lean individuals and put them in the sterile mice. So the mice that received the obese community's put on more weight than their counterparts who received the lean ones. And that was a seminal finding. It really showed that perhaps these microbes aren't just, you know, going along for the ride. Maybe they're actually grabbing the wheel now and then. Maybe they are seriously influencing our weight, the way we deal with the energy in our food. The thing is that the links between obesity and the microbiome are actually very complicated. And even though there's been 10 years of research, there are still a lot of things we don't know. So people have found differences in the microbe communities between people who are fat and lean. So you get different species that rise to the fore in different groups. But there aren't consistent differences between studies. So it's still really hard to say what, say, a, quote, unquote, \"obese microbiome\" looks like, let alone how you might want to manipulate it. And one critical study that was done, again with these germ-free mice, showed that if you take the microbes from a lean individual and put them in a rodent that has put on too much weight, then that rodent will lose weight but only if it also eats a traditionally healthy diet that's full of plants and fiber. And I think that shows that the microbiome might be deeply influenced in our lives, but it doesn't provide any easy solutions to health problems. When the first wave of studies came out about 10 years ago, headlines were full of things like, you know, blame microbes for your weight or maybe we'll be able to take some probiotic that immediately causes us to lose weight. And I think it's nowhere near that simple. The microbiome is not a panacea for our health problems. It doesn't explain them all in their entirety. I think it just shows how important microbes are in our lives and what a strong influence they have. GROSS: And this is why someone - and I forget who it is - gives an award that's named the Overselling the Microbiome Award (laughter). YONG: (Laughter) That's right, yeah. His name is Jonathan Eisen. He's a wonderful microbiologist. He's a true champion, an evangelist for microbes. But he's also very skeptical, and I think with good reason for a lot of the claims that are surrounding the microbiome. This is one of the most fashionable areas, the hottest areas of modern biology. And the microbiome has been linked to all sorts of health problems. But a lot of those studies are still correlative. We still don't know whether the microbes are leading to the disorders, whether they're a consequence of them, whether it's both or neither. And we are still at this very early stage of understanding our partnerships with the microbes that share our lives. We know they're important. But how important are they? And in what ways, and how might we be able to influence them? GROSS: So when it comes to microbiome research, it seems like we're still kind of in the infancy of it. We know enough to know this is a really promising field. We might learn a lot about foods to eat and not eat, about things to expose ourselves and not to expose ourselves to. We might find new cures for autoimmune diseases. But right now, it seems like it's still in the formative stages, very experimental. YONG: Yeah, very much so. We've known about microbes for over 350 years. But the science of the human microbiome has really only taken off in the last decade or so. And there's so much we don't know. We don't still have a full catalog of the species that live inside us. We still don't really understand what makes my microbiome different to yours. What explains those variations between people - much less what a good microbiome looks like or how you might get to that stage. But I think the potential there is huge because the microbiome is theoretically very flexible. We should be able to change it. We just don't quite know how yet. And maybe one of the quicker wins with microbiome science might be to use the microbiome as a sort of diagnostic tool, of looking at it and say what you're more likely to develop - this disease or that disorder - or to use it to influence our treatment. So we know that microbes within us affect how well medicines work in our body. We know that a lot of different drugs, from the hottest new cancer immunotherapy drugs to obvious things like acetaminophen can work in some people and not in others because of which microbes they carry. And maybe we might also be able to find ways of influencing the microbiome without needing to add or subtract strains. So there's one group that does a lot of work on heart disease. And we give - if you have a high risk of heart disease, your doctor might prescribe you a statin, which is a drug that's designed to target enzymes involved in cholesterol metabolism that are made by your own body. But bacteria can also affect the way you deal with cholesterol, and they could also contribute to the risk of heart disease in that way. And now some - one group of scientists has developed a molecule that can stop these bacteria from leading to rises in cholesterol. So maybe in the future you might get a combination of two drugs from your doctor, a statin to treat the human half of you and another chemical to affect the microbial half. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is science writer Ed Yong. His new book is called \"I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us And A Grander View Of Life. \" Let's take a short break. Then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is science writer Ed Yong. His new book is called \"I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us And A Grander View Of Life. \" He also writes about science for The Atlantic and does a science blog for National Geographic called \"Not Exactly Rocket Science. \" Not everybody has a favorite microbe, but you do (laughter). YONG: Yes. GROSS: Tell us what it is. YONG: I do. It is called Wolbachia. It was discovered in 1924, and it was found inside a common brown mosquito by two scientists, Hertig and Wolbach. And for decades, no one knew what it did or how common it was, whether it was important. It was largely neglected. And then scientists realized that actually it's incredibly common. It's not found in humans, but it is found in some 4 in 10 species of insects and other arthropods, which are themselves the most numerous and most diverse animals on the planet. So Wolbachia is extraordinarily successful, and it does all sorts of incredible things. So in some hosts, it is a parasite that has a thing out for males because Wolbachia only passes down from mothers to daughters, and so males are a complete dead end to it. In some - in some species, like woodlice, it converts males into females. In others, it kills males outright so that the females outnumber males by 100 to 1. And in some wasps, Wolbachia allows them to reproduce by cloning themselves, so they have no need for males whatsoever. But in some cases, this thing is also an ally. It is a mutualist. It allows some caterpillars that eat leaves to stop the leaves from turning yellow. It actually holds back the progress of fall so that these - its hosts can have more to eat. And it has properties that are really important to us humans. So Wolbachia is found in parasitic worms that cause debilitating tropical diseases like elephantiasis and river blindness. And by finding drugs that can kill Wolbachia, scientists are finally looking for and discovering effective ways of curing and treating these illnesses. GROSS: But what about mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and Zika? There seems to be some relevance there, too. YONG: That's right. Wolbachia turns out to be a really powerful way of controlling mosquito-borne diseases. So scientists in Australia have spent about 25 years trying to load this bacterium into Aedes aegypti, the tiger mosquito, the one that spreads dengue and yellow fever and infamously now Zika. And they've been trying to do this because Wolbachia seems to prevent these insects from transmitting the viruses behind these diseases. And Wolbachia is so good at spreading through a wild population that if you release a small number of these infected mosquitoes, they ought to fly off into the distance and then within months Wolbachia should be everywhere, thus rendering this entire community of insects unable to spread disease. They - the bacterium changes them from vectors into dead ends. And this was tried for the first time in 2011 in several suburbs of Australia. And this team showed indeed that Wolbachia rises to dominance in these natural populations, and they're now trying this approach in big megacities around the world, in places like Brazil and Colombia and Indonesia and Vietnam. And there are so many. . . GROSS: Places with mosquito issues. YONG: Places with mosquito issues, places with severe dengue problems. The approach was initially developed in order to eliminate dengue fever, but it seems to work against Zika, as well against a lot of other mosquito-borne diseases, and it has tremendous advantages. The - unlike, say, insecticides, which are toxic and need to be continuously resprayed, Wolbachia in these mosquitoes seems to have no problems, no safety risks. And it sustains itself. Once you release the insects, they go off on their business and you don't need to keep on replenishing them. GROSS: So you're not messing with the mosquitoes' genetics. You're introducing a bacteria? YONG: That's right. There is no genetic modification. These mosquitoes are not GMOs to speak of. They've been simply united with a bacterium that is already present in a large proportion of other insects. GROSS: So now that you see your body as housing huge communities of microbes, how has that changed your life? Has it changed, like, what you eat or how you behave or what you expose yourself to? YONG: I'm certainly less fearful of the microbial world than I would have been 20 years ago. You know, I don't - I wash my hands of course, but I don't over-scrub them. I don't use sanitizers. But, you know, really what writing this book has given me is a broader perspective of the world around me. So I always loved the natural world. You know, I was that kid who went to zoos all the time. I would watch wildlife documentaries and read books about nature. And now I understand that all this biology which I thought I knew, all these creatures, these elephants and hawks and fish that I was fascinated by, these things I could see with my eyes, are actually deeply and profoundly influenced by things that I cannot see. And I know that if I go to a zoo now that every animal and every visitor in that zoo is in fact a zoo in its own right. GROSS: Give us an example of an animal that you see differently now. YONG: There are - in the very deep oceans, there are environments called hydrothermal vents, these belching chimneys of superheated water. And there's a worm that lives in these vents called riftia and it's - it can grow a few metres long, and it has these beautiful red gills that look like someone's pushed a tube of lipstick out all the way. And this worm lives in this environment, which just hasn't got any food, but it has microbes in its body. A lot of its body, probably the majority of it, consists of bacteria. They grab minerals from the vent environment and use these to create nutrients. And that is entirely how the worm sustains itself. This animal has lost its mouth and it's gut because why bother having a digestive system at all when you don't need to eat when you have microbes inside you to provide you with all your energy? And I think that's just a stunning example of how intimate the animals can evolve to rely upon their microbes. This is a creature that would not be able to survive at all without the multitudes inside it. GROSS: Don't you wonder what the world looks like from the point of view of the microbes that you write about, like, if one of the microbes was writing this book, how different it would be (laughter)? YONG: I feel like we wouldn't even get a mention. GROSS: (Laughter). YONG: We are just this footnote, this icing on the - on this gigantic microbial cake. You know, in the book, I talk about how if you condense the history of the Earth into a single calendar year, so the Earth was created in the first of January and we are now in the 31 of December just before the stroke of midnight, then humans arose about 30 minutes ago. And even all the multicellular creatures, the things we can see, all the animals and plants we're familiar with, only arose a couple of months back whereas bacteria probably first evolved, say, at the start of March. So for the vast majority of life on Earth, everything was microbial. You know, bacteria have been the rulers of the planet for most of the Earth's history, and they are still the rulers of the planet. They still govern the movements of chemicals all around the world. They are in every possible habitat. They are omnipresent, and they are hugely influential. And in many ways, our bodies, the bodies of every other animals or our cities that we are so proud of, all of these are just more habitats for bacteria and other microbes to inhabit. GROSS: Ed Yong, thank you so much. YONG: Thank you very much for having me. GROSS: Ed Yong's new book about the microbes within us is called \"I Contain Multitudes. \" After we take a short break, Milo Miles will review an album by a Brazilian bossa nova ensemble.

SHAPIRO: Levitin teaches at McGill University in Montreal. He is author of \"A Field Guide To Lies. \" And in 2006, he published the book \"This Is Your Brain On Music. \" About a year after it came out, Levitin got a visit in his lab from one of the book's fans.

Think about if you have to wait for an important medical procedure, or maybe it's not that dangerous. NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam is here to talk about this. Hey, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So you're going to tell me no more grumbling if you have to wait to schedule a surgery, or what? VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Well, I think grumbling might be allowed, but it might not actually be necessary, David. This is research conducted in Britain where long waiting times for medical procedures has long been a concern. Valentina Tonei at the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin analyzed the health outcomes of patients waiting for surgery and measured whether health outcomes were affected by delays in Britain's nationalized health system. VALENTINA TONEI: Of course, no one likes to wait in any context (laughter), and not only for health care services. But that is part of the deal if you want to be treated in the public health care system. There are a lot of people that require the same treatment. GREENE: I assume we're not talking about something that is incredibly acute and urgent. VEDANTAM: I think that's right. So Tonei and her colleagues, Giuseppe Moscelli and Luigi Siciliani, analyzed outcomes of tens of thousands of patients getting coronary bypass surgery between the years 2000 and 2010. GREENE: Heart surgery, I mean, that is important stuff. VEDANTAM: It is serious, but, as you pointed out, these are all patients getting elective surgery, meaning they are not in an emergency. The average waiting time was about 200 days, but some patients waited only a month. Others waited many, many months. The questions Tonei wanted to answer is whether patients who wait longer for the procedure are more likely to die as a result of waiting or more likely to suffer medical complications after receiving a delayed surgery. TONEI: With our study, we do not find that long waits worsen patient health. So, basically, we do not find that if you wait for a long time, you're going to have a higher risk of dying after the surgery or of being readmitted as an emergency. GREENE: Why is this happening? It really does feel counterintuitive. VEDANTAM: It's not entirely clear why this is happening. Now, many medical procedures involve judgment and some element of guesswork. So if you're a doctor, you're trying to guess whether the patient before you needs a procedure. You're trying to guess how dire the situation is. If the risk that the patient is going to suffer a heart attack in reality is, let's say, a year away, this might explain why waiting between two months or six months doesn't make a difference because both of those are within the window in which the bad outcome is going to happen. GREENE: But this really means if you have a loved one who is in need of bypass surgery, I mean, you really have no argument to make that you need to get him or her into that procedure as soon as possible. I mean, waiting is OK. VEDANTAM: Yes, so it's a little - it's a complicated question you're asking, David. You know, coronary bypass surgery is a serious medical procedure, so we are talking about patients who could die from a heart attack. So the fact that waiting for this serious medical procedure doesn't produce worse outcomes is worth noting because it suggests this might also be the case for less serious procedures. At the same time, this is one study done in one country looking at one kind of medical procedure - also worth noting that the outcomes the researchers are looking at here are not the only outcomes worth considering. Waiting can produce a lot of anxiety. It can produce a lot of worry. Those are also factors you might need to consider, independent of the objective medical outcomes. GREENE: Sure. OK, so a conclusion, but keep it in context. VEDANTAM: Exactly. GREENE: All right, Shankar. Thanks as always. VEDANTAM: Thanks, David. GREENE: That is Shankar Vedantam.

Well, there is new social science research that looks into what all of us do when we encounter these documents. And to explain, we're joined by - who else? - NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam. Hey, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: I mean to tell you something - I never even read those policies. I click I agree, and I'm scared that you're going to tell me that I'm making a mistake. VEDANTAM: You are making a mistake, but you're not the exception of it. GREENE: Good. VEDANTAM: You are the rule. GREENE: Good. I feel better. VEDANTAM: You know, as soon as one of those lengthy legal policy things come up, I immediately start hunting for the button that says agree. . . GREENE: Yeah. VEDANTAM: To say I agree with what - to whatever terms. . . GREENE: Sometimes they make you actually scroll as if you're reading it before you can agree. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). GREENE: . . . But that's - that helps. VEDANTAM: Exactly. I was speaking with Jonathan Obar. He studies information policy at York University. He's conducted some new work showing how bad the problem is, but this piggybacks on some earlier work. Here's Obar. JONATHAN OBAR: It would take the average user 40 minutes a day to read all of - and that's every day - to read all of the privacy and terms of service policies that we encounter related to the different services that we're using all the time. GREENE: Oh, yeah, the spare 40 minutes we have in all of our days to do that. I mean, that's crazy. VEDANTAM: It is crazy. But we all participate in this collective act of fiction, David. Companies get to say that they are telling us what they're going to do with our data, and we say we've understood the terms and are providing informed consent. Obar and his colleague Anne Oeldorf-Hirsch at the University of Connecticut decided they wanted to put empirical heft to something we all know is happening. So they conducted a study where they asked volunteers to sign up for a new social networking site called Name Drop as in drop that name, get that job. GREENE: They just made this thing up. VEDANTAM: Yes. GREENE: They came up with it. VEDANTAM: Yeah. GREENE: OK. VEDANTAM: Now, the social networking site was fictitious, but the research has created a legal agreement laying out the terms of service. It would have taken volunteers a lot of time to read. Buried in the agreement was the disclosure that anything users shared would be passed along to the NSA. GREENE: (Laughter) The National Security Agency. VEDANTAM: Exactly. GREENE: The top secret government agency that many people are already afraid are gathering too much information about us. That's great. VEDANTAM: Precisely. Obar told me that exactly one volunteer - one out of more than 500 raised a concern. . . GREENE: Oh, my God. VEDANTAM: . . . About information being passed along to the NSA. He also included another really unusual clause in the agreement. OBAR: What we did is we went to the extreme, and we included this - a firstborn clause suggesting that if you agreed to these policies that as a form of payment, you'd be giving up a first-born child. And 98 percent of the participants that took the study didn't even notice this particular clause. VEDANTAM: So I think there's a couple of interesting things happening here psychologically, David. People don't anticipate all the ways that information collected about them can reveal things about them and how it can be used. So people are signing these agreements without reading them because they say I have nothing to hide, but, as Obar says, maybe your grocery store is selling information about your food purchases to your insurance company, which then uses it to make judgments about your health risk. And, of course, from the point of view of companies and policy-makers, the idea that these documents are eliciting informed consent is really a joke. They may provide legal cover, but how many people are really providing informed consent when they're willing to give up their first-born child just to use a social networking site?

I'm Shankar Vedantam. Many scientists who study people end up saying some version of the following sentence - the human being is the only animal that. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: . . . Has a sense of humor. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: That can cooperate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: That do radio shows. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: That regularly fashion and use tools. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROBERT SIEGEL, BYLINE: That have chins. VEDANTAM: Psychologist Daniel Gilbert at Harvard University finishes the sentence this way - the human being is the only animal that thinks about the future. DANIEL GILBERT: Every animal learns from trial and error. Human beings learn from experiences they've never even had. They close their eyes and say, would I like liver and onion ice cream? Yuck. Would it be a good idea to put my finger in a pencil sharpener? No. VEDANTAM: But just because we humans have great imaginations, it doesn't mean we do a good job of predicting the future accurately. GILBERT: People just aren't very good at looking into their future and predicting correctly their emotional reactions to the events that might unfold. VEDANTAM: We think a dentist appointment will be awful, and then it's not so bad. We think buying a new car will make us very happy, but it ends up being just nice. We think losing a job is the worst thing that could happen to us, and then it becomes the best thing. The problem is, once our minds get to work imagining the future, we leave out important details, like the nice lady at the front desk in the dentist's office or the free toothbrush. When I think about the future, I also don't consider the fact that I'm going to be a different person in the future - someone who may want a minivan instead of a convertible. Most of us also underestimate how good we are at rationalizing the decisions that we make. Joining me today to talk about our foggy foresight and what we can do to make it better is psychologist Daniel Gilbert. He's the author of the book \"Stumbling On Happiness\" and one of my favorite researchers in the world. Dan, welcome to Hidden Brain. GILBERT: (Laughter) Well, thank you. You're now my favorite radio host in the world. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Oh, that was easy. I want to start by asking you a question that you and I talked about a while ago, Dan. Some years ago, you went through a series of very difficult personal experiences, but instead of leaving you broken-hearted, as you might have anticipated, it left you with, actually, a very important insight into your own ability to predict your future emotional states. Can you tell me what happened? GILBERT: Well, you know, my - my personal experiences were no worse than the average person's - in fact, better than most. But, you know, like everybody, I suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. You know, we have divorces. We have surgeries. We have break-ups with women we love and friends we enjoy. So it was sort of ordinary events that befell me all in one year. And I realized that, had you asked me a year earlier how I would be fairing, the answer would have been, oh, my gosh, I'll be devastated. But I wasn't devastated. It wasn't a good year, but it was OK. And it made me wonder if I was the only person who was just too stupid to be able to look ahead into his future and figure out how he'd feel if really bad or maybe really good things happened. So I went to the laboratory and teamed up with my friend, Tim Wilson, and we started studying this phenomenon. And, you know, reassuringly, we found out we weren't the only stupid people out there. VEDANTAM: You've also found that painful decisions are often painful largely because we haven't made them yet. Once we actually make a decision - pick one of two alternatives - we often end up wondering how we could ever have dreamed of choosing the other choice. GILBERT: Well, surely that's true for all of us. We agonize between two things that seem awfully close. We finally choose one, and in a small or medium amount of time, we look back and wonder how we could ever have been trying to decide between them. Why did we make that mistake of thinking the two alternatives were so close when, in fact, they were really far apart? The answer is they weren't really close, and they weren't really far apart. It's just a matter of how you look at it. And when you're on the front side of a decision, alternatives seem to be very close. But once you've chosen one, the mind gets going doing what the mind does so well - convincing you that the thing you've got is better than the thing you've left behind. Now, if psychologists are trying to cure that, we call it rationalization. If we're trying to sell it, we call it coping. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). GILBERT: But whether you call it coping or rationalization, it's the same thing. It's the mind finding realistic ways to see the world so that it feels better about the world in which it finds itself. VEDANTAM: You once subscribed to the very popular belief that, I think, I still subscribe to - that more freedom always equals more happiness. And if I remember correctly, you conducted a study once that found that this wasn't quite right. And at the time, I think, you told me that you'd been living with your girlfriend for more than a decade. And you saw the data, and you decided to make some changes in your life. GILBERT: (Laughter). You have a very good memory. So, like many people, I used to believe that the more freedom, the better. How could you be less happy when you had more choice? Well, we know now a lot about why more choice sometimes makes people less happy. In our study, we brought students in, and we created a photography course. And we had all of them work with us for a long time learning how to do black-and-white photography. Then, at the end of the course, we gave them two photographs that they had taken. And we said they could keep one and we were going to keep one. Well, this was horrible for them. They wanted to keep both. They had a tough decision to make. In one group, we said, if you ever change your mind about which photograph you want, just let us know. We'll swap with you. We're going to keep this on file forever, so if took A, and you want B, we'll swap B for A, for as long as we both shall live. Another group was told your decision is final. Once you make this decision, the photograph that you're donating to us gets sent off to England. It'll never be seen again. VEDANTAM: And, of course, if you presented those choices to me, I would say I would want to be in the first group because I would preserve my options. If I took a photograph home and didn't like it, I could come back and trade it in for the one that I did like. GILBERT: Exactly, and that's not even just a good guess. We actually did exactly that in another study. We asked people which group they wanted to be in. And just like you, they overwhelmingly want to be in the first group. But what's interesting is we tracked the happiness of the people who had made these decisions over the course of several weeks. And what we found is that people who made an irrevocable decision - one they couldn't change - were much happier with the choice they made. When you've made an irrevocable decision, you rationalize it. Once something's gone and gone forever, the mind gets to work figuring out why what it got is really better than what it lost. But when a decision isn't irrevocable, when you can remake it and revisit it and change your mind any time, what do you do? You just ruminate about it, right? You buy a sweater and you know you can take it back any time. And every time you put it on, you look in the mirror and you think, oh, I don't know. Maybe it's not a good fit. Maybe it's not a good color. Maybe I ought to bring it back. On the other hand, if this sweater was bought at a place that won't take it back, you look in the mirror and you say, gosh, that looks good. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). So you took this research, and you applied it to your own life? GILBERT: I did. I think my - my then-girlfriend and I had been living together for about a decade. And once we saw the results of this experiment and a friend of mine, Dave Myers, called and said, you know, I think this really explains the difference between living together and getting married, which had never occurred to me. I thought, you know, if you're a scientist and you don't live by your own results, what kind of scientist are you? So yeah, I went home and proposed. And guess what? I was utterly right. I love her so much more now that we're married, now that I can't get out of this relationship no matter how fast I run. She is the love of my life, and I didn't realize that when I was always thinking, should I stay or shouldn't I stay. There's a lot to say about making commitments. VEDANTAM: So let's talk a little bit about why these errors often happen. One idea that you've explored is that when we imagine the future, we often fail to take into account all the little details that will actually make us happy or sad. GILBERT: Well, it's true. Every future event comprises thousands and thousands of details. But when you ask people to imagine a future event, they usually imagine one or two of those details, the ones that are central, that define the episode. So if I say to you, imagine the next visit to the dentist, probably you get a picture in your head instantly of sitting in a chair and someone's fooling around in your mouth. Well, that is indeed a part of the experience you'll have, but you also have to park. You're also going to be in the waiting room. They're going to be playing music. There will be magazines. The receptionist will be nice or not. Afterwards, you will or won't have an appointment you need to rush to. There's lots of other parts of that experience that you're not imagining, and all of them can affect your happiness. Now, you can't imagine every detail. That's not possible. But what you ought to do, rationally, is think to yourself, I'm only imagining one or two of the many pieces of the experience. And as a result, I should be very humble about my prediction, but nobody is. Instead, they say, a dental visit? I'll hate it. VEDANTAM: One of the most interesting things you found in this line of research is that it's not just that we don't imagine the event in the future in all its fullness and detail, but we also don't fully appreciate that we might not quite be the same people we are then that we are now. GILBERT: You know, I think that's even the more powerful of the two errors, so you're quite right. One problem is that we don't imagine events correctly. We don't imagine them as they will unfold. That's the smaller of the two problems. The larger problem is that we don't know who we will be when we are experiencing that event. We underestimate the mind's ability to react to events in a different way than it's reacting to them in prospect. You know, things look different from out the windshield and in the rearview mirror. Life is like that, too. Almost every event you experience feels different once you've experienced it then you imagined it would have beforehand. That's the part of our psychology we don't seem very good at anticipating. VEDANTAM: Do I recall a study that you did recently which tracked people over the course of their lives and asked them how they imagined they would change in the future versus how they had changed in the past? GILBERT: You are remembering correctly. We recently published a paper showing that when people are asked to predict how much they will change in the future, they underestimated. Look, we all know 18-year-olds are crazy. They think they are who they are, they're going to be that way forever. They have crazy hairstyles and tattoos that they believe they're going to want for the rest of their lives. And old people, like me, snicker and go, you're going to see, because 18-year-olds underestimate how different they're going to be when they're 28. And we showed this in our experiment by asking 18-year-olds to tell us how much they would change in the next 10 years and asking 28-year-olds to tell us how much they had changed in the last 10 years. In a perfectly rational world, those numbers would be the same, and they weren't. Eighteen-year-olds thought they would change very little. Twenty-eight-year-olds reported having changed a lot. But what's so interesting about this study is it's also true with 58-year-olds and 68-year-olds. That is, 58-year-olds think, OK, I'm done. I'm cooked. It'll just be me - maybe a little flabbier, more wrinkles, but I'm the guy I'm going to be. Sixty-eight-year-olds look back at the last 10 years and say, wow, have I changed. VEDANTAM: So what's really fascinating about this, Dan, is that no matter how many times we experience these errors in our lives and how many times we make the same mistakes, somehow we don't learn from them, and we're left with the same confidence that we had before that now, this time, when I predict the future, I'm going to be right. GILBERT: There are two kinds of errors. Sometimes you're driving some place, and you take the wrong route. The next time, you always get it right. But then there are errors that are more like, oh, optical illusions. You know, you see those two parallel lines on the page, and you say, gosh, they don't look parallel to me. And then you measure them, and they are. But then you stand back, and they don't look that way. So you measure them again, but they are, but they keep not looking that way. I think the kinds of errors we're talking about are a little bit more like optical illusions. You can't help but see the future in this deficient way. Time and time again, you will find your predictions were wrong, and time and time again, you'll make the same predictions. VEDANTAM: When we come back, I'm going to ask Dan how we can use insights from his research to help us make decisions that are more likely to make us happier in the future. Stay with us.

VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. I'm talking today with psychologist Dan Gilbert, who studies why we often make choices that are counterproductive to making us happier people. I asked Dan to tell me whether he's found ways to help people use their imaginations to make better decisions for their future selves. GILBERT: We and many others have spent decades trying to figure out, how can we make human imagination better? If when people look into the future, they make mistakes, what kind of training could we give them so they don't make these mistakes? And I will give you the summary of 15 years of research - it doesn't work. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). GILBERT: Almost nothing anybody has ever tried makes a long-lasting, broad difference. On the other hand, the best way to predict your future, we've discovered, is not to close your eyes and use your imagination. There's a completely different way to figure out how you will feel, and that is to ask people who are already in your future how they feel. Almost anything you're imagining - should I move to Hawaii? Should I become a trumpet player? I wonder if I should subscribe to The New York Times. Would it be better to have a bagel or a bialy? Almost any decision you're debating, large or small, many people have already made it, and they've made it in both directions. There are people who are doing the things you're only imagining. And it turns out that if you can simply measure their happiness, you can get a pretty good guide about how happy you will be in the future. One of the experiments that we did that demonstrated this most simply is we created a speed-dating clinic where young women came in, and they had a speed date with a young man. And they were offered one of two kinds of information. Either they could learn all about the young man before they met him - they could see his photograph, learn his hobbies find out about his likes and his dislikes - or they could learn none of that, and they could get just one piece of information - namely, how much did the woman who already had a speed date with him enjoy it? VEDANTAM: (Laughter). GILBERT: Well, it turns out, first of all, everybody wants the first kind of information. The women in our study all think they're going to make a much better prediction of how much they'll enjoy the date if they can just learn about the guy. But what we find is that they're much more accurate in predicting their own experience if they know nothing except another woman's experience. This woman is, in a sense, a surrogate for their future selves. And we call this method surrogation - using other people's experience as a guide to your own. VEDANTAM: So there's a commercial application that basically is built on this idea. It's called Yelp. GILBERT: Exactly right. And there are a few domains in which we all know that we want to rely on other people's reviews, if you will - movies and restaurants. Those are the two big domains. Now, why are we willing to rely on other people in these domains? Because we can't imagine for ourselves. I mean, if I say, how much do you think you'll enjoy the new restaurant? You look at me and go, how can I possibly close my eyes and imagine that? When we have no information about a future event, we become surrogaters. We're willing to listen to other people. But if you offer folks even the smallest piece of information about a future event, they will take that over all the Yelp reviews. So let me ask you - you're going to decide whether to spend a lot of money to buy a movie. Would you rather see the trailer or would you rather read reviews? If you're like most people, you would throw out all the reviews by every critic and every Yelper in the world if you could just see the trailer. VEDANTAM: Because you trust your own judgment, in some ways, better than others. GILBERT: You feel if you could just taste 30 seconds, 60 seconds of the movie, you'll know if it's the kind of movie you like, but you won't. Other people's reviews are going to be great information about things like, did the movie go on too long? Did the plot get predictable? Did - you know, did God come out of a machine in the end? All sorts of things you'll never get from a trailer. And yet, if you offer people these two kinds of information - the trailer every time. VEDANTAM: So would you suggest that we should actually have Yelp for everything, that we should be rating our friends and spouses and children and professors all, you know, via this kind of distributed review system? GILBERT: Well, you know, as a professor, I do get rated already, so there is a review system for me. And, you know, at Harvard, we have a quaint tradition. It's called shopping week. And in the first week of school, all the students come in, and they visit classes. They don't choose their classes ahead of time. They visit them all to see 15 or 20 minutes of a lecture because they're convinced and the administration is convinced that they can tell, from 20 minutes of someone's lecture, whether they'll really enjoy and get a lot out of the class. What they're ignoring is a huge database of information from people who actually sat through the class for 15 weeks and have a whole lot to say about whether you'll enjoy it or not. You can't convince a student to take a class that has great reviews if they didn't like the 10 minutes of the first lecture. The problem is something we call the illusion of diversity. We think we are utterly unique, that other people's experiences might tell us a little bit about ours, but not very much, because, after all, we're so different than everybody. Well, nonsense. You're not different than everybody. We're basically all the same. You know, if a Martian knew everything there was to know - everything there was to know about a single human being on Earth, that Martian would know 90 percent of what there is to know about everybody on Earth. VEDANTAM: I have to push back just a little bit because there's also been, I think, voluminous research conducted by maybe colleagues in the psychology department which finds that these reviews are also shot through with all kinds of biases. So female professors, for example, get much worse reviews than male professors when they're just as good. I mean, isn't there a risk in essentially outsourcing your judgment to the crowd when the crowd, actually, is capable fully of having, you know, collective biases? GILBERT: Well, two things to say about this. First, if you share the biases of the reviewers, they will correctly predict how you will feel, even if it's unfair. So let's say you just don't like old guys like me. Let's say there's a bias. Students can't stand to hear a guy in his 50s yammer and yammer. Well, that's not very fair. That's ageist. That's wrong. On the other hand, when the students say I hated, it's a pretty good guide for another 18-year-old who will probably hate it for all the same reasons. The second point I'd make is this - I'm not saying that surrogation is a perfect way to make decisions. You know, Winston Churchill once said, Democracy is the worst form of government, except for the others. Well, surrogation is a terrible way to make predictions about your own future happiness, except for the other way to make predictions. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). GILBERT: You know, imagination is so utterly flawed that surrogation, even with all of its problems, turns out to be a better method than that. Now, if there's a third way to make them, I'm very open to hearing about it, but we've never discovered it. VEDANTAM: One other idea that you and others have found is that uncertainty can amplify the emotional potency of events - that happy surprises and unhappy surprises make a bigger impact on us than happy things that we know are going to happen and sad things that we know are going to happen. Why is this, and how can we learn from it? GILBERT: Well, there's no doubt that uncertainty can amplify emotions. So if I tell you something bad is about to happen, it's probably not going to be quite as bad as if it happens by surprise. And the same is true of good events. What's interesting - and, you know, everybody - we've known that for - for decades, if not centuries, and that's not a particularly deep observation. What we found really interesting is that, even though this is true - people never want uncertainty - they eschew it. They pay good money not to have it. We did a study in which people watched a movie. And for some of the people in our experiment, we didn't let them watch how the movie ended. We didn't let them see what happened to the main character. Now, if I asked you, which of these two movies would you rather see, 100 percent of the hands go up and say, I'd like to see the end of the movie, please. But what we discovered was people who didn't see the end of the movie liked it more, thought about it for longer, were still engaged in it and still enjoying it, even hours or days later. They didn't see what happened to the last - the main character in the end, and so they kept wondering. Gosh, I wonder if he went to college or he became a football player. What an interesting thing to be thinking about and enjoying. So the point is that a little bit of uncertainty can make you very happy, but we never seem to want it. If flowers showed up on your doorstep tomorrow with no note - it just said secret admirer - I bet you'd pay me a lot to find out who the secret admirer was. But I guarantee you, no matter who it is, it's better off just having a secret admirer than knowing who sent the flowers. VEDANTAM: Do you actually try and actively build mystery into your own life when it comes to positive events? GILBERT: I'm not telling. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: Dan, I want to thank you for talking with me today. This has really been fun. GILBERT: Sure. It's been fun for me, too. Thank you.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. Many scientists who study people end up saying some version of the following sentence - the human being is the only animal that. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: . . . Has a sense of humor. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: That can cooperate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: That do radio shows. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: That regularly fashion and use tools. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROBERT SIEGEL, BYLINE: That have chins. VEDANTAM: Psychologist Daniel Gilbert at Harvard University finishes the sentence this way - the human being is the only animal that thinks about the future. DANIEL GILBERT: Every animal learns from trial and error. Human beings learn from experiences they've never even had. They close their eyes and say, would I like liver and onion ice cream? Yuck. Would it be a good idea to put my finger in a pencil sharpener? No. VEDANTAM: But just because we humans have great imaginations, it doesn't mean we do a good job of predicting the future accurately. GILBERT: People just aren't very good at looking into their future and predicting correctly their emotional reactions to the events that might unfold. VEDANTAM: We think a dentist appointment will be awful, and then it's not so bad. We think buying a new car will make us very happy, but it ends up being just nice. We think losing a job is the worst thing that could happen to us, and then it becomes the best thing. The problem is, once our minds get to work imagining the future, we leave out important details, like the nice lady at the front desk in the dentist's office or the free toothbrush. When I think about the future, I also don't consider the fact that I'm going to be a different person in the future - someone who may want a minivan instead of a convertible. Most of us also underestimate how good we are at rationalizing the decisions that we make. Joining me today to talk about our foggy foresight and what we can do to make it better is psychologist Daniel Gilbert. He's the author of the book \"Stumbling On Happiness\" and one of my favorite researchers in the world. Dan, welcome to Hidden Brain. GILBERT: (Laughter) Well, thank you. You're now my favorite radio host in the world. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Oh, that was easy. I want to start by asking you a question that you and I talked about a while ago, Dan. Some years ago, you went through a series of very difficult personal experiences, but instead of leaving you broken-hearted, as you might have anticipated, it left you with, actually, a very important insight into your own ability to predict your future emotional states. Can you tell me what happened? GILBERT: Well, you know, my - my personal experiences were no worse than the average person's - in fact, better than most. But, you know, like everybody, I suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. You know, we have divorces. We have surgeries. We have break-ups with women we love and friends we enjoy. So it was sort of ordinary events that befell me all in one year. And I realized that, had you asked me a year earlier how I would be fairing, the answer would have been, oh, my gosh, I'll be devastated. But I wasn't devastated. It wasn't a good year, but it was OK. And it made me wonder if I was the only person who was just too stupid to be able to look ahead into his future and figure out how he'd feel if really bad or maybe really good things happened. So I went to the laboratory and teamed up with my friend, Tim Wilson, and we started studying this phenomenon. And, you know, reassuringly, we found out we weren't the only stupid people out there. VEDANTAM: You've also found that painful decisions are often painful largely because we haven't made them yet. Once we actually make a decision - pick one of two alternatives - we often end up wondering how we could ever have dreamed of choosing the other choice. GILBERT: Well, surely that's true for all of us. We agonize between two things that seem awfully close. We finally choose one, and in a small or medium amount of time, we look back and wonder how we could ever have been trying to decide between them. Why did we make that mistake of thinking the two alternatives were so close when, in fact, they were really far apart? The answer is they weren't really close, and they weren't really far apart. It's just a matter of how you look at it. And when you're on the front side of a decision, alternatives seem to be very close. But once you've chosen one, the mind gets going doing what the mind does so well - convincing you that the thing you've got is better than the thing you've left behind. Now, if psychologists are trying to cure that, we call it rationalization. If we're trying to sell it, we call it coping. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). GILBERT: But whether you call it coping or rationalization, it's the same thing. It's the mind finding realistic ways to see the world so that it feels better about the world in which it finds itself. VEDANTAM: You once subscribed to the very popular belief that, I think, I still subscribe to - that more freedom always equals more happiness. And if I remember correctly, you conducted a study once that found that this wasn't quite right. And at the time, I think, you told me that you'd been living with your girlfriend for more than a decade. And you saw the data, and you decided to make some changes in your life. GILBERT: (Laughter). You have a very good memory. So, like many people, I used to believe that the more freedom, the better. How could you be less happy when you had more choice? Well, we know now a lot about why more choice sometimes makes people less happy. In our study, we brought students in, and we created a photography course. And we had all of them work with us for a long time learning how to do black-and-white photography. Then, at the end of the course, we gave them two photographs that they had taken. And we said they could keep one and we were going to keep one. Well, this was horrible for them. They wanted to keep both. They had a tough decision to make. In one group, we said, if you ever change your mind about which photograph you want, just let us know. We'll swap with you. We're going to keep this on file forever, so if took A, and you want B, we'll swap B for A, for as long as we both shall live. Another group was told your decision is final. Once you make this decision, the photograph that you're donating to us gets sent off to England. It'll never be seen again. VEDANTAM: And, of course, if you presented those choices to me, I would say I would want to be in the first group because I would preserve my options. If I took a photograph home and didn't like it, I could come back and trade it in for the one that I did like. GILBERT: Exactly, and that's not even just a good guess. We actually did exactly that in another study. We asked people which group they wanted to be in. And just like you, they overwhelmingly want to be in the first group. But what's interesting is we tracked the happiness of the people who had made these decisions over the course of several weeks. And what we found is that people who made an irrevocable decision - one they couldn't change - were much happier with the choice they made. When you've made an irrevocable decision, you rationalize it. Once something's gone and gone forever, the mind gets to work figuring out why what it got is really better than what it lost. But when a decision isn't irrevocable, when you can remake it and revisit it and change your mind any time, what do you do? You just ruminate about it, right? You buy a sweater and you know you can take it back any time. And every time you put it on, you look in the mirror and you think, oh, I don't know. Maybe it's not a good fit. Maybe it's not a good color. Maybe I ought to bring it back. On the other hand, if this sweater was bought at a place that won't take it back, you look in the mirror and you say, gosh, that looks good. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). So you took this research, and you applied it to your own life? GILBERT: I did. I think my - my then-girlfriend and I had been living together for about a decade. And once we saw the results of this experiment and a friend of mine, Dave Myers, called and said, you know, I think this really explains the difference between living together and getting married, which had never occurred to me. I thought, you know, if you're a scientist and you don't live by your own results, what kind of scientist are you? So yeah, I went home and proposed. And guess what? I was utterly right. I love her so much more now that we're married, now that I can't get out of this relationship no matter how fast I run. She is the love of my life, and I didn't realize that when I was always thinking, should I stay or shouldn't I stay. There's a lot to say about making commitments. VEDANTAM: So let's talk a little bit about why these errors often happen. One idea that you've explored is that when we imagine the future, we often fail to take into account all the little details that will actually make us happy or sad. GILBERT: Well, it's true. Every future event comprises thousands and thousands of details. But when you ask people to imagine a future event, they usually imagine one or two of those details, the ones that are central, that define the episode. So if I say to you, imagine the next visit to the dentist, probably you get a picture in your head instantly of sitting in a chair and someone's fooling around in your mouth. Well, that is indeed a part of the experience you'll have, but you also have to park. You're also going to be in the waiting room. They're going to be playing music. There will be magazines. The receptionist will be nice or not. Afterwards, you will or won't have an appointment you need to rush to. There's lots of other parts of that experience that you're not imagining, and all of them can affect your happiness. Now, you can't imagine every detail. That's not possible. But what you ought to do, rationally, is think to yourself, I'm only imagining one or two of the many pieces of the experience. And as a result, I should be very humble about my prediction, but nobody is. Instead, they say, a dental visit? I'll hate it. VEDANTAM: One of the most interesting things you found in this line of research is that it's not just that we don't imagine the event in the future in all its fullness and detail, but we also don't fully appreciate that we might not quite be the same people we are then that we are now. GILBERT: You know, I think that's even the more powerful of the two errors, so you're quite right. One problem is that we don't imagine events correctly. We don't imagine them as they will unfold. That's the smaller of the two problems. The larger problem is that we don't know who we will be when we are experiencing that event. We underestimate the mind's ability to react to events in a different way than it's reacting to them in prospect. You know, things look different from out the windshield and in the rearview mirror. Life is like that, too. Almost every event you experience feels different once you've experienced it then you imagined it would have beforehand. That's the part of our psychology we don't seem very good at anticipating. VEDANTAM: Do I recall a study that you did recently which tracked people over the course of their lives and asked them how they imagined they would change in the future versus how they had changed in the past? GILBERT: You are remembering correctly. We recently published a paper showing that when people are asked to predict how much they will change in the future, they underestimated. Look, we all know 18-year-olds are crazy. They think they are who they are, they're going to be that way forever. They have crazy hairstyles and tattoos that they believe they're going to want for the rest of their lives. And old people, like me, snicker and go, you're going to see, because 18-year-olds underestimate how different they're going to be when they're 28. And we showed this in our experiment by asking 18-year-olds to tell us how much they would change in the next 10 years and asking 28-year-olds to tell us how much they had changed in the last 10 years. In a perfectly rational world, those numbers would be the same, and they weren't. Eighteen-year-olds thought they would change very little. Twenty-eight-year-olds reported having changed a lot. But what's so interesting about this study is it's also true with 58-year-olds and 68-year-olds. That is, 58-year-olds think, OK, I'm done. I'm cooked. It'll just be me - maybe a little flabbier, more wrinkles, but I'm the guy I'm going to be. Sixty-eight-year-olds look back at the last 10 years and say, wow, have I changed. VEDANTAM: So what's really fascinating about this, Dan, is that no matter how many times we experience these errors in our lives and how many times we make the same mistakes, somehow we don't learn from them, and we're left with the same confidence that we had before that now, this time, when I predict the future, I'm going to be right. GILBERT: There are two kinds of errors. Sometimes you're driving some place, and you take the wrong route. The next time, you always get it right. But then there are errors that are more like, oh, optical illusions. You know, you see those two parallel lines on the page, and you say, gosh, they don't look parallel to me. And then you measure them, and they are. But then you stand back, and they don't look that way. So you measure them again, but they are, but they keep not looking that way. I think the kinds of errors we're talking about are a little bit more like optical illusions. You can't help but see the future in this deficient way. Time and time again, you will find your predictions were wrong, and time and time again, you'll make the same predictions. VEDANTAM: When we come back, I'm going to ask Dan how we can use insights from his research to help us make decisions that are more likely to make us happier in the future. Stay with us.

So female professors, for example, get much worse reviews than male professors when they're just as good. I mean, isn't there a risk in essentially outsourcing your judgment to the crowd when the crowd, actually, is capable fully of having, you know, collective biases? GILBERT: Well, two things to say about this. First, if you share the biases of the reviewers, they will correctly predict how you will feel, even if it's unfair. So let's say you just don't like old guys like me. Let's say there's a bias. Students can't stand to hear a guy in his 50s yammer and yammer. Well, that's not very fair. That's ageist. That's wrong. On the other hand, when the students say I hated, it's a pretty good guide for another 18-year-old who will probably hate it for all the same reasons. The second point I'd make is this - I'm not saying that surrogation is a perfect way to make decisions. You know, Winston Churchill once said, Democracy is the worst form of government, except for the others. Well, surrogation is a terrible way to make predictions about your own future happiness, except for the other way to make predictions. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). GILBERT: You know, imagination is so utterly flawed that surrogation, even with all of its problems, turns out to be a better method than that. Now, if there's a third way to make them, I'm very open to hearing about it, but we've never discovered it. VEDANTAM: One other idea that you and others have found is that uncertainty can amplify the emotional potency of events - that happy surprises and unhappy surprises make a bigger impact on us than happy things that we know are going to happen and sad things that we know are going to happen. Why is this, and how can we learn from it? GILBERT: Well, there's no doubt that uncertainty can amplify emotions. So if I tell you something bad is about to happen, it's probably not going to be quite as bad as if it happens by surprise. And the same is true of good events. What's interesting - and, you know, everybody - we've known that for - for decades, if not centuries, and that's not a particularly deep observation. What we found really interesting is that, even though this is true - people never want uncertainty - they eschew it. They pay good money not to have it. We did a study in which people watched a movie. And for some of the people in our experiment, we didn't let them watch how the movie ended. We didn't let them see what happened to the main character. Now, if I asked you, which of these two movies would you rather see, 100 percent of the hands go up and say, I'd like to see the end of the movie, please. But what we discovered was people who didn't see the end of the movie liked it more, thought about it for longer, were still engaged in it and still enjoying it, even hours or days later. They didn't see what happened to the last - the main character in the end, and so they kept wondering. Gosh, I wonder if he went to college or he became a football player. What an interesting thing to be thinking about and enjoying. So the point is that a little bit of uncertainty can make you very happy, but we never seem to want it. If flowers showed up on your doorstep tomorrow with no note - it just said secret admirer - I bet you'd pay me a lot to find out who the secret admirer was. But I guarantee you, no matter who it is, it's better off just having a secret admirer than knowing who sent the flowers. VEDANTAM: Do you actually try and actively build mystery into your own life when it comes to positive events? GILBERT: I'm not telling. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: Dan, I want to thank you for talking with me today. This has really been fun. GILBERT: Sure. It's been fun for me, too. Thank you.

Storm waves are the biggest contributors to coastal flooding and damage. And as sea levels rise, waves are expected to travel further inland, threatening areas that were once considered safe. For our series on waves of all types, NPR's Christopher Joyce takes a look at how ocean scientists are trying to predict the uncertain future of storm waves. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: This spring, Tropical Storm Colin ripped across the Gulf of Mexico and hit the coast of southwest Florida with 60-mile-an-hour winds. Joe Long ventured out to film it. Long is an oceanographer with the U. S. Geological Survey. His video shows waves rushing up the beach to the foot of a sand dune. JOE LONG: So water levels are reaching that high. They're eroding the base of that dune and creating this pretty steep face. JOYCE: Just beyond the dunes, you can see a multi-story condominium. LONG: If that dune wasn't there, that water would be going on to roadways or hitting the base of those buildings. JOYCE: When Long goes to the beach, he gets excited about dune toes and scarp formation, which he says bores his kids, but it's helped him design a computer model that predicts something called wave run-up. During storms, wind pushes a mass of water up toward a beach. That's called surge, but on top of that surge, storms create waves that reach even higher. If they're big enough, they'll destroy the dune and wash sand deep in-shore, or they may carry the sand out to sea. LONG: The model we use is trying to predict the type of coastal change that we would see during a storm. JOYCE: The model is pretty new, but it predicted the level of wave run-up during Colin to within about eight inches. One reason the Geological Survey has spent years perfecting this model is because the ocean is moving in on us. A warming planet is causing sea levels to rise. LONG: More storms could impact these protective dunes because sea level's a little higher. JOYCE: Our coastlines are increasingly threatened, and the survey is trying to predict how and where. Florida is near the top of the list. At the survey's offices in St. Petersburg, I walked downstairs to a dimly lit basement lab to visit biologist Ilsa Kuffner. She's a coral reef expert. Hey. How're you doing? ILSA KUFFNER: Hey. This is our lab. Yeah. JOYCE: Shelves are packed with chunks of coral she's collected. Kuffner's job is to find out what happens to waves before they get to the beaches. KUFFNER: The main thrust of our project is looking at reefs being barriers to - you know, that are protecting coastlines. JOYCE: Reefs slow down incoming swells and waves. Problem is warmer ocean temperatures are killing a lot of coral, so the coral beds shrink down away from the sea surface. In effect, the water depth increases. KUFFNER: There's more water depth, so there's less drag. Like, more wave energy can propagate over the reef, so they're not performing as well as breakwaters. JOYCE: When waves do reach the shore, their effects depend on a lot of things, like how steep the beach is or how high the dunes are. Florida's west coast, it turns out, is not very sturdy. HILARY STOCKDON: Well, the Gulf is in a really bad state. JOYCE: Hilary Stockdon is an oceanographer at the survey. She says beaches and dunes along the Gulf of Mexico are flat and low. Even a small hurricane would do a lot of damage. STOCKDON: A direct landfall of a Category 1 almost anywhere in the Gulf of Mexico will be - cause significant coastal erosion. JOYCE: That threatens the wetlands and barrier islands, as well as roads and buildings. The team's computer models factor in sea level rise predictions, and they show lots of places along the East and the Gulf coasts that are increasingly threatened. STOCKDON: Water is just going to start reaching places where it hasn't reached before. And if people don't consider wave run-up, they're going to miss this important part. JOYCE: They are weather forecasters and emergency response teams from Maine to Mississippi. Some already are using the model to prepare, and that makes Nathanial Plant happy. Plant is the survey's top oceanographer on this project. He says the goal is to help people prepare, to know where it's going to flood and also where the waves cannot be stopped. NATHANIAL PLANT: As a nation, we actually have to decide - what areas are we going to invest in to protect? What areas are we going to let go on their own? JOYCE: In some places, he says, the waves are just going to wind. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

They are especially relevant following the destruction of last week's earthquake in central Italy. The biggest earthquake ever recorded was in Chile, in 1960. The earth shook for 10 minutes, sending shock waves around the world. That quake helped scientists come up with today's tsunami and quake early warning systems. NPR's Rae Ellen Bichell reports. RAE ELLEN BICHELL, BYLINE: The rumbling started on the afternoon of May 22, 1960. Sergio Barrientos was about 8 years old. SERGIO BARRIENTOS: So I vividly remember what happened. BICHELL: He was walking down a street in his hometown in southern Chile when the ground started to shake. He remembers electric wires swinging from the telephone poles. BARRIENTOS: And at the same time, I saw some of the chimneys falling down through the roofs of the houses. BICHELL: The ground was shaking so hard that Barrientos couldn't stay on his feet. He was stuck on the ground for several minutes as the earth heaved. Barrientos has since spent years studying earthquakes. He directs the National Seismological Center in Santiago, Chile. That earthquake in 1960 was the most powerful one ever recorded, with a magnitude of at least 9. 5. BARRIENTOS: It was a huge - a huge earthquake. BICHELL: And he now knows that during the quake, while he was stuck on the ground, his hometown lurched west about 30 feet. BARRIENTOS: The whole country stretched during this earthquake. That increased the area of the country itself. BICHELL: The quake expanded the country by an area equal to about 1,500 football fields and caused a lot of destruction. It was a big news story at the time. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Nations reckon up the grim toll of the seismic shocks that triggered a week of devastating earthquakes and volcanic eruptions in Chile and tidal waves and tropical storms that battered every shore, from the Philippines and Japan to Alaska. BICHELL: The Great Chilean Earthquake revealed something new about the planet, that the world itself could vibrate like a guitar string. The waves went through every part of the globe, even its core. And because they were so strong, instruments from around the world picked up the signal. When it was done, seismologists realized that the earthquake had given them a window into the earth's structure, like giving the planet an ultrasound. LARRY RUFF: That's very exciting because there's a new type of information that had not yet been available by all the studies from all the generations of seismologists before. BICHELL: That's Larry Ruff, a seismologist at the University of Michigan. At the time, researchers were just starting to agree that the continents sat on top of giant plates and that earthquakes were caused as those plates folded into each other. They were also just realizing that big seismic waves, like the ones that Chile experienced, could actually lift the ocean floor, causing water to roll across the Pacific Ocean and crash into countries many hours later. RUFF: And so it just caused an immediate flurry of activity. BICHELL: Because people realized that if they just had the right instruments to pick up on those waves, they could warn people that a tsunami was headed their way. RUFF: As soon as that happened, of course, it just prompted this huge new effort to have even better high-quality seismographs located all the way around the world. BICHELL: Now those instruments make up a global tsunami warning system. But that doesn't mean another major earthquake would be any less destructive. RUFF: We don't want to see an earthquake any larger than the 1960 earthquake, that's for sure. BICHELL: But it could happen. Scientists think that an earthquake as big as the Great Chilean Earthquake could occur on a number of faults, including one along the northwest coast of the U. S. Rae Ellen Bichell, NPR News.

A few months ago, they found it, and it's nowhere near the ocean. For our summer series on waves of all kinds, NPR's Jon Hamilton looks at the science of creating perfect artificial surfing waves. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: Forget Hawaii or Fiji. The spot surfers are talking about these days is a secluded pond in California's Central Valley. ROBERT WEAVER: It's just an amazing wave. HAMILTON: Robert Wingnut Weaver is a longborder from Santa Cruz. He is one of just a handful of people who have surfed this experimental manmade wave, which breaks 110 miles from the coast. WEAVER: And it was mind-blowing at how long the wave is, how big the wave is, and you can sense the power in it as it's rumbling at you. HAMILTON: Artificial surfing waves have been around since the 1960s at surf parks and resort pools. But most of them are weak and mushy compared to the natural kind. Weaver says the wave at this hidden surf lab is different. WEAVER: It's just like a normal wave. It really feels - I mean, you get that lift, that drop, and then you're starting to deal with performing with the wave as the wave is setting up in front of you. HAMILTON: Unlike an ocean wave, though, this one has an owner - the Kelly Slater Wave Company. Slater is an 11-time world champion surfer. He and his company aren't saying much about the technology used to create their wave, which they plan to market to surf parks around the world. But other wave-makers were happy to talk. Justin Enjo is an engineer at Surf Loch, an artificial wave company in San Diego. He shows me the pool where Surf Loch is fine-tuning its waves. JUSTIN ENJO: We're trying to carve water here. We're trying to make water exist in the shape of a ramp. HAMILTON: Kelly Slater's company does this by dragging a wing-shaped sled through the water. But that approach means surfers have to wait several minutes between waves. So Surf Loch is making waves with air pressure controlled by a computer. Enjo activates the device, which starts pumping out a wave every ten seconds. ENJO: As they hit the reef, they transform and they get that really hollow section. In the science realm, they call them plunging breakers. In surfing vernacular, it's referred to the tube or the barrel. HAMILTON: Surf Loch has yet to build a full-scale surfing wave with this technology, but it's founder, Tom Lochtefeld, has created hundreds of less sophisticated artificial waves for clients around the world. TOM LOCHTEFELD: One in particular was one of the sheik's palaces in Abu Dhabi. That one was definitely - and the wave itself was mammoth. I mean, it was a double, breaking left and right. HAMILTON: Even so, it didn't look or feel like a natural wave. Lochtefeld says that's because it's really hard to replicate an ocean swell in a small space. LOCHTEFELD: You don't have 75 miles or 100,000-200,000 miles to be able to generate the wave, so you got to compress that to the smallest possible footprint. That takes a lot of science. HAMILTON: Science that was out of reach just a few years ago. Lochtefeld says it takes a supercomputer to show precisely how a wave will interact with the underwater contours of a surf pool. LOCHTEFELD: When we do our really high resolution stuff, we're probably at 10,000 processors at 5 trillion calculations a second, you know, for a month (laughter). And it costs buku bucks just to run the thing. HAMILTON: Lochtefeld has big dreams for his artificial wave. LOCHTEFELD: We're going for the Olympics. HAMILTON: It's a dream shared by the Kelly Slater Wave Company. Both firms envision contests in which each surfer gets to ride an identical, flawless wave. Longboarder Wingnut Weaver has mixed feelings about that. WEAVER: You'll get to see the absolute best, who can do the best turn, the highest air because you'll have such a level playing field. But it'll never truly replace an open ocean competition. HAMILTON: The International Olympic Committee seems to agree. It's added surfing to the 2020 Olympics in Japan, but the competition will take place in the ocean, not a wave pool. Jon Hamilton, NPR News. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  Surfers have long searched for the perfect wave. A few months ago, they found it, and it's nowhere near the ocean. For our summer series on waves of all kinds, NPR's Jon Hamilton looks at the science of creating perfect artificial surfing waves. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: Forget Hawaii or Fiji. The spot surfers are talking about these days is a secluded pond in California's Central Valley. ROBERT WEAVER: It's just an amazing wave. HAMILTON: Robert Wingnut Weaver is a longborder from Santa Cruz. He is one of just a handful of people who have surfed this experimental manmade wave, which breaks 110 miles from the coast. WEAVER: And it was mind-blowing at how long the wave is, how big the wave is, and you can sense the power in it as it's rumbling at you. HAMILTON: Artificial surfing waves have been around since the 1960s at surf parks and resort pools. But most of them are weak and mushy compared to the natural kind. Weaver says the wave at this hidden surf lab is different. WEAVER: It's just like a normal wave. It really feels - I mean, you get that lift, that drop, and then you're starting to deal with performing with the wave as the wave is setting up in front of you. HAMILTON: Unlike an ocean wave, though, this one has an owner - the Kelly Slater Wave Company. Slater is an 11-time world champion surfer. He and his company aren't saying much about the technology used to create their wave, which they plan to market to surf parks around the world. But other wave-makers were happy to talk. Justin Enjo is an engineer at Surf Loch, an artificial wave company in San Diego. He shows me the pool where Surf Loch is fine-tuning its waves. JUSTIN ENJO: We're trying to carve water here. We're trying to make water exist in the shape of a ramp. HAMILTON: Kelly Slater's company does this by dragging a wing-shaped sled through the water. But that approach means surfers have to wait several minutes between waves. So Surf Loch is making waves with air pressure controlled by a computer. Enjo activates the device, which starts pumping out a wave every ten seconds. ENJO: As they hit the reef, they transform and they get that really hollow section. In the science realm, they call them plunging breakers. In surfing vernacular, it's referred to the tube or the barrel.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Oh, not my driving. I bicycle to work. SIEGEL: All right. All right. But when you are behind the wheel, here's something to think about. If you are ever the guy in the left-hand lane slowing down traffic, stop it. SHAPIRO: OK. This is something we've been talking about since we saw a piece in Vox by freelance science reporter Joseph Stromberg. He stresses the science on all of this is not settled, but. . . JOSEPH STROMBERG: When you're traveling on the highway, the moment at which you're most at risk of getting into a crash is when you're changing lanes. And when you have people going slow in the left lane, as well as the right lane, then people who want to move faster kind of have to zigzag back and forth. They have to change lanes looking over both different shoulders, and it just increases the amount of possible accident scenarios that can happen. SHAPIRO: Every state has laws that discourage left-lane driving, and some, including Ohio, Texas and Washington, are handing out tickets. SIEGEL: But wait a minute, you might be saying to yourself. I'm going the speed limit. I can't be the problem. Oh, yes, you can. Here's Stromberg again. STROMBERG: One of the best predictors of an accident isn't necessarily whether someone's speeding or not, but the difference between the average speed of traffic surrounding them and how fast they're going. And it turns out that going 5 miles per hour slower than the surrounding speed of traffic puts you at a greater risk of accident than going 5 miles per hour faster. SHAPIRO: And slower drivers can mean more traffic jams. STROMBERG: There is, you know, strong research showing that just a small amount of congestion can ripple outwards and make a really big traffic jam. And a lot of times that's because of just a few cars that are going slower than the speed limit or just at it and blocking up both lanes. And that causes, you know, layers and layers of people trying to pass just backed up behind them. And so it's annoying, but it also really can cause legitimate congestion. SHAPIRO: So if you're driving this Labor Day weekend, let the lead foots have the left lane. SIEGEL: You'll be doing everyone a favor.

Sometime soon, you will hear someone make a prediction about the outcome of the presidential election, for example, or who's going to win the World Series.

INSKEEP: So we're talking about you and me at a bar, just talking about the future. What do we do wrong? VEDANTAM: We break up predictions into their elements. If we want to say who's going to win the Super Bowl this year, we say, let's follow the progress of each team. Let's think about how each team will do, and that'll tell us who's going to end up in the Super Bowl. Or if we want to know who's going to win the presidential election, we say, let's look at the performance of the party state by state, and that's going to tell us who's going to win nationally.

INSKEEP: . . . Of different players, or I'm looking at different electoral votes in different states. VEDANTAM: That's right. But for most people who are using their intuitions, you know, sitting around chatting, it's potentially counterproductive. I was speaking with Theresa Kelly. She studies consumer behavior at Washington University in St. Louis, along with Joseph Simmons of the University of Pennsylvania. She conducted a series of 19 experiments. Many of them involved sports prediction. She divided volunteers at random into groups. She gave both groups the track records of teams, and she asked one group to simply predict who won the next game. Then she asked people in the other group to think about the details of game. What's the final score? How's the pitcher going to perform? And then, who's going to win? People who focused on the details were less likely to call the correct winner than those who didn't think about all the details involved in the prediction. INSKEEP: Wait a minute, why did we screw it up? VEDANTAM: People are not very good at weighing different details in a prediction. Here's Kelly. THERESA KELLY: Humans have a very, very hard time understanding correlations between different pieces of information. So I might know that the pitcher's very important and the team records are very important, but I don't know how to account for the fact that the quality of the pitcher directly contributes to the team record. INSKEEP: So should we forget about the quality of the pitcher or the quality of a particular performance in a political debate and just go with our gut? VEDANTAM: Well, like everything else about human behavior, Steve, there are caveats. If you pay too much attention to the drama of battleground state polls, you can undercount the overall state of the race. Kelly says that what she does in her own life, when it comes to making predictions about how she might complete an assignment, for example, is she simply focuses on past performance rather than the details. KELLY: Rather than try to think about all the circumstances surrounding this present attempt to complete the assignment, I'll just say, well, how long has it taken me to complete similar assignments in the past? In general, that's a better way to make predictions because there's all kinds of reasons why thinking through the details of the case at hand can lead you astray. VEDANTAM: Now, Steve, if you can actually weigh all the individual details like a statistician, you can fine tune the picture by paying attention to the details.

But injuries have already begun and with that, a conversation about the toll of football on a player's body. This year, though, a new conversation has begun about how to manage all that pain with marijuana. Twenty-five states and the District of Columbia now allow some form of marijuana use, mainly for medicinal purposes. But if you play in the NFL and you use marijuana for any reason, it could cost you your job. Tennessee Titans linebacker Derrick Morgan would like to change that. He's raising the issue in an effort to persuade league officials to at least study the possible health benefits. He joined us from Nashville, and I started by asking him how he got involved in this issue. DERRICK MORGAN: Maybe about a year and a half ago, all the CT and the traumatic brain injury stuff was hitting the news. And, to me, that was very alarming. So I really started exploring what my options were, and there really weren't any, you know, just readily available to you for protecting your brain, protecting your health from the trauma that you experience playing football. So I actually was watching the CNN documentary on weed, and I seen this little girl named Charlotte. You know, she had epilepsy - hundreds of seizures a week, and they started giving her this cannabis oil. And it was a significant reduction in her seizures almost overnight. So I started looking into it. I started researching and educating myself, reached out to Eugene Monroe - because I've seen him publicly advocating for it - reached out to him and he just really extended his pool of resources and just kind of shared with me his story and his journey on it. And the more and more I researched it, the more and more I got comfortable about talking about it. MARTIN: As you mentioned, Eugene Monroe, former Baltimore Ravens offensive lineman, he's been advocating for this. Now, he recently announced that he is retiring. You're an active player, and so I'm assuming that other active players, like yourself, have these concerns, but aren't able to or willing to address them publicly. Why are you willing to go public with this concern and others aren't? MORGAN: You know, for me, I wish it didn't have to be cannabis that I had to come out publicly and talk about it, but the more and more I research this, I'm like, wow, this is something that - it shows to be very promising. You know, a lot of people are benefiting from it. I'm like, you know, I've got to spread the awareness. I got to get people talking about this. MARTIN: A number of people have pointed out that, you know, alcohol is not banned. I mean, obviously, you're expected. . . MORGAN: It's sponsored (laughter). MARTIN: . . . To use good judgment, right? It's sponsored. It's a major sponsor. MORGAN: Yeah, it's a sponsor. MARTIN: Yeah. What's the league saying to you about this? What are they - how have they responded to you so far? MORGAN: I really haven't had too much conversation with the NFL. I think where it starts is the delegation of resources to researching it. There's a lot of anecdotal evidence out there of people benefiting from it, but I think we need some clinical research into it in order to make some progress. MARTIN: Well, Yeah. How would you envision its use or what kind of - what form would you want the research to take - to what end? What would it be for pain management? MORGAN: Yeah. I think so. Pain management. Obviously, we have an opioid epidemic in our country. The NFL is not immune to that, so definitely as a alternative to the prescription painkillers and then also as a protectant for your brain. We're banging heads every play, so to have something that could possibly be a neuro-protectant, I think that's definitely worth looking into. MARTIN: That's Tennessee Titans linebacker Derrick Morgan joining us from member station WPLN in Nashville. Thank you so much. MORGAN: Yeah, definitely. Thank you. Thank you guys.

So I really started exploring what my options were, and there really weren't any, you know, just readily available to you for protecting your brain, protecting your health from the trauma that you experience playing football. So I actually was watching the CNN documentary on weed, and I seen this little girl named Charlotte. You know, she had epilepsy - hundreds of seizures a week, and they started giving her this cannabis oil. And it was a significant reduction in her seizures almost overnight. So I started looking into it. I started researching and educating myself, reached out to Eugene Monroe - because I've seen him publicly advocating for it - reached out to him and he just really extended his pool of resources and just kind of shared with me his story and his journey on it. And the more and more I researched it, the more and more I got comfortable about talking about it. MARTIN: As you mentioned, Eugene Monroe, former Baltimore Ravens offensive lineman, he's been advocating for this. Now, he recently announced that he is retiring. You're an active player, and so I'm assuming that other active players, like yourself, have these concerns, but aren't able to or willing to address them publicly. Why are you willing to go public with this concern and others aren't? MORGAN: You know, for me, I wish it didn't have to be cannabis that I had to come out publicly and talk about it, but the more and more I research this, I'm like, wow, this is something that - it shows to be very promising. You know, a lot of people are benefiting from it. I'm like, you know, I've got to spread the awareness. I got to get people talking about this. MARTIN: A number of people have pointed out that, you know, alcohol is not banned. I mean, obviously, you're expected. . . MORGAN: It's sponsored (laughter). MARTIN: . . . To use good judgment, right? It's sponsored. It's a major sponsor. MORGAN: Yeah, it's a sponsor. MARTIN: Yeah. What's the league saying to you about this? What are they - how have they responded to you so far? MORGAN: I really haven't had too much conversation with the NFL. I think where it starts is the delegation of resources to researching it. There's a lot of anecdotal evidence out there of people benefiting from it, but I think we need some clinical research into it in order to make some progress. MARTIN: Well, Yeah. How would you envision its use or what kind of - what form would you want the research to take - to what end? What would it be for pain management? MORGAN: Yeah. I think so. Pain management. Obviously, we have an opioid epidemic in our country. The NFL is not immune to that, so definitely as a alternative to the prescription painkillers and then also as a protectant for your brain. We're banging heads every play, so to have something that could possibly be a neuro-protectant, I think that's definitely worth looking into. MARTIN: That's Tennessee Titans linebacker Derrick Morgan joining us from member station WPLN in Nashville. Thank you so much. MORGAN: Yeah, definitely. Thank you. Thank you guys.", "section": "Sports", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

A batter has just milliseconds to figure out how fast the ball was thrown, where it'll cross the plate, or not, and if he'll swing, or not, and how. A couple of neuroscientists are studying the brains of baseball pitchers to measure how they react to pitches. Jason Sherwin is the co-founder of deCervo, a company that specializes in high-speed decision-making. He joins us now from New York, the capital of high-speed decision-making. Thanks so much for being with us. JASON SHERWIN: Thanks for having me. SIMON: You've been working with a couple of major league ball clubs. SHERWIN: That's correct. SIMON: So I know you can't tell us the names of the teams, but what kind of work do you do to figure this out? SHERWIN: Well, what we do is we're looking at, on a neural level, how batters make decisions on recognizing pitches or recognizing balls and strikes. And we do that by looking at the brain activity when they're deciding on pitches that we simulate for them on a video game. SIMON: Can you explain to us how the brain works when a ball is thrown? SHERWIN: Generally, what's going on is that your visual parts of the brain are figuring out whether this is a pitch to hit or not. And then they have to connect that to the motor parts of the brain. Those are the parts of the brain that allow you to move. And when your visual processing says this is a pitch I want to hit, it will then connect to the motor parts of the brain that allow you to then swing the bat and hopefully make contact with the ball. SIMON: And how much time are we talking about? SHERWIN: I mean, from release of the pitch until it gets to the plate, a 95-mile-an-hour fastball is around 425-450 milliseconds. Now, on the other side, it takes 150 milliseconds on average for a Major League Baseball player to get their bat around. So we're really shaving tens of milliseconds here in terms of in the middle where you have to decide on whether this is a pitch to hit or not. SIMON: Are you deciding or does something else kick in? Is it a learned reaction? Is it reflexes? What is it? SHERWIN: It's mostly a learned reaction. I mean, there's some amount of reflexes, but in this case, it is a learned thing. Nobody is born with a gene for knowing how to hit a baseball. And it's something that's learned over time and is improved with experience. SIMON: Now, you know, people have mocked Yogi Berra for years for saying, how do you expect a guy to think and hit at the same time? But he was on to something, wasn't he? SHERWIN: He was absolutely on to something. When we first started doing this work, we started seeing that when subjects were getting the pitches wrong, they were using the frontal parts of their brain too much. The frontal parts of the brain are mostly involved in deliberate decision-making. And when they get involved, they slow down the speed of your decisions. And when you're up at the plate and you're facing a 95-mile-an-hour fastball and you've got tens of milliseconds really to decide on whether you want to hit this thing or not, that's where that deliberate thinking is a problem. So Yogi was really on to something there. SIMON: I think a few things as being more important than this, than enhancing the game of baseball. But that being said, I wonder if there are other areas of human enterprise where this research can be applied. SHERWIN: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I originally started doing research on musicians, as I'm a musician myself, and I wanted to see how their brains reacted to when they listen to music. And then that evolved very quickly into the U. S. Army Research Lab being interested in this for how soldiers and marksman respond to the sound of gunshots. So if you think of, you know, a realm of applications where you have quick decision-making involved, whether it's slamming on the brakes of your car, whether it's a policeman deciding, you know, is this a dangerous person who's running at me or not, there are a whole realm of applications where quick decisions are important and have, you know, serious real-life consequences.

NASA's next Mars rover mission isn't explicitly designed to look for life, but it will look for evidence life could have once existed on the red planet. And that poses a problem. Where could that evidence be? Ask six Mars experts, and you'll probably get seven answers. But right now, one of the leading suggestions for the next rover landing site comes from a teenager who hasn't yet finished high school. As part of his series Joe's Big Idea, NPR's Joe Palca has this story about a young man with some big ideas of his own. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: When I visited Alex Longo at his home in Raleigh, N. C. , the first thing I was curious to learn was when this precocious 16-year-old had become obsessed with Mars. ALEX LONGO: Well, it wasn't just really Mars. My first experience with space exploration was in 2005. I was just 5 years old, and Mom and Dad had me watch a space shuttle launch. PALCA: Watching that shuttle launch was the start. Alex decided not only did he want to go into space someday himself, he wanted to be the first person to walk on Mars. He began following NASA missions on the agency's website. And one day in 2014, he came across an announcement about the next rover mission to Mars. A. LONGO: I saw that they were looking for abstracts from scientists to suggest landing sites. And I decide, well, I'll write something up. PALCA: He figured - why not? He'd written to NASA before. A. LONGO: Each time, you know, they sent me cool space shuttle mission posters or patches or something like that. I was like, well, I'll write to them, and maybe they'll send me some cool stuff. PALCA: But then he thought, maybe he should tell his mom what he was planning. LAURA LONGO: He said, hey, Mom, can I send this in to NASA? PALCA: That's Laura Longo. L. LONGO: And I said, well, let's take a look at it. And I sat down, and it's this multi-page, like, scientific document. And I said, oh, honey, that's really cool, thinking he's going to get some more swag (laughter). It's going to be great. PALCA: Alex's proposal was to land in the same place NASA's rover called Spirit had landed, a place called Gusev crater. Spirit found some intriguing potential signs there was once life on Mars. Some scientists would surely say, been there, done that. But Alex argued Gusev was worth a second look. NASA apparently agreed because instead of swag, they sent him an email inviting him to attend the first landing-site planning meeting. A. LONGO: At first, I didn't believe it. I thought that it was a dream or something. And so I just got up, walked away. And a little while later, I came back, and that email was still there (laughter). I was like, wow, I actually just got invited to go to a NASA conference. How cool is that? PALCA: The meeting was in Washington, D. C. His mom and dad drove him there. Alex was scheduled to speak in the last session of the conference. A. LONGO: Honestly, I was a bit scared because there are a 125 Ph. D. s and grad students in that room. And I'm giving a presentation to all these people. L. LONGO: I was focused on breathing so I wouldn't fall out of the chair. PALCA: Laura Longo still beams when she recalls that day. L. LONGO: When he finished, the entire room burst into applause. Everybody recognized how special. . . A. LONGO: Yes. L. LONGO: . . . This was for this young person. PALCA: That was 2014. Alex has now teamed up with some more experienced Mars scientists who also favor going back to Gusev crater. Their proposal is one of eight finalists. Alex also wangled an invitation to a NASA-sponsored conference to pick a landing site for the first human landing on Mars. He figured he had to go to that. A. LONGO: Because if I really am going to be the first guy to go there, I want a say in where I'm going to be landing. PALCA: Well, makes sense to me. Joe Palca, NPR News, Raleigh, N. C.

But it wouldn't show up at levels habitable for most organisms, like you or me, for another 2 billion years. And the answer to the question of why it took that long could lie at the bottom of Lake Huron. Today, the research vessel Storm is heading out to sinkholes less than a quarter-mile offshore. On deck, divers are prepping their gear for an 80-minute dive. And then. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SPLASHING)GREGORY DICK: So we are visiting what's a pretty unusual microbial mat community. THORP: That's Gregory Dick, a research scientist at the University of Michigan. He says microbial mats are like a large, mushy, purple carpet covering the floor of the lake. He says they're responsible for life on Earth. DICK: These microbial mats, we think, are representative of the types of organisms that would have lived billions of years ago and played a really important role in Earth's oxygenation. That is the addition of oxygen to Earth's atmosphere. THORP: The mats are made up of cyanobacteria, some of the first organisms able to perform photosynthesis - or turn light into oxygen. But here's the thing about our purple friends, they don't always produce oxygen. DICK: They can either produce or not produce oxygen, and we're very interested in what are the environmental and biological controls on that oxygen production? THORP: If scientists can figure out what controls oxygen production in these mats, they might be able to answer the question of why it took so long for oxygen to reach current levels. Dirk de Beer is a scientist from Bremen, Germany. He says having access to sites like this one is rare. DIRK DE BEER: Difficult - they're very difficult to find. Yeah, you have to have a unique set of conditions. THORP: To help them understand these mats, de Beer and his team are using high-tech microsensors. DE BEER: So I have an instrument that is equipped with microsensors. These are thinner than hair. THORP: Divers survey the mats with a combination of microsensors and camera snapshots. Back on the boat, scientists merge that data to build a map showing where the oxygen is being produced. One of the scientists shows me a color-coded layout of where oxygen is being produced in the mats on his laptop. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: That looks like that. You see? THORP: What makes this so compelling to scientists is that it gets at the question of how the Earth came to support life. Trinity Hamilton is a professor of biological science at the University of Cincinnati. She says there's a huge gap in our knowledge of Earth history. TRINITY HAMILTON: This is a question that folks have been working on for a really, really long time. And so - yeah, it has a really, really broad implications in the field, for sure. THORP: And Gregory Dick says it's part of a larger question. How rare are the conditions that allow for life? DICK: What about life on other planets? How common is this process? And what are the processes that lead to a planet with an oxygen-rich atmosphere that can support animal life?

I'm Shankar Vedantam. When you imagine a powerful person, what comes to mind? (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"HOUSE OF CARDS\")KEVIN SPACEY: (As Frank Underwood) In Gaffney, we had our own brand of diplomacy - shake with your right hand but hold a rock in your left. VEDANTAM: Perhaps you don't picture someone as evil as Frank Underwood from \"House Of Cards,\" but you also probably don't think of someone very nice. We don't normally associate power with qualities like compassion and kindness. But the psychologist Dacher Keltner at UC Berkeley says maybe we should. DACHER KELTNER: What the science is finding is that kids at school, kids in summer camps, people in colleges, people in organizations, if they are emotionally intelligent and really focus on others and even practice generosity, they rise in social power. VEDANTAM: Dacher studies power dynamics, and he's found something that might seem counter-intuitive. If you think of power is all about Machiavellian scheming, the people who display altruism, kindness, social intelligence, Dacher finds that these are the people who gain power and respect from their peers. But there's a catch - once these people become powerful, power tends to undermine the very qualities that helped them get there in the first place. KELTNER: There's something about the seductions of power that makes you lose sight of ethics in other people's interests. VEDANTAM: Dacher Keltner is the author of the new book \"The Power Paradox: How We Gain And Lose Influence. \" We think his ideas are especially relevant right now when so many people are vying for power in this election season. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Dacher, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. KELTNER: It's great to be with you, Shankar. VEDANTAM: I'm fascinated by the research that you cite in the book, Dacher, that suggests that power shapes nearly all of our relationships. If you put a bunch of 13-year-old kids in a room, you say that power dynamics quickly emerge. And you make the case that kids who are kinder and more empathetic are the ones who quickly assume the mantle of power in the group. KELTNER: So you're right on both counts, Shankar. I mean, first of all, you know, one of the things that we've learned in the science of power is that really power dynamics, who's influencing whom, shape every relationship from parent-child dynamics to dynamics in the U. S. Senate. And then, you know, what we've discovered over the past 20 years is probably a little bit counter-intuitive, and it challenges older ideas about power, more Machiavellian ideas. And what the science is finding is that kids at school, kids in summer camps, people in colleges, people in organizations, if they are emotionally intelligent and really focus on others and even practice generosity, they rise in social power. VEDANTAM: I have to say, as I hear that, I have some skepticism, and this might be because you attended nicer schools than I did. KELTNER: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: But my experience of middle school felt, you know, more emotionally like \"The Hunger Games,\" that, you know, kids who were stronger and louder and meaner often got their way. I mean, is my experience an aberration? KELTNER: Well, I don't know where you went to school, but it tends to be an aberration. You know, so what these studies do is they take a group of seventh graders, you find out who has respect and esteem at the start of the year, you study what their social behaviors are or their social strategies, and then you track how they do in the hierarchy of that seventh grade class, to use your example. And, you know, what you find is, yes, the bullies and the Machiavellians, the sociopaths, they get a little bit of attention early. But over the long haul - and this is true in other contexts - they don't have as much power as they would like to. And instead, what studies find now numbering in the dozens, it's really the the connecting kid, the empathetic kid, the kid who's really open and curious who really rises in the esteem and the ranks of the class. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if this really comes down to thinking about power in two different ways. KELTNER: Yeah. VEDANTAM: The power that I'm hearing you talk about is really reputational power. You know, I think of Doctors Without Borders, for example, as having reputational power. They don't - you know, they don't cut my paycheck and they can't fire me, but I pay attention to what they say because I respect them as an organization. On the other hand, when you have coercer (ph) power, people who can punish you or people who can take away your life or your freedom, it feels like maybe is it possible that those two different - there are two different paths to power for those two different kinds of power? KELTNER: Absolutely. And, I mean, that's a wonderful observation. And so one of the things that the science of power has done, which I report on in \"The Power Paradox,\" is to take a step back and think, what do we really mean by power? You know, we intuitively define it as money, but a lot of things happen in the world that are independent of capital. We might think of it historically as military might, but you can easily come up with counterexamples where immense military might actually produces weakness. And so we have to kind of problematize it, and what the field has done is thought about one strategy to power that works in certain contexts is a kind of a coercive top-down Machiavellian strategy. Another kind is a more socially intelligent strategy that involves some of these things we've been talking about. And, you know, what's really interesting, Shankar, and one of the things that inspired me to write this book is a lot of data that have been summarized by people like Alice Eagly finding that our conception of power is moving from coercive strategies to more collaborative strategies. So it's one of the reasons I wrote this book. VEDANTAM: So when you describe this kind of power that is more reputational, by that account, you would say, you know, the United States' power in the world is not just a reflection of the strength of its military and the size of its armed forces. It's really about the power of its ideas, its ability to do well in the world. Is that the argument you're making, that this kind of soft power in some ways is more important than the hard power that we've come to associate with power? KELTNER: Well, this is one of the ideas that really spurred the science of power for the - in our lab and other labs for the past 20 years, which is that, you know, if you think about the influence the U. S. has on the average world citizen, part of it is through the flow of capital and economics and part of it is, you know, having this expansive military. But a bigger component or dimension to our power is how do we shape the thinking of people around the world? How do we shape the emotions of people around the world? Are there what they deem to be fair or right? And that comes through books. It comes through forms of art. It comes through journalism, and I think, you know, I took that thinking of soft power, if you will, which is, in some ways, is harder, and really extended it to the personal realm, which is that as a parent, you know, yeah, I have economic control over my kids. I have - I'm bigger than they are. But really I also influence them through ideas, through preferences that I enable, through the context that I put them in. So power is much more than economic or military might. It's really - it's how we influence the states of other people. VEDANTAM: You talk in the book about the story of Abraham Lincoln and cite his rise to power as a classic example of what you're talking about, the skills that you're talking about. KELTNER: Yeah. You know, one of the things I did, Shankar, you know, in the three years of writing this book - and really while I've been doing the science of power - is just to read broadly on the biographies of great leaders, the historical accounts of important social change. And, you know, what I encountered is time and time again that there are these examples, very compelling examples, of great leaders who lead through advancing the interests of other people. You know, I mean, Abraham Lincoln was such a compelling example, you know, and I love this observation about him of Thurlow Weed who was a journalist at the time and a close student of the politics of Lincoln's era. And he's like what is it about Lincoln that accounts for his really unpredicted rise in power? He's a poor guy, awkward, didn't have all the advantages that often give you power. And he said - Thurlow Weed said, you know, Lincoln sees and hears everybody who comes to him. He just engages in the interests of others. And then when I read that and then I heard about the science, for example, of Stephane Cote showing it's really these emotionally intelligent managers in workplaces that rise in the ranks and build strong teams, I saw this nice convergence of evidence. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: When we come back, I'm going to ask Dacher about several experiments he's conducted that show that even as kindness and empathy can give rise to power, having power can undermine kindness and empathy. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MAGGIE PENMAN, BYLINE: Hi there. I'm Maggie Penman. I'm one of the producers of HIDDEN BRAIN encouraging you to download the NPR One app. As summer winds down, it's a great way to find new shows and stories for those lovely last road trips to the beach. Or if vacation is over for you, maybe you could download it before your morning commute. Basically, you should just download it. It's in your app store - NPR O-N-E. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Dacher, you've done a lot of work looking not just at the forces that give rise to power, these forces of empathy and generosity and kindness, but also what power does to those forces in turn, that when people acquire power, it seems to change their ability to be empathetic, to be kind. Talk about that. KELTNER: Well, this was some of the more dramatic work that we engaged in, you know, that's now been replicated in a lot of different places, so - and that's why I call the book \"The Power Paradox,\" which is - you know, if you look at this social science of power, we get power through, you know, the pro-social tendencies that we are endowed with. But then once we feel powerful or we come from a background of privilege and feeling above others, we lose those tendencies. So let me give an example. You know, there are a lot of studies that show that empathetic practices get you power. So one of my favorites is work by Woolley and colleagues showing, you know, you give teams these complex problems to solve, and it's really the more empathetic individuals that make their team stronger and perform better, right? They're listening well. They're asking good questions. They're paying attention to other people. So empathy makes the team and the individual stronger. And then what we've started to show in our lab is once we feel powerful, we lose - or our capacity to empathize and to know what others are thinking really is diminished. So in one study, really simple, we, you know, get - bring people to the lab. We have them engage in this exercise where they compare themselves to the - sort of the real poor people of society, and it makes them feel powerful. Or they compare themselves to the - kind of the elite of society, and they feel as a result of that comparison less power. And then we just present them some photos of people expressing different emotions with subtle muscle movements around the eyes, like concentration or flirtatious or decisive. And what we find is when you feel powerful, you lose your ability to read emotion in people's facial expressions. VEDANTAM: Why would that happen? KELTNER: Well, I mean, there are a couple of deep reasons. One is, you know, and this is just striking research by Keely Muscatell and Supvindeer Obdea (ph) which is that when - you know, Shankar, what - if I feel powerful, the studies show I just feel less interested in other people, less invested in them. And as a result, the empathy networks in the brain are actually quieted. They are less active. So Keely Muscatell brought people to the lab. She had them sort of think about another student's daily life, and if you come from a position of privilege and power, the classic empathy networks in the frontal lobes of your brain are not even active when you're thinking about another student. So this is a very deep effect of what power does to our empathic capacities. VEDANTAM: So what you're saying, in some ways, is that we are empathetic to others in part because that's useful to us. We lack power in many situations, and being empathetic and being aware of others allows us to navigate our social worlds effectively. But when we perceive ourselves having power and privilege, in some ways, we don't need to depend as much as we do on others. We don't need to reach out to others, and so those networks shut down. KELTNER: Yeah, no, really well put - because if you think about, for example, somebody who's poor and doesn't have a lot of resources, they're dependent on other people to get to work, to do a little bit of, you know, ad hoc childcare or what have you. So you're dependent on others, and out of that state of mutual dependence, you really, with vigilance, attend to other people and are aware of what they're doing. And that produces these empathy benefits coming out of less power. And then the compliment - you lose that empathy when you feel less dependent on others and powerful. VEDANTAM: So one of the paradoxes of this is something that you and others have identified, which is to look at the generosity of people who are rich and poor. KELTNER: Yeah. VEDANTAM: And you find some really surprising things. KELTNER: Yeah. You know, so, again, you know, what studies are finding - and again, this is part of the power paradox - which is that, you know, there is this really interesting literature called competitive altruism. And if you take the average person in a social network and they practice generosity and they share resources or they encourage others, through those acts of generosity, they rise in power. People trust them. They esteem them. You even see this in hunter-gatherer societies, where it's really the individual who shares the most food in hunter-gatherer societies who rises in the ranks. And yet, you know, what we started to find with Paul Piff and other colleagues is, once I feel powerful, I prove to be less generous. So in one study, we brought people to the lab who varied in terms of their social class and family wealth. We just gave them a very simple opportunity to share resources with a stranger, and we found it was really the poor who shared more, and higher-power people, more privileged people shared less. VEDANTAM: Now, obviously, people who are millionaires and billionaires, they might be philanthropic, and they might give larger amounts of money. But what you're really saying is, as a proportion of your wealth, for a millionaire to give a thousand dollars is not the same thing as somebody at the poverty line who's giving 50. KELTNER: Yeah, we always have to be careful about how we interpret these results. And these are just, you know, proportions of sharing and not absolute amounts, and you're absolutely right. But you even get this experimentally. So, you know, in one of our early studies in power, we were interested in, does experimentally produced power lead to kind of the hoarding of resources which we've been talking about? We brought groups of three people to the lab. We randomly assigned one individual to the position of power. And then, by design, they went through this experiment. And it was kind of boring, and they were writing policies for the university. And we brought in halfway through the study this plate of five chocolate chip cookies. Every member of the group - three people all together - took a cookie. And so we asked who took that fourth cookie. And it was our high-power person who tended to take that cookie. Not only that, but they ate in this kind of impulsive way, where their lips were smacking, mouths were open, you know? (LAUGHTER)KELTNER: Crumbs - took us seven months to code it - crumbs falling on their sweaters. And again, you know, what this tells us is really two things, Shankar, which is, you know, power does make us a little bit more self-focused. In this - you know, you're sharing less. You're keeping more for yourself. You're eating the cookie in an impulsive way. But the other thing I think we shouldn't lose sight of is this can happen to us all, right? This is just what the mind does when we feel powerful. VEDANTAM: Because, of course, these were just random people who are brought into the lab, and you randomly picked one of them to assign them a feeling of power. KELTNER: Yeah, absolutely. VEDANTAM: You did mention there were five cookies and three people, so what happened to the fifth cookie? KELTNER: Well, this was where it was really interesting because, you know, the rules of politeness suggest that you really should not be that uncouth person who takes the last cookie off the plate. And so we did pilot testing for the experiment, and no one would take that fourth cookie. So that's why we added a fifth cookie - just to free somebody up to take that second-to-last cookie. VEDANTAM: So it's fascinating because, of course, what you see in these lab experiments is often reflected on much, much bigger stages, where you see people in power abusing that power - you know, having affairs, cheating and, you know, falsifying financial returns. And, you know, at one level, the conventional view, I think, is sort of to say, these are just people who were bad people who rose to the top. But what you're suggesting is actually something more complex and, in some ways, much sadder, which is that these might not be bad people who rose to the top, but these might be good people who rose to the top, and power has made them bad. KELTNER: Yeah. I mean, that's such a - a very compelling and sweeping statement about this, Shankar. You know, that does align with how I read this social scientific evidence, which is that, you know, there are dozens of experiments where we randomly assign typical people to either positions of power or less power. And you find these patterns where, if I'm just randomly given power, and I feel this sense of sort of expansive, you know, euphoria that comes with power and a sense of omnipotence, you know, I speak more rudely. I take resources that are meant for somebody else. I'm more likely to flirt inappropriately. I'm more likely to engage in inappropriate sexual behavior. We have studies showing, when you make somebody feel powerful, you're more likely to cheat at a game to win 50 bucks. The list goes on. And it really lends credence to Lord Acton's old observation that, I think, stands the test of time, which is power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. VEDANTAM: You've also found the same thing looking at drivers of various cars. I understand you ran an experiment where you stood outside an intersection and saw who stopped at a stop sign. KELTNER: Yeah (laughter). You know, I mean - so I remember one day I was biking to work, and almost got hit by a black Mercedes. And the guy - you know, and I was in the right. I sort of waited and gone through this four-way stop area in California. And this guy plowed and almost hit me, and he looked at me as if, you know, I was the hoi polloi and should be sort of taken off the road. And I thought, you know, it'd be really interesting to test these ideas about the impulsive actions that power produces by looking at how people drive. So, you know, what we did in one of the versions of this study is we put a young Berkeley undergraduate at a pedestrian zone right next to the Berkeley campus. The pedestrian zone is this strip that cuts across a road that is - it gives the pedestrian the right of way. You get to cross the road. It's white stripes. And then we coded, and we had these Berkeley undergrads kind of hiding in the bushes. Our one student was standing at the pedestrian zone. The other student, who was coding, was noting the make of the car and whether, very simply, did they stop for the pedestrian, which is law, or did they blaze through the pedestrian zone? And 0 percent of our drivers of poor cars - the Yugos and Plymouth Satellites of the world - drove through the pedestrian zone; 46. 2 percent of our drivers of wealthy cars - you know, the Mercedes and the like - drive through the pedestrian zone. VEDANTAM: Forty-six percent? KELTNER: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Is it something to do with Berkeley? KELTNER: (Laughter). You know, it's funny. I just got a letter from a guy in Germany who was like, this would not happen in Germany, where we really value our Mercedes and BMWs. You know, we've replicated it. It's been replicated in other - other states. It led people to email me from all manner of context. One of my favorites was a Prius driver emailed me and said, well, you know, that's Mercedes, but of course Prius drivers abide by the law. So we checked, and Prius drivers were actually the worst. (LAUGHTER)KELTNER: So, you know, and this just fits this - this larger profile that I'm sure your listeners are aware of - that there's something about the seductions of power that makes you lose sight of ethics and other people's interests. VEDANTAM: You talk in the book about leaders who are able to overcome the paradox of power. And we talked earlier about Lincoln and how his rise to power was marked by demonstrations of these - these positive behaviors. But you also write about how he was able to retain a sense of that kinder, gentler, more empathetic self, even as he acquired and wielded great power. Talk about that story and what he did that might be illustrated for the rest of us. KELTNER: Well, you know, I think that the thing that really is striking about Lincoln's power is, you know, he had a short presidency, but he remained focused on the interests of others. He remained focused on uniting disparate parties and really the greater good, if you will - that he knew that that there was this state of the Union that he was heading toward. And the way that he did it, you know, is - and it just comes through, for example, in Doris Kearns Goodwin's \"Team Of Rivals\" - is he just - he kept close to not only the dignity of everybody and treated, you know, the warring sides, if you will, with respect, but he also - and I think this is really important - is that he sort of kept close to, you know, the suffering that was involved and the - what the costs and stakes were. And that was really foundational to his power. And what you see in a lot of the great leaders is this - this really commitment to the greater good and the concept of respect and the needs of others. VEDANTAM: You know, Dacher, you and I have talked before. And as I was reading the book, I remembered something that you had told me in the past, which is you didn't grow up with a lot of power and privilege. And to some extent, you now have some of those things. And I'm wondering if you can talk about your own journey and, you know, how your own journey may have changed you and whether you see yourself affected by the very same forces you describe in this book. KELTNER: Yeah, you know, I mean, it's so striking, you know, and it - it just comes back and bites you. And, you know, that as I've been lucky enough to get a good education and, you know, become a professor and be on this show and have a voice, I find I am just as vulnerable to the power paradox as anybody. You know, I find that when I'm feeling powerful, suddenly my scientific acumen isn't as sharp. I find when I'm feeling powerful the way I speak to other people is a little diminished. Here's one of my favorite examples, and this is not a joke. When I was writing the chapter about the car study that we just described, about people driving fancy cars or feeling powerful kind of driving in unethical ways, I went to pick up my daughter, who was rock climbing. A bunch of her friends - teenagers - piled into the back of the car. I was feeling powerful and writing this chapter and feeling like a good dad. I was captivated by this sense of my own self-worth. And I drove off and ran over my daughter's best friend's foot. VEDANTAM: Oh, my gosh. KELTNER: I know. And, you know, I could have caused a lot of serious damage. Fortunately, I did not. But this is part of the lesson of the book, which is that power is part of every moment of our social lives. We've got to be aware of it. It can lead us to do foolish things, and we should try to do the things that make it a force for good. VEDANTAM: Dacher Keltner, I want to thank you for talking with me today. KELTNER: It's been great to be with you, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Dacher Keltner is a psychologist at the University of California.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"HOUSE OF CARDS\") KEVIN SPACEY: (As Frank Underwood) In Gaffney, we had our own brand of diplomacy - shake with your right hand but hold a rock in your left. VEDANTAM: Perhaps you don't picture someone as evil as Frank Underwood from \"House Of Cards,\" but you also probably don't think of someone very nice. We don't normally associate power with qualities like compassion and kindness. But the psychologist Dacher Keltner at UC Berkeley says maybe we should. DACHER KELTNER: What the science is finding is that kids at school, kids in summer camps, people in colleges, people in organizations, if they are emotionally intelligent and really focus on others and even practice generosity, they rise in social power. VEDANTAM: Dacher studies power dynamics, and he's found something that might seem counter-intuitive. If you think of power is all about Machiavellian scheming, the people who display altruism, kindness, social intelligence, Dacher finds that these are the people who gain power and respect from their peers. But there's a catch - once these people become powerful, power tends to undermine the very qualities that helped them get there in the first place. KELTNER: There's something about the seductions of power that makes you lose sight of ethics in other people's interests. VEDANTAM: Dacher Keltner is the author of the new book \"The Power Paradox: How We Gain And Lose Influence. \" We think his ideas are especially relevant right now when so many people are vying for power in this election season. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Dacher, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. KELTNER: It's great to be with you, Shankar. VEDANTAM: I'm fascinated by the research that you cite in the book, Dacher, that suggests that power shapes nearly all of our relationships. If you put a bunch of 13-year-old kids in a room, you say that power dynamics quickly emerge. And you make the case that kids who are kinder and more empathetic are the ones who quickly assume the mantle of power in the group. KELTNER: So you're right on both counts, Shankar. I mean, first of all, you know, one of the things that we've learned in the science of power is that really power dynamics, who's influencing whom, shape every relationship from parent-child dynamics to dynamics in the U.

You know, so what these studies do is they take a group of seventh graders, you find out who has respect and esteem at the start of the year, you study what their social behaviors are or their social strategies, and then you track how they do in the hierarchy of that seventh grade class, to use your example.

But over the long haul - and this is true in other contexts - they don't have as much power as they would like to. And instead, what studies find now numbering in the dozens, it's really the the connecting kid, the empathetic kid, the kid who's really open and curious who really rises in the esteem and the ranks of the class. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if this really comes down to thinking about power in two different ways. KELTNER: Yeah. VEDANTAM: The power that I'm hearing you talk about is really reputational power. You know, I think of Doctors Without Borders, for example, as having reputational power.

KELTNER: Absolutely. And, I mean, that's a wonderful observation. And so one of the things that the science of power has done, which I report on in \"The Power Paradox,\" is to take a step back and think, what do we really mean by power? You know, we intuitively define it as money, but a lot of things happen in the world that are independent of capital.

But a bigger component or dimension to our power is how do we shape the thinking of people around the world? How do we shape the emotions of people around the world? Are there what they deem to be fair or right? And that comes through books. It comes through forms of art. It comes through journalism, and I think, you know, I took that thinking of soft power, if you will, which is, in some ways, is harder, and really extended it to the personal realm, which is that as a parent, you know, yeah, I have economic control over my kids. I have - I'm bigger than they are. But really I also influence them through ideas, through preferences that I enable, through the context that I put them in. So power is much more than economic or military might. It's really - it's how we influence the states of other people. VEDANTAM: You talk in the book about the story of Abraham Lincoln and cite his rise to power as a classic example of what you're talking about, the skills that you're talking about. KELTNER: Yeah.

KELTNER: Well, this was some of the more dramatic work that we engaged in, you know, that's now been replicated in a lot of different places, so - and that's why I call the book \"The Power Paradox,\" which is - you know, if you look at this social science of power, we get power through, you know, the pro-social tendencies that we are endowed with. But then once we feel powerful or we come from a background of privilege and feeling above others, we lose those tendencies. So let me give an example. You know, there are a lot of studies that show that empathetic practices get you power. So one of my favorites is work by Woolley and colleagues showing, you know, you give teams these complex problems to solve, and it's really the more empathetic individuals that make their team stronger and perform better, right? They're listening well. They're asking good questions. They're paying attention to other people. So empathy makes the team and the individual stronger. And then what we've started to show in our lab is once we feel powerful, we lose - or our capacity to empathize and to know what others are thinking really is diminished. So in one study, really simple, we, you know, get - bring people to the lab. We have them engage in this exercise where they compare themselves to the - sort of the real poor people of society, and it makes them feel powerful. Or they compare themselves to the - kind of the elite of society, and they feel as a result of that comparison less power. And then we just present them some photos of people expressing different emotions with subtle muscle movements around the eyes, like concentration or flirtatious or decisive. And what we find is when you feel powerful, you lose your ability to read emotion in people's facial expressions. VEDANTAM: Why would that happen? KELTNER: Well, I mean, there are a couple of deep reasons. One is, you know, and this is just striking research by Keely Muscatell and Supvindeer Obdea (ph) which is that when - you know, Shankar, what - if I feel powerful, the studies show I just feel less interested in other people, less invested in them. And as a result, the empathy networks in the brain are actually quieted. They are less active. So Keely Muscatell brought people to the lab. She had them sort of think about another student's daily life, and if you come from a position of privilege and power, the classic empathy networks in the frontal lobes of your brain are not even active when you're thinking about another student. So this is a very deep effect of what power does to our empathic capacities. VEDANTAM: So what you're saying, in some ways, is that we are empathetic to others in part because that's useful to us. We lack power in many situations, and being empathetic and being aware of others allows us to navigate our social worlds effectively. But when we perceive ourselves having power and privilege, in some ways, we don't need to depend as much as we do on others. We don't need to reach out to others, and so those networks shut down. KELTNER: Yeah, no, really well put - because if you think about, for example, somebody who's poor and doesn't have a lot of resources, they're dependent on other people to get to work, to do a little bit of, you know, ad hoc childcare or what have you. So you're dependent on others, and out of that state of mutual dependence, you really, with vigilance, attend to other people and are aware of what they're doing. And that produces these empathy benefits coming out of less power. And then the compliment - you lose that empathy when you feel less dependent on others and powerful. VEDANTAM: So one of the paradoxes of this is something that you and others have identified, which is to look at the generosity of people who are rich and poor. KELTNER: Yeah. VEDANTAM: And you find some really surprising things. KELTNER: Yeah. You know, so, again, you know, what studies are finding - and again, this is part of the power paradox - which is that, you know, there is this really interesting literature called competitive altruism. And if you take the average person in a social network and they practice generosity and they share resources or they encourage others, through those acts of generosity, they rise in power. People trust them. They esteem them. You even see this in hunter-gatherer societies, where it's really the individual who shares the most food in hunter-gatherer societies who rises in the ranks. And yet, you know, what we started to find with Paul Piff and other colleagues is, once I feel powerful, I prove to be less generous. So in one study, we brought people to the lab who varied in terms of their social class and family wealth. We just gave them a very simple opportunity to share resources with a stranger, and we found it was really the poor who shared more, and higher-power people, more privileged people shared less. VEDANTAM: Now, obviously, people who are millionaires and billionaires, they might be philanthropic, and they might give larger amounts of money. But what you're really saying is, as a proportion of your wealth, for a millionaire to give a thousand dollars is not the same thing as somebody at the poverty line who's giving 50. KELTNER: Yeah, we always have to be careful about how we interpret these results. And these are just, you know, proportions of sharing and not absolute amounts, and you're absolutely right. But you even get this experimentally. So, you know, in one of our early studies in power, we were interested in, does experimentally produced power lead to kind of the hoarding of resources which we've been talking about? We brought groups of three people to the lab. We randomly assigned one individual to the position of power. And then, by design, they went through this experiment. And it was kind of boring, and they were writing policies for the university. And we brought in halfway through the study this plate of five chocolate chip cookies. Every member of the group - three people all together - took a cookie. And so we asked who took that fourth cookie. And it was our high-power person who tended to take that cookie. Not only that, but they ate in this kind of impulsive way, where their lips were smacking, mouths were open, you know? (LAUGHTER) KELTNER: Crumbs - took us seven months to code it - crumbs falling on their sweaters. And again, you know, what this tells us is really two things, Shankar, which is, you know, power does make us a little bit more self-focused. In this - you know, you're sharing less. You're keeping more for yourself. You're eating the cookie in an impulsive way. But the other thing I think we shouldn't lose sight of is this can happen to us all, right? This is just what the mind does when we feel powerful. VEDANTAM: Because, of course, these were just random people who are brought into the lab, and you randomly picked one of them to assign them a feeling of power. KELTNER: Yeah, absolutely. VEDANTAM: You did mention there were five cookies and three people, so what happened to the fifth cookie? KELTNER: Well, this was where it was really interesting because, you know, the rules of politeness suggest that you really should not be that uncouth person who takes the last cookie off the plate. And so we did pilot testing for the experiment, and no one would take that fourth cookie. So that's why we added a fifth cookie - just to free somebody up to take that second-to-last cookie. VEDANTAM: So it's fascinating because, of course, what you see in these lab experiments is often reflected on much, much bigger stages, where you see people in power abusing that power - you know, having affairs, cheating and, you know, falsifying financial returns. And, you know, at one level, the conventional view, I think, is sort of to say, these are just people who were bad people who rose to the top. But what you're suggesting is actually something more complex and, in some ways, much sadder, which is that these might not be bad people who rose to the top, but these might be good people who rose to the top, and power has made them bad. KELTNER: Yeah. I mean, that's such a - a very compelling and sweeping statement about this, Shankar. You know, that does align with how I read this social scientific evidence, which is that, you know, there are dozens of experiments where we randomly assign typical people to either positions of power or less power. And you find these patterns where, if I'm just randomly given power, and I feel this sense of sort of expansive, you know, euphoria that comes with power and a sense of omnipotence, you know, I speak more rudely. I take resources that are meant for somebody else. I'm more likely to flirt inappropriately. I'm more likely to engage in inappropriate sexual behavior. We have studies showing, when you make somebody feel powerful, you're more likely to cheat at a game to win 50 bucks. The list goes on. And it really lends credence to Lord Acton's old observation that, I think, stands the test of time, which is power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. VEDANTAM: You've also found the same thing looking at drivers of various cars. I understand you ran an experiment where you stood outside an intersection and saw who stopped at a stop sign. KELTNER: Yeah (laughter). You know, I mean - so I remember one day I was biking to work, and almost got hit by a black Mercedes. And the guy - you know, and I was in the right. I sort of waited and gone through this four-way stop area in California. And this guy plowed and almost hit me, and he looked at me as if, you know, I was the hoi polloi and should be sort of taken off the road. And I thought, you know, it'd be really interesting to test these ideas about the impulsive actions that power produces by looking at how people drive. So, you know, what we did in one of the versions of this study is we put a young Berkeley undergraduate at a pedestrian zone right next to the Berkeley campus. The pedestrian zone is this strip that cuts across a road that is - it gives the pedestrian the right of way. You get to cross the road. It's white stripes. And then we coded, and we had these Berkeley undergrads kind of hiding in the bushes. Our one student was standing at the pedestrian zone. The other student, who was coding, was noting the make of the car and whether, very simply, did they stop for the pedestrian, which is law, or did they blaze through the pedestrian zone? And 0 percent of our drivers of poor cars - the Yugos and Plymouth Satellites of the world - drove through the pedestrian zone; 46. 2 percent of our drivers of wealthy cars - you know, the Mercedes and the like - drive through the pedestrian zone. VEDANTAM: Forty-six percent? KELTNER: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Is it something to do with Berkeley? KELTNER: (Laughter). You know, it's funny. I just got a letter from a guy in Germany who was like, this would not happen in Germany, where we really value our Mercedes and BMWs. You know, we've replicated it. It's been replicated in other - other states. It led people to email me from all manner of context. One of my favorites was a Prius driver emailed me and said, well, you know, that's Mercedes, but of course Prius drivers abide by the law. So we checked, and Prius drivers were actually the worst. (LAUGHTER) KELTNER: So, you know, and this just fits this - this larger profile that I'm sure your listeners are aware of - that there's something about the seductions of power that makes you lose sight of ethics and other people's interests. VEDANTAM: You talk in the book about leaders who are able to overcome the paradox of power. And we talked earlier about Lincoln and how his rise to power was marked by demonstrations of these - these positive behaviors. But you also write about how he was able to retain a sense of that kinder, gentler, more empathetic self, even as he acquired and wielded great power. Talk about that story and what he did that might be illustrated for the rest of us. KELTNER: Well, you know, I think that the thing that really is striking about Lincoln's power is, you know, he had a short presidency, but he remained focused on the interests of others. He remained focused on uniting disparate parties and really the greater good, if you will - that he knew that that there was this state of the Union that he was heading toward. And the way that he did it, you know, is - and it just comes through, for example, in Doris Kearns Goodwin's \"Team Of Rivals\" - is he just - he kept close to not only the dignity of everybody and treated, you know, the warring sides, if you will, with respect, but he also - and I think this is really important - is that he sort of kept close to, you know, the suffering that was involved and the - what the costs and stakes were. And that was really foundational to his power. And what you see in a lot of the great leaders is this - this really commitment to the greater good and the concept of respect and the needs of others. VEDANTAM: You know, Dacher, you and I have talked before. And as I was reading the book, I remembered something that you had told me in the past, which is you didn't grow up with a lot of power and privilege. And to some extent, you now have some of those things. And I'm wondering if you can talk about your own journey and, you know, how your own journey may have changed you and whether you see yourself affected by the very same forces you describe in this book. KELTNER: Yeah, you know, I mean, it's so striking, you know, and it - it just comes back and bites you. And, you know, that as I've been lucky enough to get a good education and, you know, become a professor and be on this show and have a voice, I find I am just as vulnerable to the power paradox as anybody. You know, I find that when I'm feeling powerful, suddenly my scientific acumen isn't as sharp. I find when I'm feeling powerful the way I speak to other people is a little diminished. Here's one of my favorite examples, and this is not a joke. When I was writing the chapter about the car study that we just described, about people driving fancy cars or feeling powerful kind of driving in unethical ways, I went to pick up my daughter, who was rock climbing. A bunch of her friends - teenagers - piled into the back of the car. I was feeling powerful and writing this chapter and feeling like a good dad. I was captivated by this sense of my own self-worth. And I drove off and ran over my daughter's best friend's foot. VEDANTAM: Oh, my gosh. KELTNER: I know. And, you know, I could have caused a lot of serious damage. Fortunately, I did not. But this is part of the lesson of the book, which is that power is part of every moment of our social lives. We've got to be aware of it. It can lead us to do foolish things, and we should try to do the things that make it a force for good. VEDANTAM: Dacher Keltner, I want to thank you for talking with me today. KELTNER: It's been great to be with you, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Dacher Keltner is a psychologist at the University of California.

Turns out, that's not insane. It's kind of normal. Many of us make the same mistake twice or many times, and for some people, it is an unethical act. NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam is here to talk about some research into this. Hi, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: So why don't we learn from past mistakes? VEDANTAM: Well, I read an interesting study by Maryam Kouchaki at Northwestern, Steve, that offers some insight into this behavior. Her theory is that people often forget about bad things they have done, and this limits their ability to learn from their past actions. Kouchaki and her co-author Francesca Gino at Harvard have a wonderful term to describe this. They call it unethical amnesia. INSKEEP: Unethical amnesia - I forgot that I stole someone's wallet basically. VEDANTAM: Now, most of the time when we say that, we're just making that up, but what they are saying is that this actually does happen. They ran a series of experiments on more than 2,000 volunteers, and they offered people the opportunity to play games. Some volunteers cheated. Others were honest. When the researchers had the volunteers return to the laboratory a few days later, volunteers who hadn't cheated had a sharper and clearer memory of what they were asked to do whereas people who had cheated had hazier memories of the game. Now, the memories of the cheaters didn't simply go poof. They were just less vivid, less sharp compared to the memories of the other volunteers. Kouchaki thinks that forgetting about the times we've acted unethically might be a psychological defense mechanism. MARYAM KOUCHAKI: When we are dishonest, we feel bad about it. You know, the dissonance and the discomfort that we feel, we come up with different ways to get rid of that, the discomfort. One of the ways people get rid of that discomfort is their memories become less clear and vivid over time. INSKEEP: I think I know where you might be heading here. If I manage to sort of forget the bad thing I did before, am I more likely to repeat that? VEDANTAM: That's exactly right. So Kouchaki and Gino wanted to know does this explain why people cheat over and over again? Now, this can be tricky to measure, Steve, because we often do see the same people cheating over and over again. But is that because their memories of cheating have faded or just because they're cheaters? INSKEEP: They're unethical, yeah. VEDANTAM: Right. So Kouchaki and Gino created a two-part experiment. In part one, they randomly assigned people to one of two groups. One of the groups was given latitude to cheat. The other was not. Not surprisingly, people randomly assigned to the group that had latitude to cheat were more likely to cheat. When people from both groups were brought back after a few days, the researchers found that memories had faded in the cheaters group more than the other one. When all the people from both groups are now given a new task, there was more cheating among volunteers in the group whose memories had faded. Kouchaki and Gino think the way memories fade when we do bad things is one reason people cheat over and over again. KOUCHAKI: A lot of the reasons people are likely to repeat what they've done is that because they don't remember what they've done. And in this particular situation, then one of the reasons that people repeat the dishonesty is because they are getting rid of that memory and they are learning from it. INSKEEP: Why do we forget? VEDANTAM: I think it's just because it's painful for us to think of ourselves as being bad people. And when we forget about the bad actions we've done, we can keep this illusion in our heads that we are wonderful human beings. INSKEEP: And keep doing bad things. Shankar, thanks very much.

And when it comes to the study of our universe, the data hasn't always been that big. So in 1929, Edwin Hubble proved the universe was expanding. And he proved this using measurements from just 24 different galaxies. ANDREW CONNOLLY: That's right. He showed that the further the galaxies were away, the faster that they were expanding. From this came the idea that the universe itself was expanding. RAZ: This is astronomer Andrew Connolly. CONNOLLY: I work on the interaction between telescopes that survey the sky and big data. RAZ: Andrew says the idea that everything in the universe was expanding gave rise to another idea, which was the Big Bang, a big idea from that small data set of 24 galaxies. And then 70 years after Hubble, something similar happened. . . CONNOLLY: That's right. RAZ: . . . When two teams of scientists were studying supernovae. CONNOLLY: Supernovae are exploding stars. CONNOLLY: The final throes of a star explodes and brightens, so you can see them to great distances. And so we could measure how far away those supernovae were. And so what they found - these supernovae were slightly further than they expected and that meant the universe had to be slightly larger than expected which meant that the universe had to be accelerating. RAZ: The expanding universe was accelerating. Now, this idea was crazy but true. And it came from studying just 42 exploding stars. CONNOLLY: But I think it took them about three years over time to collect those 42 supernovae. RAZ: That sounds like a really long time for such a small dataset. CONNOLLY: Well, they had to look through thousands of galaxies to find those 42 supernovae, but it's not a lot of data. RAZ: OK, so what if there were a way to collect more data? I mean, even our best telescopes today are really good at looking at specific parts of the sky but not that good at taking it in all at once. They sort of treat the universe more like a static image than a moving picture. And as Andrew Connolly explained in his TED Talk, that's a problem. CONNOLLY: The universe is anything but static, constantly changes on time scales of seconds to billions of years. Galaxies merge. They collide hundreds of thousands of miles per hour. Stars are born. They die. They explode in these extravagant displays. In fact, 10 supernova per second explode somewhere in our universe. If we could hear it, it would be popping like a bag of popcorn. But the telescopes we've used over the last decade are not designed to capture the data at their scale. So this is driving us to new technologies and new telescopes, telescopes that can go faint to look at the distant universe, but also telescopes that can go wide to capture the sky as rapidly as possible. RAZ: What Andrew Connolly is describing is a brand new kind of telescope, one that he and a team of scientists are working on right now on a remote mountaintop in Chile, and it's a telescope that uses big data, unlike any telescope before. So instead of measuring 42 supernovae over three years. . . CONNOLLY: We should be finding about 500 to 1,000 supernovae every night. RAZ: Wow. CONNOLLY: So millions within 10 years. RAZ: I mean, it means that the rate of discovery is about to explode. CONNOLLY: The rate of discovery will explode and scales with the amount of data that we're collecting. RAZ: And the telescope making this all possible - it's called the large synoptic survey telescope. CONNOLLY: Possibly, the most boring name ever for one of the most fascinating experiments in the history of astronomy. RAZ: Or LSST for short. CONNOLLY: We're building the LSST. We expect it to start taking data by the end of this decade. I'm going to show you how we think it's going to transform our views of the universe because one image from the LSST is equivalent to 3,000 images from the Hubble Space Telescope, each image three and a half degrees on the sky, seven times the width of the full moon. Well, how do you capture an image at this scale? Well, you build the largest digital camera in history. Using the same technology you find in the cameras in your cell phone or in the digital cameras you can buy in the high street, but now at a scale that's five and a half feet across, about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. So if you wanted to look at an image in its full resolution, just a single LSST image, it would take about 1,500 high-definition TV screens. On this camera, we'll image the sky taking a new picture every 20 seconds, so every three nights we'll get a completely new view of the skies above Chile. Over the mission lifetime of this telescope, it will detect 40 billion stars and galaxies, and that would be for the first time we'll have detected more objects in our universe than people on the Earth. Now, we can talk about this in terms of terabytes and petabytes and billions of objects, but a way to get a sense of the amount of data that will come off this camera - is that it's like playing every TED Talk ever recorded simultaneously 24 hours a day, seven days a week for 10 years. And to process this data means searching through all of those talks for every new idea and every new concept looking at each part of the video to see how one frame may have changed from the next. And this is changing the way that we do science. But as we enter this era of big data, what we're beginning to find is there's a difference between more data being just better or more data being different, capable of changing the questions we want to ask. RAZ: Here's why the LSST and all of the data it will collect can help scientists ask bigger questions about our universe. When you or I look up at the sky at night. We're not just looking into space, we're actually looking back in time. CONNOLLY: Because the nearest star is - what? - four - about just a little bit more than four light years away. So the light you see from that is actually what that star was producing four years ago. If we're looking out at near - nearby galaxies like Andromeda, we're looking back a few million years, to the most distant galaxies where we're looking back billions of years. Astronomers are almost like the ultimate historians. RAZ: It's so crazy to think that this enormous telescope is going to be capturing all of this stuff that's already happened. CONNOLLY: Yeah. Millions of years ago, billions of years ago. GUY RAZ, HOST: So what kind of mysteries could we solve with all the data that we're going to get that we couldn't get before? CONNOLLY: So the aspect about this telescope is that it's not designed just to answer one question. It's designed to provide a census of our universe. And so that means that we can understand the expansion of our universe, how rapidly it's expanding, what is it that's driving that expansion, what is dark energy, dark matter, the distribution of stars within our own galaxy, how our galaxy, the Milky Way, grew. We'd begin to understand the solar system, right? RAZ: Yeah. CONNOLLY: The properties of objects within the solar system, you know, how our solar system formed, how water came onto the planet Earth. No matter how much data we get, there's always new questions to ask. RAZ: But how do you - how do you make sense of all that data? I mean, you said looking at one photo from the LSST would take, like, 1,500 HDTVs. I mean, how do you even begin to look at a photo like that? CONNOLLY: Well, we can't. I mean, when we actually process the data, when - so we have thousands of computers. So as the data comes off that camera, it gets swept into thousands of computers that are processing and calibrating and are detecting objects. It's like if you took an image of a crowd and you wanted to pick out all the faces in the crowd. . . RAZ: Yeah. CONNOLLY: . . . All the people in the crowd or to find the pictures where two people are closest together. That's how we process the data. And we have to be able to look at the images not with our eyes but with algorithms and find anything that's moved or change and characterize it. And these images are public, and that means not just to astronomers. That means that if you looked at one of these images, you may be the first person to see that part of the sky. CONNOLLY: It took three years to find just 42 supernovae because the telescopes that we build could only survey a small part of the sky. With the LSST we get a completely new view of the skies above Chile every three nights. In its first night of operation, it will find 10 times the number of supernovae used in the discovery of dark energy. This will increase by a thousand by within the first four months, 1. 5 million supernovae by the end of its survey, each supernova testing which theories of dark energy are consistent and which ones are not until hopefully at the end of this survey, around 2030, we expect to hopefully see a theory for our universe, a fundamental theory for the physics of our universe, to gradually emerge. But if looking through tens of thousands of galaxies revealed 42 supernova that turned our understanding of the universe on its head, when we're working with billions of galaxies, how many more times are we going to find 42 points that dont quite match what we expect? What's so exciting about the next decade of data in astronomy is we don't even know how many answers are out there, answers about our origins and our evolution. How many answers are out there to questions that we don't even know that we want to ask? Thank you. RAZ: Does this mean, Andrew, that we don't have a whole lot left to learn from, you know, like, the old version of the telescope, like the kind I look through with my son in my backyard? Or is the universe so complicated now that big data is the only way to understand this? CONNOLLY: No, I think big data adds into that. So big data allows us to identify interesting objects that then you - we may take individual telescopes to target to look at them in much more detail. In fact, the fact that these data are public means that the LSST could announce the discovery of an object and you or your son could go and look at that object with your backyard telescope, make a measurement and tell us what it is. And so I don't think big data is the only way. I think big data enables much more science. And these data will let us understand how we formed, how our solar system formed, how, you know, we came into being - to understand our place in the universe. CONNOLLY: Andrew Connolly is an astronomer at the University of Washington. His TED talk is at ted dot com. And the LSST - the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope - is expected to be completed by 2019. COLORAMA: (Singing) There's too much data, too much data. You're filling up my head with too much data. RAZ: Hey, thanks for listening to our show on big data this week.

(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)(APPLAUSE)(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TOO MUCH DATA\") GUY RAZ, HOST:  Today on the show, Ideas About Big Data - how to make sense of it and how it's transforming the way we live, our understanding of the world and beyond. And when it comes to the study of our universe, the data hasn't always been that big. So in 1929, Edwin Hubble proved the universe was expanding. And he proved this using measurements from just 24 different galaxies. ANDREW CONNOLLY: That's right. He showed that the further the galaxies were away, the faster that they were expanding. From this came the idea that the universe itself was expanding. RAZ: This is astronomer Andrew Connolly. CONNOLLY: I work on the interaction between telescopes that survey the sky and big data. RAZ: Andrew says the idea that everything in the universe was expanding gave rise to another idea, which was the Big Bang, a big idea from that small data set of 24 galaxies. And then 70 years after Hubble, something similar happened. . . CONNOLLY: That's right. RAZ: . . . When two teams of scientists were studying supernovae. CONNOLLY: Supernovae are exploding stars. CONNOLLY: The final throes of a star explodes and brightens, so you can see them to great distances. And so we could measure how far away those supernovae were. And so what they found - these supernovae were slightly further than they expected and that meant the universe had to be slightly larger than expected which meant that the universe had to be accelerating. RAZ: The expanding universe was accelerating. Now, this idea was crazy but true. And it came from studying just 42 exploding stars. CONNOLLY: But I think it took them about three years over time to collect those 42 supernovae. RAZ: That sounds like a really long time for such a small dataset. CONNOLLY: Well, they had to look through thousands of galaxies to find those 42 supernovae, but it's not a lot of data. RAZ: OK, so what if there were a way to collect more data? I mean, even our best telescopes today are really good at looking at specific parts of the sky but not that good at taking it in all at once. They sort of treat the universe more like a static image than a moving picture. And as Andrew Connolly explained in his TED Talk, that's a problem. CONNOLLY: The universe is anything but static, constantly changes on time scales of seconds to billions of years. Galaxies merge. They collide hundreds of thousands of miles per hour. Stars are born. They die. They explode in these extravagant displays. In fact, 10 supernova per second explode somewhere in our universe. If we could hear it, it would be popping like a bag of popcorn. But the telescopes we've used over the last decade are not designed to capture the data at their scale. So this is driving us to new technologies and new telescopes, telescopes that can go faint to look at the distant universe, but also telescopes that can go wide to capture the sky as rapidly as possible. RAZ: What Andrew Connolly is describing is a brand new kind of telescope, one that he and a team of scientists are working on right now on a remote mountaintop in Chile, and it's a telescope that uses big data, unlike any telescope before. So instead of measuring 42 supernovae over three years. . . CONNOLLY: We should be finding about 500 to 1,000 supernovae every night. RAZ: Wow. CONNOLLY: So millions within 10 years. RAZ: I mean, it means that the rate of discovery is about to explode. CONNOLLY: The rate of discovery will explode and scales with the amount of data that we're collecting. RAZ: And the telescope making this all possible - it's called the large synoptic survey telescope. CONNOLLY: Possibly, the most boring name ever for one of the most fascinating experiments in the history of astronomy. RAZ: Or LSST for short. CONNOLLY: We're building the LSST. We expect it to start taking data by the end of this decade. I'm going to show you how we think it's going to transform our views of the universe because one image from the LSST is equivalent to 3,000 images from the Hubble Space Telescope, each image three and a half degrees on the sky, seven times the width of the full moon. Well, how do you capture an image at this scale? Well, you build the largest digital camera in history. Using the same technology you find in the cameras in your cell phone or in the digital cameras you can buy in the high street, but now at a scale that's five and a half feet across, about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. So if you wanted to look at an image in its full resolution, just a single LSST image, it would take about 1,500 high-definition TV screens. On this camera, we'll image the sky taking a new picture every 20 seconds, so every three nights we'll get a completely new view of the skies above Chile. Over the mission lifetime of this telescope, it will detect 40 billion stars and galaxies, and that would be for the first time we'll have detected more objects in our universe than people on the Earth. Now, we can talk about this in terms of terabytes and petabytes and billions of objects, but a way to get a sense of the amount of data that will come off this camera - is that it's like playing every TED Talk ever recorded simultaneously 24 hours a day, seven days a week for 10 years. And to process this data means searching through all of those talks for every new idea and every new concept looking at each part of the video to see how one frame may have changed from the next. And this is changing the way that we do science. But as we enter this era of big data, what we're beginning to find is there's a difference between more data being just better or more data being different, capable of changing the questions we want to ask. RAZ: Here's why the LSST and all of the data it will collect can help scientists ask bigger questions about our universe. When you or I look up at the sky at night. We're not just looking into space, we're actually looking back in time. CONNOLLY: Because the nearest star is - what? - four - about just a little bit more than four light years away. So the light you see from that is actually what that star was producing four years ago. If we're looking out at near - nearby galaxies like Andromeda, we're looking back a few million years, to the most distant galaxies where we're looking back billions of years. Astronomers are almost like the ultimate historians. RAZ: It's so crazy to think that this enormous telescope is going to be capturing all of this stuff that's already happened. CONNOLLY: Yeah. Millions of years ago, billions of years ago. GUY RAZ, HOST:  So what kind of mysteries could we solve with all the data that we're going to get that we couldn't get before? CONNOLLY: So the aspect about this telescope is that it's not designed just to answer one question. It's designed to provide a census of our universe. And so that means that we can understand the expansion of our universe, how rapidly it's expanding, what is it that's driving that expansion, what is dark energy, dark matter, the distribution of stars within our own galaxy, how our galaxy, the Milky Way, grew.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about how big data is helping us understand our world and ourselves. Do you think it's fair to say that human beings are basically, like, the equivalent of ones and zeros? RICCARDO SABATINI: Well, we are - I guess many people will say that we are a little more. But in a way, we are an expression of how nature is playing his own game. We are, in a way, a biological representation of an underlying set of rules that works with numbers. And for me, it's one of the most beautiful complexities that you can ever think of. It's mesmerizing. RAZ: This is Riccardo Sabatini. And by training, he is a physicist. SABATINI: Yep. I'm a theoretical physicist by training, indeed. RAZ: Riccardo works at a company called Human Longevity. And there, he applies physics to process, manage and understand one of the most complicated data sets out there, the human genome. SABATINI: That's the most amazing thing that happened at the beginning of this millennia. We started to have access to the digital representation of our genome. We started to digitalize matter. We have digital representation of atoms and proteins. We are starting to digitalize life. RAZ: And digitizing life, understanding the data that makes up our genome, means that we can study how to make our lives better and healthier. And it's something Riccardo has been working on for years now, as he explained on the TED stage. SABATINI: So for me, everything started many, many years ago when I met the first 3-D printer. The concept was fascinating. A 3-D printer need three elements - a bit of information, some raw material, some energy - and it can produce any object that was not there before. Then I realized that I actually always knew a 3-D printer - and everyone does - it was my mom. SABATINI: So my mom takes three elements - a bit of information is between my father and my mom, in this case; raw elements and energy in the same media - that is food - and after several months, produces me. And I was not existing before. Well, what amount of information takes to build and assemble a human? Is it much? Is it a little? How many thumb drives you can fill? OK. Now, you can run some numbers, and that happens to be quite an astonishing number. So the number of atoms - the file that I will save in my thumb drive to assemble a little baby, it will actually feel an entire Titanic of thumb drives multiplied 2,000 times. This is the miracle of life. Every time you see, from now on, a pregnant lady, she's assembling the biggest amount of information that you will ever encounter. Forget big data. Forget anything you heard off. This is the biggest amount of information that exists. RAZ: This is unbelievable. I mean, the amount of data it takes to create each human being - each and every single one of us will be the equivalent to 2,000 Titanics filled with thumb drives. Exactly. So could you even begin to compare the amount of data that we generate versus the amount of data that a computer generates? SABATINI: Oh, no, I think. I mean, the order of magnitude of how complicated we are is something that will eat every single database that we know. RAZ: Wow. SABATINI: In year 2020, we believe that we will have sequenced several hundred million genomes. And at that point, YouTube will look like a small hard drive of a kid. I mean, the amount of data that we will require to map the human diversity will overrun every single database that we ever encountered before. It's the biggest data that you can ever think of. RAZ: Yeah. So if each human is 2,000 Titanic ships filled with hard drives, how do you process that? SABATINI: Yeah, the nice thing is that nature is much smarter than than a theoretical physicist, so he found a language to embed and compress this complexity in a much compact form. And that's what is the DNA, the very fundamental part that give the instructions to make the 2,000 Titanic work. RAZ: I got you. So the DNA is like a compressed version of those 2,000 Titanics? SABATINI: So the DNA is much shorter, much more complex and much more compact. And in February, we decided to print it to actually show, in books, how large is an instruction manual, and it's about 3 billion letters. RAZ: Wow. SABATINI: And if you print them at character 6, happens to be 262,640 pages, the precise instruction manual to rebuild Craig Venter. RAZ: Craig Venter, the famous geneticist, who was, I guess, one of the first to map the human genome. SABATINI: Yes. RAZ: So you actually printed out the 3 billion letters of Craig Venter's DNA? SABATINI: Exactly. RAZ: And, like, how many volumes did it take? SABATINI: (Laughter) A hundred and seventy-five volumes of a 1,600 pages. RAZ: Like encyclopedia-sized. SABATINI: So welcome on stage Dr. Craig Venter. RAZ: And you wheeled these out, Craig Venter's genome. . . SABATINI: Yeah, yeah. RAZ: . . . Onto the TED stage. SABATINI: Exactly. SABATINI: Not the man in his flesh. But for the first time in history, this is the genome of a specific human printed page-by-page, letter-by-letter, 262,000 pages of information, 450 kilogram. And now for the first time I can do something funny. I can actually poke inside it and read. So let me take some interesting book, like this one. Chromosome 14, book 132. SABATINI: A-T-T-C-T-T-G-A-T-T. This human is lucky because if you will miss just two letters in this position, two letters over 3 billion, he will condemned to a terrible disease - cystic fibrosis. We have no cure for it. We don't know how to solve it, and it's just two letter of difference for what we are. So now that I have your attention, the next question is how do I read it? How do I make sense out of it? Well, for how good you can be assembling Swedish furnitures, this instruction manual is nothing you can crack in your life. And so. . . SABATINI: . . . We're going to use a technology called machine learning, OK? We build a machine and we train a machine - well, not exactly one machine, many, many machines - to try to understand what are the letters and what do they do. So we asked, can we read the books and predict your height? Well, we actually can with 5 centimeters of precision. Can we predict the eye color? Yeah, we can, 80 percent accuracy. RAZ: OK, just to break in for a sec - by using big data, Riccardo and his team can take a random sample of DNA, pick through billions of letters of genetic code and then predict the height, the eye color, all kinds of physical traits of the person that that DNA came from. They can even assemble those traits into a biologically accurate human face. SABATINI: It's a little complicated because a human face is scattered around million of these letters. We had to learn and teach a machine what is a face and embed and compress it. So we take the real face of a subject and we run it in our algorithm, OK? The results that I show you right now, this is the prediction we have. RAZ: So, Riccardo, you are showing this face on the TED stage. I was there. This computer-generated face of a woman, and it's side-by-side with her real face. And it was amazingly accurate. SABATINI: Yeah. That's what we are up to, to trace the information from the books to the body. And this is the biggest challenge of the millennium. SABATINI: So why do we do this? We do it because the same technology and the same approach, the machine learning off this code is helping us to understand how we work, how your body work, how your body ages, how disease generate in your body, how your cancer grow and develop, how drugs work and if they work on your body. It's called personalized medicine. It is a particularly complicated challenge. The more we will learn, every time we will be confronted with decisions that we never had to face before about life, about death, about parenting. This must be a global conversation. We must start to think the future we're building as a humanity without fear but with the understanding that the decisions that we will take in the next year will change the course of history forever. RAZ: In the future, Riccardo says, the same technology that can predict a face from a DNA sample today could be used to predict and treat disease. In fact, some of that future is already here. You might have even heard about technology that allows anyone to sequence their genome and identify potential health problems. But as with any massive data set, interpreting that information is pretty tricky. So you've had your genome sequenced, right? You've done this. SABATINI: I did. I did. And it was an interesting time. RAZ: What happened? SABATINI: So, I mean, I had a couple of interesting results, some cardiovascular complications that are, let's say, present in my family but we've never been able to explain. And so there is this information, even for a professional. It's not something you should read by yourself because. . . RAZ: Yeah. SABATINI: . . . At the beginning, I was, oh, my God, I'm going to die tomorrow. RAZ: You freaked out. SABATINI: (Laughter) Yeah. RAZ: Yeah, it's understandable, right? I mean, there's all this information staring you right in the face. SABATINI: But in reality, when you chat with the doctor and you are in a clinic, you discover that it's something that medicine developed lots of therapeutics around it. And I would rather prefer to know it than not because not means not taking actions and letting the roll of the dice know when or how your complications are growing. Now I have control of it. RAZ: Yeah. So when you look down the road, like, five or 10 or 20 years from now - right? - how will the world be different? Because humans will finally have unlocked the ability to read and analyze and maybe even change the biggest source of data in the world, which is our genome. SABATINI: So we survive and we have medicine that is amazing today and what we believe is amazing. But in 20 years, personalized medicine will really take the lead. It means every doctor and every pill that we will ever take, we'll know exactly if it will work or not for our genome, for our body. And it will be so embedded in the mind of our future generation, that our kids will laugh at us on how we survive on a medicine that is not based on these assumptions. And it will be a cultural moment where precision medicine will be the verb and the past will look like we're in the caves, trying to understand how to switch on the fire. RAZ: Data scientist Riccardo Sabatini. You can see his entire talk and how his team can predict faces from DNA at TED. com.

RAZ: Craig Venter, the famous geneticist, who was, I guess, one of the first to map the human genome. SABATINI: Yes. RAZ: So you actually printed out the 3 billion letters of Craig Venter's DNA? SABATINI: Exactly. RAZ: And, like, how many volumes did it take? SABATINI: (Laughter) A hundred and seventy-five volumes of a 1,600 pages. RAZ: Like encyclopedia-sized. SABATINI: So welcome on stage Dr. Craig Venter. RAZ: And you wheeled these out, Craig Venter's genome. . . SABATINI: Yeah, yeah. RAZ: . . . Onto the TED stage. SABATINI: Exactly. SABATINI: Not the man in his flesh. But for the first time in history, this is the genome of a specific human printed page-by-page, letter-by-letter, 262,000 pages of information, 450 kilogram. And now for the first time I can do something funny. I can actually poke inside it and read. So let me take some interesting book, like this one. Chromosome 14, book 132. SABATINI: A-T-T-C-T-T-G-A-T-T. This human is lucky because if you will miss just two letters in this position, two letters over 3 billion, he will condemned to a terrible disease - cystic fibrosis. We have no cure for it. We don't know how to solve it, and it's just two letter of difference for what we are. So now that I have your attention, the next question is how do I read it? How do I make sense out of it? Well, for how good you can be assembling Swedish furnitures, this instruction manual is nothing you can crack in your life. And so. . . SABATINI: . . . We're going to use a technology called machine learning, OK? We build a machine and we train a machine - well, not exactly one machine, many, many machines - to try to understand what are the letters and what do they do. So we asked, can we read the books and predict your height? Well, we actually can with 5 centimeters of precision. Can we predict the eye color? Yeah, we can, 80 percent accuracy. RAZ: OK, just to break in for a sec - by using big data, Riccardo and his team can take a random sample of DNA, pick through billions of letters of genetic code and then predict the height, the eye color, all kinds of physical traits of the person that that DNA came from. They can even assemble those traits into a biologically accurate human face. SABATINI: It's a little complicated because a human face is scattered around million of these letters. We had to learn and teach a machine what is a face and embed and compress it. So we take the real face of a subject and we run it in our algorithm, OK? The results that I show you right now, this is the prediction we have. RAZ: So, Riccardo, you are showing this face on the TED stage. I was there. This computer-generated face of a woman, and it's side-by-side with her real face. And it was amazingly accurate. SABATINI: Yeah. That's what we are up to, to trace the information from the books to the body. And this is the biggest challenge of the millennium. SABATINI: So why do we do this? We do it because the same technology and the same approach, the machine learning off this code is helping us to understand how we work, how your body work, how your body ages, how disease generate in your body, how your cancer grow and develop, how drugs work and if they work on your body. It's called personalized medicine. It is a particularly complicated challenge. The more we will learn, every time we will be confronted with decisions that we never had to face before about life, about death, about parenting. This must be a global conversation. We must start to think the future we're building as a humanity without fear but with the understanding that the decisions that we will take in the next year will change the course of history forever. RAZ: In the future, Riccardo says, the same technology that can predict a face from a DNA sample today could be used to predict and treat disease. In fact, some of that future is already here. You might have even heard about technology that allows anyone to sequence their genome and identify potential health problems. But as with any massive data set, interpreting that information is pretty tricky. So you've had your genome sequenced, right? You've done this. SABATINI: I did. I did. And it was an interesting time. RAZ: What happened? SABATINI: So, I mean, I had a couple of interesting results, some cardiovascular complications that are, let's say, present in my family but we've never been able to explain. And so there is this information, even for a professional. It's not something you should read by yourself because. . . RAZ: Yeah. SABATINI: . . . At the beginning, I was, oh, my God, I'm going to die tomorrow. RAZ: You freaked out. SABATINI: (Laughter) Yeah. RAZ: Yeah, it's understandable, right? I mean, there's all this information staring you right in the face. SABATINI: But in reality, when you chat with the doctor and you are in a clinic, you discover that it's something that medicine developed lots of therapeutics around it. And I would rather prefer to know it than not because not means not taking actions and letting the roll of the dice know when or how your complications are growing. Now I have control of it. RAZ: Yeah. So when you look down the road, like, five or 10 or 20 years from now - right? - how will the world be different? Because humans will finally have unlocked the ability to read and analyze and maybe even change the biggest source of data in the world, which is our genome. SABATINI: So we survive and we have medicine that is amazing today and what we believe is amazing. But in 20 years, personalized medicine will really take the lead. It means every doctor and every pill that we will ever take, we'll know exactly if it will work or not for our genome, for our body. And it will be so embedded in the mind of our future generation, that our kids will laugh at us on how we survive on a medicine that is not based on these assumptions. And it will be a cultural moment where precision medicine will be the verb and the past will look like we're in the caves, trying to understand how to switch on the fire.

One factor that could tip the vote is the possibility that millions of dollars in tax revenue from retail pot shops could be at stake. Now, marijuana has been legal in Colorado since 2014, and the state has earned tax benefits because of it. We sent Patty Wight of Maine Public Broadcasting and Luke Runyon of member station KUNC in Colorado to examine how the money is being spent and what Maine might expect. PATTY WIGHT, BYLINE: Maine, like a lot of other states, could always use more revenue, so that possibility of millions is potentially enticing. But it's unclear here how that money would be spent, so it's got some voters wondering, like Erin McGee Ferrell. I met her in downtown Portland. She's a foster parent. And she says that's one state program that could use more funding. ERIN MCGEE FERRELL: And I know that there's a lot of problems in terms of needing more money for health issues and people who are addicted to opioids. I mean, there's such a lack of money for the children and for health issues. WIGHT: And that's a similar question that the mayor of Portland has, Ethan Strimling. But specifically, he wants to know - how is that money going to be dedicated to individual communities? ETHAN STRIMLING: All we have at the local level is property taxes, but it would be great if some of the revenue that's generated from this legalization could stay right in the community where it's having the most impact. WIGHT: In other words, to fund substance abuse programs to help offset any of the negative impacts of legalization. So the question for Colorado, Luke, is where's the money from pot going? LUKE RUNYON, BYLINE: Well, it's really a mixed bag here. We have a slew of local and state taxes on retail marijuana. Pretty much everybody through the entire supply chain is paying into the system. So that's growers, retail shops, licensing fees. And state money, for the most part, is going towards school maintenance and construction, so paying for things like new roofs for schools and HVAC systems. WIGHT: So pot's paying for schools in Colorado. RUNYON: Well, kind of. To get a better picture on this, I talked to Chris Stiffler. He's an economist with the Colorado Fiscal Institute. They're a non-partisan think tank. And he really cautions against getting too excited about marijuana tax money. CHRIS STIFFLER: We like to talk about it as if you were walking home today and you found a $20 bill on the ground, right? You wouldn't go home and buy a new car or a new house. But you would maybe go out for a Chipotle burrito with guacamole and a margarita, right? RUNYON: It can be kind of a problem here in Colorado because when voters were considering legal marijuana, some of them thought that this was going to be a huge amount of money for education. STIFFLER: They want to know why they're not getting new schools, why they're not getting more teachers, why they're not getting better roads because they were promised so many marijuana dollars was going to fix and basically pay for a lot of the things that really drive their communities. WIGHT: So it sounds like it's kind of a drop in the bucket for the state budget. But how about local communities? RUNYON: Well, that seems to be where marijuana tax money can actually make more of a difference. So take Edgewater, Colo. It's a really extreme example of this. It's a small town of 5,300 people in the Denver metro area. Hi. Kris? KRIS TEEGARDIN: How are you? RUNYON: Hey. Luke. TEEGARDIN: Nice to meet you. Come on in. RUNYON: Thanks. So I met with Kris Teegardin. He's the mayor of Edgewater. The city has five retail marijuana shops and this year, they're projected to bring in more than a million dollars in marijuana tax revenue. And to put that in perspective, the city's total annual budget is $6 million. So that's one-sixth that's coming from marijuana. TEEGARDIN: Tax sales have been able to speed up major infrastructure improvements otherwise that we would have to take a very incremental approach toward. RUNYON: One of those improvements is road paving. Teegardin even jokes that maybe they should be paving the roads in green to show people how their marijuana tax dollars are being spent. They're also putting money towards a brand-new civic center. Other cities here in Colorado are funding homelessness programs, mental health centers. But Teegardin is not banking on this money coming in forever. TEEGARDIN: This is something that we know could go away in a blink of an eye, or it could have a downturn when other states legalize it or other municipalities decide to join. So we are really looking at a murky forecast in sales in the next three or four years. WIGHT: So this all kind of follows what the head of marijuana coordination in Colorado, Andrew Freedman, says, doesn't it? That tax revenue is really not the reason to support legalization.

I'm Terry Gross. The common wisdom about pets is that you can train a dog, but you can't train a cat. My guest says you can train a cat, but it takes an understanding of how cats learn. Sarah Ellis is the co-author with John Bradshaw of the new book, \"The Trainable Cat. \" Among the things she's trained her cats to do is come when she calls, voluntarily walk into the cat carrier to go to the vet, take medicine and be friendly to her dog and her baby. Ellis is a feline behavior specialist at the British charity group International Cat Care which collaborates with organizations around the world involved with cat welfare, and she's a visiting fellow at the University of Lincoln in England. Sarah Ellis, welcome to FRESH AIR. Why are cats more difficult to train than dogs, and do you even agree with the premise that cats are more difficult to train than dogs? SARAH ELLIS: I think, yes, they can be more difficult, but it's all about having a little bit more patience and a little bit more understanding of what the cat is in terms of its behavior and where it's come from. And then once owners have that understanding, the patience comes much more naturally, and then they can see that training is possible. GROSS: But as you point out, you can't train cats the same way that you train dogs. I mean, it's similar but different because cats respond to different things and they have different sensory ways of intaking information. One of the things you point out is that dogs are creatures of habit, cats are creatures of place. What does that mean? ELLIS: OK, so yeah, I think the fundamental difference between dogs and cats and how it influences the way that they perceive training is that dogs are innately very, very sociable. They have evolved from a social animal, the wolf, and they are incredibly sociable not just to their own species but to humans. The cat, however, has evolved from a solitary ancestor, the North African wildcat, and that process of domestication has also been much, much shorter, if you like. And therefore, the cat hasn't had the chance to develop these social tendencies that the dog already has. So because of that, the cat's a little bit more on the back foot or the back paw, if you like. They're less likely to understand our - the cues that we may give, for example, things like pointing. They're less likely to naturally attune to us. So they're much less likely to look at our faces, to be able to read our expressions. GROSS: When you say cats are creatures of place, not of habit, what do you mean by that? ELLIS: OK, so going back to this idea that dogs are really sociable and cats less so - because of that, the primary attachment for a dog is generally its owner. By an attachment bond, think of, like, a mother and their child. It's that bond being around - a child to be around its mother and creates a feeling of safety and security. And when you go to a new place as a child, as long as your mother or your parent is there, you still feel a sense of safety, and that's the same for a dog. So for when a dog goes to the vet's with its owner, the dog still feels relatively safe and secure and could cope with the environment because its owner's there, that security blanket. For the cats, that security does not necessarily come from a person or another animal. It comes from a physical place. Cats are very, very territorial animals, and they create safety by getting to know a physical place very well and by marking that place and impregnating it with their own scent. So when we take the cat out of that physical environment, we've taken away their safety or their security, and that's why they don't cope nearly as well in novel environments. GROSS: And what are the implications of that for training a cat? ELLIS: Well, the first thing is many of the things that we want to train a cat involve novel places. So you mentioned already going to the vet's, the boarding cattery, moving house, etc. And one of the ways that we tend to move cats is we put them in a cat carrier. And so those things are intrinsically stressful for a cat because they're taking them away from their place of safety and security. So the first thing we would want to teach a cat - I think every cat should be taught this as a life skill - is that the cat carrier can become a portable place of safety and security. It is a safe, secure place and is part of the cat's normal territory. And now we have a portable item of security, just like for the dog, its owner, for the cat, its cat carrier. And that's the foundation, I think, for training in terms of novelty. GROSS: So with a cat carrier, to teach the cat that it's a safe place and it's safe to be there when you're taking the cat to a new location, whether it's the airport or the vet, do you keep your carrier out all the time so that it's a very familiar part of the cat's environment, as if it were a piece of furniture in the house? ELLIS: Yeah, absolutely. That's what we would really like to encourage cat owners to do. Currently, what most cat owners do is they keep the cat carrier hidden in a closet or in the basement. And the day that the cat has to go to the vet's, they tend to bring it out. And what that does for the cat is it becomes a very predictive signal that something unpleasant is about to come because they've already made this association between the cat carrier and the travel or the vet's. Instead, as you say, if we keep the cat carrier out all the time, it becomes a regular part of the furniture within their territory. They get the opportunity to facial mark it and to sleep in it and to eat in it, so to have positive experiences within it and also to impregnate their own scent onto it, which is how they feel safe and secure. And therefore it's already a part of their home, so we're taking that place with them when we take them somewhere new. I think the main reason, at the moment, that owners don't do that is that cat carriers don't look particularly pleasant and people don't like the look of them out in their homes. And I think really for - to improve that, we really need to think about nicer, cleaner designs of cat carrier that not only function as a cat carrier but that owners would be happy to leave out in their homes at all time. GROSS: Cats live in the present, and you say any reward or punishment that you use for a cat - and, by the way, you recommend against punishment, and we'll get to that a little bit later - but any reward or punishment should happen immediately after the action. So what kind of problem sets in if you wait a couple of minutes? ELLIS: If you wait a couple of minutes, what you'll, in effect, be rewarding is the behavior that's happening in those couple of minutes later. So cats really, really are a little bit unforgiving if you, like - as are many other animals - in terms of if you are not good with your timing of your training. And by timing, I mean the delivery of the reward because they need to have the two things happening very, very close in time to know that the association is between those two things. And that's classical conditioning. That's not necessarily unique for the cat. That's the same with any animal. So we need to have a message to tell them that was exactly it, right now, right there, what you're doing. If we cannot give the reward at that exact time, and usually the reward is food, we can use other things to pinpoint or reward or mark that behavior that allows the cat to know that food is going to come two minutes later. But the only way you can do that is, first of all, to create an association between whatever your marker behavior is and your reward. So if I give you an example, quite often - let's say we were teaching a cat to go through a cat flap. I couldn't give him the food at the moment that he's going through the cat flap. GROSS: A cat flap is like a cat door, one of those little cat doors. ELLIS: Yeah, a cat door. The behavior that we would want to reward, going through the cat door or jumping down, we cannot give food at that exact moment in time because we might not physically be able to get the food to the other side of the cat door or to the cat the minute its - the second its feet lands on the floor. So we can use something that we call a marker. And in this case, very often with cats, I just use a word, and that word's often just good. But what do you have to do before that is teach the cat that the word good predicts that the real reward, the food, is going to come. And you do that just simply by pairing those two things, presenting the word good, so saying it and then giving food. And doing that time and time again, and then you know the cat has learned the association when you just say the word, good, and the cat orientates towards you. It might meow at you. It shows you all the behaviors that it normally shows you that are indicative that it knows food is on its way. Then you've got a tool that will allow you to buy those extra few seconds, but it's not going to be a few minutes. It's only going to be a few seconds. GROSS: OK, so when you're teaching a cat to respond to a word like good, what exactly is the cat hearing? Do you have any idea? And I have this habit - I don't know if it's annoying to my cat or what, but, I sometimes talk to my cat in a falsetto (imitating high voice) like this. GROSS: I don't know where that comes from, but I don't know, like, is it the rhythm of the word? Is it the, you know, like - our cat's name is Rowdy (ph), and I'll call him like, Rowdy. And, you know, so is he hearing the melody of that sound or, like - what's the best way to talk to a cat? ELLIS: Cats generally cope well with quiet voices. They don't like very loud voices. That can be frightening for them. And they do tend to like female voices a lot because they attune very well to high pitch. Their auditory system is very much designed to hear high-pitch sounds because prey make very, very high-pitch sounds and, therefore, they do tend to orientate towards high sounds better. So I don't think it's a problem at all if owners are speaking to their cats in the more sort of baby-voice-type language. GROSS: You recommend against punishment. You're all for reward. Why is punishment bad? And we're not talking about, you know, beating the cat, but just, like, a negative response like squirting the cat with water or shaking noisy keys at it. ELLIS: Yeah, the reason that we don't advocate punishment at all is because it can be really, really damaging to the relationship of the cat with the human. If you get your timing wrong, you may be punishing a very different behavior to what you think you're punishing, and that can be quite disastrous. And, secondly, if you're delivering that punishment - so you are holding a water sprayer, or you are throwing something at the cat, or you are physically, you know, smacking its back end off the kitchen counter - whatever it is, the cat will associate that punishment with you and may not associate it with the actual act of what it's doing because you're very salient in that environment, at that time, and you are the one delivering the punishment. And so all you're doing then is teaching your cat that you are not a very good person to be around, that you deliver quite unpleasant consequences and, therefore, the cat will start to avoid you rather than stopping to do that behavior. GROSS: So how do you teach a cat not to do something, to stop doing something? ELLIS: So it very much depends on the behavior. But what we would do is try and teach on incompatible behavior. So we would teach the cat to do something else instead that meant they couldn't do the behavior that was undesired. And we would make a different behavior very, very rewarding, so they were very, very motivated to do it. We would also find out what the particular behavior was that they were doing that was undesirable, and why they were motivated to do that behavior. And we have to think about, is it a behavior that they actually need to do for their own welfare? So, for example, let's say, scratching, and they're scratching the furniture as opposed to scratching on their scratch post. We couldn't just stop that behavior completely because it's a natural behavior for cats, and it's something that they should be allowed to do, and we should accept that they do as part of being a cat. So, therefore, we think we would want to train the cat to redirect that behavior onto something that we would consider much more appropriate, rather than stop it completely. GROSS: Like a scratching post? ELLIS: Like a scratching post. Exactly. GROSS: My experience is, cats love the furniture and the scratching post. You're just adding more joy in their lives, but you're not discouraging them from scratching the things you don't want them to scratch. ELLIS: And, I think, for cats that are housed indoor only, they will often scratch in multiple places within the home because they will often scratch at multiple places within their territory, the boundary of their territories. So for cats that are allowed outdoor access, that's often outdoors. But for cats that don't have outdoor access, those multiple points are often within the home. So it's a case of educating owners that, actually, one scratch post is often not enough. Most of us just don't have one chair in our house. We have several chairs, and we'll sit in different ones and, therefore, we need to think about being providing extra resources for our cats - more than one scratch post. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Sarah Ellis. She's a cat behavior specialist and co-author of the new book, \"The Trainable Cat. \" Let's take a short break, and then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Sarah Ellis. She's a cat behavior specialist and her new book, \"The Trainable Cat\" is all about how to train cats, and she says, yes, cats are trainable. OK, so let's start with, like, a basic training thing, teaching a cat to respond to the cat's name and to come when you call it. So as a positive reinforcer, you recommend, you know, a treat. And one of the things you do is have meat paste in a syringe. I mean, I don't even know where to get meat paste. I've never even heard of meat paste. ELLIS: (Laughter) So I. . . GROSS: Oh, and, by the way, I should mention the syringe, it's not to inject the cat. You just kind of squirt it out of the syringe, and so the cat can lick it off the end of it. There's no needle in it. ELLIS: Yeah, absolutely. GROSS: Is syringe the right word to use? ELLIS: Yeah. Yeah. We would call it a syringe, certainly. And then it's a syringe without a needle, so the plastic part of the syringe, if you like. GROSS: Right. ELLIS: But actually I have a 2 year old and during weaning off my little boy, I discovered these like squeezy tubes that have a spoon attached to them that you can squeeze the tube, and it squeezes the baby food out onto a spoon. And I thought these are fantastic for training cats because you can squeeze it straight into a spoon, and the cat licks it off the spoon. So it's amazing what things you can find (laughter) which you're not expecting in life at all. But meat paste - there are some cat food that comes canned, and it's like a patty. And you can loosen that patty with a little bit of water to make paste. And I also have a separate very small food mixer, so that I can blend my cat's regular cat meat into a paste which sounds a bit disgusting, but trust me once you've done it once or twice, it's not a problem. And you can buy human-grade meat paste as well. In the U. K. , people spread it on their sandwiches, and these kinds of things. You just have to make sure in the ingredients it doesn't have any additional ingredients that could be toxic to cats. It's worth definitely checking with your vet. GROSS: Spreading it on sandwiches does not sound great to me, but thanks for the advice. ELLIS: No, it's not. It's not something I would eat, hence why the cat gets it. GROSS: So getting back to teaching a cat to respond to its name and to come when you call it - walk us through the process for doing that. ELLIS: Sure. GROSS: It just seems like the very basic training. ELLIS: Yeah, definitely. So most people's cats know their names already, but where people tend to go wrong is they think, oh, he knows his name. I'll use his name to get him to come to me. But because we use their names all the time, it's not a command to say come to me. It's just a word that we say to them that they know they need to give their attention to us. So the first thing we need to do is think about what word are we going to use that actually means I want you to move your body over towards me and stop when you get to me? We tend to use come or here or any word that works well for you. So the word of the cat - the cat's name, let's say I'm training Cosmos, my cat. I would say the word Cosmos to get his attention, but then I would always say the word come to tell him the command of what I'd like you to do, now I've got your attention, is to come towards me. So you have to think about what that word's going to be first of all. But we don't use that word until a little bit further down the training. The first thing we do is we make sure the cat is actually really quite close to us when we start teaching the recall. And when I say close, I'm meaning like within a meter or two meters, definitely within the same room. And we show the cat that we have something that it really likes - so most commonly food. And so if you've got your food in the paste, you might need to squirt a little bit of that paste out and let the cat smell it or if you've got food in a tub, if you've got some biscuits you can rattle that. Assure the cat that you've got it. The cat should come to you purely because it knows you've got food, and it's motivated for that food. So choose a time when the cat's hungry. Choose a food it really, really likes. So as soon as the cat gets up and starts to walk towards you - and we're only talking at this stage a few steps, you then give that cat that reward. And you repeat that in different locations, in different places in the house, and you gradually increase the distance between you and the cat. After doing that in different locations within the house and doing it at different distances which are increasing, we can start to do it when the cat can no longer see us. It can just hear us. And so that's quite good fun. When you really know that you've trained well, you can be in a completely different room of the house, call the cat give your cue word and see if the cat comes. Only once you've got it that good with it then I take it outdoors. So we're generalizing all the time what the cat's learned to different locations. And that's what makes it really strong. GROSS: So once the cat has mastered this training and comes when you call it by saying come, at what point can you stop giving the cat food each time the cat comes and will the cat at some point think like, well, I'm not going to come any more, there's nothing in it for me? ELLIS: (Laughter) Yeah. OK. So it's a little bit like - imagine the food - it's a little bit like your pay for going to work. We wouldn't go to work for nothing ever, really. And there has to be some reward at some point, but that reward doesn't have to come every single time once the animal has learned what the key word means and has got the behavior mastered. What we tend to find in animal training - and this is not just the case for cats. It's for all animals - is that once you've taught a behavior, in order to maintain that behavioral response really strongly, intermittent reinforcement is the best kind. And by that what we mean is that you don't give a reward every single time. It sort of keeps the cat guessing. They don't know if running toward you this time they'll get the food or it will the next time. And that actually makes the behavior more likely to happen. GROSS: My guest is Sarah Ellis. Her new book is called \"The Trainable Cat. \" After a break, we'll talk about how to stop your hungry cat from waking you up by sticking its paw in your eye at 6:30 in the morning on a Sunday. Here's the novelty showpiece \"Kiddin' On The Keys\" performed by the always showy Liberace. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to our interview about how to train cats with feline behavior specialist Sarah Ellis, co-author of the new book \"The Trainable Cat. \"So cats are - they're very demanding about certain things like when they want food. They know that you feed them and they're hungry, and they want you to feed them. They will tell you either by meowing a lot or by biting your foot or scratching your leg - or there are sweeter ways of doing it than that, but there are the more (laughter) assertive ways. So how do you train a cat to, like, not bite you or scratch you? Oh, let me get to another example. This is the best. When you're sleeping - it's your day to sleep late. It's Saturday. You want to sleep late. Your cat doesn't know it's Saturday. Your cat doesn't care that it's Saturday. It wants to be fed at 6:30 in the morning. And so it jumps onto the bed or walks up to the pillow, sticks its paw in your eye (laughter) and says time to get up. How do you train a cat not to do that? ELLIS: OK, so those behaviors happen in the first place because the cats have trained us. We may not be aware of that at the time, but that's basically what's happened. Cats are not necessarily born meowing and screaming at us for food. It's a behavior that they learn. They're also not born innately to bite our noses when we sleep and scratch our eyes when we sleep. Again, it's another behavior that they try out through trial and error, learn that it has a very, very - it's very effective 'cause it gets exactly the response they would like, and therefore they use it again and again. So the first thing I would say is that owners who have found that their cats are meowing incessantly for food and driving them bonkers is to think about what have you done in the past when your cat has done those behaviors? It is likely that you have gone, oh, goodness me, he's meowing again, just give him some food for him to be quiet. What we've done, remember, is we've reinforced the meowing behavior. So we're just going to make it worse and worse and worse for ourselves 'cause our cats are going to go, oh, that is a behavior that I need to do to get food. And if one day we think, I'm not going to do that anymore, I'm really sick of him meowing for food and I don't want him to do that, I want to try and stop him doing that, and day one, he meows and he meows and you're really strong and you think, nope, he's not going to get food for that. And day two and day three - and then by day four, you've had a really, really bad day at work and you're really tired and you've got a bad headache and he is still meowing for food and you think, no, no, I'm going to be strong-willed here. He's not going to get food now. He's going to have to wait until he's quiet another time and then he can have food. And you let him meow for much, much longer than normal, and then you just can't take it anymore and you give him the food. You've made the whole situation even worse because now the cat's learned, oh, I have to meow for, like, 20 minutes instead of 10 minutes for you to give me the food. So what we have to warn owners in that situation is we have to put the behavior on what we call an extinction schedule, if we want to use a real scientific term. That is that this behavior is no longer reinforced. So if you wake me up in the middle of the night, I will no longer get up and feed you just so I can go back to bed. What we need to explain to owners is if they can be really strong with that extinction schedule and just make sure at every occurrence of that behavior they do not reward it, is that it will stop. GROSS: I think a common problem that a lot of pet owners face is that, you know, they have, say, a cat and they want to also adopt another cat or a dog or they have a new baby that's about to arrive, and you have to acclimate the cat that you already have to the newcomer and vice versa. And you have a lot of suggestions for training the cat to deal with the new baby or the new animal that's coming to the house. Can you take us through some of those steps? ELLIS: Yeah, sure. So as humans, we're really naturally very, very sociable. We like extending our families, we like having - if we love cats, we want more cats. The cat doesn't see the world like that at all. Remember, it's evolved from a solitary animal. And so suddenly being asked to share its territory with somebody or something that's very unfamiliar to it can be a real - really quite stressful experience for a cat. So while we might welcome with open arms a new baby or a new cat, and we have an understanding that this already is a family member for us, the cat doesn't. For the cat, it's - the analogy would be like if a - you just came home from work and a stranger was sleeping in your bed. It's really quite a sort of freak-out situation. But when cats - they do have the ability to form social relationships with one another, and it really depends on the individual cat to what extent they can. The way that they do so and the way that they maintain those social relationships is very often through scent, through - they have very, very good sense of smell. And while we generally recognize our family members through sight and through the sound of their voices, for cats it will be through their - how they smell. So the first thing that we try to do when we're trying to introduce them to a new cat or a new baby, etc. , is to think about all those sensory information that that new being brings, particularly smell but also sight and sound and gradually introduce the cat to them over a slow period of time and in a way that the sensory elements are, in their first instance, quite dilute and then come right up to their sort of real level of what they are. GROSS: How do you introduce a new person's smell or a new animal's smell to a cat? ELLIS: OK, so we're going to use an example of a new cat. If we brought a new cat home from the shelter, we would want to keep it in a completely different part of the house from the resident cat, ideally a single room so that that new cat gets a chance to get used to one area that's not too big before we introduce it to other areas. And one of the first ways that we can introduce the two cats to each other's smell is simply by swapping the bedding, taking the bedding that they've been sleeping on, which will be heavily impregnated with their scent, and placing that in each other's territories, making sure that they still have some bedding of their own, as well 'cause, remember, they feel safe and secure when the area smells of them. Cats produce scent, which we cannot detect. Our noses are not strong enough to be able to - or good enough to be able to detect it. And then they also produce these chemicals known as pheromones that are species-specific. So we - they mean nothing to us. We cannot detect them. And they're produced from in between the toes, at the base of the tail, down the flanks but primarily around the face. So do you know under the chin, they love to be scratched and just behind the whiskers on the cheeks, and do you know those areas in front of their ears where there seems to be a lot less hair between the ears and the eyes? GROSS: Yeah. ELLIS: That area there is a very concentrated area where - of sebaceous glands that produce these facial pheromones, these specific chemicals that cats use to communicate with one another. So rubbing a cloth over these facial regions will impregnate that cloth with a scent of that individual cat which, if we smelt that cloth we would smell nothing, but if we put that into the environment of the other cat, they would very much be able to detect the presence of another cat there. GROSS: And you also have pictures of how you trained your cat at home to accept a second cat. So you have both cats in walled-off spaces but in the same room. So, like, there's some kind of, like, little fence between them or their own - they're each in their own little crates. So they're in the same room, but they're completely protected from each other so that they learn to acclimate to each other without fear of being attacked. ELLIS: Yeah, so once they've got used to the smell of each other and they've heard each other and they're happy with all those things, then we would physically introduce them so that they could see each other. And by this stage, they should be able to recognize each other by smell. So it shouldn't be like, oh, my goodness, who is this creature in my house because they've already smelt this animal and they'll match the smell. But as a safety measure, we would always make sure that they can't physically interact at the beginning beyond just a nose-to-nose greeting. When cats tend to meet each other, they do so by sniffing each other at their noses. And then if they're - if they are well-known to one another and part of the same familial group, they may go on to then facial rub. But for cats, when we're introducing them to each other, a nose-to-nose touch or sniff is simply enough that that's all we would be really looking for with no agonistic or hostile behaviors. And so they're able to do this through a barrier, through a mesh door or through a baby gate. But we've prevented the opportunity for any hostile behavior in the eventuality that it did occur because we know from scientific study that if at the first true meeting, cats fight, then the chances of us being able to get those cats to live together is really, really difficult. And the first meeting is really crucial. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Sarah Ellis. She's a cat behavior specialist and co-author of the new book, \"The Trainable Cat. \" Let's take a short break here, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is cat behavior specialist Sarah Ellis. She's co-author of the new book, \"The Trainable Cat,\" and she insists cats can be trained. A lot of people who have cats have problems with the cat urinating outside of the litter box, and that's an example - like, I have no clue how you would train a cat to not do that. ELLIS: Yeah, the - one of the things is people often think you have to teach a cat to use the litter tray or the litter box, and you don't. You don't have to teach kittens to use the litter box. When they feel a substance under their feet that's very fine and rakable, instinctively they will toilet on it. So the reasons that sometimes they don't use the litter box is because the litter box is not clean enough. Remember they have this really, really good sense of smell. And while we might not be able to smell the odors coming from it, the cats certainly can. Their noses are closer to the soiled litter and that they have this much better, much more acute sense of smell, and they're fastidious about being clean. So if that litter tray has not been - a litter box has not been scooped in the morning or in the evening, they might choose not to use it. Often, cat litters are designed with us as a consumer in mind rather than our cat, and they are not desirable to our cat in terms of the sensation they create on their feet. They might not be fine and rakable enough or we may place the litter box in an area that the cat doesn't feel is safe and secure. Lots of people put them in their basement next to their tumble dryer or their laundry machine or the washing machine. And for a cat, it's horrible to have that vibration or that noise right next to when they want to go to the bathroom. So these are some of the reasons that cats might not want to use the litter box. There is a whole other range of reasons that are medical related. And so we always, always advise, if your cat is not using the litter box, to make sure the first thing you do is to take it to the vet's. So it's not just a simple case of being able to train the cat to use the litter box, it's more that they instinctively know how to do that. It's just that the litter box provided to them is perhaps not desirable because of cleanliness, the substrate that's in it or its location or that it has to share it with another cat. And if those two cats in the home do not consider each other part of their same social group, then they were not going to share a toilet together. GROSS: You know, we're talking about, like, training cats and why that's good for the cat and good for the people. Cats, especially indoor cats, need exercise. And so play is not only, like, a fun activity for the cat and the person but it's also, like, really healthy for the cat. I sometimes wonder if my cat understands that he's engaged in a very Sisyphean activity because (laughter) once - (laughter) like, especially, like, with a laser toy, like, there's no way you're going to actually capture that laser beam, you know? And even with, like, the feather toys - the wand feather toys - like, what do you do with it once you've captured it, you know? You play with it a while and then I'm going to whip it around again and then you capture it again and then I'm going to whip it around again. You know what I'm saying? Like, do cats get frustrated by the ways we play with them? ELLIS: Yeah, they can. And I'll come onto that. But first of all, I think - I'm really pleased you brought up the subject of play 'cause for me, it's not an optional extra in cat ownership. It's not a fun thing to do if you have the time. It is as important as feeding them and providing them with a litter box. It's an absolute basic welfare need, particularly for cats that are indoor-only because the cat, as it's evolved and as we've domesticated it and even as we've selectively bred it and got these pedigree cats, we've never selected to get rid of the predatory behavior and the hunting behavior. And so they still have this desire to perform predatory behavior. And in the wild, they would hunt, you know, approximately 10 times a day. So you imagine they've got this instinct to do this behavior, but in an indoor-only environment, they've got no outlet for it. So really for welfare point of view, we have to offer the cat an appropriate outlet and play is a brilliant, brilliant way of doing that because when they play, they're using exactly the same predatory behaviors. The idea that play could be frustrating for a cat really comes from the idea that we are not allowing the cat to express - or an opportunity to do all of the different predatory behaviors. So if you're chasing a laser beam - a little laser light that's produced from a little box or your cat is chasing feathers on the end of a wand - the chase is only one element of the predatory sequence. There is the locate, the stalk, the stare, the chase, the pounce, which is part of the capture, the killing bite and the consume. And so it's important that we, during play and during feeding, we provide opportunity for all of these behaviors, then we're much, much, much less likely to cause any form of frustration. I think we find it quite amusing when we're playing with cats to make sure that the cat actually can catch the toy that we're playing with it if it's a feathers on a wand because then they do these beautiful acrobatics for us as they attempt to catch it. GROSS: Exactly, yes (laughter). ELLIS: But it's so, so important we let them catch it because that is the reward, not every time. Remember this sort of intermittent reinforcement. They wouldn't catch a mouse every time they hunted. They wouldn't be that good, but we need to think - or (unintelligible) to ourselves when playing with cats let them catch it now and again, especially when we end a play session. End on a session where they're allowed to capture it and really have a good chew and bite at it. GROSS: So sometimes what's frustrating for the person is if the cat obviously really wants to play and you get out the wand toy and you start kind of flipping it around, and the cat is spending like minutes just kind of watching it intently, and it's like come on play. GROSS: Do something (laughter). ELLIS: Yeah. So quite often what's happening there is that the owner is making the pretend prey so the feathers on the end of the wand behave in an unrealistic way that a prey item would not normally. So I've never seen a mouse, for example, you know, fly through the air doing 360 degrees. ELLIS: But yet we expect our cats to chase that and capture that. So it's about teaching owners to make sure that a toy on the end of that wand mimics what a mouse or a bird would do. And then you'll find that the cat really gets engaged, and the more they're allowed to capture it - remember they've been rewarded for that behavior - the more they'll think this is achievable. I can capture this pretend mouse or pretend bird. But to them, it probably feels real at that moment in time. I'm going to have a shot at going for this one because it's within my ream, so it's just about adjusting our expectations a little bit. GROSS: Sarah Ellis, it's been great to talk with you. Thank you so much. ELLIS: Thank you. It's been a pleasure. GROSS: Sarah Ellis is a feline behavior specialist and co-author with John Bradshaw of \"The Trainable Cat. \" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (LAUGHTER)(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)(SOUNDBITE OF LIBERACE SONG, \"KIDDIN' ON THE KEYS\")(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)(LAUGHTER)(LAUGHTER) TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. The common wisdom about pets is that you can train a dog, but you can't train a cat. My guest says you can train a cat, but it takes an understanding of how cats learn. Sarah Ellis is the co-author with John Bradshaw of the new book, \"The Trainable Cat. \" Among the things she's trained her cats to do is come when she calls, voluntarily walk into the cat carrier to go to the vet, take medicine and be friendly to her dog and her baby. Ellis is a feline behavior specialist at the British charity group International Cat Care which collaborates with organizations around the world involved with cat welfare, and she's a visiting fellow at the University of Lincoln in England. Sarah Ellis, welcome to FRESH AIR. Why are cats more difficult to train than dogs, and do you even agree with the premise that cats are more difficult to train than dogs? SARAH ELLIS: I think, yes, they can be more difficult, but it's all about having a little bit more patience and a little bit more understanding of what the cat is in terms of its behavior and where it's come from. And then once owners have that understanding, the patience comes much more naturally, and then they can see that training is possible. GROSS: But as you point out, you can't train cats the same way that you train dogs. I mean, it's similar but different because cats respond to different things and they have different sensory ways of intaking information. One of the things you point out is that dogs are creatures of habit, cats are creatures of place. What does that mean? ELLIS: OK, so yeah, I think the fundamental difference between dogs and cats and how it influences the way that they perceive training is that dogs are innately very, very sociable. They have evolved from a social animal, the wolf, and they are incredibly sociable not just to their own species but to humans. The cat, however, has evolved from a solitary ancestor, the North African wildcat, and that process of domestication has also been much, much shorter, if you like. And therefore, the cat hasn't had the chance to develop these social tendencies that the dog already has. So because of that, the cat's a little bit more on the back foot or the back paw, if you like. They're less likely to understand our - the cues that we may give, for example, things like pointing. They're less likely to naturally attune to us. So they're much less likely to look at our faces, to be able to read our expressions. GROSS: When you say cats are creatures of place, not of habit, what do you mean by that? ELLIS: OK, so going back to this idea that dogs are really sociable and cats less so - because of that, the primary attachment for a dog is generally its owner. By an attachment bond, think of, like, a mother and their child. It's that bond being around - a child to be around its mother and creates a feeling of safety and security. And when you go to a new place as a child, as long as your mother or your parent is there, you still feel a sense of safety, and that's the same for a dog. So for when a dog goes to the vet's with its owner, the dog still feels relatively safe and secure and could cope with the environment because its owner's there, that security blanket. For the cats, that security does not necessarily come from a person or another animal. It comes from a physical place. Cats are very, very territorial animals, and they create safety by getting to know a physical place very well and by marking that place and impregnating it with their own scent. So when we take the cat out of that physical environment, we've taken away their safety or their security, and that's why they don't cope nearly as well in novel environments. GROSS: And what are the implications of that for training a cat? ELLIS: Well, the first thing is many of the things that we want to train a cat involve novel places. So you mentioned already going to the vet's, the boarding cattery, moving house, etc. And one of the ways that we tend to move cats is we put them in a cat carrier. And so those things are intrinsically stressful for a cat because they're taking them away from their place of safety and security. So the first thing we would want to teach a cat - I think every cat should be taught this as a life skill - is that the cat carrier can become a portable place of safety and security. It is a safe, secure place and is part of the cat's normal territory. And now we have a portable item of security, just like for the dog, its owner, for the cat, its cat carrier. And that's the foundation, I think, for training in terms of novelty. GROSS: So with a cat carrier, to teach the cat that it's a safe place and it's safe to be there when you're taking the cat to a new location, whether it's the airport or the vet, do you keep your carrier out all the time so that it's a very familiar part of the cat's environment, as if it were a piece of furniture in the house? ELLIS: Yeah, absolutely. That's what we would really like to encourage cat owners to do. Currently, what most cat owners do is they keep the cat carrier hidden in a closet or in the basement. And the day that the cat has to go to the vet's, they tend to bring it out. And what that does for the cat is it becomes a very predictive signal that something unpleasant is about to come because they've already made this association between the cat carrier and the travel or the vet's. Instead, as you say, if we keep the cat carrier out all the time, it becomes a regular part of the furniture within their territory. They get the opportunity to facial mark it and to sleep in it and to eat in it, so to have positive experiences within it and also to impregnate their own scent onto it, which is how they feel safe and secure. And therefore it's already a part of their home, so we're taking that place with them when we take them somewhere new. I think the main reason, at the moment, that owners don't do that is that cat carriers don't look particularly pleasant and people don't like the look of them out in their homes. And I think really for - to improve that, we really need to think about nicer, cleaner designs of cat carrier that not only function as a cat carrier but that owners would be happy to leave out in their homes at all time. GROSS: Cats live in the present, and you say any reward or punishment that you use for a cat - and, by the way, you recommend against punishment, and we'll get to that a little bit later - but any reward or punishment should happen immediately after the action. So what kind of problem sets in if you wait a couple of minutes? ELLIS: If you wait a couple of minutes, what you'll, in effect, be rewarding is the behavior that's happening in those couple of minutes later. So cats really, really are a little bit unforgiving if you, like - as are many other animals - in terms of if you are not good with your timing of your training. And by timing, I mean the delivery of the reward because they need to have the two things happening very, very close in time to know that the association is between those two things. And that's classical conditioning. That's not necessarily unique for the cat. That's the same with any animal. So we need to have a message to tell them that was exactly it, right now, right there, what you're doing. If we cannot give the reward at that exact time, and usually the reward is food, we can use other things to pinpoint or reward or mark that behavior that allows the cat to know that food is going to come two minutes later. But the only way you can do that is, first of all, to create an association between whatever your marker behavior is and your reward. So if I give you an example, quite often - let's say we were teaching a cat to go through a cat flap. I couldn't give him the food at the moment that he's going through the cat flap. GROSS: A cat flap is like a cat door, one of those little cat doors. ELLIS: Yeah, a cat door. The behavior that we would want to reward, going through the cat door or jumping down, we cannot give food at that exact moment in time because we might not physically be able to get the food to the other side of the cat door or to the cat the minute its - the second its feet lands on the floor. So we can use something that we call a marker. And in this case, very often with cats, I just use a word, and that word's often just good. But what do you have to do before that is teach the cat that the word good predicts that the real reward, the food, is going to come. And you do that just simply by pairing those two things, presenting the word good, so saying it and then giving food. And doing that time and time again, and then you know the cat has learned the association when you just say the word, good, and the cat orientates towards you. It might meow at you. It shows you all the behaviors that it normally shows you that are indicative that it knows food is on its way. Then you've got a tool that will allow you to buy those extra few seconds, but it's not going to be a few minutes. It's only going to be a few seconds. GROSS: OK, so when you're teaching a cat to respond to a word like good, what exactly is the cat hearing? Do you have any idea? And I have this habit - I don't know if it's annoying to my cat or what, but, I sometimes talk to my cat in a falsetto (imitating high voice) like this. GROSS: I don't know where that comes from, but I don't know, like, is it the rhythm of the word? Is it the, you know, like - our cat's name is Rowdy (ph), and I'll call him like, Rowdy. And, you know, so is he hearing the melody of that sound or, like - what's the best way to talk to a cat? ELLIS: Cats generally cope well with quiet voices. They don't like very loud voices. That can be frightening for them. And they do tend to like female voices a lot because they attune very well to high pitch. Their auditory system is very much designed to hear high-pitch sounds because prey make very, very high-pitch sounds and, therefore, they do tend to orientate towards high sounds better. So I don't think it's a problem at all if owners are speaking to their cats in the more sort of baby-voice-type language. GROSS: You recommend against punishment. You're all for reward. Why is punishment bad? And we're not talking about, you know, beating the cat, but just, like, a negative response like squirting the cat with water or shaking noisy keys at it. ELLIS: Yeah, the reason that we don't advocate punishment at all is because it can be really, really damaging to the relationship of the cat with the human. If you get your timing wrong, you may be punishing a very different behavior to what you think you're punishing, and that can be quite disastrous. And, secondly, if you're delivering that punishment - so you are holding a water sprayer, or you are throwing something at the cat, or you are physically, you know, smacking its back end off the kitchen counter - whatever it is, the cat will associate that punishment with you and may not associate it with the actual act of what it's doing because you're very salient in that environment, at that time, and you are the one delivering the punishment. And so all you're doing then is teaching your cat that you are not a very good person to be around, that you deliver quite unpleasant consequences and, therefore, the cat will start to avoid you rather than stopping to do that behavior. GROSS: So how do you teach a cat not to do something, to stop doing something? ELLIS: So it very much depends on the behavior. But what we would do is try and teach on incompatible behavior. So we would teach the cat to do something else instead that meant they couldn't do the behavior that was undesired. And we would make a different behavior very, very rewarding, so they were very, very motivated to do it. We would also find out what the particular behavior was that they were doing that was undesirable, and why they were motivated to do that behavior. And we have to think about, is it a behavior that they actually need to do for their own welfare? So, for example, let's say, scratching, and they're scratching the furniture as opposed to scratching on their scratch post. We couldn't just stop that behavior completely because it's a natural behavior for cats, and it's something that they should be allowed to do, and we should accept that they do as part of being a cat. So, therefore, we think we would want to train the cat to redirect that behavior onto something that we would consider much more appropriate, rather than stop it completely. GROSS: Like a scratching post? ELLIS: Like a scratching post. Exactly. GROSS: My experience is, cats love the furniture and the scratching post. You're just adding more joy in their lives, but you're not discouraging them from scratching the things you don't want them to scratch. ELLIS: And, I think, for cats that are housed indoor only, they will often scratch in multiple places within the home because they will often scratch at multiple places within their territory, the boundary of their territories. So for cats that are allowed outdoor access, that's often outdoors. But for cats that don't have outdoor access, those multiple points are often within the home. So it's a case of educating owners that, actually, one scratch post is often not enough. Most of us just don't have one chair in our house. We have several chairs, and we'll sit in different ones and, therefore, we need to think about being providing extra resources for our cats - more than one scratch post. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Sarah Ellis. She's a cat behavior specialist and co-author of the new book, \"The Trainable Cat. \" Let's take a short break, and then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Sarah Ellis. She's a cat behavior specialist and her new book, \"The Trainable Cat\" is all about how to train cats, and she says, yes, cats are trainable. OK, so let's start with, like, a basic training thing, teaching a cat to respond to the cat's name and to come when you call it. So as a positive reinforcer, you recommend, you know, a treat. And one of the things you do is have meat paste in a syringe. I mean, I don't even know where to get meat paste. I've never even heard of meat paste. ELLIS: (Laughter) So I. . . GROSS: Oh, and, by the way, I should mention the syringe, it's not to inject the cat. You just kind of squirt it out of the syringe, and so the cat can lick it off the end of it. There's no needle in it. ELLIS: Yeah, absolutely. GROSS: Is syringe the right word to use? ELLIS: Yeah. Yeah. We would call it a syringe, certainly. And then it's a syringe without a needle, so the plastic part of the syringe, if you like. GROSS: Right. ELLIS: But actually I have a 2 year old and during weaning off my little boy, I discovered these like squeezy tubes that have a spoon attached to them that you can squeeze the tube, and it squeezes the baby food out onto a spoon. And I thought these are fantastic for training cats because you can squeeze it straight into a spoon, and the cat licks it off the spoon. So it's amazing what things you can find (laughter) which you're not expecting in life at all. But meat paste - there are some cat food that comes canned, and it's like a patty. And you can loosen that patty with a little bit of water to make paste. And I also have a separate very small food mixer, so that I can blend my cat's regular cat meat into a paste which sounds a bit disgusting, but trust me once you've done it once or twice, it's not a problem. And you can buy human-grade meat paste as well. In the U. K. , people spread it on their sandwiches, and these kinds of things. You just have to make sure in the ingredients it doesn't have any additional ingredients that could be toxic to cats. It's worth definitely checking with your vet. GROSS: Spreading it on sandwiches does not sound great to me, but thanks for the advice. ELLIS: No, it's not. It's not something I would eat, hence why the cat gets it. GROSS: So getting back to teaching a cat to respond to its name and to come when you call it - walk us through the process for doing that. ELLIS: Sure. GROSS: It just seems like the very basic training. ELLIS: Yeah, definitely. So most people's cats know their names already, but where people tend to go wrong is they think, oh, he knows his name. I'll use his name to get him to come to me. But because we use their names all the time, it's not a command to say come to me. It's just a word that we say to them that they know they need to give their attention to us. So the first thing we need to do is think about what word are we going to use that actually means I want you to move your body over towards me and stop when you get to me? We tend to use come or here or any word that works well for you. So the word of the cat - the cat's name, let's say I'm training Cosmos, my cat. I would say the word Cosmos to get his attention, but then I would always say the word come to tell him the command of what I'd like you to do, now I've got your attention, is to come towards me. So you have to think about what that word's going to be first of all. But we don't use that word until a little bit further down the training. The first thing we do is we make sure the cat is actually really quite close to us when we start teaching the recall. And when I say close, I'm meaning like within a meter or two meters, definitely within the same room. And we show the cat that we have something that it really likes - so most commonly food. And so if you've got your food in the paste, you might need to squirt a little bit of that paste out and let the cat smell it or if you've got food in a tub, if you've got some biscuits you can rattle that. Assure the cat that you've got it. The cat should come to you purely because it knows you've got food, and it's motivated for that food. So choose a time when the cat's hungry. Choose a food it really, really likes. So as soon as the cat gets up and starts to walk towards you - and we're only talking at this stage a few steps, you then give that cat that reward. And you repeat that in different locations, in different places in the house, and you gradually increase the distance between you and the cat. After doing that in different locations within the house and doing it at different distances which are increasing, we can start to do it when the cat can no longer see us. It can just hear us. And so that's quite good fun. When you really know that you've trained well, you can be in a completely different room of the house, call the cat give your cue word and see if the cat comes. Only once you've got it that good with it then I take it outdoors. So we're generalizing all the time what the cat's learned to different locations. And that's what makes it really strong. GROSS: So once the cat has mastered this training and comes when you call it by saying come, at what point can you stop giving the cat food each time the cat comes and will the cat at some point think like, well, I'm not going to come any more, there's nothing in it for me? ELLIS: (Laughter) Yeah. OK. So it's a little bit like - imagine the food - it's a little bit like your pay for going to work. We wouldn't go to work for nothing ever, really. And there has to be some reward at some point, but that reward doesn't have to come every single time once the animal has learned what the key word means and has got the behavior mastered. What we tend to find in animal training - and this is not just the case for cats. It's for all animals - is that once you've taught a behavior, in order to maintain that behavioral response really strongly, intermittent reinforcement is the best kind. And by that what we mean is that you don't give a reward every single time. It sort of keeps the cat guessing. They don't know if running toward you this time they'll get the food or it will the next time. And that actually makes the behavior more likely to happen. GROSS: My guest is Sarah Ellis. Her new book is called \"The Trainable Cat. \" After a break, we'll talk about how to stop your hungry cat from waking you up by sticking its paw in your eye at 6:30 in the morning on a Sunday. Here's the novelty showpiece \"Kiddin' On The Keys\" performed by the always showy Liberace. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to our interview about how to train cats with feline behavior specialist Sarah Ellis, co-author of the new book \"The Trainable Cat. \" So cats are - they're very demanding about certain things like when they want food. They know that you feed them and they're hungry, and they want you to feed them. They will tell you either by meowing a lot or by biting your foot or scratching your leg - or there are sweeter ways of doing it than that, but there are the more (laughter) assertive ways. So how do you train a cat to, like, not bite you or scratch you? Oh, let me get to another example. This is the best. When you're sleeping - it's your day to sleep late. It's Saturday. You want to sleep late. Your cat doesn't know it's Saturday. Your cat doesn't care that it's Saturday. It wants to be fed at 6:30 in the morning. And so it jumps onto the bed or walks up to the pillow, sticks its paw in your eye (laughter) and says time to get up. How do you train a cat not to do that? ELLIS: OK, so those behaviors happen in the first place because the cats have trained us. We may not be aware of that at the time, but that's basically what's happened. Cats are not necessarily born meowing and screaming at us for food. It's a behavior that they learn. They're also not born innately to bite our noses when we sleep and scratch our eyes when we sleep. Again, it's another behavior that they try out through trial and error, learn that it has a very, very - it's very effective 'cause it gets exactly the response they would like, and therefore they use it again and again. So the first thing I would say is that owners who have found that their cats are meowing incessantly for food and driving them bonkers is to think about what have you done in the past when your cat has done those behaviors? It is likely that you have gone, oh, goodness me, he's meowing again, just give him some food for him to be quiet. What we've done, remember, is we've reinforced the meowing behavior. So we're just going to make it worse and worse and worse for ourselves 'cause our cats are going to go, oh, that is a behavior that I need to do to get food. And if one day we think, I'm not going to do that anymore, I'm really sick of him meowing for food and I don't want him to do that, I want to try and stop him doing that, and day one, he meows and he meows and you're really strong and you think, nope, he's not going to get food for that. And day two and day three - and then by day four, you've had a really, really bad day at work and you're really tired and you've got a bad headache and he is still meowing for food and you think, no, no, I'm going to be strong-willed here. He's not going to get food now. He's going to have to wait until he's quiet another time and then he can have food. And you let him meow for much, much longer than normal, and then you just can't take it anymore and you give him the food. You've made the whole situation even worse because now the cat's learned, oh, I have to meow for, like, 20 minutes instead of 10 minutes for you to give me the food. So what we have to warn owners in that situation is we have to put the behavior on what we call an extinction schedule, if we want to use a real scientific term. That is that this behavior is no longer reinforced. So if you wake me up in the middle of the night, I will no longer get up and feed you just so I can go back to bed. What we need to explain to owners is if they can be really strong with that extinction schedule and just make sure at every occurrence of that behavior they do not reward it, is that it will stop. GROSS: I think a common problem that a lot of pet owners face is that, you know, they have, say, a cat and they want to also adopt another cat or a dog or they have a new baby that's about to arrive, and you have to acclimate the cat that you already have to the newcomer and vice versa. And you have a lot of suggestions for training the cat to deal with the new baby or the new animal that's coming to the house. Can you take us through some of those steps? ELLIS: Yeah, sure. So as humans, we're really naturally very, very sociable. We like extending our families, we like having - if we love cats, we want more cats. The cat doesn't see the world like that at all. Remember, it's evolved from a solitary animal. And so suddenly being asked to share its territory with somebody or something that's very unfamiliar to it can be a real - really quite stressful experience for a cat. So while we might welcome with open arms a new baby or a new cat, and we have an understanding that this already is a family member for us, the cat doesn't. For the cat, it's - the analogy would be like if a - you just came home from work and a stranger was sleeping in your bed. It's really quite a sort of freak-out situation. But when cats - they do have the ability to form social relationships with one another, and it really depends on the individual cat to what extent they can. The way that they do so and the way that they maintain those social relationships is very often through scent, through - they have very, very good sense of smell. And while we generally recognize our family members through sight and through the sound of their voices, for cats it will be through their - how they smell. So the first thing that we try to do when we're trying to introduce them to a new cat or a new baby, etc. , is to think about all those sensory information that that new being brings, particularly smell but also sight and sound and gradually introduce the cat to them over a slow period of time and in a way that the sensory elements are, in their first instance, quite dilute and then come right up to their sort of real level of what they are. GROSS: How do you introduce a new person's smell or a new animal's smell to a cat? ELLIS: OK, so we're going to use an example of a new cat. If we brought a new cat home from the shelter, we would want to keep it in a completely different part of the house from the resident cat, ideally a single room so that that new cat gets a chance to get used to one area that's not too big before we introduce it to other areas. And one of the first ways that we can introduce the two cats to each other's smell is simply by swapping the bedding, taking the bedding that they've been sleeping on, which will be heavily impregnated with their scent, and placing that in each other's territories, making sure that they still have some bedding of their own, as well 'cause, remember, they feel safe and secure when the area smells of them. Cats produce scent, which we cannot detect. Our noses are not strong enough to be able to - or good enough to be able to detect it. And then they also produce these chemicals known as pheromones that are species-specific. So we - they mean nothing to us. We cannot detect them. And they're produced from in between the toes, at the base of the tail, down the flanks but primarily around the face. So do you know under the chin, they love to be scratched and just behind the whiskers on the cheeks, and do you know those areas in front of their ears where there seems to be a lot less hair between the ears and the eyes? GROSS: Yeah. ELLIS: That area there is a very concentrated area where - of sebaceous glands that produce these facial pheromones, these specific chemicals that cats use to communicate with one another. So rubbing a cloth over these facial regions will impregnate that cloth with a scent of that individual cat which, if we smelt that cloth we would smell nothing, but if we put that into the environment of the other cat, they would very much be able to detect the presence of another cat there. GROSS: And you also have pictures of how you trained your cat at home to accept a second cat. So you have both cats in walled-off spaces but in the same room. So, like, there's some kind of, like, little fence between them or their own - they're each in their own little crates. So they're in the same room, but they're completely protected from each other so that they learn to acclimate to each other without fear of being attacked. ELLIS: Yeah, so once they've got used to the smell of each other and they've heard each other and they're happy with all those things, then we would physically introduce them so that they could see each other. And by this stage, they should be able to recognize each other by smell. So it shouldn't be like, oh, my goodness, who is this creature in my house because they've already smelt this animal and they'll match the smell. But as a safety measure, we would always make sure that they can't physically interact at the beginning beyond just a nose-to-nose greeting. When cats tend to meet each other, they do so by sniffing each other at their noses. And then if they're - if they are well-known to one another and part of the same familial group, they may go on to then facial rub. But for cats, when we're introducing them to each other, a nose-to-nose touch or sniff is simply enough that that's all we would be really looking for with no agonistic or hostile behaviors. And so they're able to do this through a barrier, through a mesh door or through a baby gate. But we've prevented the opportunity for any hostile behavior in the eventuality that it did occur because we know from scientific study that if at the first true meeting, cats fight, then the chances of us being able to get those cats to live together is really, really difficult. And the first meeting is really crucial. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Sarah Ellis. She's a cat behavior specialist and co-author of the new book, \"The Trainable Cat. \" Let's take a short break here, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is cat behavior specialist Sarah Ellis. She's co-author of the new book, \"The Trainable Cat,\" and she insists cats can be trained. A lot of people who have cats have problems with the cat urinating outside of the litter box, and that's an example - like, I have no clue how you would train a cat to not do that. ELLIS: Yeah, the - one of the things is people often think you have to teach a cat to use the litter tray or the litter box, and you don't. You don't have to teach kittens to use the litter box. When they feel a substance under their feet that's very fine and rakable, instinctively they will toilet on it. So the reasons that sometimes they don't use the litter box is because the litter box is not clean enough. Remember they have this really, really good sense of smell. And while we might not be able to smell the odors coming from it, the cats certainly can. Their noses are closer to the soiled litter and that they have this much better, much more acute sense of smell, and they're fastidious about being clean. So if that litter tray has not been - a litter box has not been scooped in the morning or in the evening, they might choose not to use it. Often, cat litters are designed with us as a consumer in mind rather than our cat, and they are not desirable to our cat in terms of the sensation they create on their feet. They might not be fine and rakable enough or we may place the litter box in an area that the cat doesn't feel is safe and secure. Lots of people put them in their basement next to their tumble dryer or their laundry machine or the washing machine. And for a cat, it's horrible to have that vibration or that noise right next to when they want to go to the bathroom. So these are some of the reasons that cats might not want to use the litter box. There is a whole other range of reasons that are medical related. And so we always, always advise, if your cat is not using the litter box, to make sure the first thing you do is to take it to the vet's. So it's not just a simple case of being able to train the cat to use the litter box, it's more that they instinctively know how to do that. It's just that the litter box provided to them is perhaps not desirable because of cleanliness, the substrate that's in it or its location or that it has to share it with another cat. And if those two cats in the home do not consider each other part of their same social group, then they were not going to share a toilet together. GROSS: You know, we're talking about, like, training cats and why that's good for the cat and good for the people. Cats, especially indoor cats, need exercise. And so play is not only, like, a fun activity for the cat and the person but it's also, like, really healthy for the cat. I sometimes wonder if my cat understands that he's engaged in a very Sisyphean activity because (laughter) once - (laughter) like, especially, like, with a laser toy, like, there's no way you're going to actually capture that laser beam, you know? And even with, like, the feather toys - the wand feather toys - like, what do you do with it once you've captured it, you know? You play with it a while and then I'm going to whip it around again and then you capture it again and then I'm going to whip it around again. You know what I'm saying? Like, do cats get frustrated by the ways we play with them? ELLIS: Yeah, they can. And I'll come onto that. But first of all, I think - I'm really pleased you brought up the subject of play 'cause for me, it's not an optional extra in cat ownership. It's not a fun thing to do if you have the time. It is as important as feeding them and providing them with a litter box. It's an absolute basic welfare need, particularly for cats that are indoor-only because the cat, as it's evolved and as we've domesticated it and even as we've selectively bred it and got these pedigree cats, we've never selected to get rid of the predatory behavior and the hunting behavior. And so they still have this desire to perform predatory behavior. And in the wild, they would hunt, you know, approximately 10 times a day. So you imagine they've got this instinct to do this behavior, but in an indoor-only environment, they've got no outlet for it. So really for welfare point of view, we have to offer the cat an appropriate outlet and play is a brilliant, brilliant way of doing that because when they play, they're using exactly the same predatory behaviors. The idea that play could be frustrating for a cat really comes from the idea that we are not allowing the cat to express - or an opportunity to do all of the different predatory behaviors. So if you're chasing a laser beam - a little laser light that's produced from a little box or your cat is chasing feathers on the end of a wand - the chase is only one element of the predatory sequence. There is the locate, the stalk, the stare, the chase, the pounce, which is part of the capture, the killing bite and the consume. And so it's important that we, during play and during feeding, we provide opportunity for all of these behaviors, then we're much, much, much less likely to cause any form of frustration. I think we find it quite amusing when we're playing with cats to make sure that the cat actually can catch the toy that we're playing with it if it's a feathers on a wand because then they do these beautiful acrobatics for us as they attempt to catch it. GROSS: Exactly, yes (laughter). ELLIS: But it's so, so important we let them catch it because that is the reward, not every time. Remember this sort of intermittent reinforcement. They wouldn't catch a mouse every time they hunted. They wouldn't be that good, but we need to think - or (unintelligible) to ourselves when playing with cats let them catch it now and again, especially when we end a play session. End on a session where they're allowed to capture it and really have a good chew and bite at it. GROSS: So sometimes what's frustrating for the person is if the cat obviously really wants to play and you get out the wand toy and you start kind of flipping it around, and the cat is spending like minutes just kind of watching it intently, and it's like come on play. GROSS: Do something (laughter). ELLIS: Yeah. So quite often what's happening there is that the owner is making the pretend prey so the feathers on the end of the wand behave in an unrealistic way that a prey item would not normally. So I've never seen a mouse, for example, you know, fly through the air doing 360 degrees. ELLIS: But yet we expect our cats to chase that and capture that. So it's about teaching owners to make sure that a toy on the end of that wand mimics what a mouse or a bird would do. And then you'll find that the cat really gets engaged, and the more they're allowed to capture it - remember they've been rewarded for that behavior - the more they'll think this is achievable. I can capture this pretend mouse or pretend bird. But to them, it probably feels real at that moment in time. I'm going to have a shot at going for this one because it's within my ream, so it's just about adjusting our expectations a little bit. GROSS: Sarah Ellis, it's been great to talk with you. Thank you so much. ELLIS: Thank you. It's been a pleasure.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: You're losing so badly. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: You know, people are actually watching this at home. TRUMP: . . . You don't know what happening. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Gentlemen, gentlemen. TED CRUZ: Well, if I'm going to ask them. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We've got to stop this. CRUZ: . . . I've got to not be deducted when he's yelling at me. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Take control. VEDANTAM: Cacophony and discord. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) Hillary, Hillary, Hillary. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: (Unintelligible). Shut up. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: They are sitting in clusters of Bernie delegates and Hillary delegates. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: You cheated. VEDANTAM: But beneath the rancor, something else is at work. Deep inside the brain, hidden assumptions and frames are shaping the way we think about politics. To understand these forces, we need to step away from the daily barrage of punches and a counter-punches. We begin 30 miles from the White House, on a small farm in Dunkirk, MD. Tom Bonds is finishing up for the day. TOM BARNES: The was one horse I used to do named Refugee. VEDANTAM: He's a farrier, which means he trims and shoes horses' hooves all day long. BARNES: It's funny. It doesn't really look like a lot of work, but when you're under there (laughter). . . VEDANTAM: Tom likes to be outside, be his own boss, shape his own future. He believes in hardwork, self-reliance, personal responsibility. And these qualities have shaped his political views. BARNES: Fiscally and internationally conservative - not hard right, but conservative. VEDANTAM: Tom would never take on too much household debt, and he wants his country to run like his home. BARNES: I'm real simple when it comes to these kinds of things, and I don't think people should take on more debt than they would be able to repay. And if they can't, I - you know, I think that there should be consequences for that. And I think that the country is no different - that we should not take on debt that we can't repay. VEDANTAM: When he thinks of what ails America, Tom returns to a model of how a family should operate. BARNES: It's something I've been saying for the last seven and a half years, is that America needs stricter parents. And I truly do feel that way. It goes back to my example earlier of the household budget not getting to a point where they can no longer service their debt. Well, as a country, it's the same type of values that we need to get back to. We need to start being stricter parents. VEDANTAM: Hundreds of miles away, in an urban school district in Indiana, a young high school English teacher has a different perspective shaped by her own values. KATE BURKETT: The school district that I'm in, the specific school that I teach at is a 73-percent free-and-reduced-lunch school. And also, we are a minority majority school, where we are 34 percent white students. VEDANTAM: Kate Burkett doesn't just think government-supported lunch programs are useful, she knows it. BURKETT: I think I've just seen what can be done with government money, kind of putting a face to - you know, you hear all these statistics about, oh, it's a free-and-reduced-lunch school, but I don't think about it like that. I know these kids, and I've known them for years. And I've seen the good that they go on to do in the world, and it's worth it. It's worth the investment. VEDANTAM: Tom and Kate have good reasons to believe what they do. They're reasonable people with deeply held convictions. But put millions of Toms and millions of Kates together, and what you see isn't reasonable disagreement. Increasingly, Democrats and Republicans can't comprehend the other's point of view. It's not just the current campaign. Beyond the noise of the contest between Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton lies a gulf of distrust and misunderstanding. How did we get to a divide that feels so unbridgeable? Here's one theory - what if a driving force behind our political preferences is something we're not even aware of? MARTI GONZALES: They're like unconscious ideologies, in a way. That is, they're beliefs or convictions that we hold that are non-consciously held but nonetheless influence the way we interpret the world. VEDANTAM: Today's show - the hidden moral frameworks that shape our politics. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: One night decades ago, George Lakoff began a quest. He was listening to speeches from a gathering of conservative politicians. They were blasting the idea that people who worked hard to earn more money should pay more in taxes. GEORGE LAKOFF: And everybody there clapped and, you know - you know, waved their arms, waved their signs, et cetera. VEDANTAM: The conservatives were making a moral argument. To George, it seems self-evidently wrong. But to the cheering conservatives, it seems self-evidently right. George asked himself how two people could look at the same issue and draw such radically different conclusions. In 1994, it happened again. George had a sense that the people on the other side of the aisle were from another planet. This time it was Republican Newt Gingrich talking. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NEWT GINGRICH: Think of America as a giant family of 260 million people of extraordinarily diverse backgrounds riding in a huge car down the highway. VEDANTAM: Newt Gingrich was hocking his Contract with America. He warned that the tires of the family car were blowing out. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GINGRICH: America is in trouble and our trouble extends beyond the White House. VEDANTAM: Newt Gingrich offered an ambitious package of policies that covered a range of traditional conservative issues. As he listened, George started thinking about the whole Republican platform. He decided it was an incoherent mess. LAKOFF: What does the flat tax have to do with environmental regulations? What does that have to do with owning guns? You know, and what does the death penalty have to do with being pro-life? All of those things seemed strange to me. VEDANTAM: Republicans looking at the Democratic platform might say the very same thing. George looked at his own bewilderment with curiosity. This feeling of utter incomprehension is an experience widely shared by people on both sides of the aisle. How could it be, he asked himself, that millions of Americans firmly believe that the views of millions of other Americans are incoherent. As George tried to figure out what was going on, something popped in his head. It seemed tangential, but he thought it might be a clue. We heard it in something Newt Gingrich just said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GINGRICH: Think of America as a giant family of 260 million people. VEDANTAM: That's a metaphor. George Lakoff, as it happens, is a cognitive linguist and an expert on metaphors. One of the things he's discovered is that metaphors are far more powerful than most people think. They aren't just figures of speech, but ways to organize how we see the world. George started to wonder about this metaphor of the country as a family. Did it have something to do with the mutual incomprehension that Democrats and Republicans feel toward one another? The moment this notion occurred to him, he started seeing examples everywhere. LAKOFF: We have a metaphor that the nation is a family. We have Founding Fathers. We send our sons and daughters to war. We have Homeland Security. We don't want missiles in our backyard - and so on and so on. And the idea then occurred to me that, if that's the case, if you have two different views of the nation, you may have two different views of the family. So I worked backwards. I took the two different views of the nation, worked backwards through the metaphor, and out popped two different views of the family. VEDANTAM: In other words, if both Republicans and Democrats think of the nation as a kind of family but have very different assumptions on how a family ought to work, could those assumptions be behind our seemingly irreconcilable differences? On its surface, the idea that the way we think about family can shape the way we think about politics is crazy. This is where George Lakoff's earlier work on metaphors comes in. Metaphors are powerful precisely because they operate on a largely unconscious level. They are the lens through which we see the world, but most of the time we don't realize they're even there. Think again about our farrier, Tom Barnes, and what he wants for the country. BARNES: America needs stricter parents. GONZALES: They're like unconscious ideologies, in a way. That is, they're beliefs or convictions that we hold that are non-consciously held but nonetheless influence the way we interpret the world. VEDANTAM: This is Marti Gonzales. She's a psychologist who's done her own research on George Lakoff's theories about how the way we think about families can shape our political views. George and Marti think that most Americans embrace one of two different models of family. Now, these are generalizations, and they have lots of exceptions, but let's start with the basic models. One is what they call the strict-father model. GONZALES: The strict-father family, the parents in that family tend to view the world as a really complex and dangerous and unfriendly place. LAKOFF: It's tough love. In the strict-father family, the father knows best. The father knows right from wrong. And the job of the father is not just to support and protect the family, but also, with respect to children, is to teach them right from wrong so that they have the right moral views. GONZALES: Competition, of course, is a good thing from the point of view of strict-father families because success at competition rewards people for the strength and the tenacity, the self-discipline and the self-reliance that enabled a person to succeed. VEDANTAM: Now, I think the term strict father feels a little outdated. I might call it a strict-parent family since one or both parents might have this parenting style. Strict parents who love their children believe it would be wrong to send them out into a dangerous world unprepared for what it has in store for them. Strict parents believe they need to make their children tough and self-reliant. GONZALES: So the central metaphor of the strict-father family is what is good is what is strong. VEDANTAM: Again, our farrier, Tom Barnes. BARNES: I'm a firm believer that, when America is strong, the world is a safe place. And I don't think in the last seven and a half years we've - we've really stood by that. I think we've tried to be more of one of the gang than someone that our allies can count on and that our enemies respect. And I don't want to see that go any further than it already has. VEDANTAM: There is another model of how to be a good parent. George and Marti call the style nurturant. I think of these parents as empathetic parents. They believe that nurture, empathy and trust, these are the tools that help children grow into their fullest selves. The goal of this kind of parent. . . GONZALES: Is to rear children who are happy and self-fulfilled. LAKOFF: Their job is to empathize with their child, to know what their child needs, to have open, two-way discussions with their child. GONZALES: They have to develop a set of kind of values along the way or beliefs along the way, among them that we, as a society, benefit when people are willing to care for, support and nurture other people. VEDANTAM: Our teacher, Kate Burkett, exemplifies this thinking when it comes to the children in her care. BURKETT: I think it's the right thing to take care of people. I just do. I don't - maybe that's the Catholic upbringing in me, but just that's - it's right to take care of people that need it. VEDANTAM: We'll get to the evidence for George and Marti's theory about how our views of the family can shape our political outlook, but I have to say, this idea has immense intuitive appeal. The earliest experience all of us have with authority and leadership is within the family. LAKOFF: You are first governed in your family. And so we arise - arrive at metaphors in which we - and they're unconscious metaphors - in which governing institutions are families. VEDANTAM: This was a pivotal moment in George's search for understanding. If people see families as governing bodies and governing bodies playing the role of parents, isn't it possible they use their own family and upbringing as an unconscious model of how government ought to work? Marti decided to test George's hypothesis that unconscious parenting models show up all the time in our nation's politics. She and her team analyzed all the presidential political ads that have played on daytime and primetime TV, going all the way back to 1980. She had research assistants listen to the ads and code them according to whether they had underlying metaphors that spoke to the idea of the strict parent and the empathetic parent. BURKETT: The bottom line is, Professor George Lakoff was right (laughter). VEDANTAM: Now, to be clear, lots of the ads were simply one candidate attacking the other. Many of them talked about issues in the news. But a significant number made appeals to voters' unconscious moral frameworks, drawing on the themes of the strict and empathetic parent. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Jimmy Carter still doesn't know that it takes strong leadership to keep the peace. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FORMER PRES GEORGE W. BUSH: I believe we need to encourage personal responsibility so people are accountable for their actions. BURKETT: Republicans were much more likely to rely on strict-father ideas to make their points to persuade voters. Democrats were much more likely to use nurturant-parent ideas. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: I don't think Reagan showed enough compassion for the people of California. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Told the insurance company don't do this. Don't cut this child's coverage. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Al Gore got the Malone family the help they needed. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FORMER VICE PRES WALTER MONDALE: We believe in a solid, just, compassionate, hopeful future. VEDANTAM: Now, these are broad archetypes, of course. Parents can be both strict and empathetic. Parents can disagree with one another about the importance of rules and structure. But as we grow up, these models, both based on love, both based on the certainty that this is the best way to raise kids, shape the way many of us see the world. From the moment George and Marti described how Republicans and Democrats draw on different parenting models, I started to see examples of this everywhere. Here's an ad from the Trump campaign, featuring the voice of his son, Donald Trump Jr. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP JR: Well, a lot of people think of my father as a tough guy. And in many respects, he is. Growing up, my brother, sister and I had to really know what we were talking about before bringing him any kind of proposal. He may be a little less tough on his grandchildren right now, but it's that toughness that I want renegotiating trade deals with China and Mexico. It's that toughness that I want keeping me and my family and your family safe. My father will make an incredible president. VEDANTAM: And here's an ad from Hillary Clinton. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HILLARY CLINTON: When I think about why I'm doing this, I think about my mother, Dorothy. She was abandoned by her parents at the age of 8, sent from Chicago to LA to live with grandparents who didn't want her. But people showed her kindness, gave her a chance, like the teacher who saw my mother had no money for food and started bringing her extra from home, whispering, you know, Dorothy, I just brought too much food today. She went to work in somebody else's home at age 14, and it opened her eyes. For the first time, she saw parents who loved and cared for their children. And that's the kind of loving family she provided for us. When she needed a champion, someone was there. I think about all the Dorothys all over America who fight for their families, who never give up. That's why I'm doing this. That's why I've always done this - for all the Dorothys. VEDANTAM: Are you feeling a lump in your throat? If so, it might be because you have an empathetic model of parenting at the back of your head. On the other hand, if the ad sounded like sentimental coddling and you are drawn more to the Trump ad, it might be because your model of the family is built around the idea of a strict parent. I asked Marti to play a little game with me and imagine how people who disagree with Trump and Clinton might see an ad put out by the other side. How would a strict parent view that Clinton ad about her mother? GONZALES: Here's all this mushy stuff about feelings and taking care of people. And when you take care of people, of course, you know, you're undermining their self-reliance, and you're not doing them any good. And in this dangerous world, we don't need a person who can empathize with our enemies or find common ground with our enemies. We need someone strong enough to stand up and protect us from them. VEDANTAM: And here's a hypothetical voter with the empathetic parent model on the trumpet. GONZALES: Well, if Donald Trump thinks that, to govern, the only thing he needs is toughness and strength, we're in for a bumpy ride. Once people start governing, being tough isn't going to be enough. You need to be open to new ideas. You need to be open to the idea of cooperating with people across the aisle. VEDANTAM: It's interesting that this is the cartoon version that each side has of the other, that each side - separate from Clinton and Trump - sort of the division - the partisan division that we have in the country is very much this division where many progressives think of conservatives as being heartless, cruel people. GONZALES: If not Neanderthals, you know? VEDANTAM: Yeah, and many conservatives think of progressives as just being brain dead. GONZALES: (Laughter). Right, right. And the sad thing is these kinds of ads get people riled up and more willing to embrace more strongly the moral foundations of their political ideology, such that when elections are over and the process of governing begins, you have citizens on the one hand who still can't pull together, you know, across the ideological divide. And you certainly have mandates from these citizens to send their representatives to Washington not to negotiate, not to give in to the silly strict-father or the silly nurturant-parent orientations of our elected leaders. VEDANTAM: When people draw on moral frameworks that we don't share, what they say can seem incomprehensible. LAKOFF: And what happens when you hear things that don't make sense - there are various things you can do about it. One, you can just not hear it. It doesn't make any sense. You can ignore it. You can ridicule it, saying, hey, this doesn't make any sense. They're stupid people. They're dumb. They're mean. They're cruel - whatever. Or you can - if it's threatening, you can attack them. And very often there's an attack. So all of those things are happening in our politics right now, and they're normal. You would expect them to happen, given the way that people's brains work and given the fact that we have alternative worldviews. But the idea that we have alternative worldviews is not in our public discourse. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: To be sure, there are plenty of exceptions to this model of how we come to our political views. Race, religion, immigration, class, gender all play a role in shaping our politics. George Lakoff and Marti Gonzalez's ideas don't displace everything else we know about how politics works, but it's a point of view you might not have considered. Even within this theory, there's room for nuance and complexity. A person may have both strict and empathetic parenting models to guide them. They can follow one model at home and another at work. You can certainly find Republican ads that feature empathy and Democratic ads that project strength. Unconscious moral frameworks don't explain everything, but they do explain some things that otherwise seem inexplicable. LAKOFF: How you understand your world and what you're supposed to be doing and who you respect and who you don't respect and what you want to do in your life and so on - and how you understand everything around you. VEDANTAM: So here's one way to think about this political season - the nation is in the middle of a parenting dispute. Each side feels the other is on the wrong path, and so much is at stake. GONZALES: Parents who adhere to one or another conception of the ideal family want what's good for their children, and they parent in ways that they believe - firmly believe, with love in their hearts - that will most benefit their children in this complex world. VEDANTAM: Like two parents who love their child but can get along with each other, our political parties each believe they have the right answer to what the country needs. All of us feel bewildered that policies that seem so self-evidently correct to us are rejected by the other side. Understandably, we explain these differences by pointing fingers and questioning each other's motives. The truth is much harder. What fuels our inflexible certainty isn't stupidity or callousness. It's love. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This episode of HIDDEN BRAIN was produced by Jenny Schmidt, Maggie Penman and Chris Benderev. It was edited by Tara Boyle.

How could it be, he asked himself, that millions of Americans firmly believe that the views of millions of other Americans are incoherent. As George tried to figure out what was going on, something popped in his head. It seemed tangential, but he thought it might be a clue. We heard it in something Newt Gingrich just said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GINGRICH: Think of America as a giant family of 260 million people. VEDANTAM: That's a metaphor. George Lakoff, as it happens, is a cognitive linguist and an expert on metaphors. One of the things he's discovered is that metaphors are far more powerful than most people think. They aren't just figures of speech, but ways to organize how we see the world. George started to wonder about this metaphor of the country as a family. Did it have something to do with the mutual incomprehension that Democrats and Republicans feel toward one another? The moment this notion occurred to him, he started seeing examples everywhere. LAKOFF: We have a metaphor that the nation is a family. We have Founding Fathers. We send our sons and daughters to war. We have Homeland Security. We don't want missiles in our backyard - and so on and so on. And the idea then occurred to me that, if that's the case, if you have two different views of the nation, you may have two different views of the family. So I worked backwards. I took the two different views of the nation, worked backwards through the metaphor, and out popped two different views of the family. VEDANTAM: In other words, if both Republicans and Democrats think of the nation as a kind of family but have very different assumptions on how a family ought to work, could those assumptions be behind our seemingly irreconcilable differences? On its surface, the idea that the way we think about family can shape the way we think about politics is crazy. This is where George Lakoff's earlier work on metaphors comes in. Metaphors are powerful precisely because they operate on a largely unconscious level. They are the lens through which we see the world, but most of the time we don't realize they're even there. Think again about our farrier, Tom Barnes, and what he wants for the country. BARNES: America needs stricter parents. GONZALES: They're like unconscious ideologies, in a way. That is, they're beliefs or convictions that we hold that are non-consciously held but nonetheless influence the way we interpret the world. VEDANTAM: This is Marti Gonzales. She's a psychologist who's done her own research on George Lakoff's theories about how the way we think about families can shape our political views. George and Marti think that most Americans embrace one of two different models of family. Now, these are generalizations, and they have lots of exceptions, but let's start with the basic models. One is what they call the strict-father model. GONZALES: The strict-father family, the parents in that family tend to view the world as a really complex and dangerous and unfriendly place. LAKOFF: It's tough love. In the strict-father family, the father knows best. The father knows right from wrong. And the job of the father is not just to support and protect the family, but also, with respect to children, is to teach them right from wrong so that they have the right moral views. GONZALES: Competition, of course, is a good thing from the point of view of strict-father families because success at competition rewards people for the strength and the tenacity, the self-discipline and the self-reliance that enabled a person to succeed. VEDANTAM: Now, I think the term strict father feels a little outdated. I might call it a strict-parent family since one or both parents might have this parenting style. Strict parents who love their children believe it would be wrong to send them out into a dangerous world unprepared for what it has in store for them. Strict parents believe they need to make their children tough and self-reliant. GONZALES: So the central metaphor of the strict-father family is what is good is what is strong. VEDANTAM: Again, our farrier, Tom Barnes. BARNES: I'm a firm believer that, when America is strong, the world is a safe place. And I don't think in the last seven and a half years we've - we've really stood by that. I think we've tried to be more of one of the gang than someone that our allies can count on and that our enemies respect. And I don't want to see that go any further than it already has. VEDANTAM: There is another model of how to be a good parent. George and Marti call the style nurturant. I think of these parents as empathetic parents. They believe that nurture, empathy and trust, these are the tools that help children grow into their fullest selves. The goal of this kind of parent. . . GONZALES: Is to rear children who are happy and self-fulfilled. LAKOFF: Their job is to empathize with their child, to know what their child needs, to have open, two-way discussions with their child. GONZALES: They have to develop a set of kind of values along the way or beliefs along the way, among them that we, as a society, benefit when people are willing to care for, support and nurture other people. VEDANTAM: Our teacher, Kate Burkett, exemplifies this thinking when it comes to the children in her care. BURKETT: I think it's the right thing to take care of people. I just do. I don't - maybe that's the Catholic upbringing in me, but just that's - it's right to take care of people that need it. VEDANTAM: We'll get to the evidence for George and Marti's theory about how our views of the family can shape our political outlook, but I have to say, this idea has immense intuitive appeal. The earliest experience all of us have with authority and leadership is within the family. LAKOFF: You are first governed in your family. And so we arise - arrive at metaphors in which we - and they're unconscious metaphors - in which governing institutions are families. VEDANTAM: This was a pivotal moment in George's search for understanding. If people see families as governing bodies and governing bodies playing the role of parents, isn't it possible they use their own family and upbringing as an unconscious model of how government ought to work? Marti decided to test George's hypothesis that unconscious parenting models show up all the time in our nation's politics. She and her team analyzed all the presidential political ads that have played on daytime and primetime TV, going all the way back to 1980. She had research assistants listen to the ads and code them according to whether they had underlying metaphors that spoke to the idea of the strict parent and the empathetic parent. BURKETT: The bottom line is, Professor George Lakoff was right (laughter). VEDANTAM: Now, to be clear, lots of the ads were simply one candidate attacking the other. Many of them talked about issues in the news. But a significant number made appeals to voters' unconscious moral frameworks, drawing on the themes of the strict and empathetic parent. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Jimmy Carter still doesn't know that it takes strong leadership to keep the peace. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FORMER PRES GEORGE W. BUSH: I believe we need to encourage personal responsibility so people are accountable for their actions. BURKETT: Republicans were much more likely to rely on strict-father ideas to make their points to persuade voters. Democrats were much more likely to use nurturant-parent ideas. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: I don't think Reagan showed enough compassion for the people of California. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Told the insurance company don't do this. Don't cut this child's coverage. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Al Gore got the Malone family the help they needed. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FORMER VICE PRES WALTER MONDALE: We believe in a solid, just, compassionate, hopeful future. VEDANTAM: Now, these are broad archetypes, of course. Parents can be both strict and empathetic. Parents can disagree with one another about the importance of rules and structure. But as we grow up, these models, both based on love, both based on the certainty that this is the best way to raise kids, shape the way many of us see the world. From the moment George and Marti described how Republicans and Democrats draw on different parenting models, I started to see examples of this everywhere. Here's an ad from the Trump campaign, featuring the voice of his son, Donald Trump Jr. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP JR: Well, a lot of people think of my father as a tough guy. And in many respects, he is. Growing up, my brother, sister and I had to really know what we were talking about before bringing him any kind of proposal. He may be a little less tough on his grandchildren right now, but it's that toughness that I want renegotiating trade deals with China and Mexico. It's that toughness that I want keeping me and my family and your family safe. My father will make an incredible president. VEDANTAM: And here's an ad from Hillary Clinton. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: When I think about why I'm doing this, I think about my mother, Dorothy. She was abandoned by her parents at the age of 8, sent from Chicago to LA to live with grandparents who didn't want her. But people showed her kindness, gave her a chance, like the teacher who saw my mother had no money for food and started bringing her extra from home, whispering, you know, Dorothy, I just brought too much food today. She went to work in somebody else's home at age 14, and it opened her eyes. For the first time, she saw parents who loved and cared for their children. And that's the kind of loving family she provided for us. When she needed a champion, someone was there. I think about all the Dorothys all over America who fight for their families, who never give up. That's why I'm doing this. That's why I've always done this - for all the Dorothys. VEDANTAM: Are you feeling a lump in your throat? If so, it might be because you have an empathetic model of parenting at the back of your head. On the other hand, if the ad sounded like sentimental coddling and you are drawn more to the Trump ad, it might be because your model of the family is built around the idea of a strict parent. I asked Marti to play a little game with me and imagine how people who disagree with Trump and Clinton might see an ad put out by the other side. How would a strict parent view that Clinton ad about her mother? GONZALES: Here's all this mushy stuff about feelings and taking care of people. And when you take care of people, of course, you know, you're undermining their self-reliance, and you're not doing them any good. And in this dangerous world, we don't need a person who can empathize with our enemies or find common ground with our enemies. We need someone strong enough to stand up and protect us from them. VEDANTAM: And here's a hypothetical voter with the empathetic parent model on the trumpet. GONZALES: Well, if Donald Trump thinks that, to govern, the only thing he needs is toughness and strength, we're in for a bumpy ride. Once people start governing, being tough isn't going to be enough. You need to be open to new ideas. You need to be open to the idea of cooperating with people across the aisle. VEDANTAM: It's interesting that this is the cartoon version that each side has of the other, that each side - separate from Clinton and Trump - sort of the division - the partisan division that we have in the country is very much this division where many progressives think of conservatives as being heartless, cruel people. GONZALES: If not Neanderthals, you know? VEDANTAM: Yeah, and many conservatives think of progressives as just being brain dead. GONZALES: (Laughter). Right, right. And the sad thing is these kinds of ads get people riled up and more willing to embrace more strongly the moral foundations of their political ideology, such that when elections are over and the process of governing begins, you have citizens on the one hand who still can't pull together, you know, across the ideological divide. And you certainly have mandates from these citizens to send their representatives to Washington not to negotiate, not to give in to the silly strict-father or the silly nurturant-parent orientations of our elected leaders. VEDANTAM: When people draw on moral frameworks that we don't share, what they say can seem incomprehensible. LAKOFF: And what happens when you hear things that don't make sense - there are various things you can do about it. One, you can just not hear it. It doesn't make any sense. You can ignore it. You can ridicule it, saying, hey, this doesn't make any sense. They're stupid people. They're dumb. They're mean. They're cruel - whatever. Or you can - if it's threatening, you can attack them. And very often there's an attack. So all of those things are happening in our politics right now, and they're normal. You would expect them to happen, given the way that people's brains work and given the fact that we have alternative worldviews. But the idea that we have alternative worldviews is not in our public discourse. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: To be sure, there are plenty of exceptions to this model of how we come to our political views. Race, religion, immigration, class, gender all play a role in shaping our politics. George Lakoff and Marti Gonzalez's ideas don't displace everything else we know about how politics works, but it's a point of view you might not have considered. Even within this theory, there's room for nuance and complexity. A person may have both strict and empathetic parenting models to guide them. They can follow one model at home and another at work. You can certainly find Republican ads that feature empathy and Democratic ads that project strength. Unconscious moral frameworks don't explain everything, but they do explain some things that otherwise seem inexplicable. LAKOFF: How you understand your world and what you're supposed to be doing and who you respect and who you don't respect and what you want to do in your life and so on - and how you understand everything around you. VEDANTAM: So here's one way to think about this political season - the nation is in the middle of a parenting dispute. Each side feels the other is on the wrong path, and so much is at stake. GONZALES: Parents who adhere to one or another conception of the ideal family want what's good for their children, and they parent in ways that they believe - firmly believe, with love in their hearts - that will most benefit their children in this complex world. VEDANTAM: Like two parents who love their child but can get along with each other, our political parties each believe they have the right answer to what the country needs. All of us feel bewildered that policies that seem so self-evidently correct to us are rejected by the other side. Understandably, we explain these differences by pointing fingers and questioning each other's motives. The truth is much harder. What fuels our inflexible certainty isn't stupidity or callousness. It's love. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This episode of HIDDEN BRAIN was produced by Jenny Schmidt, Maggie Penman and Chris Benderev. It was edited by Tara Boyle.

The floods that hit Louisiana last month were caused by rainfall unlike anything seen there in centuries. A half a year's worth of rain fell in southern Louisiana in a few days, and a lot of the flooding was in unexpected places. As NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, scientists suspect a changing climate could make that more common. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: When nature throws a haymaker, you can depend on the Weather Channel to provide a vivid analysis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Wrap your head around this 30-inch rainfall totals, 30-inch rainfall totals. Louisiana hasn't gotten punched in the gut. JOYCE: Thirty inches in just three days, the kind of cataclysm that some might call an act of God. NICHOLAS PINTER: Our experience is that these kind of - call them acts-of-God explanations are served up just a little too easily. JOYCE: Nicholas Pinter is a geologist at the University of California, Davis and a flood expert. He says while there have always been super downpours, they're not so rare anymore. PINTER: Hundred-year floods, other large events are occurring bigger and more frequently than the published probabilities predict. JOYCE: And they're inundating places that usually haven't flooded. In Louisiana, for example, satellite photos show that about a third of the flooding was outside the flood plain. The flood plain is the area that historically gets inundated by big floods, once-in-a-century floods. Pinter says he needs more hard evidence to prove it, but it appears that these kinds of floods are on the rise. PINTER: Maybe we're seeing a different character of flood event beginning to appear, more like a climate-driven flash flood event affecting these big river systems which might be a new and different phenomenon that we need to throw into the statistics, maybe. JOYCE: A heavy rain, for example, that flashes down onto urban areas and just overwhelms sewers and drains. Paul Osman agrees. Osman is the floodplain manager for the state of Illinois. He calls these sudden deluges drainage events. They aren't necessarily caused by rivers rising over their banks. PAUL OSMAN: We found that 90 percent of our damages in Illinois are not traditional overland flow damages, but rather heavy rainfall events that cause basements to backfill with water. JOYCE: Osman says between 2007 and 2014, almost all the flood damage in urban Illinois occurred outside of traditional floodplains. OSMAN: There's no doubt all the scientific evidence points at those rainfalls - are changing. We're having a lot more of these kind of intense short-duration storms that happen in relatively small geographic areas like Louisiana. JOYCE: That's consistent with what climate scientists have been predicting. A warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor and can create bigger, more intense storms. And the federal government's latest Climate Assessment notes that extreme downpours are rising in parts of the U. S. Osman says many drainage systems just can't handle these intense storms. OSMAN: Most of those storm sewer designs were built on, you know, historic records and historic rainfall events that are no longer the case. JOYCE: If historic rainfall data no longer hold true, that's a problem for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA draws up maps that show where floodplains are. People with federally-backed mortgages in the highest-risk areas have to get flood insurance. People outside those areas don't. Kathleen Schaefer spent 10 years drawing flood maps at FEMA. She says FEMA only looked back at historical rainfall data, not forward at what a changing climate may bring. KATHLEEN SCHAEFER: You had to ignore climate change. All of the mapping had to be based on the existing conditions. JOYCE: Schaefer says local flood managers have begun to suspect that existing conditions have changed and that FEMA's flood maps may be out of date. But if they come to Washington, D. C. , looking for help, they have to mince their words. SCHAEFER: They can't even use the word climate change. They call it a slow-moving disaster which is sort of a code word for climate change. JOYCE: Recently, though, FEMA has begun to consider climate change in its flood analyses. But the agency only updates its flood insurance maps every five years, and the weather may be changing faster than that. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

Here's an assumption that seems pretty safe. If something feels more risky, we are less likely to do it. Well, NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam is here to tell us why that might not be right. Shankar, it seems pretty intuitive. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: It does seem pretty intuitive, David. I was speaking with economist Jason Kerwin at the University of Minnesota. He wanted to test the idea that telling people that they are at risk would prompt them to take steps to protect themselves. Now, that rational approach is true most of the time, but there are some important exceptions. JASON KERWIN: Telling people that an activity is extremely risky can sometimes paradoxically cause them to be less safe. So it can scare them to death instead of scaring them straight. GREENE: OK. So he's talking about when people tell us not just that something is risky but something is really, really risky. That's when something strange happens. VEDANTAM: Exactly. So let's say you believe the risk of something bad happening to you is close to 100 percent. Rather than inducing a feeling that there's something that you can do to protect yourself, this may induce a sense of fatalism. You tell yourself the risk is so high, there's really nothing I can do to protect myself. Kerwin was recently in Malawi. This is a country in southern Africa where there's a very high prevalence of HIV infection. In southern Malawi, about 1 in 5 adults, 20 percent of the population, is HIV positive - staggering number. Kerwin observed that many adults, men in particular, believed their risk of HIV infection was close to 100 percent. They also believed, for example, that one act of sexual intercourse with an infected person was sure to give them HIV infection as well. Now, Malawi also happens to be a place where few of these men are actually practicing safe sex or changing their sexual behaviors, which led Kerwin to wonder whether the high sense of risk was leading to fatalism rather than leading people to take action to protect themselves. Here's Kerwin. KERWIN: Men, in particular, they don't bother with condoms or with avoiding risky partners because, based on their history, they're just really sure that they've already got HIV. GREENE: So how did they actually test this and decide that fatalism is really at play here? VEDANTAM: Well, Kerwin divided volunteers in Malawi into groups, and he gave one of the groups information about the actual risk of HIV infection, which was much lower than people thought it was. So if you have unprotected sex with an infected partner for a year, your risk of catching HIV may be around 10 percent. GREENE: Oh, not even close to the 100 percent that a lot of people were assuming. VEDANTAM: No, no. Now, it's still high, but it's much, much lower than many people believe. Kerwin found that people who believed their risk was lower than they previously had thought became more likely to practice safe sexual behaviors. In effect, they were thinking, OK. I'm not doomed. There's something that I can do that might help keep me safe. GREENE: So what does that mean if you're in the field of public health - you should be really careful not to make something seem too, too bleak? VEDANTAM: I think that's right. I mean, when we want to change behavior, we often present people with a fearful picture. Now that can be justified, but it really is important that the fear actually correspond with reality. If it doesn't, inducing fear can actually backfire and make the problem worse. GREENE: Interesting stuff, as always. Thanks, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Thanks, David. GREENE: Shankar Vedantam is NPR's social science correspondent, and he's also the host of a podcast that explores the unseen patterns in human behavior. It is called Hidden Brain. DAVID GREENE, HOST:   All right. Here's an assumption that seems pretty safe. If something feels more risky, we are less likely to do it.

I mean, when we want to change behavior, we often present people with a fearful picture. Now that can be justified, but it really is important that the fear actually correspond with reality. If it doesn't, inducing fear can actually backfire and make the problem worse. GREENE: Interesting stuff, as always. Thanks, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Thanks, David.

Welcome, and congratulations. MANU PRAKASH: Thank you. SIEGEL: I have now watched you and colleagues of yours on YouTube demonstrating the full scope. It's amazing. What was the inspiration for this? PRAKASH: I think as a as a tool maker and as a scientist, one of the things that I always struggle with is, how do I really bring experience of science outside the lab to a much broader community? I grew up in India. I've seen inspirational people all around the world. And one of the thought process was, how do you really make scientific tools as commonplace as pencils? So that was the seed of an idea, and then we've been working on this for many years. SIEGEL: Well, is the Foldscope now in use, and if so, what is it being used for? PRAKASH: So just to clarify, we make many different types of microscopes using this modality. And some of them are really designed for specific diseases, but many of the others are really designed to get you started to thinking about the microscopic scale. We built last year 50,000 of them in the lab and shipped them around the world to 130 countries. And you know, I think the joy of doing science is also just watching it evolve. And it's quite a pleasure and a humbling experience to see so many imaginative ways people actually use the tools far beyond what we had initially realized. And so it's as much about the community as it is about the tool itself, and we try to nurture this community as much as we can and encourage and engage anybody else who's listening to engage in that community. SIEGEL: Another invention of a different sort that you're credited with is a water computer. What is a water computer? What. . . PRAKASH: (Laughter). SIEGEL: What did you do? PRAKASH: It's exactly what you think it might be. It's a computer that's made out of water. You know, if you think of a computer, if you could watch every single electron running around, you would actually see that they interact with each other to lead to a certain outcome. So literally a water computer is essentially some amount of miniature plumbing and these hydrodynamic interactions between tiny drops of water that result to universal logic which is the basis of any computation. SIEGEL: The things that you study and the inventions that you've helped create suggest a very wide range of interest. For you, is there a way that they're all tied together? How do you describe your interests in a coherent, unified way? PRAKASH: (Laughter) I try not to. SIEGEL: (Laughter). PRAKASH: I think, you know, the common thread is curiosity for me personally. It's very important to me to be curious and explore my world in the best ways I can, but it's also important for me to pass that on to a much broader group of people. So some of my work focuses really on tools that could enable open-ended explorations in other people, and some of that is, you know - I use my own tools - is just my own explorations that result in projects that we then conceive and structure.

Well, there's now new social science research suggesting an unexpected source of support for this endeavor might be coming from a low-cost airline. To explain what we're talking about, we're joined, as we often are, by NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam. Hey, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So we're talking about an airline here that is funding research or what? VEDANTAM: Well, we're talking about Southwest Airlines. And no, this doesn't have to do with Southwest funding science as much as it does with Southwest simply doing what it does best, which is offer cheap fares between places. GREENE: OK. VEDANTAM: I was talking with Christian Catalini at MIT, and he told me that he is interested in the factors that influence whether scientists collaborate and what determines the quality of such collaborations. Some of his research grows out of personal experience. Catalini said that when it comes to collaborating with his colleagues Christian Fons-Rosen and Patrick Gaule, the geographic distance between them is often a big constraint. CHRISTIAN CATALINI: I'm at MIT, and so I'm in Cambridge. Christian is in Barcelona, and Patrick is in Prague. Especially when we were Ph. D. students, of course, the cost of the flight had a big impact on our decision to collaborate and spend time together. GREENE: Graduate students don't have all that much money. And so if they could get cheap flights, they could actually spend more time face to face and doing research together. VEDANTAM: And not just graduate students - young researchers as well. And previous research has shown that even though there are all kinds of ways for scientists to collaborate online and via technologies like Skype, it's really useful for them to be able to meet face to face and spend time together. So if one barrier to meetings among these far-flung teams is the cost of travel, lowering the cost of travel should increase collaboration. Catalini and his colleagues analyzed a massive data set of scientific performance and scientific collaboration in the United States, David. Specifically, they mapped out faculty members at U. S. universities studying chemistry. They eventually focused on a sample of 10,000 scientists, which included hundreds of pairs of collaborators. They measured what happens to collaboration between pairs of scientists before and after Southwest Airlines enters a region and starts flying routes between the two metro areas where the scientists are located. GREENE: Oh, wow. VEDANTAM: Now usually when Southwest enters a market, what happens is other airlines compete on these routes and fares drop dramatically. Here's Catalini again. CATALINI: We do see a substantial spike in collaboration when these cheaper fares become available. It's about a 50 percent spike. And what's interesting is that it's actually stronger when we control for quality. So the collaboration that were somewhat enabled by the cheaper fares doesn't seem to be lower quality collaborations. GREENE: So it doesn't seem to be lower quality collaboration when we have these cheaper fares. But you actually came in and talked, at one point, to us about when there's more geographic diversity, when people from different parts of the country are able to come together and collaborate, actually increases the quality of the science. Right? VEDANTAM: That's right. So this is research by Richard Freeman we talked about a few months ago, David. He found the greater the ethnic and geographic diversity of collaborators on scientific papers, the more likely the papers were to be cited by other scientists, which is one metric of the quality of the work. So making it easier for scientists in far-flung locations to spend time in one another's labs is probably a good thing for discovery. And in the long run, that's a good thing for all of us. GREENE: It's funny. I can already hear, like, the Southwest ad saying, like, you know, want to do some research? VEDANTAM: (Laughter). GREENE: Buy some tickets. But I guess it's - I mean, it's not just them. Once the fares are lower, I mean, all these airlines might be involved in what we're seeing here. VEDANTAM: Precisely, David. GREENE: OK.

Unless your owner's manual calls for premium, you are wasting your money. The association says that more than 16 million Americans buy premium even though their cars don't need it. And AAA has a new study that's found that premium does not improve performance or gas mileage in those cars. Greg\u00a0Brannon is the director of automotive engineering for AAA. Welcome to the program, Mr. Brannon. GREG\u00a0BRANNON: Thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: And first tell us what the difference is between high-octane premium gasoline and regular gasoline. BRANNON: Well, the difference is really related to its ability to prevent detonation or that knocking sound that you hear in the engine from time to time. Those of us that are old enough to remember cars that didn't have the advanced technology that they do today will remember a time when that was much more prevalent. But really, the higher the octane, the better the gasoline is at resisting that detonation or pre-ignition. SIEGEL: Well, tell us about the test you did to see what the effect is of premium gas. BRANNON: We used something called a chassis dynamometer, which are dyno for short, which is more or less a treadmill for a vehicle. And through some very specific tests following EPA guidelines as well as a wide-open throttle horsepower test, we were able to very scientifically quantify the difference - or in this case the lack of difference - in both performance, emissions and fuel economy as a result of placing premium in a vehicle that is only calling for regular fuel. SIEGEL: Why do you think so many people - more than 16 million people - spend extra money to buy premium if in fact there's no benefit, whatever to using it with a car that's not designed for premium gasoline. BRANNON: It's certainly an interesting question. And as the report notes, over $2 billion have been wasted annually on that practice. I think it comes down to simply the naming - premium. You put premium on the pump, and the consumers likely believe that it is a premium product over the others on - that they have available to them and therefore are making that selection. It may also have something to do with carry-over from a good time ago when cars weren't as advanced as they are today, and premium fuel may have helped with that spark, knock or detonation for those of us that are old enough to remember cars that did that regularly. SIEGEL: You would buy no-knock gasoline in that case, as they would be - it would be advertised as such. BRANNON: Exactly, exactly. SIEGEL: Well, Mr. Brannan, if over 16 million Americans have been overpaying at the pump, buying premium for cars that - for which there's no benefit in using premium gasoline, have they been doing any damage to their cars by using premium? BRANNON: They have not. The only damage is to their wallet. SIEGEL: Well, on that note, thank you very much, and happy cheaper motoring. BRANNON: (Laughter) Thank you.

But when I cross paths with Nashanta Williams out walking her dog, she says it's not like this in other parts of the city. NASHANTA WILLIAMS: I have been pulled over and been told that my car smells like marijuana and put on the sidewalk and had my vehicle searched. And I felt like they were - they were fishing. DEMBOSKY: This was about two years ago. Williams was driving in East Oakland down High Street - no joke. William says in those African-American neighborhoods, people get profiled. WILLIAMS: Back then, I drove a '94 Buick, so I think the stereotype falls into the play, too - old car, smells like weed. What has she got going on? Who is she with? DEMBOSKY: Defense attorney James Clark's office window looks down on the lake. He says this stop and smell practice happens across the state. In California, the smell of marijuana gives police probable cause to search someone's entire vehicle. So if cops find something bigger, like guns or stolen property, Clark says that can turn a traffic stop into a felony. JAMES CLARK: You can imagine that if you're trying to advance your career by searching cars along the freeway that this is a tool that would be difficult to resist passing up. DEMBOSKY: Both Clark and the Nashanta Williams are wondering if recreational pot gets legalized in California, could that be the end of this stop-and-smell practice? So Austin, that's what's on the minds of voters in California. Did policing change up there in Washington state? AUSTIN JENKINS, BYLINE: The short answer is yes, it did. And to get a sense of this, I went for a ride-along with a Washington State Patrol sergeant named Nate Hovinghoff. NATE HOVINGHOFF: We'll clear here, and we'll head down 205 and head east on 14. . . JENKINS: Sergeant Hovinghoff has been with the patrol for 11 years and works along the scenic Columbia River Gorge that divides Washington and Oregon, another state that recently legalized pot. HOVINGHOFF: Yeah, so prior to legalization, in Washington state, odor alone was enough to arrest. JENKINS: If Hovinghoff pulled over a vehicle, say, for speeding and smelled marijuana, that gave him license to investigate further. HOVINGHOFF: In my experience as a trooper, probably 90 percent of my felony arrests, they started with the odor of marijuana. JENKINS: But once pot was legalized in Washington state, the rules of engagement changed. HOVINGHOFF: Now when I stop a vehicle and I go up and I smell marijuana, if they're 21 years or over, it doesn't mean automatically a crime's occurred. JENKINS: So April, Hovinghoff says as long as the driver of the car is compliant with the law and not impaired - and that's key - it's basically, have a nice day. DEMBOSKY: Yeah, but folks like Nashanta Williams aren't convinced that it will go down like that in California. The state already has liberal marijuana laws, but Williams doesn't think everyone will get a fair shake if pot is formally legalized. WILLIAMS: What do I know will happen is they will use it as an in and probably try to harass whatever person of color is smoking because what is legal for one is not necessarily what's legal for all. DEMBOSKY: In fact, recent data from police stops in Oakland show that African-Americans are more likely than whites to be searched, handcuffed and arrested. JENKINS: And that question of disparity is very much in the minds of researchers who are tracking the effects of marijuana legalization. Mike Males is with the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice. He released a study earlier this year that's been widely cited. It shows that while marijuana arrests dropped dramatically in Washington state, African-Americans are still two times more likely to be arrested for marijuana-related offenses. MIKE MALES: So there's still a large racial discrepancy. It doesn't solve that. It does reduce the overall impact of marijuana arrest, but it doesn't change the racial discrepancy as much. JENKINS: The bottom line, says Males, who spoke via Skype, if one of the goals is to reduce marijuana-related arrests, then legalization appears to accomplish that. DEMBOSKY: But it sounds like he's also saying it's not going to resolve disparities in how the law is enforced or applied. For NPR News, I'm April Dembosky in Oakland, Calif. JENKINS: And I'm Austin Jenkins in Olympia, Wash. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Marijuana legalization is on the ballot in five states this year, but it's been legal in Washington and Colorado for four years. With voters in other states facing this choice, we wanted to look at how policing is changing in a state that legalized marijuana. Austin Jenkins of the Northwest News Network in Olympia, Wash. , and April Dembosky of member station KQED in San Francisco bring us this report.

Researchers in chemistry, physics and medicine sometimes need special glass tools for complex experiments, so they often sit down with a glassblower to sketch out designs. A school in New Jersey is trying to keep that tradition going with the country's only degree program in scientific glassblowing. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Out among the corn and soybean fields of southern New Jersey, there's a studio specializing in one of the most popular materials in a research lab. DENNIS BRIENING: It's clear. You can see what the experiments are doing. It holds no chemical history. WANG: Dennis Briening leads the scientific glassblowing program here at Salem Community College. BRIENING: And it can be shaped into any form you like. So whatever your imagination is, it can be made. WANG: And his students are learning how to make those tools for research universities and glass manufacturers right through these doors. BRIENING: Come on in (laughter). WANG: Across a row of glowing furnaces, about a dozen students hover over bright flames at their workbenches as they blow into glass tubes. Briening lights a torch himself, then holds a thin, hollow glass tube over the fire. BRIENING: So we're going to preheat at same time we're heating. And I like to see the orange coming off the flame. And that indicates how hot the glass is. WANG: How hot is this flame? BRIENING: That flame is right around 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. WANG: That's hot enough for the glass to bend like rubbery taffy. Briening slowly twists that glass tube into a candy cane shape. Then it morphs into a snake coil that looks machine-made. This is a craft with exacting requirements from scientists. Any mistakes in the glass could cause accidents and ruin an experiment. BRIENING: I always say a millimeter to a glassblower is a mile. Myself and a lot of glassblowers have made things where we have to hold one-thousandth of an inch in tolerance. WANG: That's thinner than human hair, which is about two- to three-thousandths of an inch. Besides patience with blueprints, professors here are teaching students how to get along with their tools. KATIE SEVERANCE: That was a backfire for sure. Is this torch, like, really angry? WANG: Katie Severance graduated with an associate degree from the program and now teaches classes here, where she says students quickly catch what some call the glass bug. SEVERANCE: Glass as a material is so captivating. It starts as a solid. You put it in fire. Everybody loves fire. and then it melts, and it's a liquid. And it's like a beautiful dance, working with the material, getting to know it. NEIL MESSINGER: I'm working on the shape called a yo-yo. WANG: Neil Messinger is spinning a glass bottle on a rotating glass lathe. A rubber blow hose sticks out of the corner of his mouth. He gently pushes air through glass that he's heating up with the blow torch he's gripping in his right hand. MESSINGER: It's fulfilling to me in the sense that I'm using my two hands to create something. I just love tangible objects, being able to say and hold something like, I made this. WANG: Messinger got a degree in advertising before joining the program. In between classes here, he's already working for a company that makes glass parts used for gas chromatography. But he says he eventually wants to make glass tools for labs working on cancer research. MESSINGER: My mother, she had a bout with breast cancer, and I just don't want people to have to go through that. I feel like in this day and age, cancer is something that shouldn't be heard of. WANG: One day, he hopes, cancer patients won't have to sit through radiation. And after he graduates in the spring, he says, maybe his scientific glassblowing can play some small part in making that day come sooner. Hansi Lo Wang, NPR News, Alloway, N. J.

Anna Waters has been thinking a lot about the perception of women in formal debates. She has been judged as a high school debater, and she's also served as a judge and coach. She's now a journalism student at Northwestern University and recently wrote about sexism in high school debate for The Washington Post, and she's here in the studio. Welcome to the program. ANNA WATERS: Thank you so much for having me. SHAPIRO: Give us some examples that you've seen of young women being judged at a debate in ways that male debater would not. WATERS: Well, a couple of different areas - one is with voice - some of the adjectives used to describe women's voices you don't really hear about men - so things like screechy or naggy or just in general annoying. The high-pitched tone of voice is often criticized. There are things about the way that women dress. Often whatever men wear to the debate round just doesn't really play a factor. SHAPIRO: You've never seen a man criticized for wearing the wrong tie or the wrong suit. WATERS: No, not really, and even when they're just, like, wearing khakis and kind of mailing it in, like, they never get criticism. But if a woman's skirt is too long or too short, if her heels are too high or she's just wearing flats, God forbid, those play factors when they obviously shouldn't. SHAPIRO: How much of what you write about having experienced in high school debate both as a debater and now as a coach applies to a presidential stage, particularly when Hillary Clinton has been on debate stages for years, has been in the public spotlight for decades? WATERS: Well, I was surprised by how similar it seemed because I think - I don't know. You would imagine it would be really different for a major presidential candidate who's been in the spotlight and just some high school kid. But I think a lot of the structural things don't really change. Obviously she's had a lot more experience. She knows more what she's up against, and she knows what it's like to be on stages like that. But I think the things about tone, the way she'll be criticized, the way that she'll have to moderate her emotion - those are all things that I don't think really change. SHAPIRO: And yet do women in debates also have an advantage on some level? I'm thinking of during the primaries. Donald Trump attacked all of his opponents, but when he attacked Carly Fiorina, he was really heavily criticized for that in a way that he was not when he went after his male opponents. WATERS: Yeah, I think there are situations where it can be an advantage. Like, I know that when I'm judging, if I see male debaters being, like, incredibly aggressive towards a woman who you can tell is feeling attacked, maybe starting to cry. I've seen situations like that. And of course I'm sympathetic to the woman in the round. But I think that overall it's in general more difficult for women just because they have to be thinking about so many things that men don't. Like, I know that when Clinton is up there, she'll be thinking about ways that she speaks in a way that Trump won't have to. SHAPIRO: When you were a high school debater yourself, did you get feedback from judges that showed you you were being evaluated on different standards from your male competitors? WATERS: Well, there were definitely times where you would notice comments over and over again that stopped making as much sense. But one thing that I noticed about myself is that when I debate, I - sometimes people made fun of me for it. But I kind of have a debate voice, where my voice goes down a couple of octaves. And it's not like I walked into rounds like I know men are good debaters, so I'm going to try and sound like a boy. It was more just naturally - when I try to be persuasive, I sounded more masculine. I mean I can see now that is probably related to all of these gender stereotypes and all of these ways that persuasion is influenced by the gender of the person you're listening to. SHAPIRO: And so is the takeaway for those of us watching the debate at home that we should grade Hillary Clinton on a curve or keep our innate, maybe subconscious reactions in check or watch out for these particular red flags? WATERS: I think because I had experiences with sexism or just gender-related comments - when I judge rounds, I have that in the back of my head. And I know that changes the comments I write. Like, if I'm writing down that I think a woman was being too aggressive, I better not be writing on the other side that the man did a great job for being aggressive. So I think it's more just, like, have it in your head. And if you have a thought that might be gendered, maybe think about it again and be sure that you're being equally fair to both candidates. SHAPIRO: Anna Waters is a journalism student at Northwestern University, and she also coaches high school debate. Her piece in The Washington Post is called \"How Could Sexism Hurt Clinton In The debates? These Female High School Debaters Know. \" Thanks a lot. WATERS: Thank you.

What are the odds? For NPR's Hidden Brain podcast, our social science correspondent, Shankar Vedantam, decided to find out. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: When a coincidence happens in your own life, it feels like magic. AMANDA BIRCH: So I was a student at the University of Rhode Island, and we were in this writing class. VEDANTAM: This is Amanda Birch. She was talking to the teacher of her writing class and the teacher mentioned that she lived in a small town in Vermont - the same small town, it turned out, where Amanda's mother had grown up. The teacher asked Amanda what her mother's maiden name was, and Amanda told her. BIRCH: And she just kind of drops her pen and she goes, you're not going to believe this, but I live in the house where your mother grew up. JOSEPH MAZUR: That particular kind of coincidence, meeting an acquaintance in a very strange place, 80 percent of all the coincidences I've heard fall into that category. VEDANTAM: This is mathematician Joseph Mazur. You can think of him as the scrooge of coincidences. He breaks down the statistics and shows you why mathematically, coincidences aren't quite as extraordinary as you think. In this case, Mazur says, the culprit is the fact that we vastly underestimate the number of people we actually know. MAZUR: People think that their address book is essentially the people they know. And it turns out that any particular address book is about 1 percent of the people they actually know in some way. VEDANTAM: Mazur even has an explanation for what might be the greatest coincidence in recent memory, a woman named Joan Ginther who won the lottery not once, not twice, but four times. MAZUR: In 1993, I think it was, she won $5. 4 million in Texas lotto. Thirteen years later, she won again, $2 million. And then a few years after that, she won $3 million. And then in 2010, she won $10 million. VEDANTAM: What are the odds of one person, Joan Ginther, winning the lottery four times? MAZUR: The odds are about 18 septillion to one against it happening. VEDANTAM: Eighteen septillion to one - that's just incomprehensible. A septillion is 1 followed by 24 zeros. But Joseph Mazur says if you ask the question slightly differently the odds get a lot better. Rather than ask, what are the odds that Joan Ginther will win the lottery four times, if you ask, what are the odds that any person will win the lottery four times. . . MAZUR: It's about 5 million to one, and that - it takes into account the fact that we have thousands of lotteries in the world. VEDANTAM: So still unlikely, but not incomprehensible. Mazur says you may also have to account for the fact that lottery winners usually have a lot more money to gamble with than most of us. MAZUR: And you do find that almost everybody who does win a lottery fairly big-time spends all that money or much of that money in trying to win again. VEDANTAM: Mazur says this might have been the case with Joan Ginther. Once she had $5. 4 million in the bank. . . MAZUR: Her odds of winning are better than most people's because she's got the money to play with. She wins a second time, then she's playing with more money. And you can see between the first winning and the second winning, it was 13 years. Between the second winning and the third it was only two years, and between the third and the fourth was only two years as well. So, you know, she's (laughter) really hooked at this point, and she's betting more. VEDANTAM: Many of us know intellectually that there are mathematical explanations for what feels like magic, and yet we can't help but think coincidences hold more meaning than they do. NICK EPLEY: Whenever you see something that you can't explain, the natural human instinct is to try to understand it. VEDANTAM: Nick Epley is a psychologist at the University of Chicago. He's author of the book \"Mindwise,\" which is all about how we understand other people's intentions. EPLEY: This general tendency to explain behaviors in terms of purpose or intent or meaning is often quite a successful thing to do. Turns out, we live with other people who do have intentions and goals and foresight and planning. But the problem with any kind of good tool is that sometimes we use it a little too much. VEDANTAM: Coincidences are breaks in the pattern of everyday life. Because they're unusual, Epley says, they stand out in our minds. EPLEY: I think the reason why coincidences seem very meaningful is that you're trying to explain them. You and I both thought of the word propeller at the same time. How on earth could that be, that Shankar was thinking about propeller at the same time that I was? And so you're trying to explain that. You're focusing on that event that just happened to you. VEDANTAM: But as good as psychologists and mathematicians might be at debunking our sense of wonder, there are some coincidences that really are simply magical, like this story Joseph Mazur told me about a 19th century French poet, Emile Deschamps. MAZUR: As a teenager, he meets a man by the name of - a strange name - Monsieur de Fortgibu. He turns out to be an immigrant from England. And Fortgibu introduces him to a plum pudding. It's a very English dish. It's almost unheard of in France. VEDANTAM: Ten years go by. Deschamps is now passing a restaurant in Paris. There's a sign on the window saying they have plum pudding on their menu. But when he goes inside, he's told the last of the plum pudding was just sold to a gentleman sitting in the back. MAZUR: And the waiter calls out loud, Monsieur de Fortgibu, would you be willing to share your plum pudding with this gentleman? VEDANTAM: Years pass. Deschamps is at a dinner party with some friends. The host announces an unusual dessert will be served - plum pudding. MAZUR: And Deschamps jokes that one of the guests who arrive must be Monsieur de Fortgibu. Well, soon the doorbell rings and Monsieur de Fortgibu is announced. And he enters. He's an old man by now, but Deschamps recognizes him. Monsieur de Fortgibu looks around and realizes that he's in the wrong apartment. (Laughter) He was invited to a dinner, but not in that apartment. VEDANTAM: It's the kind of coincidence that even a mathematician can't deconstruct. Like I said, magic. Shankar Vedantam, NPR News.

JESSIKA TRANCIK: The question that we started with was, how do cars - how do personal vehicles compare to climate targets? BICHELL: Trancik is with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Some cars, like the Chevrolet Volt, Nissan Leaf and Toyota Prius, already meet global climate goals set for 2030. But most Americans are still buying fossil fuel-guzzling cars.

Well, there's social science research about the effect slow motion has on us, and we are joined by NPR's Shankar Vedantam. Hey, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: Football fan as I know. VEDANTAM: Indeed. GREENE: Steelers - me; Eagles - you. We're going to go to the Super Bowl. You won't. Let's just finish with that. I don't care, slow motion or real motion, whatever it is. But tell me about what we're talking about here. VEDANTAM: Well, slow motion helps us see more clearly so we can see who crossed a finish line first if two athletes are separated by a few hundreths of a second. But slow motion also has another effect, a psychological effect. I was talking to Eugene Caruso - he's at the University of Chicago - along with Zachary Burns and Benjamin Converse. They were actually talking about how it felt to them as spectators to watch slow-motion replays of collisions in NFL games. It felt to them that when they saw two athletes collide in slow motion, it changed the way they thought about what was happening inside those athletes' minds. They recently ran a series of experiments to test this idea where they asked volunteers to imagine what was happening inside the minds of the actors on the video. Some volunteers saw the action at regular speed. Others saw the action in slow motion. Here's Caruso. EUGENE CARUSO: And we found that participants who saw the actions in slow motion rated the actions as more intentional than participants who saw the same actions at regular speed. GREENE: So I guess I could see this on a football game if you can actually see the player's face and you sort of imagine them grimacing or being determined to hit another player. But you're saying this goes beyond that. I mean, when cars are hitting each other you see in slow motion, you might actually think the driver intended to hit someone else. VEDANTAM: Yes, and it's happening for innocuous reasons. Usually, when we see people taking time to perform an action, it usually means they are thinking through what they're about to do. They intended the action. On the other hand, when something happens suddenly, we're more likely to say it was an accident. It appears that even though we know that slow motion is motion that has been slowed down, our minds still unconsciously apply the same rule of thumb and ascribe greater intentionality to the action than if we saw it at regular speed. GREENE: Well - and this could become much more serious than a football game. This could probably go into the realm of law enforcement, I mean, if you're seeing someone committing a crime and figuring out if it was intentional or not. VEDANTAM: Exactly. Caruso and his colleagues, in fact, ran an experiment where they tested the effects of this idea in a mock jury setting. They asked volunteers to play the role of jurors and assess a defendant's culpability. As in the other case, some volunteers were shown the crime in slow motion; others at regular speed. CARUSO: What we find there is that the odds that a jury would be unanimous, that is, all 12 jurors would be unanimous in convicting of first-degree murder, we're between sort of three and four times higher in the slow-motion condition than in the regular-speed condition. GREENE: But people on a jury or anywhere else, they know they're seeing something in slow motion. I mean, wouldn't that sort of counteract any psychological thing going on? Like, I'm watching this in slow motion so I know it's different. VEDANTAM: I think that's really the interesting psychological question here, David. Sometimes knowing that we are making a mistake can help us correct it, but sometimes knowledge alone is not enough. Caruso finds that reminding volunteers very explicitly that they are watching a slow-motion video does reduce the error, but it does not eliminate it. So when we play things in slow motion, we just might have to accept that many of us are going to think about those events differently. And this has implications for how we use slow motion in sports settings, the criminal justice system, even the news. GREENE: Interesting stuff as always. Thanks, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Thanks, David.

So it may still be possible to appreciate nature in the future, even as we continue to change what nature is. But we also can't deny that change - it's massive. And in geological time, massive change usually means one thing - extinction. PETER WARD: Geological time is really a history of gravestones. RAZ: This is paleontologist. . . WARD: Hello, hello. Peter Ward here. RAZ: . . . Peter Ward. WARD: I am a professor of biology and a professor of Earth and Space Sciences at the University of Washington. RAZ: And Peter says the age of humans - the Anthropocene - will not just be about how we change the planet, it'll be about what disappears from the planet. WARD: If you name a new period, it's probably because a lot of stuff died out in the period before. And lo and behold, that certainly has happened. RAZ: In fact, Peter says most of the species that ever lived on planet Earth have disappeared. . . WARD: Oh, yes. RAZ: . . . In five mass extinctions. WARD: Each of these big mass extinctions has at least half of the species going extinct, and probably way more than that. RAZ: You probably know about my personal favorite 65 million years ago, when something really big. . . WARD: Exactly, a big comet or a big asteroid. RAZ: . . . Slammed into Earth. . . WARD: Bang. RAZ: Bang. WARD: (Laughter). RAZ: . . . Right near the Gulf of Mexico. And that one asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs and pretty much everything else. WARD: Yup. RAZ: And we know of at least one other mass extinction caused by something similar, a giant comet or asteroid. But the other three? Those were caused by big changes in the climate. WARD: The first of these is the Ordovician Period, somewhere 450 million years ago that particular mass extinction happened. RAZ: And what happened? It just, like, things just started dying? WARD: Well, this is the most peculiar and relatively unknown of the five big mass extinctions known from the time of animals. Lots of things started dying. And the things that died mostly were coral reef-type animals, including lots and lots of corals. It's very mysterious, but you had a pretty much reliably tropical world from pole-to-pole. And all of a sudden, we seem to have gone into a short period of global cooling. And just as if we were to take the beautiful Indo-Pacific coral reefs - the Great Barrier Reef - and stick icebergs around it for a few millennia, I guarantee the Great Barrier Reef would be really dead. RAZ: So lots of things die, and most of it's sea life in the Ordovician Period. And then I guess about 100 million years later, the - another mass extinction. WARD: Yes. And the second one is called the Devonian Mass Extinction. And this is one that wasn't caused by it getting colder. This one really appears to have been caused by - it suddenly got really, really hot. RAZ: And presumably, this was also a problem for the oceans, right? WARD: Well, heat is a very good killer. And the trouble with - when you heat an ocean, you lose the ability of the upper surface waters to continue to oxygenate the deep waters. And once you stop letting the deep ocean bottoms have oxygen upon them, it kills all the animals. RAZ: But there was one mass extinction that completely dwarfed the others. WARD: This was dubbed the mother of all mass extinctions. WARD: The Permian Extinction. WARD: The Permian, 251 million years ago. And we had the largest extensive upwelling and extrusion of lava that the world has ever seen. RAZ: And for reasons that still aren't totally clear, the Earth suddenly got a lot more volcanic. And lava flows spread all across the Earth, giving off massive amounts of CO2. WARD: These things cover the landscape. But what made the Permian a special killer is that all of these nasty volcanic layers moved into coal-bearing strata and began burning the coal subterranean. And that produced even more carbon dioxide. And so we had this really fast, fast, fast, fast, fast heat spike. RAZ: Most of been unpleasant? WARD: Yup. RAZ: This was known as a runaway greenhouse effect. More CO2 in the atmosphere kept things hotter, kept the lava flowing, which burned more coal, which released more CO2 into the atmosphere, which made things hotter. You get the idea, right? And Peter Ward says that should sound very familiar. WARD: Oh, absolutely. I mean, what's the difference between a volcano and a Volvo in terms of the gas that comes out of it? I shouldn't say that, I love my Volvo. RAZ: Yeah. WARD: I'm a college professor, come on, what do you think I'm going to drive? RAZ: Of course. WARD: So what we're doing is we're starting again one of these - what we call greenhouse extinctions that are caused largely by carbon dioxide and heating. So we are absolutely creating a case where we are killing off species. RAZ: Peter Ward explains more from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RAZ: We can really now predict what's going to happen to our particular planet. We are right now in the beautiful oreo of existence - of at least life on planet Earth. In the Cambrian explosion, life emerged from the swamps, complexity arose. And from what we can tell, we're halfway through. So our planet, like us, is going to have an age and an old age. And we are in its golden summer age right now. The Earth has never had any ice on it when we've had a thousand parts-per-million CO2. We are at 380 and climbing. We should be up to 1,000 in three centuries at the most. But my friend David Vatisti (ph) in Seattle says he thinks 100 years. So there goes the ice caps, and there comes 240 feet of sea level rise. I live in a view house now. I'm going to have waterfront. RAZ: Along with sea level rise, what else is going to happen? WARD: Well, you could take the optimistic view, or what I think is the realistic view. I think realistically, we are not going to stop fossil fuels being burned, and that we're going to continue to cause carbon dioxide oxide to go up. And we're going to continue to cause sea level to go up. And so that means moving into new areas that perhaps at the moment haven't been formed, and that means deforestation. So once you do deforestation, then you're taking out a great number of endemic species that we don't see in the fossil record, the insects for instance. The really - creatures that have no latitude in what they eat and where they live and the temperatures, these are the ones that go out. Darwin used the analogy of the wedge - that if there's a new species, it has to wedge something out. Well, we're not just wedging. We're splitting the log in half. And in this particular case, we are - we're certainly dooming a huge number of species from habitat destruction. RAZ: OK. If that's not enough, there is one final thing we haven't mentioned that could mean even more trouble for the Anthropocene. WARD: The final aspect of the mass extinction here and the one that should be scariest to us is that people are really watching what's going on in the oceans. We are seeing increasingly low-oxygen areas covering parts of the oceans because we're changing the velocity and the nature of the currents that take oxygen from the surface to the deep. RAZ: You might remember that happens when the ocean gets warmer. And it causes animals to die. But something else happens, too. WARD: Four of the 5 mass extinctions were not just accompanied by volcanic gases in the atmosphere. There was also the formation of toxins coming out of bacteria. One of the worst of these is hydrogen sulfide, which is very, very poisonous. And that is what people are most worried about. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WARD: Hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to humans. As small as 200 parts per million will kill you. You only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places - some lakes - and get down. And you'll find that the water itself turns purple. It turns purple from the presence of numerous microbes which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide. Now, the worst effect of global warming, it turns out - hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans. We can easily go back to the hydrogen-sulfide world. Give us a few millennia. And we humans should last those few millennia. Will it happen again? If we continue, it'll happen again. We have a huge problem facing us as a species. We have to beat this. RAZ: So how are humans different from, you know, all these other species that have gone extinct in the past? WARD: Oh, humans - come on. We have the golden ticket. We're able to put a coat on if it gets cold. And we're able to build air conditioners if it's too hot. So I think we are essentially extinction-proof. And I fight this concept that we are endangered. I think we are the least-endangered species on the planet in many respects simply because we have not just the experience but the intelligence to deal with so many of these challenges. And I just think we are going to be the long-term survivals. Now, happiness might be something else. RAZ: Yeah. I mean, what kind of planet will we survive on, right? WARD: Well, there's that. I mean, you certainly see all the post-apocalyptic thrillers and the depressing sort of looks into the future. But it really doesn't need to be that way. I think we're just going to see an increasingly manicured planet, an increasingly ordered planet where the wild becomes not wild at all. It's managed wild. Human civilization - there's no reason that we just can't continue for millions of years into the present with just a modicum of civilization and technology. You can get around this stuff through intelligence. RAZ: Paleontologist Peter Ward - watch his entire talk at ted. npr. org. GUY RAZ, HOST:  OK. So it may still be possible to appreciate nature in the future, even as we continue to change what nature is. But we also can't deny that change - it's massive. And in geological time, massive change usually means one thing - extinction. PETER WARD: Geological time is really a history of gravestones. RAZ: This is paleontologist. . . WARD: Hello, hello. Peter Ward here. RAZ: . . . Peter Ward. WARD: I am a professor of biology and a professor of Earth and Space Sciences at the University of Washington. RAZ: And Peter says the age of humans - the Anthropocene - will not just be about how we change the planet, it'll be about what disappears from the planet. WARD: If you name a new period, it's probably because a lot of stuff died out in the period before. And lo and behold, that certainly has happened. RAZ: In fact, Peter says most of the species that ever lived on planet Earth have disappeared. . . WARD: Oh, yes. RAZ: . . . In five mass extinctions. WARD: Each of these big mass extinctions has at least half of the species going extinct, and probably way more than that. RAZ: You probably know about my personal favorite 65 million years ago, when something really big. . . WARD: Exactly, a big comet or a big asteroid. RAZ: . . . Slammed into Earth. . . WARD: Bang. RAZ: Bang. WARD: (Laughter). RAZ: . . . Right near the Gulf of Mexico. And that one asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs and pretty much everything else. WARD: Yup. RAZ: And we know of at least one other mass extinction caused by something similar, a giant comet or asteroid. But the other three? Those were caused by big changes in the climate. WARD: The first of these is the Ordovician Period, somewhere 450 million years ago that particular mass extinction happened. RAZ: And what happened? It just, like, things just started dying? WARD: Well, this is the most peculiar and relatively unknown of the five big mass extinctions known from the time of animals. Lots of things started dying. And the things that died mostly were coral reef-type animals, including lots and lots of corals. It's very mysterious, but you had a pretty much reliably tropical world from pole-to-pole. And all of a sudden, we seem to have gone into a short period of global cooling. And just as if we were to take the beautiful Indo-Pacific coral reefs - the Great Barrier Reef - and stick icebergs around it for a few millennia, I guarantee the Great Barrier Reef would be really dead. RAZ: So lots of things die, and most of it's sea life in the Ordovician Period. And then I guess about 100 million years later, the - another mass extinction. WARD: Yes. And the second one is called the Devonian Mass Extinction. And this is one that wasn't caused by it getting colder. This one really appears to have been caused by - it suddenly got really, really hot. RAZ: And presumably, this was also a problem for the oceans, right? WARD: Well, heat is a very good killer. And the trouble with - when you heat an ocean, you lose the ability of the upper surface waters to continue to oxygenate the deep waters. And once you stop letting the deep ocean bottoms have oxygen upon them, it kills all the animals. RAZ: But there was one mass extinction that completely dwarfed the others. WARD: This was dubbed the mother of all mass extinctions. WARD: The Permian Extinction. WARD: The Permian, 251 million years ago.

More CO2 in the atmosphere kept things hotter, kept the lava flowing, which burned more coal, which released more CO2 into the atmosphere, which made things hotter. You get the idea, right?

I shouldn't say that, I love my Volvo. RAZ: Yeah. WARD: I'm a college professor, come on, what do you think I'm going to drive? RAZ: Of course.

And with that in mind, here are three simple steps to finding dinosaurs. KEN LACOVARA: Well, you know, paleontologists - we all use the same formula. RAZ: This is Ken Lacovara, the paleontologist we heard earlier in the show. LACOVARA: The first thing is you have to find rocks of the right age. RAZ: And since Ken studies dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period. . . LACOVARA: I'm usually looking for rocks that are, you know, 65, 75 million years old. RAZ: Second, they have to be the right kind of rock. LACOVARA: Those rocks have to be sedimentary rocks. You can only make a fossil on a sedimentary rock. You can't have a fossil on a rock that was formed by magma or lava. RAZ: And third, get yourself to a place where those rocks are right on the ground below your feet. LACOVARA: So you need to get yourself in a desert, usually, where there aren't too many plants covering up the rocks but where there's just enough rain to cause erosion that exposes new bones. And you find those three things, rocks of the right age that are sedimentary rocks and that are in a desert. And you get yourself on the ground. And you just walk. And you walk until you literally see a dinosaur bone sticking out of the rock. RAZ: Wow. I'm thinking you're going to say, oh, we have this killer app and this laser technology, and we've got this radar equipment. We go out there with our substation. You're just walking around looking for bones sticking out. LACOVARA: Yeah. Well, that would take all the fun out of it, wouldn't it? RAZ: Yeah, I think so. LACOVARA: (Laughter) Yeah. RAZ: OK. So that's exactly what Ken was doing back in 2005. He was walking through the desert in Patagonia in Argentina. LACOVARA: And I saw a portion of thigh bone sticking out of the ground. RAZ: The bone was massive. LACOVARA: Two meters long - so, you know, over 6 feet long. RAZ: And Ken immediately knew two things. One, this came from a giant dinosaur. LACOVARA: And I knew that another giant dinosaur hadn't been found in South America within about 35 million years of geological time. And species don't last for that long. So I knew it had to be a new species. I didn't know much about it at that point. But I knew it was a new species of really, really giant dinosaur. RAZ: And that dinosaur had a story to tell, a story about the age in which it lived and how far we've come. Ken Lacovara picks up the story in just a minute with more ideas about our human age. I'm Guy Raz. And you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about the Anthropocene, a geological epoch defined by human influence on the planet. And we're just hearing the story of a massive dinosaur leg bone that was unearthed by paleontologist Ken Lacovara in South America about 15 years ago. And he knew at the time that he discovered a new species, a species with a story to tell about the vast scope of geological time. Ken picks up the story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)LACOVARA: Now, unfortunately, that bone was isolated. We dug and dug and dug, and there wasn't another bone around. But it made us hungry to go back the next year for more. And on the first day of that next field season, I found another 2-meter femur, only this time not isolated, this time associated with 145 other bones of a giant plant-eater. And after three more hard, really brutal field seasons, the giant that lay in this grave, the new species of dinosaur we would eventually call Dreadnoughtus schrani. Dreadnoughtus was 85 feet from snout to tail. It stood two and a half stories at the shoulder. And all fleshed out in life, it weighed 65 tons. People ask me sometimes, was Dreadnoughtus bigger than a T. rex? That's the mass of 8 or 9 T. rex. Now, after this particular Dreadnoughtus carcass was buried and de-fleshed by a multitude of bacteria, worms and insects, its bones underwent a brief metamorphosis exchanging molecules with the ground water and becoming more and more like the entombing rock. Meanwhile, Earth history unfolded above. The dinosaurs would rein for another 12 million years before their hegemony was snuffed out in a fiery apocalypse. The continents drifted, the mammals rose, the ice age came. And then in East Africa, an unpromising species of ape evolved the odd trick of sentient thought. And in a remarkable diaspora surpassing even the dinosaurs' record of territorial conquest, they dispersed across the planet, ravishing every ecosystem they encountered. And along the way, inventing culture and metal working and painting and dance and music and science and rocket ships that would eventually take 12 particularly excellent apes to the surface of the moon. With 7 billion peripatetic Homo sapiens on the planet, it was perhaps inevitable that one of them would eventually trod on the grave of the magnificent titan buried beneath the badlands of Southern Patagonia. I was that ape. And standing there alone in the desert, it was not lost on me that the chance of any one individual entering the fossil record is vanishingly small. But the Earth is very, very old. And over vast tracts of time, the improbable becomes the probable. That's the magic of the geological record. RAZ: That day when you found the first giant thighbone and then everything that had led to it, I mean, that must have been, like, the most exciting discovery of your career. LACOVARA: It was. It was. It's a day you won't forget. And, you know, what I love about paleontology, and this doesn't just have to do with when you find a giant dinosaur, but when you find anything, you pick this thing out of the ground that hasn't seen sunlight in, you know, in this case, in 77 million years. And you realize that you're the first human to ever see this. And then if you find a new species, which I've been lucky enough to, you know, have that experience a few times, you realize that you're the first human to ever know this. RAZ: Which kind of makes you wonder, I mean, 65 million years from now, what are paleontologists going to make of our human age today? I mean, what will they think of us? What will remain a mystery to them? LACOVARA: What we will look like in the future record is a marker bed. A marker bed is an event that geologically was essentially instantaneous, like when that meteor hit at the end of the age of dinosaurs. That's not an age, that's just a single event. RAZ: Geologically, that is all we are, a moment. Or to put it another way. . . LACOVARA: This is a trick that I adapted from Carl Sagan that. . . RAZ: Astronomer Carl Sagan used to say that you could take all of Earth's history. . . LACOVARA: The 4. 5 billion years of Earth history and condense that into a single calendar year with Earth beginning on Jan. 1. Dinosaurs show up in the second week of December and they go extinct on Christmas Eve. Our hominid ancestors, they show up on Dec. 31 at about 3:30 in the afternoon. RAZ: Wow. LACOVARA: And then humans, our species, Homo sapiens, they show up on Dec. 31 at 11:59:59 p. m. , you know? And so corks are popping, the ball's dropping, people are kissing and that's when we show up. And, you know, everybody you've ever heard of, everybody you've ever known, every war, every invention has happened on that little tiny piece of dust that occurred at 11:59:59 on Dec. 31. So our place in time is really, really small. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)LACOVARA: The bones of Dreadnoughtus lay underground for 77 million years. Who could have imagined that a single species of shrew-like mammal living in the cracks of the dinosaur world would evolve into sentient beings capable of characterizing and understanding the very dinosaurs they must have dreaded. Why study the ancient past? Because it gives us perspective and humility that dinosaurs died in the world's fifth mass extinction, snuffed out in a cosmic accident through no fault of their own. They didn't see it coming, and they didn't have a choice. We, on the other hand, do have a choice. And the nature of the fossil record tells us that our place on this planet is both precarious and potentially fleeting. Right now, our species is propagating an environmental disaster of geological proportions that is so broad and so severe it can rightly be called the sixth extinction. Only, unlike the dinosaurs, we can see it coming. And unlike the dinosaurs, we can do something about it. That choice is ours. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: You know, when we talk about geological epochs and periods that lasted for millions of years, the idea of the Anthropocene just as, like, one of them, it's strange to think about it, right, because you go to, like, a natural history museum, and you see these species that were just blips in their own epochs. And it's kind of amazing to think about us that way. LACOVARA: Well, humans are unprecedented. There has never been a species that has been able to affect the planet so broadly and so deeply as humans have. But again, you know, whether we, you know, in a future museum of natural history, would that be an epoch or would that be, you know, one strange, strange moment in geological past? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Paleontologist Kenneth Lacovara - his entire talk, with some amazing visuals of the Dreadnoughtus, is at ted. com.

RAZ: Geologically, that is all we are, a moment. Or to put it another way. . . LACOVARA: This is a trick that I adapted from Carl Sagan that. . . RAZ: Astronomer Carl Sagan used to say that you could take all of Earth's history. . . LACOVARA: The 4. 5 billion years of Earth history and condense that into a single calendar year with Earth beginning on Jan. 1. Dinosaurs show up in the second week of December and they go extinct on Christmas Eve. Our hominid ancestors, they show up on Dec. 31 at about 3:30 in the afternoon. RAZ: Wow. LACOVARA: And then humans, our species, Homo sapiens, they show up on Dec. 31 at 11:59:59 p. m. , you know? And so corks are popping, the ball's dropping, people are kissing and that's when we show up. And, you know, everybody you've ever heard of, everybody you've ever known, every war, every invention has happened on that little tiny piece of dust that occurred at 11:59:59 on Dec. 31. So our place in time is really, really small. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) LACOVARA: The bones of Dreadnoughtus lay underground for 77 million years. Who could have imagined that a single species of shrew-like mammal living in the cracks of the dinosaur world would evolve into sentient beings capable of characterizing and understanding the very dinosaurs they must have dreaded. Why study the ancient past? Because it gives us perspective and humility that dinosaurs died in the world's fifth mass extinction, snuffed out in a cosmic accident through no fault of their own. They didn't see it coming, and they didn't have a choice. We, on the other hand, do have a choice. And the nature of the fossil record tells us that our place on this planet is both precarious and potentially fleeting. Right now, our species is propagating an environmental disaster of geological proportions that is so broad and so severe it can rightly be called the sixth extinction. Only, unlike the dinosaurs, we can see it coming. And unlike the dinosaurs, we can do something about it. That choice is ours. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) RAZ: You know, when we talk about geological epochs and periods that lasted for millions of years, the idea of the Anthropocene just as, like, one of them, it's strange to think about it, right, because you go to, like, a natural history museum, and you see these species that were just blips in their own epochs. And it's kind of amazing to think about us that way. LACOVARA: Well, humans are unprecedented. There has never been a species that has been able to affect the planet so broadly and so deeply as humans have. But again, you know, whether we, you know, in a future museum of natural history, would that be an epoch or would that be, you know, one strange, strange moment in geological past?

And that future may depend on a single building 800 miles from the North Pole, a building entirely closed to the public and empty most of the time. CARY FOWLER: Yeah. Well, there have been - there have been a lot of stories on the internet if you believe everything you see on the internet about what's really, really going on there (laughter). RAZ: Yeah, I bet. Cary Fowler is the executive director of a group that built and runs this building, which is nestled into a snowy cliffside on a polar island owned by Norway. FOWLER: Around that particular building is almost nothing. RAZ: In fact, you can't even see most of the building itself. It's underground. But what you can see is this gray concrete wedge just jutting out of the ice. FOWLER: It's very simple, austere, modern-looking wedge with a door on the front of it. RAZ: So what's inside? FOWLER: Well, once you open the door, you're looking down a very long tunnel just chiseled out of solid rock. And you go through a set of airlock doors at the end of the tunnel, and then you get hit with a blast of cold air in your face. And what you're looking at are row after row of shelves. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FOWLER: It's a - it's a room, by the way, that's about 90 feet long and about 30 feet wide and about 15 feet high. It's white. It's spray-on concrete we put in there to sort of brighten it up. And you're looking at shelves, and on the shelves are boxes. RAZ: And what's inside the boxes? FOWLER: What's inside is the largest collection of seeds in the world. RAZ: Seeds from 850,000 crop varieties to be exact. FOWLER: Which makes about 500 million seeds. RAZ: Cary Fowler explained why there is a building full of frozen seeds on an island off Norway and what it has to do with the age of humans from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FOWLER: I've been fascinated with crop diversity for about 35 years from now ever since I stumbled across a fairly obscure academic article by a guy named Jack Harlan. And he described the diversity within crops, all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such, as a genetic resource. And he said this genetic resource - and I'll never forget the words - stands between us and catastrophic starvation on a scale we cannot imagine. What he understood was that biological diversity, crop diversity, is the biological foundation of agriculture. It's the raw material, the stuff of evolution in our agricultural crops - not a trivial matter. And he also understood that, indeed, a mass extinction was underway in our fields, in our agricultural system and that this mass extinction was taking place with very few people noticing and even fewer caring. And I want to give you an example of that. In the United States in the 1800s - that's where we have the best data - on farmers and gardeners were growing 7,100 named varieties of apples. Imagine that - 7,100 apples with names. Today, 6,800 of those are extinct, no longer to be seen again. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Cary Fowler says we don't just lose diversity when crops disappear. We actually lose adaptability because many of the crops we eat today, they exist because they were bred with other crops and, in some cases, crops thought to be completely useless to humans but that contained a key characteristic, like immunity to a disease. But the biggest threat to the future of agriculture isn't disease. It's the Anthropocene, our human influence on the planet. And Cary says in the future in some countries, even the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter than anything crops have ever experienced in the past. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FOWLER: Is agriculture adapted to that? I don't know. Can fish play the piano? If they haven't - if agriculture hasn't experienced that, how could it be adapted? South Africa, by 2030, will have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize because of the climate change already in 2030. Thirty percent decrease of production in the context of increasing population. That's a food crisis. It's global in nature. We will watch children starve to death on TV. Now, you might say that 30 - 20 years is a long way off. It's two breeding cycles for maize. We have two rolls of the dice to get this right. We have to get climate-ready crops in the field, and we have to do that Rather quickly. Now, the good news is that we have conserved. We have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity, agricultural diversity, mostly in the form of seed. And we put it in seed banks, which is a fancy way of saying a freezer. Unfortunately, these seed banks are located around the world in buildings, and they're vulnerable. And disasters have happened. In recent years, we lost the gene bank, the seed bank in Iraq and Afghanistan. You can guess why. And every time something like this happens, it means extinction. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: And so to prevent this from happening, Cary Fowler and a bunch of scientists got together to establish a global seed vault, a vault dedicated to preserving as many crops as possible from around the world. And they chose to build it in Svalbard, this tiny remote island off the coast of Norway, for a couple of reasons. FOWLER: One is obviously it's really remote. And so we wanted to have this safety backup, this insurance policy, in a remote place because it would avoid a lot of the dangers we see in the real world. But the second was that it's cold. RAZ: The seeds are frozen at minus 18 Celsius, about the temperature of your kitchen freezer. And they can stay preserved for centuries. So it's like a library of life in the Anthropocene. FOWLER: It is. It's the biggest collection of agriculture-related biodiversity in the world. And when you walk down there, you have to have a - it has to be a humbling experience because you're there amidst these seeds, which have made it all the way to the present day. In other words, they've experienced an unbroken successful chain of evolution to survive this long. And your ancestors and mine were involved in their selection and their care, their development. So it really represents the past, the history of agriculture. It represents everything that agriculture, our crops, have experienced in the past and had to adapt to. On the other hand, it also represents pretty much everything our agricultural system can be in the future. It's a big repository, if you will, of traits, of diversity, of options. RAZ: So if it's a library, it's more like the Library of Congress, right, because it's - it's like if every book burns, you know, in the world, the Library of Congress still has a copy. FOWLER: That's right. That's what we aim to do. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FOWLER: This is a backup system for world agriculture. I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a solution for climate change or the energy crisis or world hunger or peace and conflict. I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a simple solution for that. But I can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can't solve any of those problems if we don't have crop diversity because quite literally if we don't - if agriculture doesn't adapt to climate change, neither will we. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a wonderful gift that Norway and others have given us, but it's not the complete answer. We need to collect the remaining diversity that's out there. We need to put it into good seed banks that can offer those seeds to researchers in the future. And my final thought is that we of course by conserving wheat, rice, potatoes and the other crops, we may quite simply end up saving ourselves. Thank you.

Is it Anthrop-ocene (ph) or Anthrow-pecene (ph)? EMMA MARRIS: Anthropocene. I've heard that it's a U. S. -U. K. difference. RAZ: This is Emma Marris. She's a writer. And she's covered nature and the environment for years. What do you say? MARRIS: I guess I say Anthropocene now. RAZ: You do? MARRIS: Yeah. RAZ: I've been saying Anthrowpecene (ph) in my interviews. Am I going to sound like a pompous jerk? MARRIS: You know what, it's possible that either version makes us sound like pompous jerks (laughter). RAZ: OK. All right. However you say it, Emma believes the world is full of signs that we're living in the Anthropocene. MARRIS: No matter where you are, no matter what you're looking at, no matter how many days you've spent hiking away from the road, you're still in a landscape that was shaped by humans because of climate change. Every place on Earth has more carbon dioxide in it than it used to. The sort of influence of humans is everywhere. . . RAZ: . . . Even in places we think of as untouched. Emma picks up the idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MARRIS: Places like Yellowstone or the Mongolian steppe or the Great Barrier Reef or the Serengeti, places that we think of as kind of Edenic representations of nature before we screwed everything up. And in a way, they are less impacted by our day-to-day activities. Many of these places have no roads or few roads. But ultimately, even these edens are deeply influenced by humans. Now let's just take North America for example, since that's where we're meeting. Crater Lake in southern Oregon, which is my closest National Park, is a beautiful example of a landscape that seems to be coming out of the past, but they're managing it carefully. One of the issues they have now is whitebark pine die-off. Whitebark pine is a beautiful megaflora that grows up at high altitude. And it's got all these problems right now with disease. There's a blister rust that was introduced, bark beetle. So to deal with this, the Park Service has been planting rust-resistant whitebark pine seedlings in the park. And this kind of thing is really much more common than you would think. National parks are heavily managed. The wildlife is kept to a certain population size and structure, fires are suppressed, fires are started. Non-native species are removed. Native species are reintroduced. It takes a lot of work to make these places look untouched. Additionally, these sort of Edenic places are often distant from where people live. And they're expensive to get to, they're hard to visit. So this means that they're only available to the elites. And that's a real problem. And in a further irony, these places that we love the most are the places that we love a little too hard sometimes. A lot of us like to go there and because we're managing them to be stable in the face of a changing planet, they often are becoming more fragile over time. RAZ: And because nature is changing, Emma Marris says we need to start to rethink how we define what nature is. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: (Unintelligible) Buggy, too. RAZ: And that starts when we're kids. MARRIS: I've got two kids, 6 and 4. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: (Unintelligible) bugs. RAZ: Do you guys spend a lot of time in nature? MARRIS: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: How many have you gotten? MARRIS: There's a lot of bug observation that happens. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: Two humongous holes. MARRIS: The kids love to look for grasshoppers. . . Whoa. How many grasshoppers is that? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: I don't know. MARRIS: . . . Dragonflies and roly-polies. And the cool thing about roly-polies is that when you touch them, they roll up. . . UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: Hey, hey, where are you? MARRIS: . . . Into a little ball. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: I got baby roly-polies. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: I got a baby ant. MARRIS: But we don't tend to make very much ground. We don't tend to really rack up the miles. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: Got a family (laughter). RAZ: Just kind of exploring what's around? MARRIS: Right, right. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: (Laughter) It's (unintelligible). RAZ: So those were your actual kids that we were just hearing there. Where do you guys - well, where do you guys do this kind of thing? MARRIS: Well, some of the places my kids love the most are empty lots and little unmowed strips by the sides of a commercial building, or just alongside the road. RAZ: Wait, all this is happening in, like, empty lots? MARRIS: Yeah. They love them. RAZ: So you raise your kids to think about nature in a totally different way? MARRIS: Yes, I do. Because we keep making all these rules for what you count as nature. You know, it's got to be pristine or it's got to be wild or it's got to have only native plants and animals in it. And they're not coming up with these these kind of exclusionary categories. They're seeing nature every day as soon as they walk out the door because they're down there looking at the ants and the leaves and the street trees and the bird - you know, the robins and the pigeons. And we stop seeing these small bits of nature as nature, partially just out of familiarity and partly because we have these grand categories in mind. But they don't make those distinctions necessarily. RAZ: Yeah. I mean, to them it's just like bugs and plants. MARRIS: Right. And, you know, they come into this world with a very open, huge inclusive definition of nature. And what I worry about is that we then train them to not see a lot of that nature. We then sort of talk them out of enjoying a lot of the nature that's available to them on a daily basis. But at the rate that the climate is changing and the rate that species are moving around, a lot of Earth is going to be changed. Then in another generation, there won't really necessarily be that many of those places left. RAZ: Emma Marris is back in just a minute with more ideas about rethinking nature in the age of humans, the Anthropocene. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about the Anthropocene, this new age of unprecedented human influence on the planet. And we were just hearing from environmental writer Emma Marris, whose idea is that since the natural world is changing, we have to change how we perceive it. MARRIS: I remember I was in Hawaii once. And I was in a car with a bunch of ecologists. And we were driving down this jungle. And it was beautiful. It was, you know, flowers, cascading down waterfalls, huge leaves dripping with water. RAZ: Wow. MARRIS: And there was a sign that said it was a scenic byway. And all of the ecologists and the car just laughed and hooted because none of those plants were from Hawaii. And so in their eyes, it was hideous. They had trained themselves to only see ugliness when it wasn't pristine. You know, that's a real shame (laughter). RAZ: Yeah. MARRIS: So what are we going to do with this Anthropocene nature that surrounds us? Are we going to be able to see the beauty in it? Are we going to be able to value it, even though our fingerprints are on it? RAZ: Here's Emma again from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MARRIS: I think that nature is anywhere where life thrives, anywhere where there are multiple species together, anywhere that's green and blue and thriving and filled with life and growing. And under that definition, things look a little bit different. All of a sudden, we see this monarch caterpillar, you know, munching on this plant. And we realize that there it is, and it's in this empty lot in Chattanooga. I mean, there's, like, probably a dozen minimum plant species growing there supporting all kinds of insect life. This is a kind of a wild nature right under our nose that we don't even notice. Here's an example. Philadelphia, there's this cool elevated railway that you can see from the ground that's been abandoned. Now, this may sound like the beginning of the High Line story in Manhattan. And it's very similar, except they haven't developed this into a park yet, although they're working on it. So for now, it's still this little sort of secret wilderness in the heart of Philadelphia. And if you know where the hole is in the chain-link fence, you can scramble up to the top and you can find this completely wild meadow just floating above the city of Philadelphia. Every single one of these plants grew from a seed that planted itself there. This is completely autonomous, self-willed nature. And there are over 50 plant species up there. And it's not just plants, this is an ecosystem, a functioning ecosystem. It's creating soil, it's sequestering carbon, there's pollination going on. I mean, this is really an ecosystem. So scientists have started calling ecosystems like these novel ecosystems because they're often dominated by non-native species, and because they're just super weird. They're just unlike anything we've ever seen before. For so long, we dismissed all these natural ecosystems as trash. We're talking about regrown agricultural fields, timber plantations that are not being managed on a day-to-day basis, second-growth forests, generally the entire East Coast, where after agriculture moved west, the forests sprung up. And of course, pretty much all of Hawaii, where novel ecosystems are the norm, where exotic species totally dominate. You can make your own novel ecosystem, too. It's really simple. You just stop mowing your lawn. (LAUGHTER)RAZ: All right. So, I mean, even if we all stop mowing lawns - right? - I mean, there's still a lot of actual nature out there being destroyed. So how do we keep some of that? MARRIS: The thing is, is that as the planet changes, it's going to be more and more expensive and time consuming to keep ecosystems from changing. But I do think it's worth doing in small areas. So there's a guy named Greg Aplet, he's a really smart guy. And he's come up with this sort of landscape-level solution for how we do conservation, which I think is brilliant. And basically the way you do it is you divide up your landscape into three chunks. In one chunk, you classically restore. You keep that place looking the way it did at whatever sort of time period you have data about the sort of pre-development state. Then the second chunk, you do innovative approaches. And you bring things in that you think might do better under the new climate. You try stuff out because we're going to need more innovative approaches in a changing world. And then the third chunk, you do nothing. You just watch as nature itself adapts to all of these new challenges and changes. And you take note of what becomes the new resilient, tough ecosystem that emerges. RAZ: Yeah. MARRIS: And we're not really sure yet which of these strategies will be most effective in doing things like preventing extinctions. So trying all three, I think, is a great idea. RAZ: Yeah. I mean, I guess it's kind of like hedging our bets because we don't really know what nature is going to be like for future generations. MARRIS: Right, right. Because we're not sure what our great grandchildren are really going to value. You know, are they going to mostly be concerned that we kept species from going extinct? Are they going to be really upset if we manage everything and there's nothing that's really wild? What are they going to value? We don't know. Nature is going to survive in some shape or form, and it's probably going to be more fantastic than we think. So by restoring some things in the way we always have, letting some things go wild and trying experiments in other places, we can ensure that we're going to at least do something right. RAZ: Emma Marris is the author of \"Rambunctious Garden. \" You can see her entire TED Talk at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  Can we just clarify this? Is it Anthrop-ocene (ph) or Anthrow-pecene (ph)? EMMA MARRIS: Anthropocene. I've heard that it's a U. S. -U. K. difference. RAZ: This is Emma Marris. She's a writer. And she's covered nature and the environment for years. What do you say? MARRIS: I guess I say Anthropocene now. RAZ: You do? MARRIS: Yeah. RAZ: I've been saying Anthrowpecene (ph) in my interviews. Am I going to sound like a pompous jerk? MARRIS: You know what, it's possible that either version makes us sound like pompous jerks (laughter). RAZ: OK. All right. However you say it, Emma believes the world is full of signs that we're living in the Anthropocene. MARRIS: No matter where you are, no matter what you're looking at, no matter how many days you've spent hiking away from the road, you're still in a landscape that was shaped by humans because of climate change. Every place on Earth has more carbon dioxide in it than it used to. The sort of influence of humans is everywhere. . . RAZ: . . . Even in places we think of as untouched. Emma picks up the idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) MARRIS: Places like Yellowstone or the Mongolian steppe or the Great Barrier Reef or the Serengeti, places that we think of as kind of Edenic representations of nature before we screwed everything up. And in a way, they are less impacted by our day-to-day activities. Many of these places have no roads or few roads. But ultimately, even these edens are deeply influenced by humans. Now let's just take North America for example, since that's where we're meeting. Crater Lake in southern Oregon, which is my closest National Park, is a beautiful example of a landscape that seems to be coming out of the past, but they're managing it carefully. One of the issues they have now is whitebark pine die-off. Whitebark pine is a beautiful megaflora that grows up at high altitude. And it's got all these problems right now with disease. There's a blister rust that was introduced, bark beetle. So to deal with this, the Park Service has been planting rust-resistant whitebark pine seedlings in the park. And this kind of thing is really much more common than you would think. National parks are heavily managed. The wildlife is kept to a certain population size and structure, fires are suppressed, fires are started. Non-native species are removed. Native species are reintroduced. It takes a lot of work to make these places look untouched. Additionally, these sort of Edenic places are often distant from where people live. And they're expensive to get to, they're hard to visit. So this means that they're only available to the elites. And that's a real problem. And in a further irony, these places that we love the most are the places that we love a little too hard sometimes. A lot of us like to go there and because we're managing them to be stable in the face of a changing planet, they often are becoming more fragile over time. RAZ: And because nature is changing, Emma Marris says we need to start to rethink how we define what nature is. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: (Unintelligible) Buggy, too. RAZ: And that starts when we're kids. MARRIS: I've got two kids, 6 and 4. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: (Unintelligible) bugs. RAZ: Do you guys spend a lot of time in nature? MARRIS: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: How many have you gotten? MARRIS: There's a lot of bug observation that happens. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: Two humongous holes. MARRIS: The kids love to look for grasshoppers. . . Whoa. How many grasshoppers is that? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: I don't know. MARRIS: . . . Dragonflies and roly-polies. And the cool thing about roly-polies is that when you touch them, they roll up. . . UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: Hey, hey, where are you? MARRIS: . . . Into a little ball. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: I got baby roly-polies. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: I got a baby ant. MARRIS: But we don't tend to make very much ground. We don't tend to really rack up the miles. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: Got a family (laughter). RAZ: Just kind of exploring what's around? MARRIS: Right, right. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: (Laughter) It's (unintelligible). RAZ: So those were your actual kids that we were just hearing there. Where do you guys - well, where do you guys do this kind of thing? MARRIS: Well, some of the places my kids love the most are empty lots and little unmowed strips by the sides of a commercial building, or just alongside the road. RAZ: Wait, all this is happening in, like, empty lots? MARRIS: Yeah. They love them. RAZ: So you raise your kids to think about nature in a totally different way? MARRIS: Yes, I do. Because we keep making all these rules for what you count as nature. You know, it's got to be pristine or it's got to be wild or it's got to have only native plants and animals in it. And they're not coming up with these these kind of exclusionary categories. They're seeing nature every day as soon as they walk out the door because they're down there looking at the ants and the leaves and the street trees and the bird - you know, the robins and the pigeons. And we stop seeing these small bits of nature as nature, partially just out of familiarity and partly because we have these grand categories in mind. But they don't make those distinctions necessarily. RAZ: Yeah. I mean, to them it's just like bugs and plants. MARRIS: Right. And, you know, they come into this world with a very open, huge inclusive definition of nature. And what I worry about is that we then train them to not see a lot of that nature. We then sort of talk them out of enjoying a lot of the nature that's available to them on a daily basis. But at the rate that the climate is changing and the rate that species are moving around, a lot of Earth is going to be changed. Then in another generation, there won't really necessarily be that many of those places left. RAZ: Emma Marris is back in just a minute with more ideas about rethinking nature in the age of humans, the Anthropocene. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about the Anthropocene, this new age of unprecedented human influence on the planet. And we were just hearing from environmental writer Emma Marris, whose idea is that since the natural world is changing, we have to change how we perceive it. MARRIS: I remember I was in Hawaii once. And I was in a car with a bunch of ecologists. And we were driving down this jungle. And it was beautiful. It was, you know, flowers, cascading down waterfalls, huge leaves dripping with water. RAZ: Wow. MARRIS: And there was a sign that said it was a scenic byway. And all of the ecologists and the car just laughed and hooted because none of those plants were from Hawaii. And so in their eyes, it was hideous. They had trained themselves to only see ugliness when it wasn't pristine. You know, that's a real shame (laughter). RAZ: Yeah. MARRIS: So what are we going to do with this Anthropocene nature that surrounds us? Are we going to be able to see the beauty in it? Are we going to be able to value it, even though our fingerprints are on it? RAZ: Here's Emma again from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) MARRIS: I think that nature is anywhere where life thrives, anywhere where there are multiple species together, anywhere that's green and blue and thriving and filled with life and growing. And under that definition, things look a little bit different. All of a sudden, we see this monarch caterpillar, you know, munching on this plant. And we realize that there it is, and it's in this empty lot in Chattanooga. I mean, there's, like, probably a dozen minimum plant species growing there supporting all kinds of insect life. This is a kind of a wild nature right under our nose that we don't even notice. Here's an example. Philadelphia, there's this cool elevated railway that you can see from the ground that's been abandoned. Now, this may sound like the beginning of the High Line story in Manhattan. And it's very similar, except they haven't developed this into a park yet, although they're working on it. So for now, it's still this little sort of secret wilderness in the heart of Philadelphia. And if you know where the hole is in the chain-link fence, you can scramble up to the top and you can find this completely wild meadow just floating above the city of Philadelphia. Every single one of these plants grew from a seed that planted itself there. This is completely autonomous, self-willed nature. And there are over 50 plant species up there. And it's not just plants, this is an ecosystem, a functioning ecosystem. It's creating soil, it's sequestering carbon, there's pollination going on. I mean, this is really an ecosystem. So scientists have started calling ecosystems like these novel ecosystems because they're often dominated by non-native species, and because they're just super weird. They're just unlike anything we've ever seen before. For so long, we dismissed all these natural ecosystems as trash. We're talking about regrown agricultural fields, timber plantations that are not being managed on a day-to-day basis, second-growth forests, generally the entire East Coast, where after agriculture moved west, the forests sprung up. And of course, pretty much all of Hawaii, where novel ecosystems are the norm, where exotic species totally dominate. You can make your own novel ecosystem, too. It's really simple. You just stop mowing your lawn. (LAUGHTER) RAZ: All right. So, I mean, even if we all stop mowing lawns - right? - I mean, there's still a lot of actual nature out there being destroyed. So how do we keep some of that? MARRIS: The thing is, is that as the planet changes, it's going to be more and more expensive and time consuming to keep ecosystems from changing. But I do think it's worth doing in small areas. So there's a guy named Greg Aplet, he's a really smart guy. And he's come up with this sort of landscape-level solution for how we do conservation, which I think is brilliant. And basically the way you do it is you divide up your landscape into three chunks. In one chunk, you classically restore. You keep that place looking the way it did at whatever sort of time period you have data about the sort of pre-development state. Then the second chunk, you do innovative approaches. And you bring things in that you think might do better under the new climate. You try stuff out because we're going to need more innovative approaches in a changing world. And then the third chunk, you do nothing. You just watch as nature itself adapts to all of these new challenges and changes. And you take note of what becomes the new resilient, tough ecosystem that emerges. RAZ: Yeah. MARRIS: And we're not really sure yet which of these strategies will be most effective in doing things like preventing extinctions. So trying all three, I think, is a great idea. RAZ: Yeah. I mean, I guess it's kind of like hedging our bets because we don't really know what nature is going to be like for future generations. MARRIS: Right, right.

I'm Guy Raz. Did you know that the birthplace of dinosaur paleontology is actually in New Jersey? KENNETH LACOVARA: It is. The world's first really substantial dinosaur skeleton was found in Haddonfield, N. J. , in 1858. And the world's first tyrannosaur was found about a mile from my quarry 150 years ago this week. RAZ: This is Ken Lacovara. He's a paleontologist and dean. . . LACOVARA: . . . Of the School of Earth and Environment at Rowan University. RAZ: Which runs a dinosaur quarry in New Jersey. LACOVARA: Wonderful place. RAZ: Yeah. The New Jersey Turnpike doesn't exactly scream birthplace of paleontology. LACOVARA: It does not. RAZ: Yeah, because you just go by, like, factories and. . . LACOVARA: Yeah. RAZ: . . . You don't think about dinosaurs when you're there. LACOVARA: I do. RAZ: You do. (LAUGHTER)RAZ: You do when you're driving down the New Jersey Turnpike? LACOVARA: Well, I do because I know what geological formations I'm driving over. RAZ: OK. So just out of curiosity, driving down the New Jersey Turnpike, if you were, like, a dinosaur and you went back in time, what would that look like? LACOVARA: Well, if you were back in the Cretaceous Period - the last of the time of the dinosaurs - and you were driving from New York to Philadelphia on the New Jersey Turnpike, you would be driving across water. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WATER SPLASH)LACOVARA: . . . For the most part. So the coastline would be a little bit to the west of there. And so the dinosaurs that we find in New Jersey are what we call the bloat and float dinosaur. So these are dinosaurs that died on the beach, ended up in the water, probably initially sank when they get a lung full of water and then the body starts to decay. And as those decay gases build up in the body, the carcass floats. They become, like, this big giant bobbing meat buoy at sea. And as the body decays, then pieces of the skeleton start to drop out of the carcass and settle to the sea floor. And that's what we find in the Cretaceous deposits of New Jersey. RAZ: And those Cretaceous deposits mark a geological era. And eras are how geologists measure time. And they're usually created by these big, world-changing events. LACOVARA: And so when the dinosaurs go extinct and 75 percent of life goes extinct after a meteor hits the planet, that's an era boundary. That's when we change from the Mesozoic to the Cenozoic. RAZ: So think of an era kind of like an hour on the clock, right? It's a lot of time, tens of millions of years. And like an hour, it's made up of smaller increments. But instead of minutes and seconds, they're known as periods and epochs. LACOVARA: In our case, we are in the Cenozoic Era, which started at the end of the time of the dinosaurs. We are in the Quaternary Period, which is within the Cenozoic Era. And within the Quaternary, we are in the Holocene Epoch. RAZ: The Holocene Epoch, basically defined by the development of our human civilization. But in geological time, the Holocene is tiny, only the last 11,700 years, or basically since the end of the last ice age. LACOVARA: It's roughly correlated with that. The technical definition of the Holocene has to do with the extinction of a snail species in Sicily. RAZ: Oh, really? LACOVARA: Yeah. RAZ: Wow. Just one snail species? LACOVARA: They have to find a - yeah. They have to find a marker. . . RAZ: Wow. LACOVARA: . . . So other geologists can say, well, there it is. There's the snail, there's not the snail. That's when we set the boundary. RAZ: Humans, here's your age. A snail died in Italy. LACOVARA: Right. RAZ: Wow. LACOVARA: Yeah. RAZ: But here's the thing, a lot has changed since that snail died in Italy. We humans have made our presence felt on the planet more than any other species in Earth's history. And what that means for our future isn't yet clear. LACOVARA: And so it was Winston Churchill who said the further back you look, the further ahead you can see. And so if we want to know how the Earth's biosphere is going to respond to the things that humans are doing to the planet right now, the only evidence that we have is how biotic systems have responded in the past. RAZ: And based on the past several million years, we know the Earth goes through natural cycles of cooling. In fact, 20,000 years ago, most of North America was covered in a giant ice sheet. LACOVARA: Might have been a mile or more high at the North Pole, that extended all the way down to East Brunswick, N. J. or the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania or deep down into Illinois in the Midwest. Just south of that where southern New Jersey is, that was tundra. RAZ: And based on that past, we know that the Earth - it should be getting cooler right about now. LACOVARA: But it's not. It's getting warmer. And the divergence between where we know we ought to be and where we're going, we can attribute that to the human influence that we're having on the climate. RAZ: And for that reason, some scientists have proposed thinking about our place in geological history differently, that the world today is a lot different than it was when that snail died in Italy. And that we need a new term for a new epoch - the Anthropocene. LACOVARA: The Anthropocene essentially would be the time of human influence on the planet. That's controversial though, because geology is a retrospective discipline. The rocks of the Anthropocene haven't been deposited yet, really. But at the same time, I think it's a really useful tool in the same way that we would discuss the Iron Age or the Bronze Age. Certainly, we have entered into a new age on our planet. We're changing things, in many cases in irreparable ways, and that will certainly be recorded in the geological record. There's no doubt if you could go 5, 10, 15 million years into the future and dig down to 2016, you would be able to find the geological evidence that humans occupied the planet. RAZ: So today on the show, the Anthropocene. Ideas about a new human age, an age that's changing our planet in unprecedented ways, and what that might mean for our future. Ken Lacovara returns later with the story of one dinosaur that reveals a lot about where we're headed. But first, how should we relate to the idea of the Anthropocene right now?

And all it requires of you is this - that you change your posture for two minutes. SCOTT SIMON, HOST: More than 36 million people have watched Amy Cuddy give this TED Talk about power poses, like leaning back in your chair or standing with your hands on your hips, stances researchers said would make people feel more powerful or willing to take risks. But this week, professor Dana Carney, who was one of three scientists who conducted the research, said, quote, \"I do not have any faith in the embodied effects of power poses. \" We're joined now by Uri Simonsohn, a behavioral scientist at the Wharton School of Business. Thanks so much for being with us. URI SIMONSOHN: Oh, thank you for having me. SIMON: How do you think this went wrong? SIMONSOHN: Like much of science, early findings are tentative and should be followed up. That's, like, on one level. Now the other level, psychology has been changing a lot in the last five, six years. People have been doing more rigorous, more large-sample studies. And so the standards were lower, at least as seen from the current perspective. SIMON: Did alarm bells go off with you when you first heard about this? SIMONSOHN: The alarms for me came up recently, maybe a year ago, when a team of researchers in Switzerland failed to replicate it. And me and some co-authors, we have a tool - a statistical tool that allows to tell you if a body of work has what we call evidential value - if you should trust it. And when we apply that technique to the entire body of work on power-posing, we found that no, there's no reason to believe it. That doesn't mean that the effect couldn't be documented in the future. It just means the existing evidence for it doesn't have the value that you wish it had. SIMON: So with the advantage of hindsight, was the research flawed by inadequate design from the first? SIMONSOHN: The only thing I would say is it had a small sample. And it's funny because it's only six years ago, but a lot has changed. Studies back then, it was very common to have a small sample. Imagine you're doing a journalistic story, and so you ask one person a question and you don't quite like the answer. So you say, I'm going to ask five people and say best out of five. Out of five people. . . SIMON: Oh, you know journalism, don't you? SIMONSOHN: (Laughter) And say if after five people you don't get it, you say best out of 10. And once you have 10 people, if the answer looks good, then you stop. And so those kinds of things that seem innocent end up messing up the statistical analysis. SIMON: Should we take a clue from this when we read other studies? SIMONSOHN: Yeah. So if we're covering most recent studies, we should realize these are prototypes. The way we're about now about self-driving cars - all right? - it's promising. We think it's going to happen, but we're not reporting that the streets are filled with them right now. And a lot of the times when we have this prototype of ideas, the media and people like to think of them as, this is done. They're very well-informed guesses, but they're not solid knowledge that we should take for granted. SIMON: How difficult is it for - emotionally, if nothing else - for a scientist to say I was wrong? SIMONSOHN: I think it's incredibly difficult, and that's why I think very highly of Dana for having done this because, basically, what she did \"wrong,\" quote, unquote, is what people thought was normal when she did it. And what she's doing now is not normal. It is very unusual for somebody to look back at their own work and, coming forward publicly with nothing gain, and say, you know what, I don't think this is really there. That is very, very rare. SIMON: Professor Uri Simonsohn at the Wharton School of Business, thanks so much. SIMONSOHN: Thank you. SIMON: Before we spoke with Uri Simonsohn, we reached out to two of the researchers behind that original study. Dana Carney declined our request. Amy Cuddy said she stands by her conclusion that power poses cause people to feel more powerful and says this effect's been replicated in other studies. But she welcomes what she called constructive examinations of new findings as the research evolves.

But this week, professor Dana Carney, who was one of three scientists who conducted the research, said, quote, \"I do not have any faith in the embodied effects of power poses. \" We're joined now by Uri Simonsohn, a behavioral scientist at the Wharton School of Business. Thanks so much for being with us. URI SIMONSOHN: Oh, thank you for having me. SIMON: How do you think this went wrong? SIMONSOHN: Like much of science, early findings are tentative and should be followed up. That's, like, on one level. Now the other level, psychology has been changing a lot in the last five, six years. People have been doing more rigorous, more large-sample studies. And so the standards were lower, at least as seen from the current perspective. SIMON: Did alarm bells go off with you when you first heard about this? SIMONSOHN: The alarms for me came up recently, maybe a year ago, when a team of researchers in Switzerland failed to replicate it. And me and some co-authors, we have a tool - a statistical tool that allows to tell you if a body of work has what we call evidential value - if you should trust it. And when we apply that technique to the entire body of work on power-posing, we found that no, there's no reason to believe it. That doesn't mean that the effect couldn't be documented in the future. It just means the existing evidence for it doesn't have the value that you wish it had. SIMON: So with the advantage of hindsight, was the research flawed by inadequate design from the first? SIMONSOHN: The only thing I would say is it had a small sample. And it's funny because it's only six years ago, but a lot has changed. Studies back then, it was very common to have a small sample. Imagine you're doing a journalistic story, and so you ask one person a question and you don't quite like the answer. So you say, I'm going to ask five people and say best out of five. Out of five people. . . SIMON: Oh, you know journalism, don't you? SIMONSOHN: (Laughter) And say if after five people you don't get it, you say best out of 10. And once you have 10 people, if the answer looks good, then you stop. And so those kinds of things that seem innocent end up messing up the statistical analysis. SIMON: Should we take a clue from this when we read other studies? SIMONSOHN: Yeah. So if we're covering most recent studies, we should realize these are prototypes. The way we're about now about self-driving cars - all right? - it's promising. We think it's going to happen, but we're not reporting that the streets are filled with them right now. And a lot of the times when we have this prototype of ideas, the media and people like to think of them as, this is done. They're very well-informed guesses, but they're not solid knowledge that we should take for granted. SIMON: How difficult is it for - emotionally, if nothing else - for a scientist to say I was wrong? SIMONSOHN: I think it's incredibly difficult, and that's why I think very highly of Dana for having done this because, basically, what she did \"wrong,\" quote, unquote, is what people thought was normal when she did it. And what she's doing now is not normal. It is very unusual for somebody to look back at their own work and, coming forward publicly with nothing gain, and say, you know what, I don't think this is really there. That is very, very rare. SIMON: Professor Uri Simonsohn at the Wharton School of Business, thanks so much. SIMONSOHN: Thank you. SIMON: Before we spoke with Uri Simonsohn, we reached out to two of the researchers behind that original study. Dana Carney declined our request. Amy Cuddy said she stands by her conclusion that power poses cause people to feel more powerful and says this effect's been replicated in other studies. But she welcomes what she called constructive examinations of new findings as the research evolves.", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And the school is spending more than $100 million to refurbish the aging system. NPR's Joe Palca went to Morgantown to check out this bold idea. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: PRT is very different from conventional mass transit. Normally when you get on a subway or light rail, you get into a large car that can hold lots of people. And you stop at every stop on the line. With PRT, you get in a much smaller car. And your car only goes to your destination. It doesn't stop anywhere else. I'd come to Morgantown, population 30,000, to give a talk to graduate students. But I've been curious about PRT for a while. So I dragooned second-year pharmaceutical science student Tiffany Kornberg into taking me for a ride on it. Morgantown's PRT runs approximately 9 miles out from the city center, where Kornberg and I got on, to the university Medical Center. So is this useful? I mean, the PRT, is it good to have? TIFFANY KORNBERG: It's definitely easier than driving and trying to park. PALCA: We climbed the stairs to an elevated platform. There's a turnstile, 50 cents for visitors, free if you're a student. Before you can go through, you have to select the station you're traveling to. That's a key to using PRT. There are several of the boxy PRT cars stopped at the station, each holds about 18 people. They're brightly painted with the West Virginia University blue and gold colors. How do we know which car to get into? KORNBERG: It says right up there. When it dings, it'll show a name of whatever station it is. PALCA: The sign over one of the cars says Medical Center, which is where we're headed. And the car door opens. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR DOOR CLOSING)PALCA: We're in. We start off rattling down an elevated guideway at a good clip. I've got to tell you, I feel like I'm in a Disneyland ride. We approached the station at the engineering campus, but the car never slows down. And so this is the advantage of PRT. We would have stopped here, and nobody would have gotten off because nobody's - on this pod is going there. But with PRT, it just zips right past. Another PRT feature, if there's a midday lull and nobody is going anywhere, the cars just sit at a station and wait. And so the cool thing is you're not wasting resources of running empty cars up and down all day long just because the schedule says you have to. When we reached the Medical Center stop, I made my way to the office of Clement Solomon, who runs the PRT system. CLEMENT SOLOMON: This is one of the best-kept secrets and the transportation world. PALCA: Solomon says the system provides 15,000 rides a day, double that when there's a home football game. He says a few years ago, the university had to make a decision. The PRT cars were wearing out and the control system needed updating. Should they refurbish the PRT system or just abandon it? So they commissioned a study.

It's a big milestone for the most ambitious agreement ever to rein in global warming. The U. S. and China and a long list of other countries were already onboard, so the vote in Europe today means enough nations have now signed on to allow the plan to go forward. NPR's Christopher Joyce is here to talk more about it. And Chris, this agreement was drafted last December in Paris. What is the plan for how it will slow climate change? CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: The basic goal is to keep the world's average temperature from going up more than two degrees Celsius - that's three and a half degrees Fahrenheit - above what it was before the Industrial Revolution. And if it does, scientists say we're in big trouble. And this is where sea level rise and massive drought and the other effects of climate change are really going to get a lot more serious than they have been so far. And to do that, each country makes a voluntary pledge to do the best it can. And this agreement, unlike the previous agreements, includes all countries rich and poor, almost every country in the world. CORNISH: Almost - right? - I mean this European vote today - it reached an important threshold. JOYCE: It did. The Paris agreement was written such that it would not go into effect until at least 55 signatories, nations agreed and ratified it. And they had to represent over 55 percent of all the greenhouse gas emissions on the planet. And that happened, but nothing really is going to happen until the hard work is done, and that's what happens next. The U. N. has to decide how to enforce this. They have to come up with rules on how to monitor nations to make sure they live up to their pledges. There's a hundred billion dollar a year fund that's supposed to come together by 2020. Rich countries are supposed to put that money up for developing countries to green-up their economies. And of course each country has to figure out how it's going to live up to this pledge. So all this is yet to be done. CORNISH: What does that mean for the U. S. ? What's the federal government here promising to do to reduce emissions? JOYCE: The U. S. is already fairly far along the way. It's reduced its emissions already by about 10 percent over the last 15 years. But President Obama promised by 2025 that the U. S. would reduce its emissions by 26 to 28 percent below what they were in 2005. A lot of numbers there, but basically it's a 25 percent cut. And you know, that's not going to be easy. The - part of the problem is the linchpin for that plan is a new regulation - the Clean Power Plan - which reduces emissions from coal-fired power plants. That's caught up in the courts. So how well the U. S. can live up to that is yet to be seen. CORNISH: Plus of course we have an election going on. There could be a new president with different priorities. JOYCE: We do have an election going on. (Inaudible). CORNISH: You might have heard of it, yeah (laughter). JOYCE: And there's quite a difference in the candidates because Hillary Clinton says she'll support the Paris Agreement, and Donald Trump says he would not. Officially, once you've signed on, you have to stick for four years. But you know, the U. N. doesn't have a police force to come and enforce that. CORNISH: But to step back for a moment and look at the whole agreement, do we know it would actually work? JOYCE: Oh, I don't know that anybody knows for sure. Eighty percent of the world's energy comes from fossil fuels. That is tremendous change in the world's energy economy that has come about. And research so far shows that these pledges, even if they're met under the Paris Agreement, are not going to keep us below two degrees. That's why the agreement requires people to come back every five years and renegotiate and try to ratchet the emissions down every five years. That said, at least now there's an agreement that includes almost every country in the world, rich and poor, and they're all playing supposedly by the same rules.

I'm Terry Gross. The other day when I was at an Amtrak station, a handsome dog on a leash came by and sniffed me. I passed the test. This was a working dog, trained to detect traces of explosives. Dogs are good at detecting explosives and other illegal substances as well as pests like bedbugs and even certain cancers because of their acute sense of smell. We're going to talk about what makes it possible for dogs to perceive scents that we can't. My guest, Alexandra Horowitz, is the author of a new book about dogs' sense of smell called \"Being A Dog. \" She's best known for her best-seller \"Inside Of A Dog. \" She's also the founder of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College. Alexandra Horowitz, welcome to FRESH AIR. Dogs have been used to hunt and track people. But now because of their great sense of smell, they're being used in new ways, being relied on in ways that they've never been relied on before. Give us some examples. ALEXANDRA HOROWITZ: The types of work that dogs now do as detection dogs is really stunning. And I don't think we've reached the capacity of what dogs are able to do. So dogs are, as we know, able to find explosives and drugs with some high acuity. They also are really good at finding us, finding missing people, whether dead or alive. But they're also used to detect goods that are brought into the country illegally, whether that's mango or bananas. They're also used to find animals whose population we're trying to count through detecting their scat. They can smell out illicit cellphones or computers if trained on the electronic components. So they're really used widely as detection dogs. GROSS: They're being used now to determine if certain tumors are cancerous? HOROWITZ: Yeah, one of the most amazing things is that, accidentally, researchers discovered that dogs could detect melanoma. The accident was that there were individual dogs who were persistently smelling something on their owners. When their owners finally went to a doctor and had it checked out, it turned out to be a melanoma. And so since that time, there's been a budding research program in training dogs to detect various cancers on the breath, in urine, in blood and on the skin. And most of these programs report very high levels of success. Dogs are definitely able to detect whatever it is in the cell that makes it cancerous. GROSS: And, of course, dogs are being used to detect explosives in train stations and airports. HOROWITZ: You almost can't go to an airport anymore without seeing a dog. So it's becoming a familiar part of our life. And I think that's just the tip of the iceberg. GROSS: And bedbugs, dogs are being used to detect bedbugs. HOROWITZ: Yeah. I'm sorry to say. . . GROSS: Thank you, dogs. (LAUGHTER)HOROWITZ: We even had a bedbug detection dog come through our house and find nothing, happily. But there are some dogs, especially beagles, who are trained to detect not just the bedbugs but the trace of the bedbugs. In other words, the skin slough - the casing sloughed off or the excreta of the bedbugs and determine if you have a problem before you are bitten. GROSS: You write that explosive detection dogs can smell a trillionth of a gram of an explosive. I mean, that's such a minuscule amount. Can dogs smell, like, the remnant of an odor in such a microscopic size? HOROWITZ: It does seem as though what they're detecting at that really low, low, low threshold is kind of almost the trace left behind by an object. You know, if we thought of putting a cup down that you've held on a table and picking it up, we would think that the cup is gone. But it's some low level - the cup has left a trace of itself. And if you touch a surface and lift your hand, you have left a trace of yourself that has an odor. And the dogs can detect that. GROSS: So compare a dog's nose with our nose. Let's start with the fact that dogs' noses have stereoscopic capability. They can smell separately with each nostril. HOROWITZ: Precisely so. I mean, starting at the nostril, their nostrils are doing a little bit better work than ours are. They have all this musculature - we do as well with our nose, but theirs really allows them to get a different odor sample with each nostril, especially up close, which might be why they bring their noses close to things, one of the reasons. Then they have this amazing long snout, many dogs, which humidifies and filters the air and kind of rushes the air up to the back of the nose. We both have that same apparatus, but ours is less complex. And at the end of the nose, right sort of between the eyes, we both have a little patch of tissue called the olfactory epithelium, which has the receptor cells, the ones that really grab the odors and are going to send the signal to the brain. The dogs, it has just hundreds of millions more receptor cells than ours does. And that's probably partially responsible for their increased acuity. GROSS: Does that mean they can smell more categories of things as well as being more sensitive to particles of smell? HOROWITZ: Precisely. I think they have more types of receptors, which allows them to smell more types of things that we might not discriminate at all, and probably that increased number translates to them having an increased sensitivity to the very existence of a substance. GROSS: So let's get back to the stereoscopic nostrils. Why do they have separate control of each nostril? How does that help them? HOROWITZ: It makes sense to have the nostrils work independently just the same way as it makes sense to have our eyes get a different snapshot of the world so that we can create three-dimensional representation of what's out there. Binocular vision is the same as kind of stereo olfaction for a visual creature. That allows them to not only detect whether a smell is there but where in space it might be. Is it more to my left? Is it more to my right? Is it in front of me? Is it behind me? Creating a picture of the world through smell. GROSS: The dogs' exhale is different from ours, too, and adds to their ability to detect and identify smell. Can you describe the exhale, what happens there? HOROWITZ: I love the fact that not only is the dog sniff different than ours but their exhale is different. I mean, it goes so deep, the differences between us. And in this case, researchers looking at the fluid dynamics of airflow found that dogs exhale through the side slits of their nose. So they inhale through the nostrils but exhale through the side. And what that does is it allows the odors that they've inhaled to stay in there a little bit longer in the back of the nose. When you want to get a smell out of your nose, you can exhale it out. You can kind of push it out with an exhale. But dogs don't push all the smell out with a single exhale. It's like a circular breathing of smelling. And it also creates a little puff on the ground, a puff of air that might actually allow more odor molecules to come up toward their nose to be sniffed. GROSS: And they also have what you describe as a second nose under their nose. HOROWITZ: Right. They have vomeronasal organ, which is a small sac above the roof of the mouth under the nose, which allows them to detect other chemicals, especially things like pheromones and other hormones which are water soluble, which aren't volatile, aren't - don't evaporate in the air. And so that allows them - like other animals that have the vomeronasal organ to detect hormones on other members of their species and even other species. GROSS: So now that you've told us a little bit about how dogs perceive the world through their sense of smell, let's talk about some of the things they can smell that we just can't. I mean, you've talked about detection dogs. But, like, you say normal dogs, dogs who aren't working dogs, can smell, for instance, that it's afternoon or they can smell that it's a new day. They can kind of tell time through their sense of smell. How do they do that? HOROWITZ: I think this is one of the more intriguing things about imagining the olfactory world to a creature like a dog. Smells tell time. In other words, a strong odor is probably newer odor, laid down more recently. A weaker odor is something that was left in the past. So in being able to detect the concentration of a smell, they're really seeing not only what it is but how long ago it was left. So the past, for instance, when you walk outside your door is underfoot, who's walked by, what, you know, skin have they sloughed, leaving some evidence of their voyage, what animals have passed by and the future, in a way, is smelled on a breeze from up ahead or around a corner. So I feel like time has rubber-banded for dogs through smell, and it also allows them to detect things which we don't think are really visible yet. Like, dogs often are said to be able to detect an upcoming storm. One of the reasons this might be is that when a low-pressure system moves in, the air above the ground kind of feels extra roomy and the earth loosens its grip on odors within it, and they become volatile. They evaporate and go up in the air, and the dog can detect that. And you might see a change in their behavior when they notice this new smell. GROSS: But how can they smell that it's afternoon? What does afternoon smell like compared to morning? HOROWITZ: Well, smells in a room change as the day goes on. Hot air rises, and it usually rises in currents along the walls and will rise to the ceiling and go kind of to the center of the room and drop. And so if we were able to visualize the movement of air through the day, what we're really visualizing is the movement of odor through the day. In the mid-afternoon, you might feel tangibly on your skin that - or see through the light in the window that it's afternoon, and the sun is halfway in the middle of the sky. The dog, I think, can smell that through the movement of that air through a room. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Horowitz. She's the author of the best-seller \"Inside Of A Dog. \" Now she has a new book called \"Being A Dog\" that's all about dogs' sense of smell. She also founded the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College. We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Horowitz. She's the author of the best-seller \"Inside Of A Dog,\" and now she has a new book called \"Being A Dog\" that's about how a dog understands the world through its sense of smell. She's also the founder of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College. Does the size of a dog's nose determine how much a dog can detect through the sense of smell? I mean, for instance, some dogs have like really long snouts and some dogs have basically like two little nostrils on their face. HOROWITZ: (Laughter) Right. Well, to some extent, yes, but for the most part the snout - it's this humidifying, warming chamber that hurries air to the part of the nose which really smells the odors. It doesn't matter truly if it's short or long. I mean, I think the dogs who are better smellers are usually long-nose dogs. They both will have hundreds of millions of olfactory receptors, those receptors that catch odors in the back of their nose. But it is true that these short-nose dogs are seen to be slightly less good smellers, and that's because we've basically bred these dogs to have slightly different shaped skulls. And they don't have all the equipment that a long-nose dog will. So you rarely see pugs, for instance, acting as explosive detection dogs. GROSS: Right - or never see them is probably more. . . HOROWITZ: Oh, yeah, no - maybe never. But they'd still be a lot better than we would. GROSS: If dogs are so good at detecting odors, why are they not repelled by their own smelliness when they get really filthy or they rolled in something really foul? HOROWITZ: It's not obvious that it is foul or smelly in that sense to a dog. In other words, I think when you try to imagine a world made of smells, smells become less binary than they are to us. For us, they're often really pleasant or really unpleasant. You know, I like freshly baked bread, and I really don't like garbage that's sat on the summer in - on the street in New York City. But, for dogs, those smells are just information. They're information about what's out there, and I don't think they levy the same judgment on smells. Just like when you walk into a room and you see a lot of visual information, we're not saying, oh, that's really a bad color. That's really a bad image. That's really a great one. We're just seeing it as a room. GROSS: But dogs eat things that they shouldn't eat because it's not good for them. In fact, it might be really toxic. And the offensive odor doesn't seem to necessarily put them off. HOROWITZ: It's true, for instance. . . GROSS: With people, you know, like a really foul odor, it's a warning this is rotten. You really should not be eating it. HOROWITZ: Yeah. And it can be a disorder if a dog is, for instance, eating their own feces. Most dogs are not doing that. They are avoiding things like that, and yet, they might eat another species' feces and that's - it's a little bit maladaptive, but it also indicates that the smell isn't any longer bad to them, that there's something else attractive in that smell. They roll in things like that. People have a few theories as to why they might. It might be to kind of camouflage their own scent or maybe because it makes them more popular because they have this really stinky thing on them, among other dogs. Or maybe they just like the scent. It's hard for us to imagine that they like scents that we find offensive, but it seems to be the case. GROSS: You know, when I put lotion on my hands when my cat is on my lap or sitting next to me, I wonder will the cat still know it's me because I've just put something on my hands that's going to mask my odor and replace it with the lotion odor. And I'm wondering like with dogs when you've like come out of the shower after having soap - you know, used a fragrant soap or if you've put lotion on your hands - or, say, you're somebody who wears perfume or something - does the dog recognize that you're still you? HOROWITZ: I think that's a great question. We are, I think, somewhat hidden by these smells that we layer on our smell. But our smell, the smell of us, is profound to the dog. I mean, each one of us, no matter how clean you are, really stinks. We're giving off a haze of odor and molecules that the dog not only detects, but comes to recognize as us. So a perfume or a fragrance soap might put them off for a second. There might be a moment of lack of recognition, but if they can get a little closer or get on the other side of the - of a breeze, then they'll recognize you instantly. We all have a really - an identifying smell to the dog. GROSS: We've all had the experience of going to visit the home of a friend where we haven't been before. The friend has a dog. The first thing they do when you arrive is greet you by smelling your crotch, which is embarrassing for everybody. So why do dogs do that? HOROWITZ: It's a really smelly place. I mean, dogs are extremely good at honing in on the parts of us that happen to smell. And we secrete a lot of smells from a couple of parts of our body - the crotch, the armpits, the mouth. You know, one of the things you can do when you don't like that, which most people don't, is give them something else to smell. You know, they might be preoccupied with the smell of your ear, for instance. We have lots of glands that give off odors around our face, and that might suffice to be information about you. That's all the dog is trying to get, information. I love that we often feel like the dog is being impolite in that case. And many people will not unreasonably train their dogs not to do that. But I also see it as just the dog's way of discovering who you are, and we are our smell to them. GROSS: So you did this amazing experiment with what you call a pee poll in a New York park (laughter). What was the poll? And what were you looking for? HOROWITZ: Right, and we're still doing this experiment in New York City's Riverside Park, where we set up a pee post, essentially, which is just a place where a dog might mark, might leave an identifying bit of pee. And we set a camera up to capture instances of dogs visiting this. And what I'm trying to do is do some basic research about what dogs are doing when they mark. What we know from some research of feral dogs and free-ranging dogs is that dogs aren't doing what we mostly think they are doing when they mark, which is marking territory. Dogs don't have territorial marking pee like wolves do. They'll go around their home range and pee right around the perimeter so that any intruder will know that they're entering someone else's territory. What would be that home range for dogs? It's obvious that they no longer have that kind of perception of the world. They don't have home ranges. They do mark along shared paths, what researchers like to call runways. So if you encounter a lamp post or a fire hydrant and/or a tree trunk on your regular walk and lots of other dogs, too, chances are that dogs will mark all of these places. But what they're doing with this information, we're not exactly sure. So I was looking at all the behaviors around dogs sniffing of these marked spots of the pee post and what they do afterwards. GROSS: What did you learn? HOROWITZ: Well, thus far, it looks like there are a couple of interesting characteristics of the marking. First, they sniff a lot more than they mark. So it's not that every dog comes, notices that someone's been there before and then has to leave their own mark. It's really not territorial or dominance related. Also, they often look up after they sniff. And it's really hard to see, I think, for most owners when their dog is looking somewhere what might actually be happening, which is often that they're smelling somewhere. And if you look, their noses are working. You can see their noses working. They're probably smelling after the dog who has left that mark. My favorite observation is just that dogs don't come back to check again later. You know, they don't go to smell their own pee and see, has anybody covered this? - which I find fascinating. GROSS: So have you basically - have you found that dogs identify themselves with pee in the same way that, like, a graffiti writer might to say that they were there (laughter)? HOROWITZ: I would say that I don't know conclusively what they're doing yet. They might be leaving a little message, like a message you tack on a bulletin board, for other dogs with information about who they are and what they've eaten today and how healthy they are and what sex they are and maybe even how old they are and so forth. But they never come back to check on other messages that are left in response. So it's not obvious to me why they would leave those messages. It might just be a vestige of having been wolves or something like wolves thousands of years ago. GROSS: My guest is Alexandra Horowitz, author of the new book \"Being A Dog. \" After a break, she'll share her concern that pet dogs are at risk of losing some of their sense of smell. And she'll tell us about her own dogs. And Ken Tucker will review the debut album by singer-songwriter Lucy Dacus. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Alexandra Horowitz. Her new book \"Being A Dog\" is about how dogs rely on their sense of smell to perceive the world around them. She's also the author of the best-seller \"Inside Of A Dog,\" and she's the founder of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, where she conducts research on dog behavior and perception. Because urine is filled with information, if you have a dog's nose, you've been studying urine. And in one of your experiments you captured dog urine so that you could do what with it? HOROWITZ: Yeah. We spend a surprisingly large amount of time thinking about dog urine in our Dog Cognition Lab, I'm sorry to say - maybe not what researchers who work with me thought they would be doing. Yeah. I got very interested in a test of self-recognition that's done with other animals. It's called the mirror mark test where animals are shown a mirror. Once they become accustomed to the fact that that mirror is not another animal in front of them, they are surreptitiously marked on their heads for instance and then presented with the mirror again. And the researchers look to see if they see the mirror as showing them something about themselves and move to remove that mark. Chimpanzees pass this test. They seem to have some measure of self-recognition. Dolphins pass the test. One elephant has passed the test. Dogs don't seem to pass this test, but I was a little surprised about that. It feels like they certainly can identify themselves and distinguish themselves from others. So I figured, well, one of the reasons they might not be passing this test is because they aren't visual creatures primarily. And they also aren't grooming creatures. If they have something funny on their body, they don't seem to be worried about that and want to remove it. Like, you know, when we see that spinach caught between our teeth in the mirror, the first thing we do is remove it. They seem ambivalent. So I designed a little bit of an olfactory test. We gather a little bit of their urine - a very small amount - and other substances and, in canisters, simply allow them to sniff these different canisters. And we were seeing how long they sniffed each one of the canisters. What we found is that one of the canisters - we use their own urine and another we used their urine and we marked it with something else - sort of like the mark that was put on the chimpanzee's head - with another substance, basically. And we looked at how long they sniffed both of those. They're very uninterested in sniffing their own pee, even when discovered out of context like this. And they were much more interested in their own pee when it had been changed by this mark. So that seems to me some measure of the beginning of recognition of self. I'm interested in that smell, but only if something's off about it. GROSS: So what does that tell you? Why is that important, knowing that? HOROWITZ: I think that maybe dogs are - do have some measure of self-recognition, that they are identifying themselves. Maybe they don't think about themselves with the autobiographical eye that that humans do, but that they're recognizing themselves and their own smells, and they affiliate with them and can distinguish them from other dogs' smells. That's an important step in cognition. When we talk about human development, even kids don't recognize themselves in their first year or two. But when they do, they really have a fuller appreciation of their social world, and I think dogs have that. GROSS: You know, we talked earlier about how working dogs are being used in incredible ways now - to sniff out bed bugs, to detect certain cancerous tumors. In your book, you mentioned that some working dogs are being used to sniff out in advance when somebody is about to have an epileptic seizure or whether they're about to go into diabetic shock, which is - it's pretty remarkable things that these dogs can do. But at the same time, you point out that some domestic dogs are losing some of their sense of smell. Why are they losing it? HOROWITZ: People really don't encourage dogs to smell very much. One - the one thing that detection dogs do is go and find an odor that they've been trained on. In all circumstances - every day for a detection dog's life is them getting up, being brought to a situation, told to find an odor of some sort, finding it perhaps and getting to play with a toy as a reward. So they're expressly told to smell. But in a pet dog's life, they're usually told not to smell, right? They - as you say, when they greet someone - a visitor to the house - you know, they go to smell the person and they're discouraged from smelling the person. If - many people don't like to be licked by their dogs. If they're sniffing things by a tree trunk or a fire hydrant outside, their dogs - their owners might pull their dogs away. Now it's becoming even more popular to not have dogs sniff each other up close for fear that one dog might be too aggressive or maybe just impolite. So they're discouraged from smelling in their ordinary life often. And I don't think they lose their ability to smell, but they lose their predisposition to smell. They're kind of living in our visual world, and they start attending to our pointing and our gestures and our facial expressions more and less to smells. GROSS: After you started doing research about how a dog uses its sense of smell, how it perceives the world through its sense of smell, you started taking your dogs on smell walks. What do you do and why are you doing it? HOROWITZ: Well, I really am trying to counter what I and lots of owners have done our whole lives, which is discourage smelling. And in fact, instead I'm trying to embrace it. So on a smell walk, really, I just let the dog choose what we're going to do and where we're going to go and how long we're going to stay there. So sometimes we don't get off our front step for a little while because as soon as you open the door, the dog is faced with a new day. And the air holds odor that - where a trace of who or what's passed by. Then we might spend a little time with a little tree guard - the iron railing that surrounds a tree - which has leavings from, presumably, other dogs who have passed by. And I just let the dog take charge. Sometimes our walks are pretty much standing around actually, but I think that the dog is enjoying himself. GROSS: You know, dogs recognize us from our odors, but we don't really want to smell. You know, if you say to somebody, you smell, that's usually not a good thing. Have you changed your attitude about your own body odors? HOROWITZ: I've changed my attitude about all odors, really, from all this practice intentionally smelling. I mean, I never was one to wear a lot of perfume to begin with. Now actually, I like perfumes more as a kind of odor one might wear, but not because it would cover up my own odor. I think I am a little less worried, maybe to the chagrin of those around me, about having an odor. I just see it as a natural part of being a biological creature. And I really do celebrate, as I saw sometimes with these olfactory experts, some of the bad smells in the way that I didn't used to celebrate them. So a smell of garbage, for instance, is more just information about the fact that there's garbage near rather than being something hugely off-putting and offensive - that's the way I used to find it - and something that affected me. And now I'd feel, oh, well, yeah. I mean, there's garbage, and that's the strong smell of garbage. HOROWITZ: Isn't that interesting? GROSS: So I'm interested in the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard that you created and still run. What kinds of experiments do you do there? HOROWITZ: I started this lab because I used to do simple experiments on my own, but students really wanted to be involved. And there was this burgeoning world of dog cognition, which 20 years ago, didn't exist, but had a little momentum. And so I basically asked people to join me in the lab, so that I could do slightly more complex experiments. I do really simple behavioral experiments, which try to ask and answer questions that I'm interested in. And I also do a lot of natural observations of dogs, for instance, interacting with their owners in play or playing themselves - to see if I can deconstruct what's going on in those interactions. Some of the experiments I do are testing, for instance, anthropomorphisms, attributions that we make of dogs. One of my favorites was of the guilty look. Dogs show this guilty look, pulling their ears back and pulling their tail under their body or turning away. Often, owners know when they've done something wrong. So it's fair for people to say that dogs look guilty. But I thought, that's a strange attribution. How can we be sure that dogs are guilty? And so I did a little test to see if the guilty look popped up only when they'd done something wrong or in any other circumstance. GROSS: What did you find? HOROWITZ: And it's a really simple experiment. And I found that the guilty look showed up more often when they were being scolded or about to be scolded by their owners, whether or not they'd done something wrong. And so it looks like we really prompt the dogs to put on this look, which is probably more aptly described as a submissive look or a concerned look, than a guilty look. I'm not saying that dogs don't feel guilt. They very well might, but this look isn't showing us that. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Horowitz. She's the author of the best-seller \"Inside Of A Dog\" and now the new book \"Being A Dog,\" which is about how dogs perceive the world through their sense of smell. She's also the founder of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College. We're going to take a short break here, and then we'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Horowitz. Her new book is called \"Being A Dog: Following The Dog Into A World Of Smell. \" She's also the founder of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College. Tell us about the dogs you have now. HOROWITZ: Upton is a large, mixed-breed mongrel dog - probably a Plott Hound and Great Dane mix - well, well mixed - that we got. We got him when he was 3 and a half years old. And he's a really goofy, large, sweet dog. And I also have Finnegan, who we've lived with for about eight years, who's also a mixed-breed, maybe Lab mix. I consider Finnegan kind of a professional dog. He's much more cooperative in listening to us, wants to kind of follow our lead a lot more. And he's the one I took with me in this book to do a few smelling projects because I was really interested in how much we could kind of open up his nose and make him a smelling dog again. GROSS: How did you find your dogs? HOROWITZ: Both of my dogs, we found in shelters. I went to shelters - I don't go to shelters very much because it's really hard for me to not adopt an animal when I see an animal at a shelter. They all look so wonderful. But we went to a shelter in Queens and found Finnegan. Long ago as a puppy, he was sick. And we brought him out, and he leaned against me, and boy, that really grabbed me. So we took him. And then a few years later, I had my son. And Finnegan was displaced as the primary child in the family. And so a few years after that, we decided to get another dog - probably as a companion, we thought, for Finnegan. And we went again to a shelter and met this great, galumphing, funny creature, who became Upton. And now we have a two-dog family. GROSS: With Upton, how did you know that he was the dog for you? HOROWITZ: It was not obvious, I would say, with a 3-and-a-half-year-old dog who'd been given up twice to a shelter. But he recognized me after just a few minutes. We met him. We played with him in a little room. We put him back. And then I returned, and he recognized us. And we know this about dogs, that they actually form attachments really fast in shelters if they see somebody again and again. And this large dog, showing recognition and wagging happily, you know, thunk, thunk, thunk on the bottom of his cage is - you know, my heart can't handle that. GROSS: (Laughter). HOROWITZ: We had to take him home. GROSS: Did you have any reservations about adopting a dog that was 3 and a half years old and had already been returned once to the shelter? HOROWITZ: No. But you know what? It's great to get a slightly older dog. Puppies are just wonderful. But there are so many dogs that are returned to shelters that I know that if I was going to get a second dog, I wanted to contribute to reducing those numbers. And dogs are so flexible. You know, this dog, Upton, has some fears. He's not a perfect city dog. You know, the sounds of a city are difficult for him. But he's so agreeable, ultimately, as most dogs are, and sort of cooperative in working their way into the family, that a lot of things can happen to a dog, and they'll still turn and trust the next person and give it a shot. GROSS: So you wanted to find a dog who'd been returned to a shelter. Did you go into the shelter and say, who's been returned to you? HOROWITZ: Well, all these dogs. . . GROSS: Show me a dog nobody seems to want. (LAUGHTER)HOROWITZ: Well, a big dog is an especially hard sell, I think. And older dogs even older than that, are hard sells because people want to have a lifetime with the dog, which is understandable. But yeah, we did go looking for especially an older dog. And, you know, I like the look of him. You have to like the way a dog looks and the way they act around you andHOROWITZ: And the feeling that they're somehow recognizing you is important, and he had all of those things. GROSS: Has your approach to training dogs changed over the years? HOROWITZ: I should say that my dogs are not really trained, per se. I don't - I'm not - I never - I'm not a dog trainer, and I've never been that concerned with making them super polite. You know, they - I train them to do the things that they need to do in emergency and to protect themselves and others. They can come, and they'll sit for me and so forth. But, you know, I'm less concerned about keeping them off the bed or the couch than maybe I would have been when I first was a dog owner. In fact, I don't try to keep them off the bed or the couch. It's perfectly fine with me if they're sitting when we're sitting. And I understand the urge. That's where I like to sit, too. And I - I'm very willing to have them off leash and run around as long as they'll come back to me and not interfere with other people. So I don't think that they're really heavily trained. I like them to be dog-like. GROSS: So some readers know your dog Pumpernickel from your previous book, and Pumpernickel is no longer with us. How did Pumpernickel die? HOROWITZ: She died of being very old, which I was fortunate. You know, that almost never happens. She died at almost. . . GROSS: How did you know it was time? HOROWITZ: Well, she had slowed down to the point of stopping, essentially, and she was 17 years old. It wasn't surprising when she stopped enjoying things that she usually enjoyed like, you know, a little lick of peanut butter on a finger or a small game of rough and tumble or jostling each other. And I knew that she wasn't really experiencing life. GROSS: And did you take her to the vet or did the vet come to you? HOROWITZ: A vet came to us. It's really one of the more heartbreaking things I've had to do in my life. And, you know, her life ended with me. And when she died, I thought - I was impossibly sad. I mean, I really wrote \"Inside Of A Dog\" kind of as a tribute to her, thinking about her. And I probably spent a year, which is maybe not extraordinary for people who live with dogs, really, really glum and sad and thinking that it was impossible that she was gone. And that's about how long it took before I decided to get another dog as well. I did realize that I couldn't live in a space that didn't have another, you know, happy, breathing, wagging creature in it, and that's how we went and met Finnegan. GROSS: I want to thank you so much for talking with us. HOROWITZ: It's been my utter pleasure. Thank you, Terry. GROSS: Alexandra Horowitz is the author of the new book \"Being A Dog. \" She founded the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College. After we take a short break, rock critic Ken Tucker will review the debut album by Lucy Dacus. This is FRESH AIR. TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. The other day when I was at an Amtrak station, a handsome dog on a leash came by and sniffed me. I passed the test. This was a working dog, trained to detect traces of explosives. Dogs are good at detecting explosives and other illegal substances as well as pests like bedbugs and even certain cancers because of their acute sense of smell. We're going to talk about what makes it possible for dogs to perceive scents that we can't. My guest, Alexandra Horowitz, is the author of a new book about dogs' sense of smell called \"Being A Dog. \" She's best known for her best-seller \"Inside Of A Dog. \" She's also the founder of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College. Alexandra Horowitz, welcome to FRESH AIR. Dogs have been used to hunt and track people. But now because of their great sense of smell, they're being used in new ways, being relied on in ways that they've never been relied on before. Give us some examples. ALEXANDRA HOROWITZ: The types of work that dogs now do as detection dogs is really stunning. And I don't think we've reached the capacity of what dogs are able to do. So dogs are, as we know, able to find explosives and drugs with some high acuity. They also are really good at finding us, finding missing people, whether dead or alive. But they're also used to detect goods that are brought into the country illegally, whether that's mango or bananas. They're also used to find animals whose population we're trying to count through detecting their scat. They can smell out illicit cellphones or computers if trained on the electronic components. So they're really used widely as detection dogs. GROSS: They're being used now to determine if certain tumors are cancerous? HOROWITZ: Yeah, one of the most amazing things is that, accidentally, researchers discovered that dogs could detect melanoma. The accident was that there were individual dogs who were persistently smelling something on their owners. When their owners finally went to a doctor and had it checked out, it turned out to be a melanoma. And so since that time, there's been a budding research program in training dogs to detect various cancers on the breath, in urine, in blood and on the skin. And most of these programs report very high levels of success. Dogs are definitely able to detect whatever it is in the cell that makes it cancerous. GROSS: And, of course, dogs are being used to detect explosives in train stations and airports. HOROWITZ: You almost can't go to an airport anymore without seeing a dog. So it's becoming a familiar part of our life. And I think that's just the tip of the iceberg. GROSS: And bedbugs, dogs are being used to detect bedbugs. HOROWITZ: Yeah. I'm sorry to say. . . GROSS: Thank you, dogs. (LAUGHTER) HOROWITZ: We even had a bedbug detection dog come through our house and find nothing, happily. But there are some dogs, especially beagles, who are trained to detect not just the bedbugs but the trace of the bedbugs. In other words, the skin slough - the casing sloughed off or the excreta of the bedbugs and determine if you have a problem before you are bitten. GROSS: You write that explosive detection dogs can smell a trillionth of a gram of an explosive. I mean, that's such a minuscule amount. Can dogs smell, like, the remnant of an odor in such a microscopic size? HOROWITZ: It does seem as though what they're detecting at that really low, low, low threshold is kind of almost the trace left behind by an object. You know, if we thought of putting a cup down that you've held on a table and picking it up, we would think that the cup is gone. But it's some low level - the cup has left a trace of itself. And if you touch a surface and lift your hand, you have left a trace of yourself that has an odor. And the dogs can detect that. GROSS: So compare a dog's nose with our nose. Let's start with the fact that dogs' noses have stereoscopic capability. They can smell separately with each nostril. HOROWITZ: Precisely so. I mean, starting at the nostril, their nostrils are doing a little bit better work than ours are. They have all this musculature - we do as well with our nose, but theirs really allows them to get a different odor sample with each nostril, especially up close, which might be why they bring their noses close to things, one of the reasons. Then they have this amazing long snout, many dogs, which humidifies and filters the air and kind of rushes the air up to the back of the nose. We both have that same apparatus, but ours is less complex. And at the end of the nose, right sort of between the eyes, we both have a little patch of tissue called the olfactory epithelium, which has the receptor cells, the ones that really grab the odors and are going to send the signal to the brain. The dogs, it has just hundreds of millions more receptor cells than ours does. And that's probably partially responsible for their increased acuity. GROSS: Does that mean they can smell more categories of things as well as being more sensitive to particles of smell? HOROWITZ: Precisely. I think they have more types of receptors, which allows them to smell more types of things that we might not discriminate at all, and probably that increased number translates to them having an increased sensitivity to the very existence of a substance. GROSS: So let's get back to the stereoscopic nostrils. Why do they have separate control of each nostril? How does that help them? HOROWITZ: It makes sense to have the nostrils work independently just the same way as it makes sense to have our eyes get a different snapshot of the world so that we can create three-dimensional representation of what's out there. Binocular vision is the same as kind of stereo olfaction for a visual creature. That allows them to not only detect whether a smell is there but where in space it might be. Is it more to my left? Is it more to my right? Is it in front of me? Is it behind me? Creating a picture of the world through smell. GROSS: The dogs' exhale is different from ours, too, and adds to their ability to detect and identify smell. Can you describe the exhale, what happens there? HOROWITZ: I love the fact that not only is the dog sniff different than ours but their exhale is different. I mean, it goes so deep, the differences between us. And in this case, researchers looking at the fluid dynamics of airflow found that dogs exhale through the side slits of their nose. So they inhale through the nostrils but exhale through the side. And what that does is it allows the odors that they've inhaled to stay in there a little bit longer in the back of the nose. When you want to get a smell out of your nose, you can exhale it out. You can kind of push it out with an exhale. But dogs don't push all the smell out with a single exhale. It's like a circular breathing of smelling. And it also creates a little puff on the ground, a puff of air that might actually allow more odor molecules to come up toward their nose to be sniffed. GROSS: And they also have what you describe as a second nose under their nose. HOROWITZ: Right. They have vomeronasal organ, which is a small sac above the roof of the mouth under the nose, which allows them to detect other chemicals, especially things like pheromones and other hormones which are water soluble, which aren't volatile, aren't - don't evaporate in the air. And so that allows them - like other animals that have the vomeronasal organ to detect hormones on other members of their species and even other species. GROSS: So now that you've told us a little bit about how dogs perceive the world through their sense of smell, let's talk about some of the things they can smell that we just can't. I mean, you've talked about detection dogs. But, like, you say normal dogs, dogs who aren't working dogs, can smell, for instance, that it's afternoon or they can smell that it's a new day. They can kind of tell time through their sense of smell. How do they do that? HOROWITZ: I think this is one of the more intriguing things about imagining the olfactory world to a creature like a dog. Smells tell time. In other words, a strong odor is probably newer odor, laid down more recently. A weaker odor is something that was left in the past. So in being able to detect the concentration of a smell, they're really seeing not only what it is but how long ago it was left. So the past, for instance, when you walk outside your door is underfoot, who's walked by, what, you know, skin have they sloughed, leaving some evidence of their voyage, what animals have passed by and the future, in a way, is smelled on a breeze from up ahead or around a corner. So I feel like time has rubber-banded for dogs through smell, and it also allows them to detect things which we don't think are really visible yet. Like, dogs often are said to be able to detect an upcoming storm. One of the reasons this might be is that when a low-pressure system moves in, the air above the ground kind of feels extra roomy and the earth loosens its grip on odors within it, and they become volatile. They evaporate and go up in the air, and the dog can detect that. And you might see a change in their behavior when they notice this new smell. GROSS: But how can they smell that it's afternoon? What does afternoon smell like compared to morning? HOROWITZ: Well, smells in a room change as the day goes on. Hot air rises, and it usually rises in currents along the walls and will rise to the ceiling and go kind of to the center of the room and drop. And so if we were able to visualize the movement of air through the day, what we're really visualizing is the movement of odor through the day. In the mid-afternoon, you might feel tangibly on your skin that - or see through the light in the window that it's afternoon, and the sun is halfway in the middle of the sky. The dog, I think, can smell that through the movement of that air through a room. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Horowitz. She's the author of the best-seller \"Inside Of A Dog. \" Now she has a new book called \"Being A Dog\" that's all about dogs' sense of smell. She also founded the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College. We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Horowitz. She's the author of the best-seller \"Inside Of A Dog,\" and now she has a new book called \"Being A Dog\" that's about how a dog understands the world through its sense of smell. She's also the founder of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College. Does the size of a dog's nose determine how much a dog can detect through the sense of smell? I mean, for instance, some dogs have like really long snouts and some dogs have basically like two little nostrils on their face. HOROWITZ: (Laughter) Right. Well, to some extent, yes, but for the most part the snout - it's this humidifying, warming chamber that hurries air to the part of the nose which really smells the odors. It doesn't matter truly if it's short or long. I mean, I think the dogs who are better smellers are usually long-nose dogs. They both will have hundreds of millions of olfactory receptors, those receptors that catch odors in the back of their nose. But it is true that these short-nose dogs are seen to be slightly less good smellers, and that's because we've basically bred these dogs to have slightly different shaped skulls. And they don't have all the equipment that a long-nose dog will. So you rarely see pugs, for instance, acting as explosive detection dogs. GROSS: Right - or never see them is probably more. . . HOROWITZ: Oh, yeah, no - maybe never. But they'd still be a lot better than we would. GROSS: If dogs are so good at detecting odors, why are they not repelled by their own smelliness when they get really filthy or they rolled in something really foul? HOROWITZ: It's not obvious that it is foul or smelly in that sense to a dog. In other words, I think when you try to imagine a world made of smells, smells become less binary than they are to us. For us, they're often really pleasant or really unpleasant. You know, I like freshly baked bread, and I really don't like garbage that's sat on the summer in - on the street in New York City. But, for dogs, those smells are just information. They're information about what's out there, and I don't think they levy the same judgment on smells. Just like when you walk into a room and you see a lot of visual information, we're not saying, oh, that's really a bad color. That's really a bad image. That's really a great one. We're just seeing it as a room. GROSS: But dogs eat things that they shouldn't eat because it's not good for them. In fact, it might be really toxic. And the offensive odor doesn't seem to necessarily put them off. HOROWITZ: It's true, for instance. . . GROSS: With people, you know, like a really foul odor, it's a warning this is rotten. You really should not be eating it. HOROWITZ: Yeah. And it can be a disorder if a dog is, for instance, eating their own feces. Most dogs are not doing that. They are avoiding things like that, and yet, they might eat another species' feces and that's - it's a little bit maladaptive, but it also indicates that the smell isn't any longer bad to them, that there's something else attractive in that smell. They roll in things like that. People have a few theories as to why they might. It might be to kind of camouflage their own scent or maybe because it makes them more popular because they have this really stinky thing on them, among other dogs. Or maybe they just like the scent. It's hard for us to imagine that they like scents that we find offensive, but it seems to be the case. GROSS: You know, when I put lotion on my hands when my cat is on my lap or sitting next to me, I wonder will the cat still know it's me because I've just put something on my hands that's going to mask my odor and replace it with the lotion odor. And I'm wondering like with dogs when you've like come out of the shower after having soap - you know, used a fragrant soap or if you've put lotion on your hands - or, say, you're somebody who wears perfume or something - does the dog recognize that you're still you? HOROWITZ: I think that's a great question. We are, I think, somewhat hidden by these smells that we layer on our smell. But our smell, the smell of us, is profound to the dog. I mean, each one of us, no matter how clean you are, really stinks. We're giving off a haze of odor and molecules that the dog not only detects, but comes to recognize as us. So a perfume or a fragrance soap might put them off for a second. There might be a moment of lack of recognition, but if they can get a little closer or get on the other side of the - of a breeze, then they'll recognize you instantly. We all have a really - an identifying smell to the dog. GROSS: We've all had the experience of going to visit the home of a friend where we haven't been before. The friend has a dog. The first thing they do when you arrive is greet you by smelling your crotch, which is embarrassing for everybody. So why do dogs do that? HOROWITZ: It's a really smelly place. I mean, dogs are extremely good at honing in on the parts of us that happen to smell. And we secrete a lot of smells from a couple of parts of our body - the crotch, the armpits, the mouth. You know, one of the things you can do when you don't like that, which most people don't, is give them something else to smell. You know, they might be preoccupied with the smell of your ear, for instance. We have lots of glands that give off odors around our face, and that might suffice to be information about you. That's all the dog is trying to get, information. I love that we often feel like the dog is being impolite in that case. And many people will not unreasonably train their dogs not to do that. But I also see it as just the dog's way of discovering who you are, and we are our smell to them. GROSS: So you did this amazing experiment with what you call a pee poll in a New York park (laughter). What was the poll? And what were you looking for? HOROWITZ: Right, and we're still doing this experiment in New York City's Riverside Park, where we set up a pee post, essentially, which is just a place where a dog might mark, might leave an identifying bit of pee. And we set a camera up to capture instances of dogs visiting this. And what I'm trying to do is do some basic research about what dogs are doing when they mark. What we know from some research of feral dogs and free-ranging dogs is that dogs aren't doing what we mostly think they are doing when they mark, which is marking territory. Dogs don't have territorial marking pee like wolves do. They'll go around their home range and pee right around the perimeter so that any intruder will know that they're entering someone else's territory. What would be that home range for dogs? It's obvious that they no longer have that kind of perception of the world. They don't have home ranges. They do mark along shared paths, what researchers like to call runways. So if you encounter a lamp post or a fire hydrant and/or a tree trunk on your regular walk and lots of other dogs, too, chances are that dogs will mark all of these places. But what they're doing with this information, we're not exactly sure. So I was looking at all the behaviors around dogs sniffing of these marked spots of the pee post and what they do afterwards. GROSS: What did you learn? HOROWITZ: Well, thus far, it looks like there are a couple of interesting characteristics of the marking. First, they sniff a lot more than they mark. So it's not that every dog comes, notices that someone's been there before and then has to leave their own mark. It's really not territorial or dominance related. Also, they often look up after they sniff. And it's really hard to see, I think, for most owners when their dog is looking somewhere what might actually be happening, which is often that they're smelling somewhere. And if you look, their noses are working. You can see their noses working. They're probably smelling after the dog who has left that mark. My favorite observation is just that dogs don't come back to check again later. You know, they don't go to smell their own pee and see, has anybody covered this? - which I find fascinating. GROSS: So have you basically - have you found that dogs identify themselves with pee in the same way that, like, a graffiti writer might to say that they were there (laughter)? HOROWITZ: I would say that I don't know conclusively what they're doing yet. They might be leaving a little message, like a message you tack on a bulletin board, for other dogs with information about who they are and what they've eaten today and how healthy they are and what sex they are and maybe even how old they are and so forth. But they never come back to check on other messages that are left in response. So it's not obvious to me why they would leave those messages. It might just be a vestige of having been wolves or something like wolves thousands of years ago. GROSS: My guest is Alexandra Horowitz, author of the new book \"Being A Dog. \" After a break, she'll share her concern that pet dogs are at risk of losing some of their sense of smell. And she'll tell us about her own dogs. And Ken Tucker will review the debut album by singer-songwriter Lucy Dacus. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Alexandra Horowitz. Her new book \"Being A Dog\" is about how dogs rely on their sense of smell to perceive the world around them. She's also the author of the best-seller \"Inside Of A Dog,\" and she's the founder of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, where she conducts research on dog behavior and perception. Because urine is filled with information, if you have a dog's nose, you've been studying urine. And in one of your experiments you captured dog urine so that you could do what with it? HOROWITZ: Yeah. We spend a surprisingly large amount of time thinking about dog urine in our Dog Cognition Lab, I'm sorry to say - maybe not what researchers who work with me thought they would be doing. Yeah. I got very interested in a test of self-recognition that's done with other animals. It's called the mirror mark test where animals are shown a mirror. Once they become accustomed to the fact that that mirror is not another animal in front of them, they are surreptitiously marked on their heads for instance and then presented with the mirror again. And the researchers look to see if they see the mirror as showing them something about themselves and move to remove that mark. Chimpanzees pass this test. They seem to have some measure of self-recognition. Dolphins pass the test. One elephant has passed the test. Dogs don't seem to pass this test, but I was a little surprised about that. It feels like they certainly can identify themselves and distinguish themselves from others. So I figured, well, one of the reasons they might not be passing this test is because they aren't visual creatures primarily. And they also aren't grooming creatures. If they have something funny on their body, they don't seem to be worried about that and want to remove it. Like, you know, when we see that spinach caught between our teeth in the mirror, the first thing we do is remove it. They seem ambivalent. So I designed a little bit of an olfactory test. We gather a little bit of their urine - a very small amount - and other substances and, in canisters, simply allow them to sniff these different canisters. And we were seeing how long they sniffed each one of the canisters. What we found is that one of the canisters - we use their own urine and another we used their urine and we marked it with something else - sort of like the mark that was put on the chimpanzee's head - with another substance, basically. And we looked at how long they sniffed both of those. They're very uninterested in sniffing their own pee, even when discovered out of context like this. And they were much more interested in their own pee when it had been changed by this mark. So that seems to me some measure of the beginning of recognition of self. I'm interested in that smell, but only if something's off about it. GROSS: So what does that tell you? Why is that important, knowing that? HOROWITZ: I think that maybe dogs are - do have some measure of self-recognition, that they are identifying themselves. Maybe they don't think about themselves with the autobiographical eye that that humans do, but that they're recognizing themselves and their own smells, and they affiliate with them and can distinguish them from other dogs' smells. That's an important step in cognition. When we talk about human development, even kids don't recognize themselves in their first year or two. But when they do, they really have a fuller appreciation of their social world, and I think dogs have that. GROSS: You know, we talked earlier about how working dogs are being used in incredible ways now - to sniff out bed bugs, to detect certain cancerous tumors. In your book, you mentioned that some working dogs are being used to sniff out in advance when somebody is about to have an epileptic seizure or whether they're about to go into diabetic shock, which is - it's pretty remarkable things that these dogs can do. But at the same time, you point out that some domestic dogs are losing some of their sense of smell. Why are they losing it? HOROWITZ: People really don't encourage dogs to smell very much. One - the one thing that detection dogs do is go and find an odor that they've been trained on. In all circumstances - every day for a detection dog's life is them getting up, being brought to a situation, told to find an odor of some sort, finding it perhaps and getting to play with a toy as a reward. So they're expressly told to smell. But in a pet dog's life, they're usually told not to smell, right? They - as you say, when they greet someone - a visitor to the house - you know, they go to smell the person and they're discouraged from smelling the person. If - many people don't like to be licked by their dogs. If they're sniffing things by a tree trunk or a fire hydrant outside, their dogs - their owners might pull their dogs away. Now it's becoming even more popular to not have dogs sniff each other up close for fear that one dog might be too aggressive or maybe just impolite. So they're discouraged from smelling in their ordinary life often. And I don't think they lose their ability to smell, but they lose their predisposition to smell. They're kind of living in our visual world, and they start attending to our pointing and our gestures and our facial expressions more and less to smells. GROSS: After you started doing research about how a dog uses its sense of smell, how it perceives the world through its sense of smell, you started taking your dogs on smell walks. What do you do and why are you doing it? HOROWITZ: Well, I really am trying to counter what I and lots of owners have done our whole lives, which is discourage smelling. And in fact, instead I'm trying to embrace it. So on a smell walk, really, I just let the dog choose what we're going to do and where we're going to go and how long we're going to stay there. So sometimes we don't get off our front step for a little while because as soon as you open the door, the dog is faced with a new day. And the air holds odor that - where a trace of who or what's passed by. Then we might spend a little time with a little tree guard - the iron railing that surrounds a tree - which has leavings from, presumably, other dogs who have passed by. And I just let the dog take charge. Sometimes our walks are pretty much standing around actually, but I think that the dog is enjoying himself. GROSS: You know, dogs recognize us from our odors, but we don't really want to smell. You know, if you say to somebody, you smell, that's usually not a good thing. Have you changed your attitude about your own body odors? HOROWITZ: I've changed my attitude about all odors, really, from all this practice intentionally smelling. I mean, I never was one to wear a lot of perfume to begin with. Now actually, I like perfumes more as a kind of odor one might wear, but not because it would cover up my own odor. I think I am a little less worried, maybe to the chagrin of those around me, about having an odor. I just see it as a natural part of being a biological creature. And I really do celebrate, as I saw sometimes with these olfactory experts, some of the bad smells in the way that I didn't used to celebrate them. So a smell of garbage, for instance, is more just information about the fact that there's garbage near rather than being something hugely off-putting and offensive - that's the way I used to find it - and something that affected me. And now I'd feel, oh, well, yeah. I mean, there's garbage, and that's the strong smell of garbage. HOROWITZ: Isn't that interesting? GROSS: So I'm interested in the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard that you created and still run. What kinds of experiments do you do there? HOROWITZ: I started this lab because I used to do simple experiments on my own, but students really wanted to be involved. And there was this burgeoning world of dog cognition, which 20 years ago, didn't exist, but had a little momentum. And so I basically asked people to join me in the lab, so that I could do slightly more complex experiments. I do really simple behavioral experiments, which try to ask and answer questions that I'm interested in. And I also do a lot of natural observations of dogs, for instance, interacting with their owners in play or playing themselves - to see if I can deconstruct what's going on in those interactions. Some of the experiments I do are testing, for instance, anthropomorphisms, attributions that we make of dogs. One of my favorites was of the guilty look. Dogs show this guilty look, pulling their ears back and pulling their tail under their body or turning away. Often, owners know when they've done something wrong. So it's fair for people to say that dogs look guilty. But I thought, that's a strange attribution. How can we be sure that dogs are guilty? And so I did a little test to see if the guilty look popped up only when they'd done something wrong or in any other circumstance. GROSS: What did you find? HOROWITZ: And it's a really simple experiment. And I found that the guilty look showed up more often when they were being scolded or about to be scolded by their owners, whether or not they'd done something wrong. And so it looks like we really prompt the dogs to put on this look, which is probably more aptly described as a submissive look or a concerned look, than a guilty look. I'm not saying that dogs don't feel guilt. They very well might, but this look isn't showing us that. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Horowitz. She's the author of the best-seller \"Inside Of A Dog\" and now the new book \"Being A Dog,\" which is about how dogs perceive the world through their sense of smell. She's also the founder of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College. We're going to take a short break here, and then we'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Horowitz. Her new book is called \"Being A Dog: Following The Dog Into A World Of Smell. \" She's also the founder of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College. Tell us about the dogs you have now. HOROWITZ: Upton is a large, mixed-breed mongrel dog - probably a Plott Hound and Great Dane mix - well, well mixed - that we got. We got him when he was 3 and a half years old. And he's a really goofy, large, sweet dog. And I also have Finnegan, who we've lived with for about eight years, who's also a mixed-breed, maybe Lab mix. I consider Finnegan kind of a professional dog. He's much more cooperative in listening to us, wants to kind of follow our lead a lot more. And he's the one I took with me in this book to do a few smelling projects because I was really interested in how much we could kind of open up his nose and make him a smelling dog again. GROSS: How did you find your dogs? HOROWITZ: Both of my dogs, we found in shelters. I went to shelters - I don't go to shelters very much because it's really hard for me to not adopt an animal when I see an animal at a shelter. They all look so wonderful. But we went to a shelter in Queens and found Finnegan. Long ago as a puppy, he was sick. And we brought him out, and he leaned against me, and boy, that really grabbed me. So we took him. And then a few years later, I had my son. And Finnegan was displaced as the primary child in the family. And so a few years after that, we decided to get another dog - probably as a companion, we thought, for Finnegan. And we went again to a shelter and met this great, galumphing, funny creature, who became Upton. And now we have a two-dog family. GROSS: With Upton, how did you know that he was the dog for you? HOROWITZ: It was not obvious, I would say, with a 3-and-a-half-year-old dog who'd been given up twice to a shelter. But he recognized me after just a few minutes. We met him. We played with him in a little room. We put him back. And then I returned, and he recognized us. And we know this about dogs, that they actually form attachments really fast in shelters if they see somebody again and again. And this large dog, showing recognition and wagging happily, you know, thunk, thunk, thunk on the bottom of his cage is - you know, my heart can't handle that. GROSS: (Laughter). HOROWITZ: We had to take him home. GROSS: Did you have any reservations about adopting a dog that was 3 and a half years old and had already been returned once to the shelter? HOROWITZ: No. But you know what? It's great to get a slightly older dog. Puppies are just wonderful. But there are so many dogs that are returned to shelters that I know that if I was going to get a second dog, I wanted to contribute to reducing those numbers. And dogs are so flexible. You know, this dog, Upton, has some fears. He's not a perfect city dog. You know, the sounds of a city are difficult for him. But he's so agreeable, ultimately, as most dogs are, and sort of cooperative in working their way into the family, that a lot of things can happen to a dog, and they'll still turn and trust the next person and give it a shot. GROSS: So you wanted to find a dog who'd been returned to a shelter. Did you go into the shelter and say, who's been returned to you? HOROWITZ: Well, all these dogs. . . GROSS: Show me a dog nobody seems to want. (LAUGHTER) HOROWITZ: Well, a big dog is an especially hard sell, I think. And older dogs even older than that, are hard sells because people want to have a lifetime with the dog, which is understandable. But yeah, we did go looking for especially an older dog. And, you know, I like the look of him. You have to like the way a dog looks and the way they act around you and HOROWITZ: And the feeling that they're somehow recognizing you is important, and he had all of those things. GROSS: Has your approach to training dogs changed over the years? HOROWITZ: I should say that my dogs are not really trained, per se. I don't - I'm not - I never - I'm not a dog trainer, and I've never been that concerned with making them super polite. You know, they - I train them to do the things that they need to do in emergency and to protect themselves and others. They can come, and they'll sit for me and so forth. But, you know, I'm less concerned about keeping them off the bed or the couch than maybe I would have been when I first was a dog owner. In fact, I don't try to keep them off the bed or the couch. It's perfectly fine with me if they're sitting when we're sitting. And I understand the urge. That's where I like to sit, too. And I - I'm very willing to have them off leash and run around as long as they'll come back to me and not interfere with other people. So I don't think that they're really heavily trained. I like them to be dog-like. GROSS: So some readers know your dog Pumpernickel from your previous book, and Pumpernickel is no longer with us. How did Pumpernickel die? HOROWITZ: She died of being very old, which I was fortunate. You know, that almost never happens. She died at almost. . . GROSS: How did you know it was time? HOROWITZ: Well, she had slowed down to the point of stopping, essentially, and she was 17 years old. It wasn't surprising when she stopped enjoying things that she usually enjoyed like, you know, a little lick of peanut butter on a finger or a small game of rough and tumble or jostling each other. And I knew that she wasn't really experiencing life. GROSS: And did you take her to the vet or did the vet come to you? HOROWITZ: A vet came to us. It's really one of the more heartbreaking things I've had to do in my life. And, you know, her life ended with me. And when she died, I thought - I was impossibly sad. I mean, I really wrote \"Inside Of A Dog\" kind of as a tribute to her, thinking about her. And I probably spent a year, which is maybe not extraordinary for people who live with dogs, really, really glum and sad and thinking that it was impossible that she was gone. And that's about how long it took before I decided to get another dog as well. I did realize that I couldn't live in a space that didn't have another, you know, happy, breathing, wagging creature in it, and that's how we went and met Finnegan. GROSS: I want to thank you so much for talking with us. HOROWITZ: It's been my utter pleasure. Thank you, Terry.

They won for their work exploring new phases of matter. Joining us to talk about the winners is NPR's science editor, Geoff Brumfiel. Good morning. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Good morning. MONTAGNE: Let's start with these researchers. Who are they? BRUMFIEL: They are David Thouless of the University of Washington Seattle, Duncan Haldane of Princeton University and Michael Kosterlitz of Brown University. And they won for, as you said, work on unusual phases of matter, and specifically - I'm going to have to read this out loud; I had to write it down - for theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and topological phases of matter. MONTAGNE: I see why you wrote it down - quite a mouthful. BRUMFIEL: (Laughter). Yeah, yeah, it's really something. But let's just break it down. So topological phases of matter - we'll work back-to-front here. Matter is just, you know, stuff. It's, like, the table here in the studio. It's made of atoms. And phases you learned in school. That's just liquid, solid, gas. That's the way the matter is organized. But then it turns out that there are also some very unusual phases out there that we don't learn about. And specifically, these topological phases are cases where matter is - or there are often cases where matter is squashed down into two dimensions. So rather than having a block of atoms, you have a sheet - a two-dimensional sheet of, say, electrons. And that can lead to some very unusual properties. And so these three winners did a lot of theoretical work back in the 1970s. It was all just sort of on paper about how these sort of flat sheets of matter might behave. And that's why they won. MONTAGNE: And why, though, now, having done that work so long ago? BRUMFIEL: Well, that's a good question. I mean, it often takes a long time for the Nobel committee to recognize work, but I think there's something else going on here. So basically what happened was, first of all, in the '70s and '80s, you know, this was all theoretical. But physicists started seeing, you know, some of this stuff in their experiments, and they'd refer to these guys' work, and they'd use it to explain things. And then we had the computer revolution kind of happening in parallel. And so, all of a sudden, people were able to make some of these two-dimensional sheets of material. A few years ago, there was a Nobel Prize awarded for graphene, which is just a sheet of carbon. And so, as we've become more sophisticated, all of a sudden, you know, we're starting to apply this more and more. And there's hopes that these materials could be used for things like quantum computers, which could be able to do certain calculations better than regular computers. I think there's a feeling we're on the cusp of something maybe very big with topological materials, and that's why people are excited about it now. MONTAGNE: All right. Well, Geoff, we have - we've got a little time here, so why don't you talk to us about the fact that everyone thought there was another topic that - that would likely be the winner, right? BRUMFIEL: Yes. So they contacted one of the laureates today. Even he sounded a little surprised that he'd won this year. And that's because this was the year they detected gravitational waves - waves in the fabric of space and time. Einstein predicted those waves a hundred years ago. It took an entire century to see them. So it was a very, very big discovery. But, you know, I mean, it took a hundred years. They can wait another year for the Nobel Prize. They're almost certain to get one at some point. MONTAGNE: (Laughter). OK, thanks very much. That's NPR's Geoff Brumfiel. BRUMFIEL: Thank you. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:   The Nobel Prize in physics this morning has been awarded to three scientists. They won for their work exploring new phases of matter. Joining us to talk about the winners is NPR's science editor, Geoff Brumfiel. Good morning. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Good morning. MONTAGNE: Let's start with these researchers. Who are they? BRUMFIEL: They are David Thouless of the University of Washington Seattle, Duncan Haldane of Princeton University and Michael Kosterlitz of Brown University. And they won for, as you said, work on unusual phases of matter, and specifically - I'm going to have to read this out loud; I had to write it down - for theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and topological phases of matter. MONTAGNE: I see why you wrote it down - quite a mouthful. BRUMFIEL: (Laughter). Yeah, yeah, it's really something. But let's just break it down. So topological phases of matter - we'll work back-to-front here. Matter is just, you know, stuff. It's, like, the table here in the studio. It's made of atoms. And phases you learned in school. That's just liquid, solid, gas. That's the way the matter is organized. But then it turns out that there are also some very unusual phases out there that we don't learn about. And specifically, these topological phases are cases where matter is - or there are often cases where matter is squashed down into two dimensions. So rather than having a block of atoms, you have a sheet - a two-dimensional sheet of, say, electrons. And that can lead to some very unusual properties. And so these three winners did a lot of theoretical work back in the 1970s. It was all just sort of on paper about how these sort of flat sheets of matter might behave. And that's why they won. MONTAGNE: And why, though, now, having done that work so long ago? BRUMFIEL: Well, that's a good question. I mean, it often takes a long time for the Nobel committee to recognize work, but I think there's something else going on here. So basically what happened was, first of all, in the '70s and '80s, you know, this was all theoretical. But physicists started seeing, you know, some of this stuff in their experiments, and they'd refer to these guys' work, and they'd use it to explain things. And then we had the computer revolution kind of happening in parallel. And so, all of a sudden, people were able to make some of these two-dimensional sheets of material. A few years ago, there was a Nobel Prize awarded for graphene, which is just a sheet of carbon. And so, as we've become more sophisticated, all of a sudden, you know, we're starting to apply this more and more. And there's hopes that these materials could be used for things like quantum computers, which could be able to do certain calculations better than regular computers. I think there's a feeling we're on the cusp of something maybe very big with topological materials, and that's why people are excited about it now. MONTAGNE: All right. Well, Geoff, we have - we've got a little time here, so why don't you talk to us about the fact that everyone thought there was another topic that - that would likely be the winner, right?

And it will be shared by three scientists who've figured out how to make tiny machines. These machines are a thousand times smaller than a human hair, and they are not just fanciful. The technology could someday be used in computers, for energy storage and other ideas still just imagined. Joining me now is NPR's science correspondent, Richard Harris. Good morning. RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: And who are these three winners? HARRIS: Well, it's an international group. Part of the prize goes to Jean-Pierre Sauvage at the University of Strasbourg in France. Another share goes to J. Fraser Stoddart, who is a Scottish-born scientist, who's now at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. - and Bernard Feringa, at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. And the story of their discovery actually stretches back more than 30 years. MONTAGNE: All right. So tell us that story. HARRIS: Well, as you suggested, it's all about tiny machines. Scientists and science fiction writers have, of course, been dreaming about machines on a molecular scale for a really long time. And in fact, biology has already invented these things - if you think of mechanical devices like the tiny flagella, the little whip on the end of bacteria that spin around and help the bacteria move. So biology figured this out billions of years ago, and people are catching up. But how could people build them from scratch? That's the question. And there are two basic requirements. First, you need moving parts, and then you need some way to power the moving pieces. And the first real breakthrough here, according to the Nobel Committee, came in 1983. That's when Jean-Pierre Sauvage figured out how to link together two chemical rings. But instead of using those rigid chemical bonds that you're used to seeing in your chemistry book or whatever, he actually threaded them together like links in a chain. MONTAGNE: But Richard, a chain isn't exactly a machine. Is it? HARRIS: No, it's not. But it's certainly a step in the right direction. And the next advance came from Fraser Stoddart, who built on the concept of interlocking rings by threading a ring around a straight rod - like an axle, right? So it's starting to sound more like a familiar machine, isn't it? MONTAGNE: Yeah, right. HARRIS: Yeah. And he's been exploring how to make use of that. Among other things, he figured out how to use this ring-around-the-axle system to build tiny molecular-sized elevators. By 1994, he'd figured out how to make the ring jump from one end of the axle to another. So he now had a machine that could actually do work at this scale. MONTAGNE: You know, this is getting pretty impressive, I must say. HARRIS: It's amazing, isn't it? MONTAGNE: I've got this picture of these little - OK, tiny elevators. Where does the third laureate come into the picture? HARRIS: Yeah, Bernard Feringa in the Netherlands has been figuring out how to power these machines - because remember, you need to have movement. You have to have power source. And so normally, molecules this small just move randomly. But as the Nobel Committee explains, Feringa figured out how to design molecules that could move in a specific direction - molecules, in fact, that spin like the wheels of a car. And in 2001, his group built a four-wheel-drive nanocar with four spinning wheels. And he's been gradually improving on this technology to the point that these molecules can now spin pretty fast, like 12 million revolutions per second. MONTAGNE: Now this is all fascinating. So what's it all good for? HARRIS: Well, the Nobel Committee describes all of this as a molecular tool box that can be used to explore the world of tiny machines and build upon it, of course. And they say it's the - I'm quoting - \"the first steps into a new world. \" Technology at this scale already exists, right? Think of computer chips, which exist at the nanoscale or these nanoparticle coatings on materials. But what technologist wouldn't want to manipulate material at this tiny scale? Honestly, we have a long way to go though. The Nobel Committee says that the molecular motor is at the same stage of development as the electric motor was back in the 1830s - gives you a sense of how much headroom for improvement we have. It's really the cutting edge of technology. And like most things that are just, you know, starting out, where it could lead is anybody's guess. MONTAGNE: All right. Well, thanks very much.

S. - that means no Category 3, 4 or 5 hurricanes. Matthew is losing strength and may not break that hurricane drought. But as NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, that may only be a technicality. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Some things to know about this so-called hurricane drought. There actually have been plenty of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean over the past decade and quite a few quote, \"major ones. \" They just didn't hit us. They hit other places or just churned up a lot of waves in the ocean. Atmospheric scientist Adam Sobel of Columbia University says it's all about luck, not climate change or some other weird phenomenon. ADAM SOBEL: It's essentially been a fluke. There's no explanation for it that anybody has come up with other than random chance. JOYCE: How much of a fluke was this 10-year hiatus? SOBEL: That's something you would expect to occur roughly every 170-odd years. In other words, a 10-year drought is that rare of an event. JOYCE: There have been hurricane droughts before, though not quite as long. Eventually, things got back to normal, which is a couple of smaller hurricanes making landfall every year and a major one every two years or so. Sobel and other scientists expect that will happen again sooner or later. SOBEL: I think it's a mistake to attach too much significance to the 10-year drought. It's not something we ever expected should continue indefinitely. JOYCE: And the whole idea of a drought is largely one of definition. Hurricanes Sandy and Irene did hit land during that drought. They weren't classified as major, but they did lots of damage. Also, the definition of major is based on wind speed. But slow-moving hurricanes carrying lots of water can do more damage than windy ones. When Matthew closed in on Florida, it was a Category 4, a major hurricane - powerful, but not unprecedented. It's the kind of hurricane we've seen before and scientists say we'll see them again. Christopher Joyce, NPR News. KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:  Hurricane Matthew is making its way northward.

TIM FLYNN: Austin, nice to meet you, my friend. AUSTIN BEGGIN: Hey, Tim. It's a pleasure. I appreciate you doing this. SHAPIRO: That's Austin Beggin and Tim Flynn. Austin's life became something very different last year. He'd just graduated from college with a degree in human resources and had started a job at Nabisco. To celebrate, he went on vacation with his family. They went to St. George Island, Fla. The first day, May 31, 2015, there was an accident at the beach. BEGGIN: I was probably about waist-deep when I saw a wave coming, decided to dive into it. I was a swimmer my whole life, so it's not like I haven't dove, you know, thousands of times. And for whatever reason, this was the wave. FLYNN: You picked the wrong wave, man. BEGGIN: Yeah, the one wrong wave. SHAPIRO: Austin dove in, hit the bottom and was left paralyzed from the shoulders down. Tim Flynn suffered a similar injury 35 years ago. He was in a car accident. He'd been driving drunk. He's been paralyzed since, though, unlike Austin, he's able to move his arms. Tim is a counselor for people with disabilities. The two spoke for our new series, Been There, connecting people at either end of a shared experience. Austin picks up his story. BEGGIN: I stayed conscious during the impact. And immediately, you notice something's wrong. Your first thing to try to do is, well, I got to turn over. I mean, I'm face-down in the water. And you realize you're unable to turn to the left or unable to turn to the right. And that's kind of when, you know, the fear sets in. FLYNN: Yeah. BEGGIN: I couldn't talk initially. I mean, it was probably three weeks before they released the cuff in my ventilator to allow me to talk. And I love telling this story, that my voice just sounded real raspy. It kind of reminded me of Darth Vader from \"Star Wars. \"FLYNN: (Laughter). BEGGIN: So I knew my dad was coming into the hospital that day. He came in, and I just looked at him and said, I am your father. FLYNN: (Laughter). BEGGIN: That just kind of reassured them that I was the same person and kind of helped me, you know, remember nothing's really changed with me mentally. Physically, you know, I was unable to move from the shoulders down. FLYNN: So what this means for the uninitiated is you need a lot of help. And, you know, you have difficulty feeding yourself, I would imagine, grooming. BEGGIN: Yeah, Tim. I mean, you pretty much nailed it. From feeding to getting dressed to your morning routines - bowels, bladder. I have the ability to be independent with my chair, but for the most part, yeah, I mean, this injury has caused me to be fully dependent on someone for practically everything. FLYNN: Austin, buddy, that's about as bad as it gets, my friend (laughter). BEGGIN: Yeah. FLYNN: And I - you know, I don't want to be Pollyanna in, you know, there's always a silver lining to everything, but if you get through this life is not going to throw anything that's much more difficult than this at you. BEGGIN: Oh, you could take on anything after this. FLYNN: Absolutely. And, you know, I really was trying to put myself - I was thinking about you over the weekend, trying to sort of put myself back into that mindset of being hurt for a year, and damned if I didn't start crying. But, you know, one of the important things someone said to me then - this was from one of the psychologists who came in to gauge my level of mental well-being, I guess. You know, after that I threw the first three out who came in and said, how are you feeling? And I'd be, how the hell do you think I feel? You know, get the hell out of here. BEGGIN: Yeah. Right, I love those questions. FLYNN: But then someone came in, must've caught me at a moment of weakness 'cause I listened. They said, in every sort of lifetime, you know, we could do about 10,000 things. And they said, so what's going to happen now is you're going to do a different 10,000 things than you were going to do before. So it became figuring out what that new 10,000 things was going to be, you know, from a career standpoint or, you know - am I ever going to have a girlfriend? Am I getting married? BEGGIN: Obviously, there's no question that the idea of, you know, dating or talking to girls is something that's on your mind. And one thing that happened recently was being in a wedding for one of my best friends growing up. FLYNN: Yeah. BEGGIN: But just being a part of it and seeing how my friend, you know, got to hold his wife's hand and, you know. . . FLYNN: Yeah, yeah. BEGGIN: . . . Kiss her and, I don't know, dance with her. It's things like that that, you know, you're not ever, like, prepared for. . . FLYNN: No, you're not. BEGGIN: . . . In this situation. And I can have, you know, the happiest day leading up to it, but once that moment hits and I see that reality, you know, it sets in that that's something I guess that, you know, I will not be able to do. But - I know that doesn't define me, but at the same time, I mean, those are moments. . . FLYNN: It hurts. It hurts, yeah. BEGGIN: . . . That just get you down. Yeah, it hurts. FLYNN: It hurts. BEGGIN: It does. FLYNN: I'm not going say it's going to stop hurting. You know, I really miss walking arm-in-arm with a woman. That's something I loved doing. BEGGIN: Yeah. I mean, dancing - I used to love to dance. FLYNN: Yeah, that, too. BEGGIN: Just that whole idea. FLYNN: Well, there - you know, you can figure out how to dance. Just encourage somebody to climb up onto your lap and. . . BEGGIN: Yeah. FLYNN: . . . And start driving with your head, dude, you know? BEGGIN: Go for a spin. FLYNN: Go for a spin, you know? I mean, it's - yeah, it's not the same. I get that. But hey, you're in the middle of this minefield of not the same. And it's not going to change. And early on, where you are, that's really tough. You're waking up and you say, uh-oh. Yep, still paralyzed, aren't I? BEGGIN: Well, because I don't know if you had it but, you know, there's plenty of dreams I have and. . . FLYNN: . . . Sure. You're walking in them, aren't you? BEGGIN: I'm not wheelchair-bound. And, you know, you wish you could stay in that dream, and then you wake up and. . . FLYNN: It's absolutely normal to wake up and like, oh, God. Hey, still, buddy, I wake up, you know, and I've got to drag my legs out of bed. . . BEGGIN: Yeah. FLYNN: . . . And I'm like, all right, you know? But I've got someplace to go. You know, having a job is really important and having a good one is important. BEGGIN: Yeah. And I had a job with Nabisco. FLYNN: Yeah. BEGGIN: And they were great even after the injury - letters and the amount of people that came to visit me in the hospital. And they always have assured me that, when the time was right - that I would be ready to go back to work, that, you know, we would find a position that was suited for me. FLYNN: That is phenomenal. I mean, phenomenal. BEGGIN: Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of people that don't kind of have that opportunity after their injury. FLYNN: You said you were in marketing and business administration? BEGGIN: Human resources. FLYNN: Human resources? BEGGIN: Yeah. FLYNN: That's perfect. I mean, it's certainly something you can handle from the chair. You know, look, you've got to come home and have something to talk about at the dinner table. Otherwise, nobody cares about you. You know, from a self-esteem standpoint, it's real important. And one of the big transitions for me - and it took me a good five years to get there - was I kept on looking back into my past, thinking about what I lost. And that's not a strategy for progress. It was when I was sort of able to turn around and start looking forward and sort of looking out into the world and just think in terms of what I got and how I can use it. BEGGIN: I mean, I kind of made it a focal point right off the bat to - as uncomfortable as it was early on, but just go out as often as I could, whether that was restaurants, sporting events. FLYNN: Yeah. Yeah. BEGGIN: So that, you know, I wouldn't keep myself confined to my room where I have just ample amount of time to sit there and think about, you know, all the negative things going on. And that's why, you know, I always enjoy talking to people who, you know, have done well for themselves after this because it's just reassuring that, you know, there is plenty of hope and opportunities out there. FLYNN: There is. And from what I'm hearing over my headphones, here is a confident man who is smart, got a sense of humor. Just keep it up, buddy. BEGGIN: Hey, thank you, Tim. I appreciate your time. FLYNN: I've got faith in you. SHAPIRO: That was Tim Flynn and Austin Beggin. They spoke as part of our series Been There. If you're looking for advice about a life change, send us an email to nprcrowdsource@npr. org. Put Been There in the subject line. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  When you're going through a major change in life, it can help to talk to somebody who's already been there. TIM FLYNN: Austin, nice to meet you, my friend. AUSTIN BEGGIN: Hey, Tim. It's a pleasure. I appreciate you doing this. SHAPIRO: That's Austin Beggin and Tim Flynn. Austin's life became something very different last year. He'd just graduated from college with a degree in human resources and had started a job at Nabisco. To celebrate, he went on vacation with his family. They went to St. George Island, Fla. The first day, May 31, 2015, there was an accident at the beach. BEGGIN: I was probably about waist-deep when I saw a wave coming, decided to dive into it. I was a swimmer my whole life, so it's not like I haven't dove, you know, thousands of times. And for whatever reason, this was the wave. FLYNN: You picked the wrong wave, man. BEGGIN: Yeah, the one wrong wave. SHAPIRO: Austin dove in, hit the bottom and was left paralyzed from the shoulders down. Tim Flynn suffered a similar injury 35 years ago. He was in a car accident. He'd been driving drunk. He's been paralyzed since, though, unlike Austin, he's able to move his arms. Tim is a counselor for people with disabilities. The two spoke for our new series, Been There, connecting people at either end of a shared experience. Austin picks up his story. BEGGIN: I stayed conscious during the impact. And immediately, you notice something's wrong. Your first thing to try to do is, well, I got to turn over. I mean, I'm face-down in the water. And you realize you're unable to turn to the left or unable to turn to the right. And that's kind of when, you know, the fear sets in. FLYNN: Yeah. BEGGIN: I couldn't talk initially. I mean, it was probably three weeks before they released the cuff in my ventilator to allow me to talk. And I love telling this story, that my voice just sounded real raspy. It kind of reminded me of Darth Vader from \"Star Wars. \" FLYNN: (Laughter). BEGGIN: So I knew my dad was coming into the hospital that day. He came in, and I just looked at him and said, I am your father. FLYNN: (Laughter). BEGGIN: That just kind of reassured them that I was the same person and kind of helped me, you know, remember nothing's really changed with me mentally. Physically, you know, I was unable to move from the shoulders down. FLYNN: So what this means for the uninitiated is you need a lot of help. And, you know, you have difficulty feeding yourself, I would imagine, grooming. BEGGIN: Yeah, Tim. I mean, you pretty much nailed it. From feeding to getting dressed to your morning routines - bowels, bladder. I have the ability to be independent with my chair, but for the most part, yeah, I mean, this injury has caused me to be fully dependent on someone for practically everything. FLYNN: Austin, buddy, that's about as bad as it gets, my friend (laughter). BEGGIN: Yeah. FLYNN: And I - you know, I don't want to be Pollyanna in, you know, there's always a silver lining to everything, but if you get through this life is not going to throw anything that's much more difficult than this at you. BEGGIN: Oh, you could take on anything after this. FLYNN: Absolutely. And, you know, I really was trying to put myself - I was thinking about you over the weekend, trying to sort of put myself back into that mindset of being hurt for a year, and damned if I didn't start crying. But, you know, one of the important things someone said to me then - this was from one of the psychologists who came in to gauge my level of mental well-being, I guess. You know, after that I threw the first three out who came in and said, how are you feeling? And I'd be, how the hell do you think I feel? You know, get the hell out of here. BEGGIN: Yeah. Right, I love those questions. FLYNN: But then someone came in, must've caught me at a moment of weakness 'cause I listened. They said, in every sort of lifetime, you know, we could do about 10,000 things. And they said, so what's going to happen now is you're going to do a different 10,000 things than you were going to do before. So it became figuring out what that new 10,000 things was going to be, you know, from a career standpoint or, you know - am I ever going to have a girlfriend? Am I getting married? BEGGIN: Obviously, there's no question that the idea of, you know, dating or talking to girls is something that's on your mind. And one thing that happened recently was being in a wedding for one of my best friends growing up. FLYNN: Yeah. BEGGIN: But just being a part of it and seeing how my friend, you know, got to hold his wife's hand and, you know. . . FLYNN: Yeah, yeah. BEGGIN: . . . Kiss her and, I don't know, dance with her. It's things like that that, you know, you're not ever, like, prepared for. . . FLYNN: No, you're not. BEGGIN: . . . In this situation. And I can have, you know, the happiest day leading up to it, but once that moment hits and I see that reality, you know, it sets in that that's something I guess that, you know, I will not be able to do. But - I know that doesn't define me, but at the same time, I mean, those are moments. . . FLYNN: It hurts. It hurts, yeah. BEGGIN: . . . That just get you down. Yeah, it hurts. FLYNN: It hurts. BEGGIN: It does. FLYNN: I'm not going say it's going to stop hurting. You know, I really miss walking arm-in-arm with a woman. That's something I loved doing. BEGGIN: Yeah. I mean, dancing - I used to love to dance. FLYNN: Yeah, that, too. BEGGIN: Just that whole idea. FLYNN: Well, there - you know, you can figure out how to dance. Just encourage somebody to climb up onto your lap and. . . BEGGIN: Yeah. FLYNN: . . . And start driving with your head, dude, you know? BEGGIN: Go for a spin. FLYNN: Go for a spin, you know? I mean, it's - yeah, it's not the same. I get that. But hey, you're in the middle of this minefield of not the same. And it's not going to change. And early on, where you are, that's really tough. You're waking up and you say, uh-oh. Yep, still paralyzed, aren't I? BEGGIN: Well, because I don't know if you had it but, you know, there's plenty of dreams I have and. . . FLYNN: . . . Sure. You're walking in them, aren't you? BEGGIN: I'm not wheelchair-bound. And, you know, you wish you could stay in that dream, and then you wake up and. . . FLYNN: It's absolutely normal to wake up and like, oh, God. Hey, still, buddy, I wake up, you know, and I've got to drag my legs out of bed. . . BEGGIN: Yeah. FLYNN: . . . And I'm like, all right, you know? But I've got someplace to go. You know, having a job is really important and having a good one is important. BEGGIN: Yeah. And I had a job with Nabisco. FLYNN: Yeah. BEGGIN: And they were great even after the injury - letters and the amount of people that came to visit me in the hospital. And they always have assured me that, when the time was right - that I would be ready to go back to work, that, you know, we would find a position that was suited for me. FLYNN: That is phenomenal. I mean, phenomenal. BEGGIN: Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of people that don't kind of have that opportunity after their injury. FLYNN: You said you were in marketing and business administration? BEGGIN: Human resources. FLYNN: Human resources? BEGGIN: Yeah. FLYNN: That's perfect. I mean, it's certainly something you can handle from the chair. You know, look, you've got to come home and have something to talk about at the dinner table. Otherwise, nobody cares about you. You know, from a self-esteem standpoint, it's real important. And one of the big transitions for me - and it took me a good five years to get there - was I kept on looking back into my past, thinking about what I lost. And that's not a strategy for progress. It was when I was sort of able to turn around and start looking forward and sort of looking out into the world and just think in terms of what I got and how I can use it. BEGGIN: I mean, I kind of made it a focal point right off the bat to - as uncomfortable as it was early on, but just go out as often as I could, whether that was restaurants, sporting events. FLYNN: Yeah. Yeah. BEGGIN: So that, you know, I wouldn't keep myself confined to my room where I have just ample amount of time to sit there and think about, you know, all the negative things going on. And that's why, you know, I always enjoy talking to people who, you know, have done well for themselves after this because it's just reassuring that, you know, there is plenty of hope and opportunities out there. FLYNN: There is. And from what I'm hearing over my headphones, here is a confident man who is smart, got a sense of humor. Just keep it up, buddy. BEGGIN: Hey, thank you, Tim. I appreciate your time.

I'm Terry Gross. We're going to talk about the confusing state of our public policy toward marijuana and how attitudes toward marijuana have evolved in the U. S. Twenty-five states have legalized medical marijuana. And four states and the District of Columbia have legalized pot for recreational use. The state of Colorado alone has issued 25,000 licenses to work in the burgeoning marijuana industry. Yet possession of pot, even for medical use, remains a federal crime. For decades, police in the U. S. have arrested untold numbers of people for marijuana offenses, resulting in tough prison sentences for some and stigmatizing all with criminal records. Our guest John Hudak is the author of the new book \"Marijuana: A Short History. \" He's a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and deputy director of the Brookings Center for Effective Public Management. He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies. DAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, John Hudak, welcome to FRESH AIR. You know, the very first line in your book is marijuana is not new. And so I know it dates back thousands of years. But let's just talk about this country. How long have we been using this plant in this country? JOHN HUDAK: We've been using this plant in this country before the United States was a country. The plant cannabis is used to produce hemp. And in the early colonies, hemp was grown quite widely. And in fact, for a period of time, the British crown required landowners to grow the cannabis plant because hemp was such a vital part of the British economy. DAVIES: So hemp, from which rope is made, is the same as marijuana? HUDAK: It comes from the same plant. The difference is that hemp is not psychoactive. It can't get you high if you harvest it. You harvest it for different reasons and it gives different products. So you can make ship sails and ropes and clothing and food and oil and a variety of other products that were absolutely essential for the royal economy. In the 1600s and 1700s, hemp was part of that. DAVIES: I gather from the book that there is evidence that the Founding Fathers and their families were also getting high with this stuff, too? HUDAK: Well, we have evidence that the Founding Fathers - Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, John Adams - grew hemp on their farms. It was, again, such a vital cash crop. They were doing it. But we have some evidence from John Adams actually, where he writes under a pseudonym at one point that if you grow the cannabis plant in a certain way - and I'm paraphrasing of course - it has some mind-altering effects. And it suggests that either John Adams heard through the grapevine - or through the hempvine - that there was a way to produce cannabis that might get you in a great place like the old grog could. Or he did that himself as a hemp farmer. And we don't know for sure, we won't know for sure. But, you know, the Founding Fathers were certainly aware of what this plant could do. DAVIES: OK. So no widespread evidence that people were toking? (Laughter). HUDAK: Yeah. I - we didn't see George Washington in the early White House smoking reefer. But we know that they were producing the plant from which they could have if they wanted to. DAVIES: The term marijuana is a product of the 20th century, right? Where did it come from? HUDAK: So throughout our history, this plant has been in the United States. And actually, throughout the 1800s, it was used for medicinal value. Not widespread, but there were doctors who were prescribing essentially medical marijuana. At that time, it was called cannabis. It was named for what the technical plant name was. And for the longest time, that is how you - if you used medical marijuana, medical cannabis, that's what your prescription would call for. Or the products that you would use would say that they contained cannabis. It wasn't until really the introduction of this product as a labeled Mexican product. And the term that was used in Mexico - marijuana spelled not with a J but with an H - began its sort of linguistic introduction into the United States. And it very quickly became a center point for political conflict in the U. S. DAVIES: Why was that? HUDAK: Well, in part it was what happens in this country from time to time. And that is the political class using an individual group or a product or a behavior to vilify huge groups of people. And so after the Spanish-American War and after Mexican immigration into the United States began to increase, there were people in this country who were very uncomfortable with that. And so marijuana gave individuals - in media organizations in particular - an opportunity to vilify these new Mexican immigrants. And to say that they were lazy, and that they were a problem, and that they were bringing these drugs into this country, who were ruining the quote, unquote, \"good Americans. \" Thankfully, our politics don't do that anymore. But it was certainly something that was happening at the turn of the century. DAVIES: And the name stuck? HUDAK: The name stuck. And it's actually an interesting story. And I discussed this in the book about this terminology being so controversial, even in the reform community today. An anecdote I like to tell is that I was at a drug policy conference last year. And there was a speaker up on stage who said, I refuse to spell cannabis with an M. And I sat there and I'd never heard that phrase before. And I thought, what is he talking about? I don't understand it. Until I realized he was so offended by the word marijuana and the racialized history that it had, that he was never willing to use that word, even though it is the more common term rather than cannabis. DAVIES: All right. So going back to the early 20th century, what was the government's approach to the regulation of marijuana? HUDAK: The government's approach to regulation early on was nonexistent. And that's typically true of any medical product in the United States. We had very little federal-level regulation of anything, frankly, in - for much of the 1800s. But as the Progressive reform movement in the late 1800s and early 1900s began, you started to see the federal government step in and flex its regulatory muscle. And so the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act was passed. That was a law passed by the United States Congress that sought to do pretty much what the title of the law says, and that was regulate food, drugs and cosmetics. And so the first step toward regulation was just to try to make sure that this product - which was being prescribed by doctors or doled out by doctors for certain types of medical treatment - would be regulated in some way. That there would be safe means of getting that product, producing that product, making sure that it was the real thing. Which, again, turn of the century medical regulation was nothing like it was today. But it was one step forward at least. DAVIES: You write that a key figure in drug policy in the United States was a guy named Harry Anslinger, who was there for decades. Tell us who he was, and what was his impact? HUDAK: Harry Anslinger was the the nation's first real drug czar. He came from the Bureau of Prohibition and was put in charge of a variety of federal government agencies that changed names over the course of time, but were effectively the precursors for the Drug Enforcement Agency. Harry Anslinger is someone who is not well known, even though he was essentially the J. Edgar Hoover of drugs in the United States. He had the same types of tactics that Hoover had. That was being very aggressive with Congress, going into the media to try to advance his political and policy interests. He had details and histories of members of Congress and senators that they did not want to become public. And he was a one-man force in expanding drug prohibition in the United States. He did this for a variety of drugs. But he had a special place in his heart for marijuana. DAVIES: All right. So at a time when marijuana was used maybe - certainly not as widely as it came to be, but used and might have been seen in any number of ways by government regulators, what was the attitude that Harry Anslinger brought to it? And what was its impact on enforcement and regulation? HUDAK: Anslinger brought to it this real racialized aspect. I mean, he was an absolute unavowed racist. And when you look at the letters he wrote two different civic organizations or op-eds that he published or even congressional testimony, it is riddled with racist language and racist claims about the use of marijuana really being only in Mexican communities in the Southwest, and then eventually it transitioned to be a product that was used by the individuals who were around jazz music, which of course was code language for the African-American community. And he was one who thought that marijuana was this evil that was coming to the United States, and he claimed that marijuana would turn people into psychopaths, murderers, rapists. It would make women promiscuous, particularly promiscuous around men of color. And this was seen as something that was brought into communities by people of color in order to make the most vulnerable in society behave in ways that would appall society. And this was, at the time, considered serious public policy claims. Anslinger would use statistics that oftentimes were made up just to advance these claims and to turn America against this plant and groups of people. And he was masterful in terms of fear mongering, in terms of propaganda and in terms of really making the United States Congress a puppet. And he was aided in this way by Hollywood. He was aided in this way by the American media. Regardless of what you think of marijuana, the way that this was perpetrated really leaves a dark mark on this nation's history. DAVIES: We're speaking with John Hudak. He is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, we're speaking with John Hudak. He is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. He has a new book about the history of marijuana policy in the United States. It's called \"Marijuana: A Short History. \"Harry Anslinger guided drug policy in the '30s, '40s and '50s, and I guess then marijuana was criminalized and banned. When we look at the post-war era, you write quite a bit about the various administrations - Eisenhower, Nixon, others - and there's a pattern that I discern, which is that in many cases presidents, often Republican presidents, would commission reports on marijuana and its actual effects and potential ways to regulate or deregulate it. And then there would be the actual policies that the government followed. Let's talk about the reports first. What did these commissions conclude when they looked at marijuana? HUDAK: There were a lot of reports that were produced over a period of time, the first actually being royal. The British government commissioned a report to look into this and it found that marijuana was not as harmful as people believed widely that it was, that it wasn't as addictive, that there could be medicinal value to it. But the British government was not the only government to do this. As you said, the American government really worked in this way. The first major report in the U. S. was by Fiorello La Guardia, who ended up becoming the mayor of New York City. And he looked at this crisis, quote, unquote, \"crisis\" that was happening in New York City because he was being told of course by Anslinger that this was a very serious drug in his community and a public health threat and a public safety threat. So he looked at it and he found that the statistics that were being used were false, that marijuana was not as addictive as it was claimed and that it had no relationship with the types of violent crimes that were being reported on in New York City. Well, La Guardia's report was trashed. Anslinger trashed him personally and went on a crusade to undermine him, eventually pushing the American Medical Association to respond negatively to it. There was an Eisenhower report commissioned in the '50s. Again, it was an interdepartmental, a cabinet-level group who looked into the same question and came up with the same answers that La Guardia did. In the 1970s, President Nixon commissioned the former governor of Pennsylvania Ray Shafer, who was a good friend, a fellow Republican, a good friend of Nixon's, to commission this report about this evil drug infecting society. And Shafer came up again with the same answers. It wasn't as addicting, that there were reasons to try to think about this drug in different ways than the federal government was thinking about it, that it wasn't causing violent crime. And Shafer was actually called into the Oval Office and read off by the president for this draft report. And he said to Shafer, you cannot publish this. And Shafer stood his ground. He said, I'm publishing it and Nixon trashed that. And it was just this extended period of a president after president asking for answers, not getting the answers that he liked and then throwing the report away. DAVIES: If these reports concluded that marijuana was not as addictive, was not necessarily a gateway drug to heroin, was not causing, you know, violent crime and mental pathologies, what did guide government policy and where did it go? HUDAK: Government policy was guided by a few things. One was politics at its core. Being able to be tough on drugs and fighting the drug war was something that was very successful for many presidents over a period of time, chief among them of course, Richard Nixon. This was a way to vilify out-groups, which in some cases were communities of color - again, blacks, Latinos, others - but there were other groups, there were beatniks in the '50s and hippies in the '60s and groups that Richard Nixon personally thought to be a threat to him and to his coalition. And so the politics there really allowed or really encouraged the president to crack down on this drug, and he did. At the same time, you started to grow a law enforcement community around this, which culturally took hold to believe that this was bad, and you also grew culture within the United States among the mass public that this was a problem. This was a serious threat. When you look at Ronald Reagan's rhetoric about this, you have no idea, in a vacuum, whether he's talking about marijuana or talking about the Soviet Union, the way he's talking about this threat, this war, this evil. And I think when you take a step back, you understand that rarely is politics nice to look at. But when you're talking about the drug war, it really has a nasty tone to it. DAVIES: So one of the things that began to change public opinion about marijuana was its increasing use for medical purposes. When did that happen, and how? HUDAK: Well, people have been self-medicating with marijuana for millennia. We have evidence from the Chinese empire of this. We have evidence that British royals were prescribed cannabis for pain relief. And in America, it was part of the United States Pharmacopeia until 1942. But in terms of a policy change, this really began in the Castro District of San Francisco in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The AIDS epidemic was savaging and ravaging this community, and it was one that individuals, I think, looked at this product that was largely being used recreationally and understood that it helped with pain relief. Or people were saying, you know, if I smoke this and I get the munchies, maybe it will help for people dying of AIDS who are so nauseated that they can't eat and they're dealing with clinical anorexia as a result of that. And so you had a few individuals, Dennis Peron was one - is one. A woman named Brownie Mary, who was an orderly at a hospital in San Francisco who would bake brownies laced with marijuana and deliver them to AIDS patients each day. And this community popped up around delivering medical cannabis for those who were dying. And it wasn't only people dying of AIDS. It was people who had a variety of ailments. And that grassroots underground - even though it was pretty much in the daylight for some time - movement transitioned into a political one. And in 1996, California became the first state to pass a medical marijuana ballot initiative. DAVIES: Now, when states began to develop medical marijuana programs, they were illegal under federal law. And there are, of course, federal agencies that can investigate - you know, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI. Did they? Were there raids? HUDAK: Absolutely. There still are raids today because, again, it remains a federal crime. In California, for instance, after the initiative was passed in 1996, DEA agents and others were cracking down on these marijuana grow cooperatives and individuals who had plants. And these were sometimes done in conjunction with local or state law enforcement. Sometimes it was done unilaterally by DEA and FBI and others. But this was happening because the federal government did not know how to react to this real slap in the face from California about federal law. And those raids continued. As more states legalized medical marijuana, raids continued in those states. And like I said, they even continue today. DAVIES: Well, were - I mean, there's a lot of discretion in what gets investigated and what gets prosecuted among law enforcement personnel. Was there any logic to the raids? I mean, were there particularly bad actors they were going after, however you define that? HUDAK: There were absolutely bad actors who the federal government was going after. I think some people in the policy community often paint the raids in marijuana - medical marijuana reform states as only, you know, arresting old ladies and people dying of cancer. The reality is that there were certainly individuals who fit that profile who were being raided, but there were also operations that were, you know, violating even the spirit of the initiative in California. But it was. . . DAVIES: . . . What were the - who were the bad actors? What were they doing that made them, you know -HUDAK: Well, there were certainly institutions who were working with cartels, you know, growers working with cartels. There were growers who were growing extraordinary amounts of marijuana and not necessarily working with individuals who were qualified patients - that is, individuals who are eligible under the initiative and under the law to be medical marijuana users. And so that was going on. There's no doubt about that. But in the process, others were being affected, too. And so grow cooperatives in California that were serving, you know, communities who had cancer or other illnesses that the law was meant to help, that the initiative was meant to help were also seeing these crackdowns. And so in some ways, there appeared to be very little rhyme or reason as to how the federal government was enforcing except that they oftentimes tried to work with local law enforcement. But they cannot force local law enforcement to help them, so where they could get the help they oftentimes went in. And sometimes these were almost paramilitaristic (ph) operations with helicopters and huge guns and nighttime raids and things like that. GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with John Hudak, author of the new book \"Marijuana: A Short History. \" He's a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. After a break, they'll talk about upcoming initiatives to legalize marijuana. And Ken Tucker will review the new solo album by Bob Weir, a co-founder of the Grateful Dead. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with John Hudak, author of the new book \"Marijuana: A Short History. \" It's about how public policy on marijuana has evolved and the current conflicting laws and regulations. Twenty-five states have legalized medical marijuana. Four states and the District of Columbia have legalized pot for recreational use. But the possession of pot, even for medical use, remains a federal crime. DAVIES: So let's talk about how legalization has worked in places where it has happened. We've - there are four states that permit recreational use. That's happened within the last - what? - five years or so. And a lot of - to get that done, it often required winning a referendum, which can be a big political job in a big state. I mean, typically these are, you know, won when political professionals are involved. Was that the case with the marijuana legalization efforts, and who paid for it? HUDAK: That's absolutely correct. So to lay out the landscape, sort of the legal landscape around this, four states and D. C. have legalized recreational marijuana. Colorado and Washington were the first in November of 2012. They were followed by Oregon and Alaska and D. C. in 2014. Each was passed by a ballot initiative. And they set up a system of - with the exception of Washington, D. C. - a regulated commercial market in which marijuana would be sold at dispensaries throughout the states. And individuals 21 and over can go into those stores and purchase marijuana like they would purchase products at a grocery store or a clothing store or a shoe store. DAVIES: So California has an initiative this year. Are there other states that are near votes on this question? HUDAK: There are five states this year, in 2016, that will consider recreational marijuana initiatives. They are California, here in Nevada, Arizona, Massachusetts and Maine. There are also four states running medical marijuana ballot initiatives. They include Florida, Arkansas, North Dakota and Montana. DAVIES: You said that taxes are as high as 37 percent in some state taxes on marijuana. I mean, do states look upon this as a revenue source the way they look at casinos, kind of a cash cow that will fund public needs? HUDAK: Yes, states definitely see the revenue benefits of marijuana happening every day. I mean, Colorado has made hundreds of millions of dollars in tax and fee revenue since legalization has happened, both off the medical and the recreational side. States see this as an opportunity to get more money in the door. It's certainly not, you know, going to be the cure-all to balance the books in states, but it is money that would not be collected otherwise if this remained a black market industry. That said, what - if you talk to people who work on these campaigns and have worked on these campaigns, early on, they thought that the revenue argument - oh, let's get more taxes and let's spend that money on schools and law enforcement and mental health and addiction services - was going to be a huge selling point. And it is for some people, but it was much less of a convincing argument for a lot of voters. And other issues like personal liberty or criminal justice issues or safety issues, those were the ones that were selling with different sub demographics within these states. And revenue was only a small part of that argument. DAVIES: Well, let's just go into that for a moment. When these fights over marijuana legalization occur, and there are these ballot initiatives, give us a sense of the arguments against and the arguments in favor. HUDAK: The arguments against focus quite a bit on public health and public safety, and those focus on mental health and addiction on the access of marijuana for children and young people. They look at - they focus on things like DUID, driving under the influence of drugs. They look at - and now, as this industry matures, they'll look at unfortunate cases in states that have legalized and make political arguments around that. For instance, challenges that existed around marijuana edibles in Colorado early on was part of the conversation in opposition in later states to legalize. DAVIES: And what are the arguments in favor? HUDAK: Yeah, the arguments in favor focus on a variety of issues. So you can go into communities of color - Black and Latino communities - and say, look at what law enforcement has done to your young men and young women by enforcing this law. Let's legalize it. Let's stop these arrests. You know, we have 750,000 arrests in a year that have to do with marijuana, some of them large-scale things, but many of them simple possession. And so in communities of color that criminal justice argument is a tremendous one. For Libertarians, you talk about personal liberty and privacy and property rights, and that is an important issue for them. For, you know, people who are interested - conservatives or liberals - who are interested in balancing the budget, talking about all of the law enforcement dollars that are spent on the prosecution and investigation of marijuana crimes in a year. That's budget savings, as well as revenue in the door on the tax side. And so that makes sense to them. For others, it is about product safety, understanding that a regulatory system is going to be able to test the product, and you'll know exactly, as a consumer, what you're getting, whereas on the black market, you don't know that. Arguments are made about displacing cartels and displacing illegal operations in states that can have violent elements around it. And, frankly, one of the - one significant argument in favor of adult-use marijuana that not many people talk about is a simple one, and that is some people just like to get high. And I think in this policy debate, oftentimes seeing marijuana as a recreational product is - it is frowned upon to discuss it. But it's a reality. People enjoy it like people enjoy wine or people enjoy a good steak, and they're getting some sort of utility out of that, some sort of benefit out of it. And while that's, you know, not plastered on billboards in states that are looking to legalize or run on TV ads, it is an important part of what people consider. DAVIES: Take us to a city where recreational marijuana is legal now - you know, I don't know, Seattle or Denver or Portland. What's the experience like? What do you see? HUDAK: You can go down to downtown Denver, and you can look into the storefront or pop into the storefront of a marijuana dispensary, and it looks more like an Apple store. You go in, and it's not like going into a convenience store where everything's just laid out on shelves and you pick and choose. There are, in these states, limits on how much you can buy at a time, so everything is behind counters. And the individual who serves you is called a budtender, and that person will guide you through what your - what type of experience you're trying to achieve, whether it is - you know, someone who wants an appetite increase or an appetite suppressant, or someone who wants to relax or someone who wants energy. Depending on what kind of high you want, they'll help you - walk you through that. And you'll have whole-flower marijuana that you can grind up and roll and smoke or put into a bowl or a bong or whatever. You can get edibles. You can get creams and other types of products. You know, the variety of products you can get, particularly on the adult-use market, is something that is fascinating. You can get pre-rolled joints or rolling papers to roll your own. It's a pretty interesting experience, actually. Regardless of what you think of marijuana reform, if you are ever in a state that has recreational marijuana, I encourage everyone to go into a dispensary just to see what it looks like. I mean, you might hate it. You might love it. You'll probably be surprised by what you see. DAVIES: We're speaking with John Hudak. He is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, we're speaking with John Hudak. He is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. His new book about marijuana policy is called \"Marijuana: A Short History. \"You know, we have this circumstance where, you know, there's increased legal marijuana use in many states. But it remains illegal under federal law. And even if the federal government doesn't choose to conduct investigations and raids, there are still some problems associated with the fact that it's not legal. You want to talk about some of those? HUDAK: There are a number of problems that exist because the legal marijuana framework that we have in this country is wholly done at the state level, and then sort of allowed at the federal level. And what happens, what that means is that there are challenges within industry, there are challenges for customers. And so let me talk about a few. One of them involves taxes. So if you're a marijuana business - or let me back up. If you're any business in the United States that's not a marijuana business, and you invest in your company or you do research or you do any variety of everyday business operations, you're entitled on your federal taxes - federal business taxes to certain write-offs. And that's how businesses stay afloat and make financial decisions about expansion or what. Under federal law though, because this is an illegal substance, those businesses are still required to pay their taxes. But they're not entitled to any write-offs. So they are effectively just communicating incoming revenue to the state without really being able to write-off much of anything. There are a few write-offs they're entitled to, but nothing that allows them to function as a normal business. So that can mean for some businesses, you have - in a year, 100 to 150 percent of your revenue is a tax burden. And so as much money as - is coming in, as much or more is going out the door to the IRS. Beyond that, banks are loathe to enter this space because of federal prohibition. So it means that in most states, the marijuana industry is a cash-only business, which introduces security challenges. And to put that into perspective, most marijuana businesses cannot get a checking account. They can't get a savings account. They're not entitled to a business loan or a line of credit, things that any business in the United States depends on heavily. So that cash-only business means that the marijuana industry is trafficking in huge sums of cash at any time. That increases security challenges. It poses opportunities for money laundering. And it's just a really ineffective policy. DAVIES: There have been been several efforts to get marijuana declassified as a schedule I drug, that is to say, the most serious, dangerous drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. That - one of those efforts came to a conclusion this summer and the government did not change it. It left it as a schedule I drug. Why? What happened? HUDAK: One of the reasons for the maintenance of marijuana as a schedule I substance was that the medical community is not convinced of its medical value. There are plenty of doctors who believe that there is medical value to marijuana. They're willing to recommend it to patients. But the threshold required to demonstrate medical value for the community as a whole - the medical community as a whole is much higher than it is for the reform community. And so I think they are looking for more rigorous, broader extensive research into this as a medicine. And even though we do have a significant number of studies that indicate medical value under certain circumstances for certain conditions, we don't have a ton of research that meets that gold standard, the double-blind placebo experiments that are done on a variety of other medical issues in this country every day. But marijuana research has been slow to get there, and thus the federal government issued that ruling in August. DAVIES: Is there a catch-22? I mean, can you demonstrate that it has medical value if there's - if it's illegal? And. . . HUDAK: That - so, yeah, there is this cannabis catch-22. And it is as a schedule I drug, it is very difficult to do research on the plant. There are only certain, you know, researchers who will get the certification and licensure necessary to handle the drug. Then of course, you need the funding to study it. You need approval from university institutional review boards. And the burdens that exist to do the type of research on a schedule I drug are tremendous. But that research is what will help inform the medical community as to its medical use. And so what you need and what you can do are entirely prevented by this federal government policy. And so for me, I think given that this is a - policy reality in the states, the federal government should be doing everything it can to answer these questions about medical value. And they should be doing it as quickly as possible. I understand the rescheduling decision was made because of that three-part criteria. But given that there are 25 states and the District of Columbia that allow medical marijuana, you would think the federal government would carve out some sort of exception that would facilitate research in the face of this policy reality. DAVIES: You write that there have been a number of efforts to change marijuana regulation at the federal level and they've all failed. And, you know, everybody knows how much partisan gridlock there is in Congress. And I wonder if the fault lines of the battles over marijuana legalization fall along the lines of the other partisan battles in Congress. HUDAK: It really doesn't. This is the most fascinating part of the marijuana issue for me. You look out at our politics right now and they are exactly what you said, partisan gridlock. It's not so with marijuana policy, though. So when you look at Congress and you look at the people who are working on some of the most cutting-edge reform legislation, you see people like Cory Booker, a senator from New Jersey who is a progressive - as progressive as they come, in many ways - working side-by-side with Rand Paul, who is a Libertarian senator from Kentucky and in many ways very, very conservative. That is not just two senators who happen to like each other and happen to get along on this one issue. It actually puts into perspective how diverse this coalition of support around marijuana is. Different members of Congress from different parties, from different perspectives, from different backgrounds are coming at this in very different ways. But at the end, they're coming out to the same outcome. And increasingly, that outcome is moving toward a pro-reform direction. DAVIES: How did you get into this area of research? HUDAK: So this is an interesting question. I get this a lot. If you told me five years ago when I was, you know, finishing up graduate school that I would be studying this, I would've laughed at you. I study the presidency. I study the executive branch of government. And I don't - before this really never looked at marijuana. And a colleague of mine came down to my office in October of 2012, and he said, you know, Colorado and Washington, I think one of these states - there's an outside chance - might legalize marijuana this year. Have you ever thought of doing research on it? And I said, absolutely not at all. All I knew at that point was that there were ballot initiatives there. I didn't know anything about it. He said, well, if one of them passes, if one of them happens to pass, this - these states or this state is going to have to set up a huge regulatory system, a new administration, hire people. And you ask about all those questions in a variety of other areas. And I don't think anyone's going to be asking these questions around marijuana. Why don't you take a look at it and see what you think? And so I started to do some reading on these initiatives and the movement, and just really - it became such a fascination for me. And you might say I got addicted. DAVIES: Well, John Hudak, thanks so much for speaking with us. HUDAK: Thank you. GROSS: John Hudak is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of the new book \"Marijuana: A Short History. \" After we take a short break, Ken Tucker will review the new solo album by Bob Weir, who co-founded the Grateful Dead. This is FRESH AIR. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In the audio of this story, our guest incorrectly refers to the Drug Enforcement Administration as the Drug Enforcement Agency. ] TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. We're going to talk about the confusing state of our public policy toward marijuana and how attitudes toward marijuana have evolved in the U. S. Twenty-five states have legalized medical marijuana. And four states and the District of Columbia have legalized pot for recreational use. The state of Colorado alone has issued 25,000 licenses to work in the burgeoning marijuana industry. Yet possession of pot, even for medical use, remains a federal crime. For decades, police in the U. S. have arrested untold numbers of people for marijuana offenses, resulting in tough prison sentences for some and stigmatizing all with criminal records. Our guest John Hudak is the author of the new book \"Marijuana: A Short History. \" He's a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and deputy director of the Brookings Center for Effective Public Management. He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies. DAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, John Hudak, welcome to FRESH AIR. You know, the very first line in your book is marijuana is not new. And so I know it dates back thousands of years. But let's just talk about this country. How long have we been using this plant in this country? JOHN HUDAK: We've been using this plant in this country before the United States was a country. The plant cannabis is used to produce hemp. And in the early colonies, hemp was grown quite widely. And in fact, for a period of time, the British crown required landowners to grow the cannabis plant because hemp was such a vital part of the British economy. DAVIES: So hemp, from which rope is made, is the same as marijuana? HUDAK: It comes from the same plant. The difference is that hemp is not psychoactive. It can't get you high if you harvest it. You harvest it for different reasons and it gives different products. So you can make ship sails and ropes and clothing and food and oil and a variety of other products that were absolutely essential for the royal economy. In the 1600s and 1700s, hemp was part of that. DAVIES: I gather from the book that there is evidence that the Founding Fathers and their families were also getting high with this stuff, too? HUDAK: Well, we have evidence that the Founding Fathers - Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, John Adams - grew hemp on their farms. It was, again, such a vital cash crop. They were doing it. But we have some evidence from John Adams actually, where he writes under a pseudonym at one point that if you grow the cannabis plant in a certain way - and I'm paraphrasing of course - it has some mind-altering effects. And it suggests that either John Adams heard through the grapevine - or through the hempvine - that there was a way to produce cannabis that might get you in a great place like the old grog could. Or he did that himself as a hemp farmer. And we don't know for sure, we won't know for sure. But, you know, the Founding Fathers were certainly aware of what this plant could do. DAVIES: OK. So no widespread evidence that people were toking? (Laughter). HUDAK: Yeah. I - we didn't see George Washington in the early White House smoking reefer. But we know that they were producing the plant from which they could have if they wanted to. DAVIES: The term marijuana is a product of the 20th century, right? Where did it come from? HUDAK: So throughout our history, this plant has been in the United States. And actually, throughout the 1800s, it was used for medicinal value. Not widespread, but there were doctors who were prescribing essentially medical marijuana. At that time, it was called cannabis. It was named for what the technical plant name was. And for the longest time, that is how you - if you used medical marijuana, medical cannabis, that's what your prescription would call for. Or the products that you would use would say that they contained cannabis. It wasn't until really the introduction of this product as a labeled Mexican product. And the term that was used in Mexico - marijuana spelled not with a J but with an H - began its sort of linguistic introduction into the United States. And it very quickly became a center point for political conflict in the U. S. DAVIES: Why was that? HUDAK: Well, in part it was what happens in this country from time to time. And that is the political class using an individual group or a product or a behavior to vilify huge groups of people. And so after the Spanish-American War and after Mexican immigration into the United States began to increase, there were people in this country who were very uncomfortable with that. And so marijuana gave individuals - in media organizations in particular - an opportunity to vilify these new Mexican immigrants. And to say that they were lazy, and that they were a problem, and that they were bringing these drugs into this country, who were ruining the quote, unquote, \"good Americans. \" Thankfully, our politics don't do that anymore. But it was certainly something that was happening at the turn of the century. DAVIES: And the name stuck? HUDAK: The name stuck. And it's actually an interesting story. And I discussed this in the book about this terminology being so controversial, even in the reform community today. An anecdote I like to tell is that I was at a drug policy conference last year. And there was a speaker up on stage who said, I refuse to spell cannabis with an M. And I sat there and I'd never heard that phrase before. And I thought, what is he talking about? I don't understand it. Until I realized he was so offended by the word marijuana and the racialized history that it had, that he was never willing to use that word, even though it is the more common term rather than cannabis. DAVIES: All right. So going back to the early 20th century, what was the government's approach to the regulation of marijuana? HUDAK: The government's approach to regulation early on was nonexistent. And that's typically true of any medical product in the United States. We had very little federal-level regulation of anything, frankly, in - for much of the 1800s. But as the Progressive reform movement in the late 1800s and early 1900s began, you started to see the federal government step in and flex its regulatory muscle. And so the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act was passed. That was a law passed by the United States Congress that sought to do pretty much what the title of the law says, and that was regulate food, drugs and cosmetics. And so the first step toward regulation was just to try to make sure that this product - which was being prescribed by doctors or doled out by doctors for certain types of medical treatment - would be regulated in some way. That there would be safe means of getting that product, producing that product, making sure that it was the real thing. Which, again, turn of the century medical regulation was nothing like it was today. But it was one step forward at least. DAVIES: You write that a key figure in drug policy in the United States was a guy named Harry Anslinger, who was there for decades. Tell us who he was, and what was his impact? HUDAK: Harry Anslinger was the the nation's first real drug czar. He came from the Bureau of Prohibition and was put in charge of a variety of federal government agencies that changed names over the course of time, but were effectively the precursors for the Drug Enforcement Agency. Harry Anslinger is someone who is not well known, even though he was essentially the J. Edgar Hoover of drugs in the United States. He had the same types of tactics that Hoover had. That was being very aggressive with Congress, going into the media to try to advance his political and policy interests. He had details and histories of members of Congress and senators that they did not want to become public. And he was a one-man force in expanding drug prohibition in the United States. He did this for a variety of drugs. But he had a special place in his heart for marijuana. DAVIES: All right. So at a time when marijuana was used maybe - certainly not as widely as it came to be, but used and might have been seen in any number of ways by government regulators, what was the attitude that Harry Anslinger brought to it? And what was its impact on enforcement and regulation? HUDAK: Anslinger brought to it this real racialized aspect. I mean, he was an absolute unavowed racist. And when you look at the letters he wrote two different civic organizations or op-eds that he published or even congressional testimony, it is riddled with racist language and racist claims about the use of marijuana really being only in Mexican communities in the Southwest, and then eventually it transitioned to be a product that was used by the individuals who were around jazz music, which of course was code language for the African-American community. And he was one who thought that marijuana was this evil that was coming to the United States, and he claimed that marijuana would turn people into psychopaths, murderers, rapists. It would make women promiscuous, particularly promiscuous around men of color. And this was seen as something that was brought into communities by people of color in order to make the most vulnerable in society behave in ways that would appall society. And this was, at the time, considered serious public policy claims. Anslinger would use statistics that oftentimes were made up just to advance these claims and to turn America against this plant and groups of people. And he was masterful in terms of fear mongering, in terms of propaganda and in terms of really making the United States Congress a puppet. And he was aided in this way by Hollywood. He was aided in this way by the American media. Regardless of what you think of marijuana, the way that this was perpetrated really leaves a dark mark on this nation's history. DAVIES: We're speaking with John Hudak. He is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, we're speaking with John Hudak. He is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. He has a new book about the history of marijuana policy in the United States. It's called \"Marijuana: A Short History. \" Harry Anslinger guided drug policy in the '30s, '40s and '50s, and I guess then marijuana was criminalized and banned. When we look at the post-war era, you write quite a bit about the various administrations - Eisenhower, Nixon, others - and there's a pattern that I discern, which is that in many cases presidents, often Republican presidents, would commission reports on marijuana and its actual effects and potential ways to regulate or deregulate it. And then there would be the actual policies that the government followed. Let's talk about the reports first. What did these commissions conclude when they looked at marijuana? HUDAK: There were a lot of reports that were produced over a period of time, the first actually being royal. The British government commissioned a report to look into this and it found that marijuana was not as harmful as people believed widely that it was, that it wasn't as addictive, that there could be medicinal value to it. But the British government was not the only government to do this. As you said, the American government really worked in this way. The first major report in the U. S. was by Fiorello La Guardia, who ended up becoming the mayor of New York City. And he looked at this crisis, quote, unquote, \"crisis\" that was happening in New York City because he was being told of course by Anslinger that this was a very serious drug in his community and a public health threat and a public safety threat. So he looked at it and he found that the statistics that were being used were false, that marijuana was not as addictive as it was claimed and that it had no relationship with the types of violent crimes that were being reported on in New York City. Well, La Guardia's report was trashed. Anslinger trashed him personally and went on a crusade to undermine him, eventually pushing the American Medical Association to respond negatively to it. There was an Eisenhower report commissioned in the '50s. Again, it was an interdepartmental, a cabinet-level group who looked into the same question and came up with the same answers that La Guardia did. In the 1970s, President Nixon commissioned the former governor of Pennsylvania Ray Shafer, who was a good friend, a fellow Republican, a good friend of Nixon's, to commission this report about this evil drug infecting society. And Shafer came up again with the same answers. It wasn't as addicting, that there were reasons to try to think about this drug in different ways than the federal government was thinking about it, that it wasn't causing violent crime. And Shafer was actually called into the Oval Office and read off by the president for this draft report. And he said to Shafer, you cannot publish this. And Shafer stood his ground. He said, I'm publishing it and Nixon trashed that. And it was just this extended period of a president after president asking for answers, not getting the answers that he liked and then throwing the report away. DAVIES: If these reports concluded that marijuana was not as addictive, was not necessarily a gateway drug to heroin, was not causing, you know, violent crime and mental pathologies, what did guide government policy and where did it go? HUDAK: Government policy was guided by a few things. One was politics at its core. Being able to be tough on drugs and fighting the drug war was something that was very successful for many presidents over a period of time, chief among them of course, Richard Nixon. This was a way to vilify out-groups, which in some cases were communities of color - again, blacks, Latinos, others - but there were other groups, there were beatniks in the '50s and hippies in the '60s and groups that Richard Nixon personally thought to be a threat to him and to his coalition. And so the politics there really allowed or really encouraged the president to crack down on this drug, and he did. At the same time, you started to grow a law enforcement community around this, which culturally took hold to believe that this was bad, and you also grew culture within the United States among the mass public that this was a problem. This was a serious threat. When you look at Ronald Reagan's rhetoric about this, you have no idea, in a vacuum, whether he's talking about marijuana or talking about the Soviet Union, the way he's talking about this threat, this war, this evil. And I think when you take a step back, you understand that rarely is politics nice to look at. But when you're talking about the drug war, it really has a nasty tone to it. DAVIES: So one of the things that began to change public opinion about marijuana was its increasing use for medical purposes. When did that happen, and how? HUDAK: Well, people have been self-medicating with marijuana for millennia. We have evidence from the Chinese empire of this. We have evidence that British royals were prescribed cannabis for pain relief. And in America, it was part of the United States Pharmacopeia until 1942. But in terms of a policy change, this really began in the Castro District of San Francisco in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The AIDS epidemic was savaging and ravaging this community, and it was one that individuals, I think, looked at this product that was largely being used recreationally and understood that it helped with pain relief. Or people were saying, you know, if I smoke this and I get the munchies, maybe it will help for people dying of AIDS who are so nauseated that they can't eat and they're dealing with clinical anorexia as a result of that. And so you had a few individuals, Dennis Peron was one - is one. A woman named Brownie Mary, who was an orderly at a hospital in San Francisco who would bake brownies laced with marijuana and deliver them to AIDS patients each day. And this community popped up around delivering medical cannabis for those who were dying. And it wasn't only people dying of AIDS. It was people who had a variety of ailments. And that grassroots underground - even though it was pretty much in the daylight for some time - movement transitioned into a political one. And in 1996, California became the first state to pass a medical marijuana ballot initiative. DAVIES: Now, when states began to develop medical marijuana programs, they were illegal under federal law. And there are, of course, federal agencies that can investigate - you know, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI. Did they? Were there raids? HUDAK: Absolutely. There still are raids today because, again, it remains a federal crime. In California, for instance, after the initiative was passed in 1996, DEA agents and others were cracking down on these marijuana grow cooperatives and individuals who had plants. And these were sometimes done in conjunction with local or state law enforcement. Sometimes it was done unilaterally by DEA and FBI and others. But this was happening because the federal government did not know how to react to this real slap in the face from California about federal law. And those raids continued. As more states legalized medical marijuana, raids continued in those states. And like I said, they even continue today. DAVIES: Well, were - I mean, there's a lot of discretion in what gets investigated and what gets prosecuted among law enforcement personnel. Was there any logic to the raids? I mean, were there particularly bad actors they were going after, however you define that? HUDAK: There were absolutely bad actors who the federal government was going after. I think some people in the policy community often paint the raids in marijuana - medical marijuana reform states as only, you know, arresting old ladies and people dying of cancer. The reality is that there were certainly individuals who fit that profile who were being raided, but there were also operations that were, you know, violating even the spirit of the initiative in California. But it was. . . DAVIES: . . . What were the - who were the bad actors? What were they doing that made them, you know - HUDAK: Well, there were certainly institutions who were working with cartels, you know, growers working with cartels. There were growers who were growing extraordinary amounts of marijuana and not necessarily working with individuals who were qualified patients - that is, individuals who are eligible under the initiative and under the law to be medical marijuana users. And so that was going on. There's no doubt about that. But in the process, others were being affected, too. And so grow cooperatives in California that were serving, you know, communities who had cancer or other illnesses that the law was meant to help, that the initiative was meant to help were also seeing these crackdowns. And so in some ways, there appeared to be very little rhyme or reason as to how the federal government was enforcing except that they oftentimes tried to work with local law enforcement. But they cannot force local law enforcement to help them, so where they could get the help they oftentimes went in. And sometimes these were almost paramilitaristic (ph) operations with helicopters and huge guns and nighttime raids and things like that. GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with John Hudak, author of the new book \"Marijuana: A Short History. \" He's a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. After a break, they'll talk about upcoming initiatives to legalize marijuana. And Ken Tucker will review the new solo album by Bob Weir, a co-founder of the Grateful Dead. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with John Hudak, author of the new book \"Marijuana: A Short History. \" It's about how public policy on marijuana has evolved and the current conflicting laws and regulations. Twenty-five states have legalized medical marijuana. Four states and the District of Columbia have legalized pot for recreational use. But the possession of pot, even for medical use, remains a federal crime. DAVIES: So let's talk about how legalization has worked in places where it has happened. We've - there are four states that permit recreational use. That's happened within the last - what? - five years or so. And a lot of - to get that done, it often required winning a referendum, which can be a big political job in a big state. I mean, typically these are, you know, won when political professionals are involved. Was that the case with the marijuana legalization efforts, and who paid for it? HUDAK: That's absolutely correct. So to lay out the landscape, sort of the legal landscape around this, four states and D. C. have legalized recreational marijuana. Colorado and Washington were the first in November of 2012. They were followed by Oregon and Alaska and D. C. in 2014. Each was passed by a ballot initiative. And they set up a system of - with the exception of Washington, D. C. - a regulated commercial market in which marijuana would be sold at dispensaries throughout the states. And individuals 21 and over can go into those stores and purchase marijuana like they would purchase products at a grocery store or a clothing store or a shoe store. DAVIES: So California has an initiative this year. Are there other states that are near votes on this question? HUDAK: There are five states this year, in 2016, that will consider recreational marijuana initiatives. They are California, here in Nevada, Arizona, Massachusetts and Maine. There are also four states running medical marijuana ballot initiatives. They include Florida, Arkansas, North Dakota and Montana. DAVIES: You said that taxes are as high as 37 percent in some state taxes on marijuana. I mean, do states look upon this as a revenue source the way they look at casinos, kind of a cash cow that will fund public needs? HUDAK: Yes, states definitely see the revenue benefits of marijuana happening every day. I mean, Colorado has made hundreds of millions of dollars in tax and fee revenue since legalization has happened, both off the medical and the recreational side. States see this as an opportunity to get more money in the door. It's certainly not, you know, going to be the cure-all to balance the books in states, but it is money that would not be collected otherwise if this remained a black market industry. That said, what - if you talk to people who work on these campaigns and have worked on these campaigns, early on, they thought that the revenue argument - oh, let's get more taxes and let's spend that money on schools and law enforcement and mental health and addiction services - was going to be a huge selling point. And it is for some people, but it was much less of a convincing argument for a lot of voters. And other issues like personal liberty or criminal justice issues or safety issues, those were the ones that were selling with different sub demographics within these states. And revenue was only a small part of that argument. DAVIES: Well, let's just go into that for a moment. When these fights over marijuana legalization occur, and there are these ballot initiatives, give us a sense of the arguments against and the arguments in favor. HUDAK: The arguments against focus quite a bit on public health and public safety, and those focus on mental health and addiction on the access of marijuana for children and young people. They look at - they focus on things like DUID, driving under the influence of drugs. They look at - and now, as this industry matures, they'll look at unfortunate cases in states that have legalized and make political arguments around that. For instance, challenges that existed around marijuana edibles in Colorado early on was part of the conversation in opposition in later states to legalize. DAVIES: And what are the arguments in favor? HUDAK: Yeah, the arguments in favor focus on a variety of issues. So you can go into communities of color - Black and Latino communities - and say, look at what law enforcement has done to your young men and young women by enforcing this law. Let's legalize it. Let's stop these arrests. You know, we have 750,000 arrests in a year that have to do with marijuana, some of them large-scale things, but many of them simple possession. And so in communities of color that criminal justice argument is a tremendous one. For Libertarians, you talk about personal liberty and privacy and property rights, and that is an important issue for them. For, you know, people who are interested - conservatives or liberals - who are interested in balancing the budget, talking about all of the law enforcement dollars that are spent on the prosecution and investigation of marijuana crimes in a year. That's budget savings, as well as revenue in the door on the tax side. And so that makes sense to them. For others, it is about product safety, understanding that a regulatory system is going to be able to test the product, and you'll know exactly, as a consumer, what you're getting, whereas on the black market, you don't know that. Arguments are made about displacing cartels and displacing illegal operations in states that can have violent elements around it. And, frankly, one of the - one significant argument in favor of adult-use marijuana that not many people talk about is a simple one, and that is some people just like to get high. And I think in this policy debate, oftentimes seeing marijuana as a recreational product is - it is frowned upon to discuss it. But it's a reality. People enjoy it like people enjoy wine or people enjoy a good steak, and they're getting some sort of utility out of that, some sort of benefit out of it. And while that's, you know, not plastered on billboards in states that are looking to legalize or run on TV ads, it is an important part of what people consider. DAVIES: Take us to a city where recreational marijuana is legal now - you know, I don't know, Seattle or Denver or Portland. What's the experience like? What do you see? HUDAK: You can go down to downtown Denver, and you can look into the storefront or pop into the storefront of a marijuana dispensary, and it looks more like an Apple store. You go in, and it's not like going into a convenience store where everything's just laid out on shelves and you pick and choose. There are, in these states, limits on how much you can buy at a time, so everything is behind counters. And the individual who serves you is called a budtender, and that person will guide you through what your - what type of experience you're trying to achieve, whether it is - you know, someone who wants an appetite increase or an appetite suppressant, or someone who wants to relax or someone who wants energy. Depending on what kind of high you want, they'll help you - walk you through that. And you'll have whole-flower marijuana that you can grind up and roll and smoke or put into a bowl or a bong or whatever. You can get edibles. You can get creams and other types of products. You know, the variety of products you can get, particularly on the adult-use market, is something that is fascinating. You can get pre-rolled joints or rolling papers to roll your own. It's a pretty interesting experience, actually. Regardless of what you think of marijuana reform, if you are ever in a state that has recreational marijuana, I encourage everyone to go into a dispensary just to see what it looks like. I mean, you might hate it. You might love it. You'll probably be surprised by what you see. DAVIES: We're speaking with John Hudak. He is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, we're speaking with John Hudak. He is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. His new book about marijuana policy is called \"Marijuana: A Short History. \" You know, we have this circumstance where, you know, there's increased legal marijuana use in many states. But it remains illegal under federal law. And even if the federal government doesn't choose to conduct investigations and raids, there are still some problems associated with the fact that it's not legal. You want to talk about some of those? HUDAK: There are a number of problems that exist because the legal marijuana framework that we have in this country is wholly done at the state level, and then sort of allowed at the federal level. And what happens, what that means is that there are challenges within industry, there are challenges for customers. And so let me talk about a few. One of them involves taxes. So if you're a marijuana business - or let me back up. If you're any business in the United States that's not a marijuana business, and you invest in your company or you do research or you do any variety of everyday business operations, you're entitled on your federal taxes - federal business taxes to certain write-offs. And that's how businesses stay afloat and make financial decisions about expansion or what. Under federal law though, because this is an illegal substance, those businesses are still required to pay their taxes. But they're not entitled to any write-offs. So they are effectively just communicating incoming revenue to the state without really being able to write-off much of anything. There are a few write-offs they're entitled to, but nothing that allows them to function as a normal business. So that can mean for some businesses, you have - in a year, 100 to 150 percent of your revenue is a tax burden. And so as much money as - is coming in, as much or more is going out the door to the IRS. Beyond that, banks are loathe to enter this space because of federal prohibition. So it means that in most states, the marijuana industry is a cash-only business, which introduces security challenges. And to put that into perspective, most marijuana businesses cannot get a checking account. They can't get a savings account. They're not entitled to a business loan or a line of credit, things that any business in the United States depends on heavily. So that cash-only business means that the marijuana industry is trafficking in huge sums of cash at any time. That increases security challenges. It poses opportunities for money laundering. And it's just a really ineffective policy. DAVIES: There have been been several efforts to get marijuana declassified as a schedule I drug, that is to say, the most serious, dangerous drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. That - one of those efforts came to a conclusion this summer and the government did not change it. It left it as a schedule I drug. Why? What happened? HUDAK: One of the reasons for the maintenance of marijuana as a schedule I substance was that the medical community is not convinced of its medical value. There are plenty of doctors who believe that there is medical value to marijuana. They're willing to recommend it to patients. But the threshold required to demonstrate medical value for the community as a whole - the medical community as a whole is much higher than it is for the reform community. And so I think they are looking for more rigorous, broader extensive research into this as a medicine. And even though we do have a significant number of studies that indicate medical value under certain circumstances for certain conditions, we don't have a ton of research that meets that gold standard, the double-blind placebo experiments that are done on a variety of other medical issues in this country every day. But marijuana research has been slow to get there, and thus the federal government issued that ruling in August. DAVIES: Is there a catch-22? I mean, can you demonstrate that it has medical value if there's - if it's illegal? And. . . HUDAK: That - so, yeah, there is this cannabis catch-22. And it is as a schedule I drug, it is very difficult to do research on the plant. There are only certain, you know, researchers who will get the certification and licensure necessary to handle the drug. Then of course, you need the funding to study it. You need approval from university institutional review boards. And the burdens that exist to do the type of research on a schedule I drug are tremendous. But that research is what will help inform the medical community as to its medical use. And so what you need and what you can do are entirely prevented by this federal government policy. And so for me, I think given that this is a - policy reality in the states, the federal government should be doing everything it can to answer these questions about medical value. And they should be doing it as quickly as possible. I understand the rescheduling decision was made because of that three-part criteria. But given that there are 25 states and the District of Columbia that allow medical marijuana, you would think the federal government would carve out some sort of exception that would facilitate research in the face of this policy reality. DAVIES: You write that there have been a number of efforts to change marijuana regulation at the federal level and they've all failed. And, you know, everybody knows how much partisan gridlock there is in Congress. And I wonder if the fault lines of the battles over marijuana legalization fall along the lines of the other partisan battles in Congress. HUDAK: It really doesn't. This is the most fascinating part of the marijuana issue for me. You look out at our politics right now and they are exactly what you said, partisan gridlock. It's not so with marijuana policy, though. So when you look at Congress and you look at the people who are working on some of the most cutting-edge reform legislation, you see people like Cory Booker, a senator from New Jersey who is a progressive - as progressive as they come, in many ways - working side-by-side with Rand Paul, who is a Libertarian senator from Kentucky and in many ways very, very conservative. That is not just two senators who happen to like each other and happen to get along on this one issue. It actually puts into perspective how diverse this coalition of support around marijuana is. Different members of Congress from different parties, from different perspectives, from different backgrounds are coming at this in very different ways. But at the end, they're coming out to the same outcome. And increasingly, that outcome is moving toward a pro-reform direction. DAVIES: How did you get into this area of research? HUDAK: So this is an interesting question. I get this a lot. If you told me five years ago when I was, you know, finishing up graduate school that I would be studying this, I would've laughed at you. I study the presidency. I study the executive branch of government. And I don't - before this really never looked at marijuana. And a colleague of mine came down to my office in October of 2012, and he said, you know, Colorado and Washington, I think one of these states - there's an outside chance - might legalize marijuana this year. Have you ever thought of doing research on it? And I said, absolutely not at all. All I knew at that point was that there were ballot initiatives there. I didn't know anything about it. He said, well, if one of them passes, if one of them happens to pass, this - these states or this state is going to have to set up a huge regulatory system, a new administration, hire people. And you ask about all those questions in a variety of other areas. And I don't think anyone's going to be asking these questions around marijuana. Why don't you take a look at it and see what you think? And so I started to do some reading on these initiatives and the movement, and just really - it became such a fascination for me. And you might say I got addicted. DAVIES: Well, John Hudak, thanks so much for speaking with us. HUDAK: Thank you.

It turns out that over the past few decades, the odds of any given business failing have increased. NPR social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam is here to talk about this. Hi, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: What's happening? VEDANTAM: Well, I looked at some new research out of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. Vijay Govindarajan and Anup Srivastava analyzed the business life cycles of nearly 30,000 publicly traded firms. INSKEEP: Life cycles - birth, growth, death, the whole deal. VEDANTAM: Exactly. Now this was between 1960 and 2009, and now they find something really interesting. Before 1970, the chances that a new firm will survive for five years was 92 percent. By the 1980s, the odds of five-year survival have dropped to 70 percent. By the 2000s, it's 63 percent. So even as innovation is producing wonderful things for consumers - you know, mobile phones instead of pay phones, email instead of snail mail, taxis at the press of a button - what you also see is that companies now have much higher odds of dying and dying suddenly. INSKEEP: I guess we should be clear. Small businesses actually go out of business at a very high rate. We're talking here about publicly traded companies, reasonably large companies. And I think you might be hinting at a reason why this would be. There's been so much technological change. We're in a time of convulsion. VEDANTAM: We are. And in many ways, you know, the idea that failure might actually be a good thing has become a mantra at many companies, the idea that you try things quickly and you fail, and then when you learn from your failure and you innovate. One of the central ideas of being an entrepreneur now is that you don't fear failure as much as your parents might have done 40 years ago. INSKEEP: Well, that sounds great. But what does it mean for the people who work for those companies? VEDANTAM: Well, there's the rub, Steve. So if you're working at one of these companies and it turns into one of these unicorns that's suddenly worth a billion dollars, great for you. But if you're one of these companies that suddenly goes under, you know, not so great for you. Now, I think this is especially true for people with certain levels of education. There are many people working in the economy now who are on LinkedIn. And even as they are working at job A, they're already thinking ahead to what job B might be. But there's also lots of people who've done the kinds of work their parents have done. You know, that's the work that they've been born into. That's the work they've been raised in doing. That job disappears - much harder for those people now to pivot to job B. INSKEEP: And the reality is the company just may not be there in a few years. VEDANTAM: Exactly.

The presidential campaign has certainly laid bare those concerns. NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam is here with some insights from history. Hi, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: You know, this notion of a nation of immigrants, I hear this when I talk with voters who are on one side, who will say, we're a nation of immigrants; why are you so concerned? And people on the other side will say, we're a nation of immigrants, but I'm still concerned. What's going on here? VEDANTAM: You know, there are people who say the United States is a country that opens its arms to immigrants, and there are people who say the United States is a country that's extremely wary of immigrants. I was talking with a historian, Maria Cristina Garcia at Cornell, and I asked her which version of America is true, and she said both. She told me that, right from the start of the republic, you know, in the 1750s, one of our founding fathers, Ben Franklin, was worried about German immigrants. He said they were stupid, and he was also afraid that they wouldn't learn English, they wouldn't assimilate into the country. At the same time, Franklin was also the person who started one of the first German-language newspapers. And so you have these twin forces contained in the same person. INSKEEP: He was marketing to the German people, whom he considered stupid. VEDANTAM: Well, he was also helping them, and I think this is the twin impulses that you often see. And really with the exception of Native Americans and slaves, Steve, every other group who showed up here has knocked on the door. Garcia told me that many of these groups have faced discrimination when they first arrive, but they very quickly turn around and voice suspicion of the next group of immigrants. Irish Catholics, for example, faced a lot of prejudice when they first arrived. But a few years later, the same Irish were worried now about Chinese immigrants. Here's Garcia. MARIA CRISTINA GARCIA: Some of the most vitriolic voices of the anti-Chinese movement were Irish immigrants and their children, who themselves had been much maligned. German Jews who had arrived in the early 19th century were also highly suspicious and worried about the Eastern European Jews who migrated at the end of the 19th century. INSKEEP: Why would people who just got here or their parents just got here be concerned about immigrants, even immigrants who apparently were somewhat like themselves? VEDANTAM: You know, it's a real paradox, Steve. Garcia told me that she sees this even in her own community. Her family came to America as refugees fleeing communist Cuba. A couple of decades later, after this wave of Cubans had settled in and become successful, there was another wave of immigration from Cuba. And Garcia told me she heard many older Cubans worrying about whether the new Cubans would fit in. So I asked her, why do you think this is happening? And she actually came up with a really interesting psychological explanation. GARCIA: I guess you could say that part of Americanization is to adopt the values and the perspectives of the society that surrounds you. It also becomes a defense mechanism and becomes a way of proving your membership in the society to demonstrate that you're a member of the in-group and not the outgroup. INSKEEP: This is a really interesting theory, Shankar, but I'm sure there are some people listening who are concerned about illegal immigration or concerned about refugees who will say, I'm not trying to prove my membership in society. I'm worried about crime. I'm worried about drugs or a changing culture or terrorism - whatever they're worried about. VEDANTAM: I think that's a fair point, Steve. I think the point that Maria Cristina Garcia would make is that those concerns about crime and national security and immigration have really been with us from the start of the republic. You know, in the 20th century, for example, we turned away many refugees fleeing Nazi Germany because we were afraid that spies and saboteurs would sneak in with them. We're having very similar conversations today about whether ISIS might sneak in terrorists with refugees from Syria. History can't really tell us what we should do, but it could tell us we've been here before. INSKEEP: Shankar thanks very much. VEDANTAM: Thank you, Steve. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Shankar Vedantam, who regularly joins us to talk about social science research. And you can also find him on his podcast, Hidden Brain. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   Here's a question - why is this nation of immigrants so concerned about immigration? The presidential campaign has certainly laid bare those concerns. NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam is here with some insights from history. Hi, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: You know, this notion of a nation of immigrants, I hear this when I talk with voters who are on one side, who will say, we're a nation of immigrants; why are you so concerned? And people on the other side will say, we're a nation of immigrants, but I'm still concerned. What's going on here? VEDANTAM: You know, there are people who say the United States is a country that opens its arms to immigrants, and there are people who say the United States is a country that's extremely wary of immigrants. I was talking with a historian, Maria Cristina Garcia at Cornell, and I asked her which version of America is true, and she said both. She told me that, right from the start of the republic, you know, in the 1750s, one of our founding fathers, Ben Franklin, was worried about German immigrants. He said they were stupid, and he was also afraid that they wouldn't learn English, they wouldn't assimilate into the country. At the same time, Franklin was also the person who started one of the first German-language newspapers. And so you have these twin forces contained in the same person. INSKEEP: He was marketing to the German people, whom he considered stupid. VEDANTAM: Well, he was also helping them, and I think this is the twin impulses that you often see.

Fewer than 1 in 5 legislators are women. At Fortune 500 companies, fewer than 1 in 20 CEOs are women. And look at all the presidents of the United States through Barack Obama. Now, I know there was a long time when women couldn't be president. But if men and women had an equal shot at the White House, the odds of having 44 presidents in a row all be men - about 1 in 18 trillion. What explains the dearth of women in top leadership positions? Is it bias, a lack of role models, the old boys club? Sure, but it goes deeper than that. Women are trapped in a catch-22 paradox so deeply embedded in our culture, that there are few means of escape. CAROL MOSELEY BRAUN: And so it is really that very, very fine line between being a shrew on the one hand and a puppet on the other, that any woman in public life has to walk. VEDANTAM: The puppet, the shrew and the double bind facing women who want to lead, this week on HIDDEN BRAIN. This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. A few years ago, one of our listeners decided to switch careers. DEBRA MEHTA: So my name is Debra Mehta (ph), and I am a second-year marketing student in an MBA program. VEDANTAM: Debra had been a successful teacher, but the business world appealed to her. She thought she would be a good fit. So did the program to which she applied. She was awarded a full scholarship. Soon she was sharing the good news with an old friend. MEHTA: We met for coffee one day and she is very nice. I'm still really good friends with her. But she said to me, I really can't see you in business. I think you're, you know, too sweet for the business world. VEDANTAM: It was the beginning of a series of comments that undermined her belief that she could be a leader or a manager. Later that year, Debra's voice was the problem. Specifically, her habit of ending sentences on a higher pitch. MEHTA: A professor during a class mentioned that I do that, that I raise my, you know, pitch at the end of a sentence. VEDANTAM: The implication was that Debra sounded like a lightweight, not manager material. Debra says she wasn't prepared for the offhand remarks. MEHTA: I mean, it really was leading me to lose confidence. The criticism of my voice and then, you know, everyone - not everyone - but several people telling me I - you know, I'm too sweet for business. I think it really affected me. VEDANTAM: This is one side of the catch-22. Women like Debra are seen as not tough enough to be leaders. Another listener, Tuli Winston (ph), made a different set of choices. As a manager at a construction company, a female leader in a man's world, she decided to be strategic. From the way she dresses. . . TULI WINSTON: I've definitely chosen to go a more masculine path, wearing Oxford shoes and button-downs, straight pulled back hair and pants. VEDANTAM: . . . To the way she greets clients. WINSTON: You just, you know, just go in there and grab that hand and squeeze it because you have muscles too. I think that tends to help them go, oh, wow, this is not just a lady (laughter). VEDANTAM: Tuli doesn't want to appear soft or overly feminine because she knows that would be seen as weakness. But appearing tough turns out to create its own set of problems. WINSTON: It's definitely a double-edged sword because if I'm outspoken, all of a sudden the men in the office will joke about, oh, whoa, whoa, watch out for Tuli. Watch out, she's dangerous, that one. VEDANTAM: Dangerous. Not driven, not strong - dangerous. We tell you their stories because together, Tuli and Debra's experiences reveal a powerful phenomenon that plays out when women strive to become leaders. The problem doesn't end with getting to the corner office. Women confront the same issues when it comes to exercising power. It's a double bind. Social psychologist Alice Eagly says the double bind comes about because of a series of unconscious interlocking stereotypes we have about men, women and the nature of leadership. ALICE EAGLY: The female gender role, you know, is based on the stereotype that women are nice and kind and compassionate. But it's also expected, so people expect women to be kind of nice and friendly and smile. VEDANTAM: Now, says Alice, consider our cultural stereotype about leaders. EAGLY: In a leadership role, one is expected to take charge and sometimes, at least, to demonstrate toughness, make tough decisions, be very assertive in bringing an organization forward, sometimes fire people for cause, et cetera. VEDANTAM: So what's a woman to do, be nice and kind and friendly, as our gender stereotypes about women require? Or be tough and decisive, as our stereotypes about leadership demand? To be one is to be seen as nice, but weak. To be the other is to be seen as competent, but unlikable. The double bind exists for women like Tuli and Debra in the business world. But it also exists in public life, even for women with enormous power and experience. We talked to two women elected to high office. One is a Democrat, the other is a Republican. Their stories have many similarities. By the way, you may notice we refer to our guests by their first names. There are gender biases in the way the media use names. Journalists regularly refer to women by their first names and men by their last names. On this podcast, in the interest of being conversational, we use first names for all guests. When Carol Moseley Braun was elected to the U. S. Senate, she achieved a powerful first. She was the first female African-American senator. In fact, she was the first African-American senator, period. Carol says growing up, her parents shielded her from finding out how bias might limit her choices. MOSELEY BRAUN: My parents had never given me a notion that I was limited any way by my race or my gender. And that, you know, I could just do whatever it was that I thought I wanted to do and could do. VEDANTAM: But when she got into politics, Carol realized that race and gender did matter. Of the two, she thought that racism would be the big barrier. MOSELEY BRAUN: And I have to tell you that I think in some regards, the gender biases are more profound and more central to our culture than even the racial ones. And that for me was the surprise. I was expecting some pushback based on race and/or gender. What I wasn't expecting was that the gender pushback would be as pronounced as it was, even more so than the racial ones. VEDANTAM: But shortly after Carol won her race, she says she confronted a second trap - the other side of the double bind. One time she made an impassioned plea on the floor of the Senate, but she felt her colleagues were just tuning her out. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MOSELEY BRAUN: . . . Children in this country and getting rid of that safety net is what this so-called welfare reform is all about. VEDANTAM: All they could hear was a shrill black woman. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MOSELEY BRAUN: . . . Just because it hasn't worked. And I submit to you, Mr. President, that it. . . I came home that night. I was so upset and demeaned - to use the word - that I thought, OK, that's it. I can't take this anymore. I'm going to quit. VEDANTAM: She didn't quit. But Carol still vividly recalls how unfair it felt. And it wasn't just over how she was being treated. She saw her experience in the long light of history. MOSELEY BRAUN: In the 15th century, women who talked back, they would put weights on their tongue and make them walk around the square. (Laughter) That's - that was a shrew's punishment, the idea being that you're not supposed to have opinions about things outside of the home. And so that's a real danger for any woman in public life. So every stranger gets to comment on how they - what they think about you and what they think about what you just said. And if you said too much, that becomes a danger. If you said too little, that's a danger also. And so it is really that very, very fine line between being a shrew on the one hand and a puppet on the other that any woman in public life has to walk. VEDANTAM: After serving one term in the Senate, Carol lost reelection in 1998. CONNIE MORELLA: There is this sense that a woman has to be gracious and civil and smart and smile. VEDANTAM: This is Connie Morella. Connie served for 16 years as a Republican congresswoman from Maryland. MORELLA: But she's got to be strong also, and indicate that she's going to persevere. VEDANTAM: Like Democrat Carol Moseley Braun, Connie says at times she struggled to be heard. MOSELEY BRAUN: In a committee room when I wasn't chair of the committee, I would respond to a question or a comment on an issue. And they would say, well, thank you Connie, that's great. And then a little later, Representative Smith said the very same thing I did and it was, oh, Congressman Smith, that was fabulous. Let the record show that you have accomplished that whatever. And I think, gee, I just said that (laughter). VEDANTAM: Connie Morella, Carol Moseley Braun, Tuli Winston, Debra Mehta - all these women feel they've experienced bias. But here's the thing. How do we know scientifically that they're right? Carol Moseley Braun's Senate colleagues may have felt that perception of her was accurate. The newspaper cartoonist may have felt she really was easily manipulated. In fact, Carol herself in her interview with us listed numerous missteps she'd made as a campaigner and as a senator. How can we tell with scientific certainty whether Carol was the victim of bias? When we look at a woman leader who appears incompetent or shrill, how do we know if we are seeing reality or just seeing the world through the lens of our own unconscious biases? This is where laboratory experiments are essential. They allow us to see precisely what's happening. MADELINE HEILMAN: We keep everything identical. We expose people to the various what we call experimental conditions. And at the end of the day, if we find a difference we can say that it has to be due to that thing that we were studying. And that's the nature of a controlled experiment. VEDANTAM: Stay with us. When we judge a person's character, we usually think our opinions are based on fact. What we forget is that the world that enters our brain has been filtered. Figuring out what those filters are and how they distort our vision has long intrigued Madeline Heilman. She's a psychology professor at New York University who focuses on gender stereotypes and bias, particularly when it comes to leadership. HEILMAN: What we have found consistently is that when we present women and men with exactly the same credentials, qualifications and backgrounds for a job that is traditionally male - held by men in our culture, thought to require male attributes - we consistently find that the woman is seen as more incompetent than the man. VEDANTAM: The problem doesn't end there. HEILMAN: Sometimes women really do show their competence and it's unavoidable and we can't we can't deny it. And what happens then? Well, the research that I've done has shown that when women are truly successful in areas where they're not expected to be, there's a very negative reaction. There's disapproval and they are penalized. They're disliked, but they're also seen as really - almost really awful depictions of what kinds of people they are. Words like bitter and quarrelsome and selfish and deceitful and devious and manipulative and cold. These are words that are attributed to these women who are successful where they are not supposed to be, and I should put that in quotes. We have terms for these people, you know, ice queen and dragon lady and iron maiden and so on and so forth. VEDANTAM: I want to emphasize these aren't Madeline's opinions. They are the findings of her experiments. In one study, Madeline asked volunteers to evaluate a high-powered manager joining a company. Sometimes volunteers are told a manager is a man. Other times they're told it's a woman. HEILMAN: When the person was presented as a very-high power person who was very ambitious, we found that the person was seen as much more unlikable when it was a woman than when it was a man. VEDANTAM: To be clear, the high-powered male and female manager are described in identical terms down to the letter. The only thing different is that one is said to be a man and the other is said to be a woman. Madeline has also looked at what happens when someone joins a company, but is not set to be in a position of power. HEILMAN: If we didn't give information about how successful the person was, just had them applying for a job, we find that they're very - the women are as likeable as the man but they're seen as less competent. And that is the rock and the hard place, the double bind, that if it's not clear that you're successful and you have the same information about a woman and a man, the woman is seen as less competent. If you have very clear indication that there is success, then the woman is rated as unlikable. They see her as competent, but unlikable. VEDANTAM: Madeline says the double bind arises because our minds are trying to align our stereotypes about men and women with our stereotypes about leadership. HEILMAN: We have conceptions of these jobs and these positions and what is required to do them well. And there's a lack of fit between how we see women and what these positions require. VEDANTAM: The biases Madeline describes aren't just held by men. They're held by both sexes, which explains why many female leaders encounter derision and suspicion from both men and women. HEILMAN: I think that this comes from the social roles that people have played over time. Women stayed home and they took care. Men went out and they took, you know, they took charge of things. That is the kind of origin I think of the stereotypes that we hold. We have very strong feelings about how men and women are. And that leads to the idea that women are less competent than men in a lot of these fields that we're talking about. And we have real strong ideas about how they should be. And that leads to this dislike when they go over the line, when they tread where they're not supposed to be. VEDANTAM: There are other aspects to the double bind. Female leaders can get in trouble for displaying emotion, but also for not displaying emotion. Lisa Feldman Barrett is a psychology professor at Northeastern University and author of the forthcoming book \"How Emotions Are Made. \"LISA FELDMAN BARRETT: There's an implication that if a woman expresses emotion that she's either unsuitable for leadership or unstable in some way. Or if she doesn't express enough emotion, she's also seen rather than being seen as rational and kind of level-headed, she's seen as, you know, not empathic, not warm and generally not trustworthy. VEDANTAM: In one experiment, Lisa showed volunteers pictures of faces and asked her why the subject was expressing an emotion. She found that the volunteers thought men's emotions were shaped by what was going on around them, but that women's emotions were shaped by their nature. FELDMAN BARRETT: Both men and women when they were looking at female faces expressing emotion believed that this was caused by a woman's emotional nature. She's just a neurotic person. She's just unstable. She's just untrustworthy. As opposed to when they were looking at male faces expressing emotion, they were more likely to say, oh, he's just having a bad day. Something bad happened to him. VEDANTAM: Lots of people have suggested ways out of the double bind. Some say women should ignore criticisms about incompetence and plunge full steam ahead. If they then appear unlikable, they should also go out of their way to demonstrate kindness in order to keep people from seeing them as competent but cold. There is something disturbing about these ideas. They ask women, who are the victims here, to compensate for the biases of others. Many experts also think that as society changes, our stereotypes will change as well. If more women make it through the labyrinth and get to the top, fewer people will have trouble seeing women as leaders. Many countries and organizations are coming to think of leadership as being collaborative, rather than dictatorial. The less we think of leaders as alpha males, the easier it's going to be for our unconscious minds to see women as leaders. If there's one common thread here, it's that ending the double bind can't be just on the women reaching for high office or the corner office. It has to be on all of us. This week's episode of HIDDEN BRAIN was produced by Jenny Schmidt and edited by Tara Boyle. Our staff also includes Maggie Penmen and Renee Klahr. If you liked this episode, I'm going to ask that you tell two friends - one man and one woman - about the show. Our unsung hero this week is Anya Grundmann. She's the person who oversees NPR's podcasts. She's always had our back and there's a reason her calendar is always maxed out. Anya is the very definition of that collaborative leader we were just talking about. She makes everyone around her better. Today we're also honoring the work of another remarkable colleague, producer Chris Benderev, who's been with us at HIDDEN BRAIN for a few months. He's about to return to his role on NPR's Embedded podcast. Chris is great at everything he does, which would be a little obnoxious if he weren't also one of the nicest people we know. Thank you, Chris, for all the great work you've done on this show. You can find more HIDDEN BRAIN on Facebook and Twitter and listen for my stories on your local public radio station.

(Laughter) That's - that was a shrew's punishment, the idea being that you're not supposed to have opinions about things outside of the home. And so that's a real danger for any woman in public life. So every stranger gets to comment on how they - what they think about you and what they think about what you just said. And if you said too much, that becomes a danger. If you said too little, that's a danger also. And so it is really that very, very fine line between being a shrew on the one hand and a puppet on the other that any woman in public life has to walk. VEDANTAM: After serving one term in the Senate, Carol lost reelection in 1998. CONNIE MORELLA: There is this sense that a woman has to be gracious and civil and smart and smile. VEDANTAM: This is Connie Morella. Connie served for 16 years as a Republican congresswoman from Maryland. MORELLA: But she's got to be strong also, and indicate that she's going to persevere. VEDANTAM: Like Democrat Carol Moseley Braun, Connie says at times she struggled to be heard. MOSELEY BRAUN: In a committee room when I wasn't chair of the committee, I would respond to a question or a comment on an issue. And they would say, well, thank you Connie, that's great. And then a little later, Representative Smith said the very same thing I did and it was, oh, Congressman Smith, that was fabulous. Let the record show that you have accomplished that whatever. And I think, gee, I just said that (laughter). VEDANTAM: Connie Morella, Carol Moseley Braun, Tuli Winston, Debra Mehta - all these women feel they've experienced bias. But here's the thing. How do we know scientifically that they're right? Carol Moseley Braun's Senate colleagues may have felt that perception of her was accurate. The newspaper cartoonist may have felt she really was easily manipulated. In fact, Carol herself in her interview with us listed numerous missteps she'd made as a campaigner and as a senator. How can we tell with scientific certainty whether Carol was the victim of bias? When we look at a woman leader who appears incompetent or shrill, how do we know if we are seeing reality or just seeing the world through the lens of our own unconscious biases? This is where laboratory experiments are essential. They allow us to see precisely what's happening. MADELINE HEILMAN: We keep everything identical. We expose people to the various what we call experimental conditions. And at the end of the day, if we find a difference we can say that it has to be due to that thing that we were studying. And that's the nature of a controlled experiment. VEDANTAM: Stay with us. When we judge a person's character, we usually think our opinions are based on fact. What we forget is that the world that enters our brain has been filtered. Figuring out what those filters are and how they distort our vision has long intrigued Madeline Heilman. She's a psychology professor at New York University who focuses on gender stereotypes and bias, particularly when it comes to leadership. HEILMAN: What we have found consistently is that when we present women and men with exactly the same credentials, qualifications and backgrounds for a job that is traditionally male - held by men in our culture, thought to require male attributes - we consistently find that the woman is seen as more incompetent than the man. VEDANTAM: The problem doesn't end there. HEILMAN: Sometimes women really do show their competence and it's unavoidable and we can't we can't deny it. And what happens then? Well, the research that I've done has shown that when women are truly successful in areas where they're not expected to be, there's a very negative reaction. There's disapproval and they are penalized. They're disliked, but they're also seen as really - almost really awful depictions of what kinds of people they are. Words like bitter and quarrelsome and selfish and deceitful and devious and manipulative and cold. These are words that are attributed to these women who are successful where they are not supposed to be, and I should put that in quotes. We have terms for these people, you know, ice queen and dragon lady and iron maiden and so on and so forth. VEDANTAM: I want to emphasize these aren't Madeline's opinions. They are the findings of her experiments. In one study, Madeline asked volunteers to evaluate a high-powered manager joining a company. Sometimes volunteers are told a manager is a man. Other times they're told it's a woman. HEILMAN: When the person was presented as a very-high power person who was very ambitious, we found that the person was seen as much more unlikable when it was a woman than when it was a man. VEDANTAM: To be clear, the high-powered male and female manager are described in identical terms down to the letter. The only thing different is that one is said to be a man and the other is said to be a woman. Madeline has also looked at what happens when someone joins a company, but is not set to be in a position of power. HEILMAN: If we didn't give information about how successful the person was, just had them applying for a job, we find that they're very - the women are as likeable as the man but they're seen as less competent. And that is the rock and the hard place, the double bind, that if it's not clear that you're successful and you have the same information about a woman and a man, the woman is seen as less competent. If you have very clear indication that there is success, then the woman is rated as unlikable. They see her as competent, but unlikable. VEDANTAM: Madeline says the double bind arises because our minds are trying to align our stereotypes about men and women with our stereotypes about leadership. HEILMAN: We have conceptions of these jobs and these positions and what is required to do them well. And there's a lack of fit between how we see women and what these positions require. VEDANTAM: The biases Madeline describes aren't just held by men. They're held by both sexes, which explains why many female leaders encounter derision and suspicion from both men and women. HEILMAN: I think that this comes from the social roles that people have played over time. Women stayed home and they took care. Men went out and they took, you know, they took charge of things. That is the kind of origin I think of the stereotypes that we hold. We have very strong feelings about how men and women are. And that leads to the idea that women are less competent than men in a lot of these fields that we're talking about. And we have real strong ideas about how they should be. And that leads to this dislike when they go over the line, when they tread where they're not supposed to be. VEDANTAM: There are other aspects to the double bind. Female leaders can get in trouble for displaying emotion, but also for not displaying emotion. Lisa Feldman Barrett is a psychology professor at Northeastern University and author of the forthcoming book \"How Emotions Are Made. \" LISA FELDMAN BARRETT: There's an implication that if a woman expresses emotion that she's either unsuitable for leadership or unstable in some way. Or if she doesn't express enough emotion, she's also seen rather than being seen as rational and kind of level-headed, she's seen as, you know, not empathic, not warm and generally not trustworthy. VEDANTAM: In one experiment, Lisa showed volunteers pictures of faces and asked her why the subject was expressing an emotion. She found that the volunteers thought men's emotions were shaped by what was going on around them, but that women's emotions were shaped by their nature. FELDMAN BARRETT: Both men and women when they were looking at female faces expressing emotion believed that this was caused by a woman's emotional nature. She's just a neurotic person. She's just unstable. She's just untrustworthy. As opposed to when they were looking at male faces expressing emotion, they were more likely to say, oh, he's just having a bad day. Something bad happened to him. VEDANTAM: Lots of people have suggested ways out of the double bind. Some say women should ignore criticisms about incompetence and plunge full steam ahead. If they then appear unlikable, they should also go out of their way to demonstrate kindness in order to keep people from seeing them as competent but cold. There is something disturbing about these ideas. They ask women, who are the victims here, to compensate for the biases of others. Many experts also think that as society changes, our stereotypes will change as well. If more women make it through the labyrinth and get to the top, fewer people will have trouble seeing women as leaders. Many countries and organizations are coming to think of leadership as being collaborative, rather than dictatorial. The less we think of leaders as alpha males, the easier it's going to be for our unconscious minds to see women as leaders. If there's one common thread here, it's that ending the double bind can't be just on the women reaching for high office or the corner office. It has to be on all of us. This week's episode of HIDDEN BRAIN was produced by Jenny Schmidt and edited by Tara Boyle. Our staff also includes Maggie Penmen and Renee Klahr. If you liked this episode, I'm going to ask that you tell two friends - one man and one woman - about the show. Our unsung hero this week is Anya Grundmann. She's the person who oversees NPR's podcasts. She's always had our back and there's a reason her calendar is always maxed out. Anya is the very definition of that collaborative leader we were just talking about. She makes everyone around her better. Today we're also honoring the work of another remarkable colleague, producer Chris Benderev, who's been with us at HIDDEN BRAIN for a few months. He's about to return to his role on NPR's Embedded podcast. Chris is great at everything he does, which would be a little obnoxious if he weren't also one of the nicest people we know. Thank you, Chris, for all the great work you've done on this show. You can find more HIDDEN BRAIN on Facebook and Twitter and listen for my stories on your local public radio station.

She says, when I got here, I kneeled down. I grabbed a handful of soil, put it in my mouth. And then she says, I will never leave here again.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE BABUSHKAS OF CHERNOBYL\")UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: (Foreign language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: (Foreign language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: (Foreign language spoken). RAZ: These women are surrounded by toxins, but they're surviving, even thriving, says Holly Morris. Here's her TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HOLLY MORRIS: Now, around Chernobyl, there are abandoned villages - bucolic, charming. Many were buried under the time of the accident. All are totally contaminated. Others have one or two babushkas or babas - that's the Russian and Ukrainian words for grandmother - who live in them. Other villages might have six or seven women in them. So this is the strange demographic of the Zone, isolated, alone together. And when I made my way to a village - it was called Kupuvate - I met Hanna Zavorotyna, the self-declared mayor of Kupuvate village, population 8. And she told me when I asked her the obvious question, radiation doesn't scare me; starvation does. Now, you have to remember. These are people who have survived the worst atrocities of the 20th century - Stalin's enforced famines of the 1930s which killed millions of Ukrainians. In the '40s, the Nazis came through, raping, killing, and in fact many of these women were shipped to Germany as forced labor. So when a couple decades into Soviet rule Chernobyl happened, they were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy that was invisible. So they returned to their villages and are told they're are going to get sick and die soon. But five happy years, the thinking goes, is better than 10 stuck in a high-rise on the outskirts of Kiev, you know, separated from their gardens, the graves of their mothers and fathers, their children. For them, environmental contamination may not be the worst sort of devastation, and this holds true for other species as well. Wolves, wild boar, lynx - they've all returned to the Zone in force. The dead zone, it turns out, is full of life. RAZ: So that's interesting that things are still, you know, growing and thriving in the dead zone. But I have to assume it's pretty - still really dangerous, right? I mean when you were filming there, weren't you, like, worried about your own safety? MORRIS: Yeah (laughter). Well, you know, we filmed in teams, and the sum total of our time inside the Zone was about 18 days. And you know, the people disagree and scientists and everybody else about how much time inside the Zone today is OK or how dangerous it is or it isn't. And you can go to the Zone for a day even as a tourist. You're quite limited in where you can go and what you can do, but it is possible to go there. But the bottom line, the one thing everyone agrees on is less time is better, and more is worse. And of course you try to avoid highly contaminated areas of around the reactor and the Red Forest and certain areas. RAZ: So when you're there, do just walk around with a radiation detector all the time to know, you know, where the danger is? MORRIS: Yeah, well, you do have a dosimeter, a Geiger counter with you at all times so you don't - in case you stumble across something. And you know, that clicking can drive you crazy (laughter) because it is the constant reminder that you are in a radioactive zone, which is easily forgettable when the villain is invisible. You can't see it. You can't smell it. You can't hear it. So it's that clicking dosimeter that keeps you on your toes. And the women of the Zone are, you know - of course they've chosen to live there, so you know, if you show up - and of course like so many women of that part of the world, the first thing you got to do is eat. And the first rule of visiting the Zone is, do not eat the local food. So it is a delicate matters, especially when you're trying to make a film, to say no to the food or the drink. RAZ: Yeah. Would you pop in and the sleep somewhere else for the night? MORRIS: Yeah, yeah. So we stayed in Kiev and then essentially commuted to the Zone every day - couple of hours to the Zone border. You're in at 9. You have to be out by 5. There's a curfew. You can only enter the Zone for so many consecutive days - a lot of bureaucracy around the. . . RAZ: Yeah, I can imagine. MORRIS: . . . Exclusion Zone. RAZ: But you just, like, wear regular clothes, right? MORRIS: Did wear regular clothes, although I have to say I threw them out after each and every visit (laughter) because you know, there are higher levels of background radiation inside the Zone. But there is dust. So you know, dusty days, for example, are not good. Usually the beautiful, lovely, breezy days are the most dangerous. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MORRIS: And here is the really surprising truth. There's evidence that the women who have returned to their homes and lived for the last 30 years off some of the most toxic land on Earth have actually outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation by some estimates up to 10 years. I mean how could this be? I mean here's a theory. Could it be that those ties to home actually affect longevity? The power of motherland so intransigent to that part of the world seems almost palliative. By avoiding relocation trauma, which is devastating to anybody but especially the elderly, they've actually stayed happier and thus healthier. It turns out home and community are forces that rival even radiation. And for the stalkers, you know, who are the first generation disconnected from the - those land - the ties to land and community, I think they sense that disconnect and are searching for something new. Now, radiation or not, the women of the Zone are at the end of their lives. But the spirit and existence of the babushkas whose numbers have been halved in the five years I've known them will leave us with powerful new ideas to think about and grapple with about the relative nature of risk, about transformative connections to home and about the magnificent tonic of personal agency and self-determination.

But I have to assume it's pretty - still really dangerous, right? I mean when you were filming there, weren't you, like, worried about your own safety? MORRIS: Yeah (laughter). Well, you know, we filmed in teams, and the sum total of our time inside the Zone was about 18 days. And you know, the people disagree and scientists and everybody else about how much time inside the Zone today is OK or how dangerous it is or it isn't. And you can go to the Zone for a day even as a tourist. You're quite limited in where you can go and what you can do, but it is possible to go there. But the bottom line, the one thing everyone agrees on is less time is better, and more is worse. And of course you try to avoid highly contaminated areas of around the reactor and the Red Forest and certain areas. RAZ: So when you're there, do just walk around with a radiation detector all the time to know, you know, where the danger is? MORRIS: Yeah, well, you do have a dosimeter, a Geiger counter with you at all times so you don't - in case you stumble across something. And you know, that clicking can drive you crazy (laughter) because it is the constant reminder that you are in a radioactive zone, which is easily forgettable when the villain is invisible. You can't see it. You can't smell it. You can't hear it. So it's that clicking dosimeter that keeps you on your toes. And the women of the Zone are, you know - of course they've chosen to live there, so you know, if you show up - and of course like so many women of that part of the world, the first thing you got to do is eat. And the first rule of visiting the Zone is, do not eat the local food. So it is a delicate matters, especially when you're trying to make a film, to say no to the food or the drink. RAZ: Yeah. Would you pop in and the sleep somewhere else for the night? MORRIS: Yeah, yeah. So we stayed in Kiev and then essentially commuted to the Zone every day - couple of hours to the Zone border. You're in at 9. You have to be out by 5. There's a curfew. You can only enter the Zone for so many consecutive days - a lot of bureaucracy around the. . . RAZ: Yeah, I can imagine. MORRIS: . . . Exclusion Zone. RAZ: But you just, like, wear regular clothes, right? MORRIS: Did wear regular clothes, although I have to say I threw them out after each and every visit (laughter) because you know, there are higher levels of background radiation inside the Zone. But there is dust. So you know, dusty days, for example, are not good. Usually the beautiful, lovely, breezy days are the most dangerous. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) MORRIS: And here is the really surprising truth. There's evidence that the women who have returned to their homes and lived for the last 30 years off some of the most toxic land on Earth have actually outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation by some estimates up to 10 years. I mean how could this be? I mean here's a theory. Could it be that those ties to home actually affect longevity? The power of motherland so intransigent to that part of the world seems almost palliative. By avoiding relocation trauma, which is devastating to anybody but especially the elderly, they've actually stayed happier and thus healthier. It turns out home and community are forces that rival even radiation. And for the stalkers, you know, who are the first generation disconnected from the - those land - the ties to land and community, I think they sense that disconnect and are searching for something new. Now, radiation or not, the women of the Zone are at the end of their lives. But the spirit and existence of the babushkas whose numbers have been halved in the five years I've known them will leave us with powerful new ideas to think about and grapple with about the relative nature of risk, about transformative connections to home and about the magnificent tonic of personal agency and self-determination. Thank you. (APPLAUSE, CHEERING) RAZ: That's Holly Morris. \"The Babushkas of Chernobyl\" is a pretty incredible film. You can hear more about it in Holly's full Ted Talk at ted. com.

But what about the toxins we all encounter every single day? TYRONE HAYES: I mean, we're exposed to chemicals all the time. RAZ: They're all around us? HAYES: Yeah. RAZ: By the way, this is Dr. Tyrone Hayes. HAYES: Oh, Tyrone's fine. RAZ: OK, great. HAYES: (Laughter) As, you know, I say, nobody has to call me doctor unless you're a cop pulling me over for no reason. RAZ: OK. (LAUGHTER)RAZ: Tyrone is a biologist at the University of California at Berkeley. HAYES: And my research focuses on endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the environment. RAZ: Endocrine-disrupting chemicals describes a whole group of chemicals that mimic the body's natural hormones like estrogen or testosterone. And it turns out, those chemicals are in all kinds of stuff we use every day - in food, food packaging, cleaning products, baby products, toys, even in water. HAYES: I mean, one of the most troubling things is most of the chemicals we use we know very, very little about. RAZ: But we knew even less about them 20 years ago. That was when Tyrone began studying one particular chemical called atrazine. And real quick, what is atrazine used for? HAYES: It's an herbicide. For example, it's mostly used on corn in this country. So you would spray atrazine all over the soil so that nothing grows up. And when you plant the corn, then there's nothing that - there's no weeds to compete with the corn. It's also used in forestry. It's also used on golf courses. And in some states, it can be used on your lawn. RAZ: So how are humans exposed to atrazine? HAYES: Atrazine exposure for humans is mostly through the drinking water. RAZ: Tyrone did some of the earliest studies on atrazine and whether it was the kind of chemical that could throw natural hormones out of whack. And the way he did this was by studying frogs. HAYES: Amphibians are of particular interest because they have to deal with the aquatic environment. They have to deal with the terrestrial environment. They through these amazing transitions where they're completely vulnerable to the environment. They can't regulate their temperature. You know, when they're developing as embryos, they have no placenta, no eggshells to protect them from the environment. RAZ: So Tyrone took a bunch of frogs and exposed them to atrazine. And eventually, he came up with some pretty surprising results, which he described on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HAYES: We were a bit surprised when we found out that when we exposed frogs to very low levels of atrazine - 0. 1 parts per billion - that it produced animals that look like this. These are the dissected gonads of an animal that has two testis, two ovaries, another large testis, more ovaries, which is not normal. . . (LAUGHTER)HAYES: . . . Even for amphibians. And some cases in other species like the North American leopard frog, we show that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testis. And you can see these large yoked up eggs bursting through the surface of this male's testis. We show that some of these animals when they're exposed to atrazine, some of the males grow up and completely become females. So these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship. And not only do these genetic males mate with other males, they actually have the capacity to lay eggs even though they're genetic males. What we proposed and what we've now generated support for is that what atrazine is doing is wreaking havoc, causing a hormone imbalance. Normal testis should make testosterone, the male hormone. But what atrazine does is it turns on an enzyme - the machinery if you will - aromatase, that converts testosterone into estrogen. And as a result, these exposed males lose their testosterone - they're chemically castrated - and they're subsequently feminized because now they're making the female hormone. RAZ: That's unbelievable. And were you just, like, bathing these frogs in atrazine, I mean, just exposing them to crazy levels of it? HAYES: Oh, no, it's not crazy levels. We were exposing the levels that you can find in rainwater. So it's a ubiquitous. . . RAZ: (Laughter) Wow. HAYES: . . . Contaminant. It's the most common contaminant of drinking water and most common contaminant of groundwater. RAZ: So I'm assuming after this study that you did came out, it was banned in the U. S. ? HAYES: (Laughter) No, it wasn't banned in the U. S. RAZ: This is not banned in the U. S? (Laughter). HAYES: No. The U. S. EPA was - only now has the EPA come out with a report saying that atrazine is a threat to wildlife. And they have another report coming out where they review its effects on humans. And in California under Prop 65, atrazine has just been labeled a reproductive toxin. So the European Union denied regulatory approval for atrazine all the way back in 2002. RAZ: So, yeah, as a result of Tyrone's research, the EU banned atrazine. In the U. S. , a lot of scientists are still split on whether atrazine is safe, whether it's as dangerous as Tyrone claims. And full disclosure - some of his studies have been hard to replicate. But if he's right, what can it mean for humans? Tyrone Hayes returns in just a minute. Today on the show - Toxic. I'm Guy Raz and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. RAZ: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today - Toxic. And we were just hearing from UC Berkeley biologist Tyrone Hayes about his research on the herbicide atrazine. And he found that male frogs when exposed to atrazine - they grew ovaries and started to produce eggs. . . HAYES: Which was very strange and abnormal. RAZ: Now the obvious question is, what does this mean for humans, right? Well, frogs are different than humans in many ways. First of all, they're especially vulnerable before they're born because they hatch from eggs - and soft ones without any real shell. And humans, like most mammals in utero, are nourished and protected by the placenta, which helps remove waste and toxins from the fetus. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HAYES: But it turns out that this ancient structure that separates us from other animals - the placenta - cannot evolve or adapt fast enough because of the rate that we're generating new chemicals that it's never seen before. RAZ: Here's Tyrone again on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HAYES: The evidence of that is that studies in rats - again, with atrazine - show that the hormone imbalance that atrazine generates causes abortion. Because maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones. Of those that don't abort, atrazine causes impaired memory or breast development in the exposed daughters in utero, so that their breasts don't develop properly. And as a result when those rats grow up, their pups experience retarded growth and development because they can't make enough milk to nourish their pups. Given the life of many of these chemicals - years, dozens of years - that means that we right now are affecting the health of our grandchildren's grandchildren by things that we're putting into the environment today. And this is not just philosophical. It's already known that chemicals like diethylstilbestrol and estrogen, PCBs, DDT cross the placenta and effectively determine the likelihood of developing breast cancer and obesity and diabetes already when the baby's in the womb. In addition to that, after the baby's born, our other unique invention as mammals is that we nourish our offspring after they're born. We already know that chemicals like DDT and DES and atrazine can also pass over into milk, again affecting our babies even after they're born. RAZ: So how do these chemicals get into milk in the first place? Well, they're everywhere - flame retardants in furniture, dioxin in meat products, BPA in food packaging. And, yeah, those chemicals do affect animals. But it's still hard to say what effect they can have on us. HAYES: You can't do a controlled experiment in humans. You can only say, well, you're exposed to this and you have, you know, this symptom or this condition that's associated with that chemical. RAZ: In Kentucky, for example, women who used well water that contained atrazine were more likely to develop breast cancer. Now, that doesn't mean atrazine causes the cancer, but it does mean it can be linked. HAYES: So what we see in rats, for example, is that atrazine increases estrogen. It decreases testosterone and increases estrogen. And so if you get breast cancer - which is estrogen-dependent - estrogen drives the cancer so to speak - atrazine itself may not be causing the cancer. But by causing this hormone imbalance, it creates a physiological environment that's conducive to breast cancer, that promotes breast cancer. RAZ: So, again, this is controversial. And it's hard to nail down the exact toxicity of chemicals like atrazine. But a growing number of scientists, including Tyrone Hayes, say that obesity, diabetes, breast cancer, prostate cancer and even some birth defects can be linked to exposure to these kinds of chemicals. HAYES: And atrazine is associated with at least three birth defects in humans. Gastroschisis, where the intestine's on the outside of the body. Choanal atresia, where there's a hole in the baby's face. And malformed male genitals. So when you're exposed to a chemical that decreases testosterone and increases estrogen, in every animal that has been studied you get a baby that looks like it has too little testosterone and too much estrogen. RAZ: I feel like I need to move into a bubble and just, you know, just, like, that's it. Like, how do we deal with this? What can we do about it? How do we protect ourselves? HAYES: I think being informed. I think making informed decisions about things that you purchase. I think being politically involved. And we can make choices. And as the phrase I've heard is vote with our dollars and, you know, decide that I'm going to buy this product but not this product. In terms of who we elect, in terms of what the environmental policy of our local government representatives are. And I think we need to refocus our efforts. RAZ: Tyrone Hayes is a biologist at UC Berkeley. You can see his entire talk which he did with filmmaker Penelope Jagessar Chaffer at ted. com.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today - Toxic, ideas about human resilience in a world full of toxins and chemicals. So what if the way we think about toxins is oversimplified? RISHI MANCHANDA: We often only look at a substance that is toxic because it's easy for us to mobilize a campaign against a villain. But what happens when we can't use a reductionist or singular approach? When we have to actually think about complexity, when we have to think about community and not just single cause. RAZ: This is Dr. Rishi Manchanda. And he says, yeah, chemicals can be toxic. But so can a lot of other things right in our own homes. MANCHANDA: There's no doubt that, as many public health researchers have been saying for years, that zip code matters more than genetic code when it comes to health outcomes. Where we live, where we eat, where we sleep have more than five times the impact on our health outcomes than all the, you know, pills and procedures the doctors prescribe. RAZ: Which means if you can't afford to live somewhere with access to healthy food or green spaces or good living conditions, it has an impact on your health. MANCHANDA: Poor communities have less say in determining how healthy their community can be or less power to actually make that happen. It's a vicious cycle. RAZ: Rishi's seen this firsthand. He used to work at a clinic in South Central Los Angeles, which served mostly lower income and minority patients. MANCHANDA: It was so clear that the issues that impacted my patients were informed by the toxins in their environment. RAZ: Rishi would see a lot of kids come into that clinic with things like lead poisoning because of old paint in their homes, people with breathing problems because of mold. And in cases like that, the approach can be surprisingly simple. Rishi told the story of one patient on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MANCHANDA: Veronica (ph) was the 17th patient out of my 26-patient-day at that clinic in South Central Los Angeles. She came into our clinic with a chronic headache. This headache had been going on for a number of years. And this particular episode was very, very troubling. In fact, three weeks before she came to visit us for the first time, she went to an emergency room in Los Angeles. The emergency room doctors said let me run some tests, Veronica. The results are normal, so here's some pain medication. And follow up with a primary care doctor. But if the pain persists or if it worsens, then come on back. In the three weeks before Veronica met us, she went to the emergency room three times. She went back and forth, in and out of hospitals and clinics just like she had done in years past, trying to seek relief but still coming up short. When she came to our clinic though, we tried a different approach. Our medical assistant asked them routine questions. She asked, what's your chief complaint? Headache. Let's get your vital signs, measure your blood pressure and your heart rate. But let's also ask about something equally as vital to Veronica and a lot of patients like her in South Los Angeles. Veronica, can you tell me about where you live, specifically about your housing conditions? Do you have mold? Do you have water leaks? Do you have roaches in your home? Turns out Veronicas said yes to three of those things - roaches, water leaks, mold. RAZ: Of course, not all doctors ask these questions. In fact, the template for Rishi's survey, it didn't come from a doctor at all. MANCHANDA: Actually came from the American Housing Survey. It's a survey to assess the health of our housing stock. But it asks questions that are pertinent for health issues, too. RAZ: Questions like. . . MANCHANDA: Do you have water leaks? RAZ: Are there cockroaches in your house? MANCHANDA: How old is your home? RAZ: Do you have mold? Does anyone smoke in the house? MANCHANDA: Do you have large sections of your home where paint is chipping or fraying? RAZ: Things that can make you sick. And so Rishi and his team took those questions and they included them in a patient's exam. So by the time Rishi met with Veronica, he already knew about how her environment might be affecting her health. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MANCHANDA: Here she was, doubled over in pain sitting on my exam table. Her head, clearly throbbing, was resting in her hands. She lifted her head up and I saw her face. I said hello. And then I immediately noticed something across the bridge of her nose - a crease in her skin. In medicine we call that crease the allergic salute. It's usually seen among children who have chronic allergies. It comes from chronically rubbing one's nose up and down trying to get rid of those allergy symptoms. And yet here was Veronica, a grown woman, with the same telltale sign of allergies. I said, Veronica, I think you have chronic allergies. I think you have migraine headaches and some sinus congestion. And I think all of those are related to where you live. She looked a little bit relieved because for the first time she had a diagnosis. But I said, Veronica, now let's talk about your treatment. We're going to order some medications for your symptoms. But I also want to refer you to a specialist if that's OK. I said, Veronica, actually the specialist I'm talking about is someone I call a community health worker, someone who if it's OK with you, can come to your home and try to understand what's going on with those water leaks and that mold, try to help you manage those conditions in your housing that I think are causing your symptoms. And if required, that specialist might refer you to another specialist that we call a public interest lawyer. Because it might be that your landlord isn't making the fixes he's required to make. Veronica came back in a few months later. She agreed to all those treatment plans. She told us that her symptoms had improved by 90 percent. She was spending more time at work and with her family and less time shuttling back and forth between the emergency rooms of Los Angeles. Veronica had improved remarkably. Her sons, one of whom had asthma, was no longer as sick as they used to be. She had gotten better. And not coincidentally, Veronica's home was better, too. What was it about this different approach that we tried that led to better care, fewer visits to the ER, better health? Well, quite simply, it started with that question. Veronica, where do you live? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Yeah, I mean, being exposed to chemicals isn't just the only way to be exposed to a toxic environment, right? MANCHANDA: Yeah. I tell the story of a great research project that happened in the United Kingdom. The researchers behind the study were looking specifically at cardiovascular disease and, within that specifically, the risk of death from a heart attack. And when they controlled for all other factors - you know, the economic level, the education level for somebody, the degree of disease that they had - what they came across was the closer an individual lived to a green space, to parks and trees, the lower their chance of dying from a heart attack. So for me as a physician, I'm certainly aware and trained to be aware of how to find the right pills and procedures to help support a patient of mine when they're at risk for a heart attack. But how do I prescribe a park? How do we as health care providers start thinking about the influence that that exposure has? And that's what is profound for me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Asking about health factors like whether there's a park nearby or mold in your home - that's known as an upstream approach. Basically you look beyond the symptoms and toward the source of the problem. And Rishi Manchanda says there are a few reasons more doctors don't do this. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MANCHANDA: The honest answer is that in health care, we often treat symptoms without addressing the conditions that make you sick in the first place. And there are many reasons for that, but the big three are, first, we don't pay for that. In health care, we often pay for volume and not value. That leads to a second phenomenon that I call the don't ask, don't tell approach to upstream issues in health care. We don't ask about where you live and where you work because if there's a problem there, we don't know what to tell you. It's not that doctors don't know these are important issues. In a recent survey done in the U. S. among physicians - over a thousand physicians - 80 percent of them actually said that they know that their patients' upstream problems are as important as their health issues, as their medical problems. And yet despite that widespread awareness of the importance of upstream issues, only 1 in 5 doctors said they had any sense of confidence to address those issues, to improve health where it begins. There's this gap between knowing that patient's lives, the context of where they live and work matters and the ability to do something about it in the systems in which we work. RAZ: And that's crazy to me. It's crazy to me that more doctors aren't asking the kinds of questions that you're asking. MANCHANDA: The great news is that there are increasing numbers of doctors and nurses and social workers and other health care professionals who have always been asking this question and are going to continue asking this question, and it's growing. The question for me, Guy, is, how do we take this ever-expanding body of information about the toxic exposures that are out there and expand our own understanding of how to - what we can do about those? A doctor doesn't have to become a transportation expert or a mold expert or a social worker, but a doctor should certainly know how to contact a transportation expert or a social worker or a mold expert with the same ease that a doctor can call a cardiologist to take care of that heart murmur. RAZ: Dr. Rishi Manchanda - you can see his entire talk at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today - Toxic, ideas about human resilience in a world full of toxins and chemicals. So what if the way we think about toxins is oversimplified? RISHI MANCHANDA: We often only look at a substance that is toxic because it's easy for us to mobilize a campaign against a villain. But what happens when we can't use a reductionist or singular approach? When we have to actually think about complexity, when we have to think about community and not just single cause. RAZ: This is Dr. Rishi Manchanda. And he says, yeah, chemicals can be toxic. But so can a lot of other things right in our own homes. MANCHANDA: There's no doubt that, as many public health researchers have been saying for years, that zip code matters more than genetic code when it comes to health outcomes. Where we live, where we eat, where we sleep have more than five times the impact on our health outcomes than all the, you know, pills and procedures the doctors prescribe. RAZ: Which means if you can't afford to live somewhere with access to healthy food or green spaces or good living conditions, it has an impact on your health. MANCHANDA: Poor communities have less say in determining how healthy their community can be or less power to actually make that happen. It's a vicious cycle. RAZ: Rishi's seen this firsthand. He used to work at a clinic in South Central Los Angeles, which served mostly lower income and minority patients. MANCHANDA: It was so clear that the issues that impacted my patients were informed by the toxins in their environment. RAZ: Rishi would see a lot of kids come into that clinic with things like lead poisoning because of old paint in their homes, people with breathing problems because of mold. And in cases like that, the approach can be surprisingly simple. Rishi told the story of one patient on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) MANCHANDA: Veronica (ph) was the 17th patient out of my 26-patient-day at that clinic in South Central Los Angeles. She came into our clinic with a chronic headache. This headache had been going on for a number of years. And this particular episode was very, very troubling. In fact, three weeks before she came to visit us for the first time, she went to an emergency room in Los Angeles. The emergency room doctors said let me run some tests, Veronica. The results are normal, so here's some pain medication. And follow up with a primary care doctor. But if the pain persists or if it worsens, then come on back. In the three weeks before Veronica met us, she went to the emergency room three times. She went back and forth, in and out of hospitals and clinics just like she had done in years past, trying to seek relief but still coming up short. When she came to our clinic though, we tried a different approach. Our medical assistant asked them routine questions. She asked, what's your chief complaint? Headache. Let's get your vital signs, measure your blood pressure and your heart rate. But let's also ask about something equally as vital to Veronica and a lot of patients like her in South Los Angeles. Veronica, can you tell me about where you live, specifically about your housing conditions? Do you have mold? Do you have water leaks? Do you have roaches in your home? Turns out Veronicas said yes to three of those things - roaches, water leaks, mold. RAZ: Of course, not all doctors ask these questions. In fact, the template for Rishi's survey, it didn't come from a doctor at all. MANCHANDA: Actually came from the American Housing Survey. It's a survey to assess the health of our housing stock. But it asks questions that are pertinent for health issues, too. RAZ: Questions like. . . MANCHANDA: Do you have water leaks? RAZ: Are there cockroaches in your house? MANCHANDA: How old is your home? RAZ: Do you have mold? Does anyone smoke in the house? MANCHANDA: Do you have large sections of your home where paint is chipping or fraying? RAZ: Things that can make you sick. And so Rishi and his team took those questions and they included them in a patient's exam. So by the time Rishi met with Veronica, he already knew about how her environment might be affecting her health. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) MANCHANDA: Here she was, doubled over in pain sitting on my exam table. Her head, clearly throbbing, was resting in her hands. She lifted her head up and I saw her face. I said hello. And then I immediately noticed something across the bridge of her nose - a crease in her skin. In medicine we call that crease the allergic salute. It's usually seen among children who have chronic allergies. It comes from chronically rubbing one's nose up and down trying to get rid of those allergy symptoms. And yet here was Veronica, a grown woman, with the same telltale sign of allergies. I said, Veronica, I think you have chronic allergies. I think you have migraine headaches and some sinus congestion. And I think all of those are related to where you live. She looked a little bit relieved because for the first time she had a diagnosis. But I said, Veronica, now let's talk about your treatment. We're going to order some medications for your symptoms. But I also want to refer you to a specialist if that's OK. I said, Veronica, actually the specialist I'm talking about is someone I call a community health worker, someone who if it's OK with you, can come to your home and try to understand what's going on with those water leaks and that mold, try to help you manage those conditions in your housing that I think are causing your symptoms. And if required, that specialist might refer you to another specialist that we call a public interest lawyer. Because it might be that your landlord isn't making the fixes he's required to make. Veronica came back in a few months later. She agreed to all those treatment plans. She told us that her symptoms had improved by 90 percent. She was spending more time at work and with her family and less time shuttling back and forth between the emergency rooms of Los Angeles. Veronica had improved remarkably. Her sons, one of whom had asthma, was no longer as sick as they used to be. She had gotten better. And not coincidentally, Veronica's home was better, too. What was it about this different approach that we tried that led to better care, fewer visits to the ER, better health? Well, quite simply, it started with that question. Veronica, where do you live?

Well, that's what environmental activist Emily Penn decided to find out. EMILY PENN: I grew up eating food mostly from the back garden. My parents are hugely keen gardeners. RAZ: You were not eating processed food? PENN: I wasn't eating processed food. I was the one who showed up at my friend's birthday party with, like, freshly-pulled beetroot with its sprouts all attached to give to my friends, when everyone else showed up with a box of chocolates. RAZ: So you're thinking, like, my body is not exactly loaded with toxic chemicals? PENN: Exactly. RAZ: But recently, Emily decided to have her blood tested for 35 toxic chemicals that are banned by the United Nations. PENN: And of those 35 chemicals that we tested for, we found 29 of them inside my body. RAZ: And that included traces of pesticides and flame retardants. PENN: I should point out here that the levels of chemicals I have inside me, they're not alarmingly high that I need to be immediately concerned about my health. PENN: For me, it's more of a scary indication of the direction that we're heading. RAZ: As we just heard from Tyrone Hayes, there are tons of ways these chemicals get into our bodies. And Emily is focused on just one of those ways - through plastics. So think about how much plastic you use every day - a plastic fork, a phone, little baggies for sandwiches. . . PENN: The smell of a new shower curtain. RAZ: Oh, I love that smell. PENN: Yeah (laughter). That's. . . RAZ: That's not good? PENN: No, that's not good. RAZ: One problem with plastic - it's made to last a very, very long time. PENN: And then we go and design products like plastic bags and plastic water bottles that are designed to be used just once out of that material that's designed to last forever. RAZ: And there's really not a lot of great options for how to deal with all that plastic. Emily explained why on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK)PENN: Only about 10 percent of the plastic that we use actually gets recycled. And that number's so low because plastic is really a term that we give to hundreds of different materials. They all have different properties. And to give them those properties, they need different chemical structures. But when you recycle something, the first thing you have to do is separate out all those different types of plastic. You need to clean them. And it's a very lengthy and expensive process. And it's much, much cheaper to take virgin plastic and make new products from scratch. And so instead, we see a lot of this plastic going to landfill. And also, 8 million tons of it annually washing down streams, down rivers and waterways. And eventually everything runs downhill to the ocean. RAZ: A couple of years ago, Emily went on a boat trip organized by environmental activists to see the problem firsthand. PENN: We would be in a part of the ocean a thousand miles from the nearest human being, you know, in the middle of the Pacific. And we'd - you'd see everything. You'd see plastic bags, plastic fragments, a washing basket. . . RAZ: In the middle of the ocean? PENN: . . . A TV - in the middle of the ocean. You'd jump in for a swim and you'd find a toothbrush. You know, it just totally boggled my mind about how we have managed to just disperse our waste literally across the whole of our planet. RAZ: But it wasn't until they put a fine net into the ocean, when they realized there is a much bigger problem. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK)PENN: The bigger problem was actually the smaller pieces. Because when we bring that net on deck, turn that sock inside out, this is what we find. We find thousands of tiny fragments of plastic smaller than your little fingernail, what we call micro plastics. And most of the plastic in our ocean is actually that big. When we get these samples on board, we see the same thing all the way from the tropics up to the Arctic. And it's almost like there's this fine mist of plastic pieces that just vary in concentration across our whole ocean. And so when we get those samples back onboard, the next thing we have to do is analyze them and work out what's plastic and what's plankton. And it made me wonder how the fish would cope, working out what was their food and what wasn't. And then we start finding things like fish with actually fragments of plastic inside its stomach. RAZ: So basically, these toxins that are going into the fish are just, like, climbing up the food chain? PENN: Yes, exactly. So the fact that when that plastic - so much of it does end up in our ocean. We are now finding a lot of - definitely the bigger marine mammals that you would have seen in the media, whales being washed up, turtles being found with stomachs full of plastic. It is rather scary that we know that this plastic, which has a lot of toxic chemicals, that actually getting into the food chain, that of course we are at the top of. RAZ: So I know that you take groups out to show them the effects of plastic in our environment. PENN: Yeah. RAZ: You also - you do the same blood tests for people in those groups. And so are you finding that everyone you test is just full of toxins? PENN: So before you get too depressed, we did have some interesting results when we looked at DDE - the derivative of DDT - inside our bodies. And of the whole group that we were sampling, we found that one of our members of the group had very, very high levels of DDE, way above the national average. And the rest of us, way below the national average. And she was actually 67 years old, and the only one of us who was alive prior to 1972, prior to that ban of DDT. What we can kind of draw from that small set of results is that those of us who have just been living post the ban have actually got very little of that chemical inside us. So when we do decide to make a change and we enforce it really as a global community, then we can see positive results in our own bodies. RAZ: Emily Penn is an environmental activist.

And so far, we've heard about toxins like pollution and industrial chemicals. But for scientists like Jeff Iliff. . . JEFF ILIFF: I'm an assistant professor at Oregon Health & Science University. RAZ: A toxin can be something in the cells of your own body. ILIFF: Yeah, so cells are like little engines, you know, they burn sugar and they use up oxygen. And in the process they produce all kinds of waste. RAZ: Like carbon dioxide, which is toxic in certain amounts. And that's not all. ILIFF: You know, ammonia is a molecule that your cells produce. RAZ: Ammonia, like, you know, the stuff in glass cleaner is also a chemical byproduct of your metabolism. ILIFF: Yeah. There's simple molecules like that. But then there's even more damaging, more complex molecules like certain proteins that can be produced that can have toxic effects if they build up to high enough levels. RAZ: And, yeah, every cell in your body produces these toxins. But the good news is we have organs to process and get rid of them. But there's one place in your body where toxins are much, much more dangerous. . . ILIFF: Your brain. RAZ: Your brain has its own way of dealing with toxins. ILIFF: So it has something called the blood-brain barrier, which is this - it's like a castle wall that walls the brain and the spinal cord in, and walls everything else from the rest of your body out. And so that sealing of the brain behind this barrier creates this other problem of, well, how do you deal with toxins that are made inside the castle? RAZ: Because remember, every cell in the body produces a tiny amount of toxic waste, even in the cells inside your brain. So how do we get rid of that? Here's Jeff on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ILIFF: Two-thousand years ago, Galen - one of the most prominent medical researchers of the ancient world - proposed that while we're awake, our brain's motive force - its juice - would flow out to all the other parts of the body, animating them but leaving the brain all dried up. And he thought that when we sleep, all this moisture that filled the rest of the body would come rushing back, rehydrating the brain and refreshing the mind. Now that sounds completely ridiculous to us now. But Galen was simply trying to explain something about sleep that we all deal with every day. So we all know based on our own experience that when you sleep, it clears your mind. And when you don't sleep, it leaves your mind murky. But while we know a great deal more about sleep now than when Galen was around, we still haven't understood why it is that sleep - of all of our activities - has this incredible restorative function for the mind. I want to tell you about some recent research that may shed new light on this question. We've found that sleep may actually be a kind of elegant design solution to some of the brain's most basic needs. RAZ: And one of those needs - flushing out toxins. ILIFF: So you can think of the brain sort of as almost like a, you know, a big sponge, right? RAZ: But the sponge acts differently depending on whether you're awake or asleep. ILIFF: What appears to happen is when you're awake if you were to, say, run water over that sponge - it's like if you had a very dense sponge that had very small gaps that ran through it - and very little of the water would actually wash through the sponge. RAZ: And that's because when you're awake, your brain cells seem to be packed tightly together. There's not a lot of space between them. ILIFF: But if that sponge suddenly underwent a change where all the gaps in between suddenly opened up, all of a sudden fluid is relatively free to move through. RAZ: And your brain - it has exactly the fluid to do that. It's called CSF, or cerebral spinal fluid. ILIFF: CSF is this really incredible clear fluid that is almost completely protein-free. So it's like this very clean salt water almost. So what the brain actually does is it floats in this sea of salt water, you know, like a person floating in a swimming pool where you feel more-or-less weightless. . . RAZ: Yeah. ILIFF: . . . The brain is in much the same way. RAZ: So during the day, your brain is happily floating in CSF. But when we sleep - and this is according to a study by Jeff and his team of researchers - CSF washes into the brain. And it flushes out toxins that our brain cells produce all day long. ILIFF: That appears to be at least one of the ways that the body manages waste that it needs to get rid of on a daily basis. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ILIFF: The waste product that these recent studies focus most on is amyloid beta, which is a protein that's made in the brain all the time. My brain's making amyloid beta right now and so is yours. But in patients with Alzheimer's disease, amyloid beta builds up and aggregates in the spaces between the brain cells instead of being cleared away like it's supposed to be. And it's this buildup of amyloid beta that's thought to be one of the key steps in the development of that terrible disease. A series of recent clinical studies suggest that among patients who haven't yet developed Alzheimer's disease, worsening sleep quality and sleep duration are associated with a greater amount of amyloid beta building up in the brain. And while it's important to point out that these studies don't prove that lack of sleep or poor sleep cause Alzheimer's disease, they do suggest that the failure of the brain to keep its house clean by clearing away waste like amyloid beta may contribute to the development of conditions like Alzheimer's. RAZ: Is it possible that there are other functions helped by sleep that we, you know, that we haven't yet discovered? ILIFF: I think it's not only possible, I think it's very likely. One might be immune surveillance of the brain. So how does the rest of the body detect whether there's an infection in the brain or not? Is that something that's happening during sleep? Impairment in sleep, especially chronic sleep disruption, is associated with all kinds of health conditions that you don't necessarily think of as being driven by the brain. What those connections are and why they're connected isn't necessarily clear. But there's probably other things that are happening during sleep that we haven't even sort of conceived of yet that we're going to discover in the next five, 10, 15 years. RAZ: That's Jeff Iliff. He's a neuroscientist at Oregon Health & Science University. You can watch his entire talk at ted. com. More ideas about toxins in just a moment. I'm Guy Raz and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:  On today's show, we're talking about things that are toxic. And so far, we've heard about toxins like pollution and industrial chemicals. But for scientists like Jeff Iliff. . . JEFF ILIFF: I'm an assistant professor at Oregon Health & Science University. RAZ: A toxin can be something in the cells of your own body. ILIFF: Yeah, so cells are like little engines, you know, they burn sugar and they use up oxygen. And in the process they produce all kinds of waste. RAZ: Like carbon dioxide, which is toxic in certain amounts. And that's not all. ILIFF: You know, ammonia is a molecule that your cells produce. RAZ: Ammonia, like, you know, the stuff in glass cleaner is also a chemical byproduct of your metabolism. ILIFF: Yeah. There's simple molecules like that. But then there's even more damaging, more complex molecules like certain proteins that can be produced that can have toxic effects if they build up to high enough levels. RAZ: And, yeah, every cell in your body produces these toxins. But the good news is we have organs to process and get rid of them. But there's one place in your body where toxins are much, much more dangerous. . . ILIFF: Your brain. RAZ: Your brain has its own way of dealing with toxins. ILIFF: So it has something called the blood-brain barrier, which is this - it's like a castle wall that walls the brain and the spinal cord in, and walls everything else from the rest of your body out. And so that sealing of the brain behind this barrier creates this other problem of, well, how do you deal with toxins that are made inside the castle? RAZ: Because remember, every cell in the body produces a tiny amount of toxic waste, even in the cells inside your brain. So how do we get rid of that? Here's Jeff on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) ILIFF: Two-thousand years ago, Galen - one of the most prominent medical researchers of the ancient world - proposed that while we're awake, our brain's motive force - its juice - would flow out to all the other parts of the body, animating them but leaving the brain all dried up. And he thought that when we sleep, all this moisture that filled the rest of the body would come rushing back, rehydrating the brain and refreshing the mind. Now that sounds completely ridiculous to us now. But Galen was simply trying to explain something about sleep that we all deal with every day. So we all know based on our own experience that when you sleep, it clears your mind. And when you don't sleep, it leaves your mind murky. But while we know a great deal more about sleep now than when Galen was around, we still haven't understood why it is that sleep - of all of our activities - has this incredible restorative function for the mind. I want to tell you about some recent research that may shed new light on this question. We've found that sleep may actually be a kind of elegant design solution to some of the brain's most basic needs. RAZ: And one of those needs - flushing out toxins. ILIFF: So you can think of the brain sort of as almost like a, you know, a big sponge, right? RAZ: But the sponge acts differently depending on whether you're awake or asleep. ILIFF: What appears to happen is when you're awake if you were to, say, run water over that sponge - it's like if you had a very dense sponge that had very small gaps that ran through it - and very little of the water would actually wash through the sponge. RAZ: And that's because when you're awake, your brain cells seem to be packed tightly together. There's not a lot of space between them. ILIFF: But if that sponge suddenly underwent a change where all the gaps in between suddenly opened up, all of a sudden fluid is relatively free to move through. RAZ: And your brain - it has exactly the fluid to do that. It's called CSF, or cerebral spinal fluid. ILIFF: CSF is this really incredible clear fluid that is almost completely protein-free. So it's like this very clean salt water almost. So what the brain actually does is it floats in this sea of salt water, you know, like a person floating in a swimming pool where you feel more-or-less weightless. . . RAZ: Yeah. ILIFF: . . . The brain is in much the same way. RAZ: So during the day, your brain is happily floating in CSF. But when we sleep - and this is according to a study by Jeff and his team of researchers - CSF washes into the brain. And it flushes out toxins that our brain cells produce all day long. ILIFF: That appears to be at least one of the ways that the body manages waste that it needs to get rid of on a daily basis. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) ILIFF: The waste product that these recent studies focus most on is amyloid beta, which is a protein that's made in the brain all the time. My brain's making amyloid beta right now and so is yours. But in patients with Alzheimer's disease, amyloid beta builds up and aggregates in the spaces between the brain cells instead of being cleared away like it's supposed to be. And it's this buildup of amyloid beta that's thought to be one of the key steps in the development of that terrible disease. A series of recent clinical studies suggest that among patients who haven't yet developed Alzheimer's disease, worsening sleep quality and sleep duration are associated with a greater amount of amyloid beta building up in the brain. And while it's important to point out that these studies don't prove that lack of sleep or poor sleep cause Alzheimer's disease, they do suggest that the failure of the brain to keep its house clean by clearing away waste like amyloid beta may contribute to the development of conditions like Alzheimer's. RAZ: Is it possible that there are other functions helped by sleep that we, you know, that we haven't yet discovered? ILIFF: I think it's not only possible, I think it's very likely. One might be immune surveillance of the brain. So how does the rest of the body detect whether there's an infection in the brain or not? Is that something that's happening during sleep? Impairment in sleep, especially chronic sleep disruption, is associated with all kinds of health conditions that you don't necessarily think of as being driven by the brain. What those connections are and why they're connected isn't necessarily clear. But there's probably other things that are happening during sleep that we haven't even sort of conceived of yet that we're going to discover in the next five, 10, 15 years. RAZ: That's Jeff Iliff.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, Toxic - ideas about human change and resilience in a world full of toxins and chemicals. So let's start in one of the most toxic places on Earth. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NEWS ANCHOR #1: There has been a nuclear accident in the Soviet Union. And the Soviets have admitted that it happened. The Soviet version is this - one of the atomic reactors at the Chernobyl atomic power plant in the city of Kiev was damaged. And there is speculation in Moscow that people were injured and may have died. The Soviets may have. . . HOLLY MORRIS: I think a lot of people would say Chernobyl is among the most toxic places in the world. Certainly, 30 years in the life of nuclear contamination is not a very long time. RAZ: Holly Morris is a filmmaker who's been to Chernobyl. It's a decommissioned nuclear power plant in present-day Ukraine where 30 years ago. . . MORRIS: On April 26, 1986. . . RAZ: Something went very, very wrong. MORRIS: The accident actually - because it was Soviet times and there was a lot of secrecy, there wasn't like, hey, guys, hello world, we've just had a big accident. They kept it under wraps. And in fact, it was a nuclear power plant in Sweden. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NEWS ANCHOR #2: Radiation monitors in Sweden and Finland this morning are showing unusually high readings. . . MORRIS: . . . Where the alarms started going off. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NEWS ANCHOR #2: At the moment, the source of those emissions is a mystery. But speculation has arisen of a nuclear power plant accident inside the Soviet Union. RAZ: And for days after, Russian officials denied how bad it actually was. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: (Foreign language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED NEWS ANCHOR #3: An official announcement from the Council of Ministers. There has been an accident at the Chernobyl atomic power station. One of the atomic reactors was damaged. RAZ: Russian officials said the loss of life was minimal. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NEWS ANCHOR #4: This evening, Soviet television repeated the claim that only two people have died. They assured viewers all is under control. RAZ: All the while, in the area around the Chernobyl plant. . . MORRIS: The nearest town to the plant is called Pripyat, which is essentially the company town. RAZ: Everyone there was evacuated. MORRIS: They were told they would be gone for three days. And they were loaded into buses and taken away. And, of course, they never returned home again. RAZ: The accident caused a nuclear fire that burned for more than a week. Dozens of workers died at the plant that day. And in the years to come, thousands more people in the area would die from thyroid cancer. And even to this day, the area where they lived - known as the exclusion zone - remains empty. Well, almost. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE BABUSHKAS OF CHERNOBYL\")UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Foreign language spoken). RAZ: This voice is a woman from a film Holly Morris made. It's called \"The Babushkas Of Chernobyl. \"MORRIS: A babushka is actually the Russian word for grandmother. RAZ: This babushka in Holly's film visits her family's plot in a cemetery, points out her relatives one-by-one. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE BABUSHKAS OF CHERNOBYL\")UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Foreign language spoken). RAZ: She's one of just a hundred women who were allowed back into the area around Chernobyl shortly after the accident. And they've lived there ever since. MORRIS: Now what's important to remember in terms of their survival is they were in their 50s at the time of the accident. And the older you are, the less detrimental the effects of radiation is. So the young people of Chernobyl who, of course, were certainly not allowed to return to those villages really took the brunt of the contamination at the time. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE BABUSHKAS OF CHERNOBYL\")UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Foreign language spoken). RAZ: So why make such a dangerous choice? Here's Holly on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MORRIS: Chernobyl is one of the most toxic places on Earth. The soil, the water, the air are all contaminated. And the nuclear fire that burned for 11 days back in 1986 released 400 times as much radiation as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The point being, no human beings should be living anywhere near the dead zone - but they are. And almost all of them are women. The men having died off earlier in part due to overuse of alcohol, cigarettes, if not radiation. Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated at the time of the accident, but not everybody accepted that fate. These are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities - and it would seem common sense - and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone. As one woman put it to a soldier who was trying to evacuate her for a second time - shoot me and dig the grave, otherwise I'm going home. I mean, why would they return to such deadly land? Were they unaware of the risks, or crazy enough to ignore them, or both? The thing is, they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently. RAZ: So, OK, so they move back and you decide to tell their stories. And when you encounter these women, what was your life like? MORRIS: It - you know, you come up on a village, like, there's a woman in the film named Hanna Zavorotnya. And I remember my first time - I was going to the village. It's beautiful. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE BABUSHKAS OF CHERNOBYL\")UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: (Foreign language spoken). MORRIS: It's a village that you might think of from a hundred years ago. Right? There's beautiful cottages. There's no cars. There's wind blowing, the light is lovely. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE BABUSHKAS OF CHERNOBYL\")UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: (Foreign language spoken). MORRIS: And the women themselves are - have these beautiful gardens, you know. It's strangely bucolic. On one hand you're passing abandoned, collapsing houses and villages along the way. But then you show up at Hanna Zavorotnya's house and you're like - and you see this sort of spritely woman welcome you and start offering you moonshine and dumplings and. . . (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE BABUSHKAS OF CHERNOBYL\")UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: (Foreign language spoken). MORRIS: . . . You're like, wow, I'm in the Chernobyl exclusion zone, yet this experience is happening. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE BABUSHKAS OF CHERNOBYL\")UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: (Foreign language spoken). RAZ: Our modern lives are filled with convenience and technology - shrink-wrapped vegetables and crystal clear swimming pools and plastic bags. But increasingly, those things are making our world and our bodies more toxic. So today on the show, we're going to explore some of the toxins in our environments, in our foods, even toxins our own bodies produce, and what we might be able to do about it. MORRIS: The women of the zone have chosen to live in a contaminated environment. They had a choice. And that kind of choice is going to be seen all over the world in the decades to come because environmental disasters are going to continue to happen. And it's not going to be realistic or maybe even the choice of people who live in those areas to leave. So the babushkas of Chernobyl, you know, are an early and curious example of this. RAZ: More on the babushkas later and how they've survived, even thrived for so long. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Unintelligible) our borders (ph). . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: You cheated. MARTIN: The discord highlights what seems to be an ever-widening political gap in our country. There are many theories to explain it - race, religion, gender. The list is long. For NPR's Hidden Brain podcast, social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam explored another idea. Could a driving force behind our political preferences be rooted deep inside the brain, hidden even to ourselves? We start with two voters whose deeply-held beliefs illustrate how moral values can shape our politics. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Thirty miles from the White House on a small farm in Dunkirk, Md. , Tom Barnes is finishing up his day. Barnes is a farrier, which means he trims and shoes horses' hooves all day long. TOM BARNES: It's funny, it doesn't really look like a lot of work. But when you're under there (laughter). . . VEDANTAM: Barnes believes in hard work, self-reliance and personal responsibility. And these qualities have shaped his political views. BARNES: Fiscally and internationally conservative, not hard right but conservative. VEDANTAM: Barnes says he'd never take on too much household debt. BARNES: I'm real simple when it comes to these kinds of things, and I don't think people should take on more debt than they would be able to repay. And I think that the country is no different. VEDANTAM: When he thinks of what ails America, he returns to a model of how a family should operate. BARNES: America needs stricter parents. It goes back to my example earlier of the household budget not getting to a point where they can no longer service their debt. Well, as a country, it's the same type of values that we need to get back to. We need to start being stricter parents. VEDANTAM: Hundreds of miles away, Kate Burkett is also working hard. She's an English teacher in Indianapolis, Ind. She has a different perspective shaped by her own values. KATE BURKETT: The school district that I'm in, the specific school that I teach at is a 73-percent free-and-reduced-lunch school. VEDANTAM: Burkett doesn't just think government-supported lunch programs are useful, she knows it. BURKETT: I think I've just seen what can be done with government money, kind of putting a face to - you know, you hear all these statistics about, oh, it's a free-and-reduced-lunch school, but I don't think about it like that. It's I know these kids, and I've known them for years and I've seen the good that they go on to do in the world, and it's worth it. It's worth the investment. VEDANTAM: Tom Barnes and Kate Burkett are thoughtful and fair-minded and have clear reasons to think the way they do. But when you put millions of Toms and millions of Kate's together, you don't get reasonable disagreement. You get Democrats and Republicans who can't comprehend each other's points of view. Social scientists are looking at what produces these intense disagreements. At the University of California at Berkeley, George Lakoff noticed what he thought could be a clue. It had to do with the way many politicians speak about the country. GEORGE LAKOFF: We have a metaphor that the nation is a family. We have Founding Fathers. We send our sons and daughters to war. We have homeland security. We don't want missiles in our backyard and so on and so on. VEDANTAM: Lakoff was drawn to the family metaphor because he's a cognitive linguist. Over decades of research, he's found that metaphors are not just figures of speech. They are ways to organize how we see the world. Could it be, he wondered, that this metaphor plays an organizing principle in the way voters think about politics? Could it help explain the deep divisions in the country? LAKOFF: If you have two different views of the nation, you may have two different views of the family, so I worked backwards. I took the two different views of the nation, worked backwards through the metaphor and out popped two different views of the family. VEDANTAM: Lakoff's theory goes something like this. The earliest experience most of us have with authority is inside the family. If people grow up thinking of parents as governing bodies, could it be, later in their lives as adults, they see governing bodies playing the role of parents? If so, could unconscious models of parental behavior shape how we think about government? One of those models is what Lakoff calls the strict father family. LAKOFF: In the strict-father family, the father knows best, the father knows right from wrong. And the job of the father is not just to support and protect the family but also, with respect to children, is to teach them right from wrong so that they have the right moral views. VEDANTAM: There is another model of how to be a good parent. Lakoff calls the style nurturant. Marti Gonzales is a psychologist at the University of Minnesota. She's done follow-up research on Lakoff's work. She says the goal of the nurturant parent. . . MARTI GONZALES: Is to rear children who are happy and self-fulfilled. And for children to be happy and self-fulfilled, they have to develop a set of kind of beliefs along the way, among them that we as a society benefit when people are willing to care for, support and nurture other people. VEDANTAM: Could these two models of parental behavior be behind some of the divisions in the country? To figure this out, Marti Gonzales and her team analyzed presidential political ads going back to 1980. And they found a bunch that fit the frameworks of the strict parent and the nurturant parent. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: The message Ronald Reagan has carried to America is one of strength. RONALD REAGAN: Peace is made by the fact of strength. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)WALTER MONDALE: We believe in a solid, just, compassionate, hopeful future. . . VEDANTAM: There was also a clear pattern between parental models and political leanings. GONZALES: Republicans were much more likely to rely on strict father ideas to make their points to persuade voters. Democrats were much more likely to use nurturant parent ideas. VEDANTAM: You can see the same ideas in the current presidential campaign between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. Here's a Trump ad featuring the voice of his son Donald Trump, Jr. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD)DONALD TRUMP JR: Well, a lot of people think of my father as a tough guy, and in many respects he is. Growing up, my brother, sister and I had to really know what we were talking about before bringing him any kind of proposal. He may be a little less tough on his grandchildren right now, but it's that toughness that I want renegotiating trade deals with China and Mexico. VEDANTAM: And here's an ad from Hillary Clinton. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD)CLINTON: When I think about why I'm doing this, I think about my mother Dorothy. She was abandoned by her parents at the age of 8, sent from Chicago to LA to live with grandparents who didn't want her. But people showed her kindness, gave her a chance. VEDANTAM: Can you hear the appeals to the frames of the strict, tough-love parent and the nurturing, empathetic parent? Lakoff and Gonzales think these hidden frames are responsible for much of the political rancor in the country. Much of the problem is because we don't realize how powerfully frames shape the way we see the world. LAKOFF: And what happens when you hear things that don't make sense, there are various things you can do about it. One, you can just not hear it, it doesn't make any sense. You can ignore it. You can ridicule it, saying, hey, this doesn't make any sense. They're stupid people, they're dumb, they're mean, they're cruel, whatever. Or you can - if it's threatening, you can attack them. So all of those things are happening in our politics right now. VEDANTAM: George Lakoff and Marti Gonzales' ideas aren't the only explanation for what divides us politically, but they offer a point of view you might not have considered. So when you're thinking about the last few days of this presidential election, think about it as a parenting dispute, like two parents who love a child but can't get along with each other. And while bewildered voters might be pointing fingers and questioning motives, the truth may be more complicated. What fuels our rancor may not be stupidity or callousness, but love.

MARTIN: The discord highlights what seems to be an ever-widening political gap in our country. There are many theories to explain it - race, religion, gender. The list is long. For NPR's Hidden Brain podcast, social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam explored another idea. Could a driving force behind our political preferences be rooted deep inside the brain, hidden even to ourselves? We start with two voters whose deeply-held beliefs illustrate how moral values can shape our politics. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Thirty miles from the White House on a small farm in Dunkirk, Md. , Tom Barnes is finishing up his day. Barnes is a farrier, which means he trims and shoes horses' hooves all day long. TOM BARNES: It's funny, it doesn't really look like a lot of work. But when you're under there (laughter). . . VEDANTAM: Barnes believes in hard work, self-reliance and personal responsibility. And these qualities have shaped his political views. BARNES: Fiscally and internationally conservative, not hard right but conservative. VEDANTAM: Barnes says he'd never take on too much household debt. BARNES: I'm real simple when it comes to these kinds of things, and I don't think people should take on more debt than they would be able to repay. And I think that the country is no different. VEDANTAM: When he thinks of what ails America, he returns to a model of how a family should operate. BARNES: America needs stricter parents. It goes back to my example earlier of the household budget not getting to a point where they can no longer service their debt. Well, as a country, it's the same type of values that we need to get back to. We need to start being stricter parents. VEDANTAM: Hundreds of miles away, Kate Burkett is also working hard. She's an English teacher in Indianapolis, Ind. She has a different perspective shaped by her own values. KATE BURKETT: The school district that I'm in, the specific school that I teach at is a 73-percent free-and-reduced-lunch school. VEDANTAM: Burkett doesn't just think government-supported lunch programs are useful, she knows it. BURKETT: I think I've just seen what can be done with government money, kind of putting a face to - you know, you hear all these statistics about, oh, it's a free-and-reduced-lunch school, but I don't think about it like that. It's I know these kids, and I've known them for years and I've seen the good that they go on to do in the world, and it's worth it. It's worth the investment. VEDANTAM: Tom Barnes and Kate Burkett are thoughtful and fair-minded and have clear reasons to think the way they do. But when you put millions of Toms and millions of Kate's together, you don't get reasonable disagreement. You get Democrats and Republicans who can't comprehend each other's points of view. Social scientists are looking at what produces these intense disagreements. At the University of California at Berkeley, George Lakoff noticed what he thought could be a clue. It had to do with the way many politicians speak about the country. GEORGE LAKOFF: We have a metaphor that the nation is a family. We have Founding Fathers. We send our sons and daughters to war. We have homeland security. We don't want missiles in our backyard and so on and so on. VEDANTAM: Lakoff was drawn to the family metaphor because he's a cognitive linguist. Over decades of research, he's found that metaphors are not just figures of speech. They are ways to organize how we see the world. Could it be, he wondered, that this metaphor plays an organizing principle in the way voters think about politics? Could it help explain the deep divisions in the country? LAKOFF: If you have two different views of the nation, you may have two different views of the family, so I worked backwards. I took the two different views of the nation, worked backwards through the metaphor and out popped two different views of the family. VEDANTAM: Lakoff's theory goes something like this. The earliest experience most of us have with authority is inside the family. If people grow up thinking of parents as governing bodies, could it be, later in their lives as adults, they see governing bodies playing the role of parents? If so, could unconscious models of parental behavior shape how we think about government? One of those models is what Lakoff calls the strict father family. LAKOFF: In the strict-father family, the father knows best, the father knows right from wrong. And the job of the father is not just to support and protect the family but also, with respect to children, is to teach them right from wrong so that they have the right moral views. VEDANTAM: There is another model of how to be a good parent. Lakoff calls the style nurturant. Marti Gonzales is a psychologist at the University of Minnesota. She's done follow-up research on Lakoff's work. She says the goal of the nurturant parent. . . MARTI GONZALES: Is to rear children who are happy and self-fulfilled. And for children to be happy and self-fulfilled, they have to develop a set of kind of beliefs along the way, among them that we as a society benefit when people are willing to care for, support and nurture other people. VEDANTAM: Could these two models of parental behavior be behind some of the divisions in the country? To figure this out, Marti Gonzales and her team analyzed presidential political ads going back to 1980. And they found a bunch that fit the frameworks of the strict parent and the nurturant parent. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: The message Ronald Reagan has carried to America is one of strength. RONALD REAGAN: Peace is made by the fact of strength. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WALTER MONDALE: We believe in a solid, just, compassionate, hopeful future. . . VEDANTAM: There was also a clear pattern between parental models and political leanings. GONZALES: Republicans were much more likely to rely on strict father ideas to make their points to persuade voters. Democrats were much more likely to use nurturant parent ideas. VEDANTAM: You can see the same ideas in the current presidential campaign between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. Here's a Trump ad featuring the voice of his son Donald Trump, Jr. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) DONALD TRUMP JR: Well, a lot of people think of my father as a tough guy, and in many respects he is. Growing up, my brother, sister and I had to really know what we were talking about before bringing him any kind of proposal. He may be a little less tough on his grandchildren right now, but it's that toughness that I want renegotiating trade deals with China and Mexico. VEDANTAM: And here's an ad from Hillary Clinton. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) CLINTON: When I think about why I'm doing this, I think about my mother Dorothy. She was abandoned by her parents at the age of 8, sent from Chicago to LA to live with grandparents who didn't want her. But people showed her kindness, gave her a chance. VEDANTAM: Can you hear the appeals to the frames of the strict, tough-love parent and the nurturing, empathetic parent? Lakoff and Gonzales think these hidden frames are responsible for much of the political rancor in the country. Much of the problem is because we don't realize how powerfully frames shape the way we see the world. LAKOFF: And what happens when you hear things that don't make sense, there are various things you can do about it. One, you can just not hear it, it doesn't make any sense. You can ignore it. You can ridicule it, saying, hey, this doesn't make any sense. They're stupid people, they're dumb, they're mean, they're cruel, whatever. Or you can - if it's threatening, you can attack them. So all of those things are happening in our politics right now. VEDANTAM: George Lakoff and Marti Gonzales' ideas aren't the only explanation for what divides us politically, but they offer a point of view you might not have considered. So when you're thinking about the last few days of this presidential election, think about it as a parenting dispute, like two parents who love a child but can't get along with each other. And while bewildered voters might be pointing fingers and questioning motives, the truth may be more complicated. What fuels our rancor may not be stupidity or callousness, but love.

The news is usually released along with an artist's impression of what that planet might look like. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce wondered how much freedom those artists get to create their visions of alien worlds. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: When it comes to our own solar system, we've got tons of drop-dead-gorgeous photos - red canyons on Mars, the rings of Saturn, the ice on Pluto. The planets outside our solar system are a different story. Over the last two decades, scientists have discovered thousands of them, but not by actually seeing them. What they see is how a planet's gravity tugs on its star or how a planet blocks a star's light. TIM PYLE: Did that star slightly move a little - kind of wobble left and right? Or did the brightness of the star dim just a little bit? GREENFIELDBOYCE: That's Tim Pyle. He's a graphic artist who works at NASA's Spitzer Science Center at Cal Tech. He says, by looking at the star. . . PYLE: We're actually able to extrapolate quite a bit of information about, say, the number of planets that might be around it, their distance from the star, their size. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Still, that leaves a lot of details that have to be filled in if you want to create a plausible picture of what the planet might look like. And that's Pyle's job. He's illustrated dozens of planet discoveries and tries to tell a visual story about each world. PYLE: If, you know, we find a planet that potentially has liquid water on its surface - and let's say that's pretty rare - you're going to make sure that, whatever your artist's concept is, you're focusing on that water in some way. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But it gets complicated. Take a planet called Kepler-186f, a rocky planet that might have liquid water or maybe not. PYLE: So we didn't want the general public to see this artist concept and walk away thinking, wow, they found another Earth. So a detail as small as what color is the water that I'm illustrating on the surface of the planet ended up becoming a really big thing. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The water's color got tweaked again and again. PYLE: Because we wanted it to be clear that it's water, but we certainly didn't want it to look, say, blue because that would look inviting, like, oh, wow, I want to go to Kepler-186 and dive into the water and swim around. It looks awesome. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They settled on a kind of muddy brown. Then there was the time he illustrated Kepler-452b. Scientists couldn't agree on whether this planet could have water. It might have lost it all in what's called a runaway greenhouse effect. So Pyle created a planet that was just beginning to lose its water. PYLE: So you can see lakes and rivers that have dried up and left behind salty residue along their shores. And it was kind of a green, ugly water, volcanoes all over the surface. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Images like this get a lot of press attention. PYLE: Which impressed my mom. It was on the cover of USA Today, and my mom actually saved a copy and sent me a copy. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And creating these pictures has become a bit of a cottage industry. Pyle used to do computer graphics work in Hollywood, but now he collaborates with scientists, as well as another visual artist named Robert Hurt, who was trained as an astronomer. Hurt says, when illustrating a planet, there is one thing they never do. ROBERT HURT: We have never put anything indicating the possibility of life or anything that you would look at and say, oh, yeah, that's definitely a living organism - trees, even algae, right? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Even so, some people worry that these illustrations might give the public the wrong idea. Ray Villard is news director for the Space Telescope Science Institute. RAY VILLARD: It's tricky with computer graphics. You can make stuff in such extraordinary detail. People might think it's real. People might think we've actually seen these features - canyons and all kinds of lakes and rivers. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That's why he prefers illustrations that leave more to the imagination. VILLARD: It can be evocative without showing every little rock and stone and cliff that's on the planet. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Still, he doesn't want to knock the more photorealistic ones. He understands the need to excite and inspire the public. And given the technical challenges, he thinks it will be well into the next century until we can take a real photograph of a planet beyond our solar system that comes anywhere close to what a space artist can imagine.

LIV AANNESTAD: I always assumed it would happen the normal, typical way. I'd meet somebody maybe either in high school or college and get married and have a few babies. But it didn't happen that way. SIEGEL: As years went by and she still hadn't met the right person, Liv started thinking about becoming a single parent. Now, Liv Aannestad is 36, and this year she started the in-vitro fertilization process. Like every prospective parents, she has lots of questions, so we introduced her to someone who could answer them. PAM RECTOR: Hi, Liv. How are you? AANNESTAD: Hello. How are you? RECTOR: Good. Good morning. SIEGEL: Pam Rector is a single mother by choice. Her daughter is now 17. Pam and Liv spoke as part of our series Been There, connecting people at either end of a shared experience. Liv, the prospective mother, wanted to know what it was like for Pam when she decided to get pregnant on her own. AANNESTAD: One of my concerns I was going to ask you about is, do people judge you for this when they find out that you did it on your own? RECTOR: My folks were not so keen on the idea. My mom was a big fan of Dr. Laura at the time, so my mom was saying, you know, Dr. Laura says that this is very selfish and blah, blah, blah. And my dad said to me, you know, you're just having a midlife crisis. Why don't you just get a red car or something? But once I was pregnant, they were, like, over the moon that all that. . . AANNESTAD: Right. RECTOR: . . . Fell away. So. . . AANNESTAD: Then it becomes real I guess. RECTOR: Yeah. Then they're, like, at the ultrasound. But I don't think - the judgment thing wasn't a big issue to me. I mean I don't want to say I didn't care, but it - my desire to be a mom was more important than what people were going to say to me. AANNESTAD: Yeah. RECTOR: So question for you - are you having doubts about the path, like, disaster fantasies (laughter) or huge fears or. . . AANNESTAD: Yeah. RECTOR: Do you have. . . AANNESTAD: I do do that. I. . . RECTOR: Yeah. AANNESTAD: I mean I - it is the right decision, but I have my thoughts of, you know - obviously the question of, is the child going to be resentful of the fact that there's not a father figure? There may not be a father figure. I did go with a open or non-anonymous donor, so they have the option of contacting them when they're 18. So I was going to ask you if you had done that. RECTOR: Yeah, I went with the California Cryobank, and at the time, what the donor agreed to is that when the child is 18, the child can contact the bank, and the bank will contact the donor. Does your daughter want to meet him? She's interested in meeting him and seeing him, but she's - she has always known obviously. You know, when she was little, I practiced telling the story about the nice man with the seeds that, you know, the doctor put inside me. And that's how you came to be. And she's been - I mean, you know, because you can pick whatever you want donor wise, I picked somebody with Italian background because I wanted a little SPF in there. AANNESTAD: (Laughter). RECTOR: And you know, I remember; we were in an elevator one time. And so she gets really beautiful skin in the summer. And someone said to her, oh, your skin - it's so beautiful. And she was three. She's like, oh, thank you; I got it from my donor, you know? AANNESTAD: Yeah (laughter). RECTOR: And I'm like, OK, this is a girl that's comfortable with. . . AANNESTAD: It's not an elevator. . . RECTOR: . . . Her story. AANNESTAD: conversation though maybe. RECTOR: Yeah, yeah. AANNESTAD: Is there anything that was unexpected as you went through this process that I should know about? RECTOR: I think for a lot of single moms, we are independent women, and we can handle our own business. But then this little baby comes. And sometimes you just can't do it all, so you have to know how to ask for support or, when people offer, to take it. And that's hard - for me, it was a hard lesson to learn because I'm used to, like, no, no, no, I got it; I can handle it. But no, you know, she was a colicky kid. She cried from, like, 7 to 11 at night. When people said, what can I do? It's like, you can come over. Bring food, and carry her around so I can eat while she's doing the crying thing. AANNESTAD: That's a good point because I could see myself being afraid that people are going to say I told you so, you know? Like, well, you did this on your own, so it might lead me to say, oh, I'm fine; I don't need help - but yeah. RECTOR: There was a big group of people that were very supportive to me, but in the end, you're doing it by yourself. AANNESTAD: Sure. RECTOR: So I think it's important that you know that there are going to be times where you're just like, oh, my God, this is just so hard, you know? AANNESTAD: Right. RECTOR: I've got to do the taxes. I've got to do the this. And now the plumbing broke. And the baby's crying. And the (unintelligible). You know, some days are just not that pretty, (laughter) and you just take the breath and get it done. I look back at videos that I have. You know, like, I'm videoing my daughter, and there's nobody in it but her, right? Like, there's not videos. . . AANNESTAD: Right. RECTOR: . . . Of she and I. AANNESTAD: Right 'cause you're holding the camera, right? RECTOR: Right, so it is a different family situation. AANNESTAD: Do you think you had - have a better relationship with your daughter because it's just you and her? RECTOR: You know, we've had the conversation about, do you wish you had a dad? And she has said sometimes she wished she had a dad because dads are fun, and dads play. And - but I think the thing is, she also has said to me, I know if I had a dad, that she and I wouldn't have the same relationship that we do have. She's, you know, half of the family.

AANNESTAD: Do you think you had - have a better relationship with your daughter because it's just you and her? RECTOR: You know, we've had the conversation about, do you wish you had a dad? And she has said sometimes she wished she had a dad because dads are fun, and dads play. And - but I think the thing is, she also has said to me, I know if I had a dad, that she and I wouldn't have the same relationship that we do have. She's, you know, half of the family.

Some psychologists see it differently - not a ceiling, but a labyrinth. And the problem does not stop once a woman is elected to public office or reaches the corner office. NPR's Shankar Vedantam explores a painful double bind that affects women who seek to lead. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: For 16 years, Connie Morella served as a Republican congresswoman from Maryland, but she says she struggled to be taken seriously. CONNIE MORELLA: I would respond to a question or a comment on an issue. And they would say, well, thank you, Connie. And then, a little later, Representative Smith said the very same thing I did, and it was, oh, Congressman Smith, that was fabulous. Let the record show that you have accomplished that - whatever. And I think, gee, I just said that. VEDANTAM: This is one side of the double bind. Women who aspire to leadership are often seen as inconsequential. In 1992, Carol Moseley-Braun became the first African-American woman elected to the U. S. Senate. But shortly after she won her race, she confronted the other side of the double bind. She made an impassioned plea on the Senate floor one day and realized her colleagues were only hearing a shrill, angry woman. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CAROL MOSELEY-BRAUN: And getting rid of that safety net is what this so-called welfare reform is all about. We are rending that safety net apart. VEDANTAM: Moseley-Braun says she nearly quit the Senate that day. It wasn't just about the unfair perception. She saw her experience in the long light of history. MOSELEY-BRAUN: In the 15th century, women who talked back, they would put weights on their tongue. And so it is really that very, very fine line between being a shrew on the one hand and a puppet on the other that any woman in public life has to walk. VEDANTAM: The experiences of Carol Moseley-Braun and Connie Morella reveal the twin faces of the double bind. Women in power often have to choose between being seen as likeable, but incompetent, or competent, but cold. Social psychologist Alice Eagly says the double bind arises from a series of interlocking stereotypes about gender. . . ALICE EAGLY: People expect women to be kind of nice and friendly (laughter) and smile. VEDANTAM: . . . And about leadership. EAGLY: One is expected to demonstrate toughness, make tough decisions, sometimes fire people for cause, et cetera. VEDANTAM: But in real life, when we look at a woman leader who appears incompetent or shrill, how do we know if we are seeing the world as it actually is or through the lens of our own biases? Madeline Heilman, a psychology professor at New York University, uses controlled experiments to answer that question. In one study, for instance, she asked volunteers to evaluate a high-powered manager joining a company. Sometimes, volunteers are told the manager is a man. Other times, they're told it's a woman. MADELINE HEILMAN: When we present women and men with exactly the same credentials, qualifications and backgrounds for a job that is traditionally male, we consistently find that the woman is seen as more incompetent than the man. VEDANTAM: Because these biases are shaped by culture, they're held by both men and women. HEILMAN: The research that I've done has shown that when women are truly successful in areas where they're not expected to be, there's a very negative reaction. There's disapproval, but they're also seen as really awful depictions of what kinds of people they are - words like bitter and quarrelsome and selfish and deceitful and devious and manipulative and cold. We have terms for these people - you know, ice queen and dragon lady and iron maiden and so on and so forth. VEDANTAM: At the same time, many experts believe these biases might be breaking down. As society changes and we come to think of leadership as being collaborative rather than dictatorial, our views may also change. The less we think of leaders as alpha males, the easier it's going to be for women to make it through the labyrinth and for our unconscious minds to recognize them as competent leaders. If there's one common thread here, it's that ending the double bind can't be just on the women who are reaching for high office or the corner office. It has to be on all of us.

Over the past four years, the drought has killed at least 60 million trees. Scientists are struggling to find ways to keep the survivors alive, and as NPR's Christopher Joyce discovered, they're trying some completely new ideas. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: The Sierra Nevada Mountains are known for rocky pinnacles and tall forests. These days, though, the forests are blotchy. Patches of dead trees stand right next the healthy, green ones. I went into the forest to talk to Nate Stephenson, an ecologist with the U. S. Geological Survey. He says the drought and high heat combine to do things he has not seen before. NATE STEPHENSON: We don't really understand a lot of things, like exactly how a drought kills a tree or what's going on underground - you know, where is the water flowing in areas we can't see. JOYCE: So a team of ecologists has come here, as well, with truckloads of equipment to find out what separates the survivors from the dead. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Unintelligible). UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yeah. JOYCE: Their destination is down a steep slope, through piles of pine needles and rotting tree limbs. STEPHENSON: Yellow jacket nests down here, so watch out. JOYCE: Looming above is Odin, a green, thriving giant sequoia. The top is 250 feet up. Its base is as wide as a city street. Odin was a sapling when Rome was still an empire, and for some reason, it's resisting this drought. These scientists want to find out why. CAMERON WILLIAMS: My name is Cameron Williams. I consider myself a forest canopy biologist. JOYCE: Williams buckles on a climbing harness festooned with clips, carabiners and an ascender - a clamp attached to the rope he's now uncoiling that he will use to climb up into the canopy. I put a small microphone on his shirt, and he practices his emergency communication drill. (SOUNDBITE OF SCREAMING)WILLIAMS: Williams can joke because he's done this so many times. He and his climbing partner, Rikke Naesborg, have spent hundreds of hours up in this tree, measuring it like a patient etherized on a table. RIKKE NAESBORG: Every single branch. JOYCE: Taking notes while you're hanging from a rope? NAESBORG: We are taking notes while we're hanging on rope, yes (laughter). Well, you get used to it. WILLIAMS: It's very, very laborious. JOYCE: They measure to check growth rate and how much moisture is in the branches and the needles and cones. Todd Dawson is running the show here. He's a plant ecologist from the University of California, Berkeley. Dawson says what's happening to these forests is not normal. TODD DAWSON: There's a lot more dead trees in this forest than I've ever seen since we've been working here - since 2008. JOYCE: Dawson is like an epidemiologist, studying disease in a large population - in this case, trees. But there are way too many trees here to climb each one, so while his climbers take Odin's measurements, Dawson is going to try something else. He's going to fly a drone around the giant sequoia, carefully avoiding branches on every side, and essentially do a botanical X-ray of it. DAWSON: This is the first time for all of us, so we're taking our time and trying to be very cautious. JOYCE: Tom Jennings is a drone jockey with a company called CloudD8TA. TOM JENNINGS: We're dealing with the canopy, and that's a new hazard that I'm not used to. JOYCE: The drones will fly to the top of the tree and then down around it, taking images. JENNINGS: Go ahead, guys. We just figured we all should get started. JOYCE: What the team hopes to do is compare what the climbers see with what the drones reveal. If drones can diagnose a tree as well as a climber can, they could cover a whole forest much faster. (SOUNDBITE OF DRONE BUZZING)JOYCE: The black drone rises from the ground. It's about three feet square and looks like something Darth Vader would have on his desk. It's carrying some very sophisticated cameras. DAWSON: It records basically the reflected light off the canopy, and that reflected light gives us the health of the crown itself - water content and other chemicals in there, like chlorophyll content, which is directly related to photosynthesis, and nitrogen content. JOYCE: All things that reflect how stressed the tree is. (SOUNDBITE OF DRONE BUZZING)JOYCE: The drone slowly descends from the treetop. Meanwhile, Cameron Williams pulls himself up a tree on a rope the size of his pinky finger. (SOUNDBITE OF RUSTLING AND CLICKING)WILLIAMS: Well, we just reached 160-ish feet above the ground. Looks like a long ways down there. And I can hear a drone overhead. Sounds like a giant bees' nest (laughter). Looking around at the landscape, you can really see a lot of dead trees. Wow. There's hundreds - potentially thousands - of dead trees that I can see in this one view. JOYCE: These diagnoses are vital to understanding the drought. Already, Dawson has found that forests at low and mid-elevations - pine, fir, cedar - are getting slammed the hardest. They can choke to death. Heat and drought cause air bubbles to form in their trunks and block their flow of water. Or they die when beetles detect the weak ones and single them out like predators on the Serengeti. But the giant sequoias, like Odin, are different. DAWSON: What is giant sequoia doing? Why is it able to be so resilient? JOYCE: It could be that sequoias grow where there is more groundwater, or maybe it's the way they shed needles when they're stressed. Understanding how different species of trees respond will help scientists focus their rescue efforts. There are things that can be done. Forest ecologists like Nate Stephenson say, for example, you can thin out small trees and underbrush. That means fewer straws sucking water out of the ground. STEPHENSON: That gives more water, more light, more nutrients for the biggest trees on the landscape, so they're better able to survive stresses in the future. (SOUNDBITE OF RUSTLING)JOYCE: The drought is a disaster, but also a huge natural experiment. And ecologists like Cameron Williams, still up in Odin's branches, say trees like this one could tell them how to help these forests survive. WILLIAMS: Looks like this tree has been here for a long time and endured a lot of the elements that the environment has in store for it. JOYCE: And that's exactly why these scientists think that Odin, going strong despite the drought, will help them save the rest of the forest. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

She is running campaign ads in the reliably Republican state of Texas. This is because she thinks she can expand the map of where a Democrat can win. There's also social science research suggesting that she might want to go even further and run ads in safe Democratic states as well. Why is that? Well, to explain, we're joined by NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam. Hi, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So why run ads in places where you know you're going to win? VEDANTAM: Well, I was talking to the political scientist Sarah Niebler at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania, David. She said that unlike voters in battleground states, voters in safe Democratic states aren't seeing ads for Hillary Clinton. Voters in safe Republican states aren't seeing ads for Donald Trump. SARAH NIEBLER: They're seeing regular advertisements for insurance companies, for cars. They're not seeing their airways dominated by presidential advertising. GREENE: And they're probably happy about that, seeing ads for cars and not for candidates. VEDANTAM: Right. Now, Niebler told me that she and Carly Urban at Montana State University asked themselves why the campaigns were hurting themselves by ignoring these states. Now, they're not hurting themselves in terms of votes. But could ignoring such states affect the willingness of people in those states to give money to the campaign? GREENE: Are you saying there might be untapped money in some of these places and if they run ads, people might say - oh, I've liked this candidate anyway. But now that you're actually making the effort, I might open my checkbook? VEDANTAM: Exactly. There's also a psychological reason. If you live in a safe red or a safe blue state, you have the feeling that you can't do much to influence the election because the outcome in your state is a foregone conclusion. But one way to get these voters involved is to get them to pull out their checkbooks and credit cards so they can say, you know, my vote might not matter to the outcome, but maybe my $200 can make a difference. Niebler and Urban came up with a clever way to analyze the effects of campaign ads on people living in non-battleground states. Now, these are not the big donors who'll write checks with thousands of dollars but the small donors who are writing checks for $50. I'll let her tell you what she found, but what you need to know first is that if you average the amount of money given by donors around the country, donors in each ZIP code in the nation give around $22,000 dollars in campaign contributions. NIEBLER: We found that having been exposed to this campaign advertising increased the amount of money that the ZIP code gave by about $6,000, so about a quarter more contributions coming from the ZIP codes that were exposed to campaign advertising as compared to the ZIP codes that were never exposed to campaign advertising. GREENE: But the real bottom-line question is, if you're a presidential campaign, you decide, is it worth spending money in a state that you know you're going to win? If you spend money on the advertising, are you guaranteed you're going to get that money back from this extra donation? VEDANTAM: Niebler told me she thought that it would come back. She said it's probably not going to be a large difference. But campaigns that do this would end up with valuable extra cash that they could then take and spend on battleground states. But she also told me she didn't think it was going to happen. You know, it's one thing for Hillary Clinton to campaign in Texas because it sends a message she's doing so well she is now trying to win over traditional Republican states. But advertising in Democratic states would require campaign managers to take the kind of risks that campaign managers don't like to take. NIEBLER: It doesn't pass the gut check to a lot of campaign managers, I think. Someone can easily look and say, you spent $100,000 advertising in San Francisco, when they maybe lose a state by a half a percent or even a couple of hundred votes that they could have won maybe having spent a little bit more money there. VEDANTAM: The bottom line, David, is that campaigns actually tend to be quite risk-averse. A campaign manager who takes this kind of gamble and loses will probably never be hired to run another campaign again. GREENE: Probably not (laughter). Shankar, thanks as always. VEDANTAM: Thanks, David. GREENE: All right. Shankar Vedantam is NPR's social science correspondent. He explores the science of risk aversion, as we just heard about, and other ideas about human behavior on his podcast Hidden Brain.

I'll let her tell you what she found, but what you need to know first is that if you average the amount of money given by donors around the country, donors in each ZIP code in the nation give around $22,000 dollars in campaign contributions. NIEBLER: We found that having been exposed to this campaign advertising increased the amount of money that the ZIP code gave by about $6,000, so about a quarter more contributions coming from the ZIP codes that were exposed to campaign advertising as compared to the ZIP codes that were never exposed to campaign advertising. GREENE: But the real bottom-line question is, if you're a presidential campaign, you decide, is it worth spending money in a state that you know you're going to win? If you spend money on the advertising, are you guaranteed you're going to get that money back from this extra donation? VEDANTAM: Niebler told me she thought that it would come back. She said it's probably not going to be a large difference. But campaigns that do this would end up with valuable extra cash that they could then take and spend on battleground states. But she also told me she didn't think it was going to happen. You know, it's one thing for Hillary Clinton to campaign in Texas because it sends a message she's doing so well she is now trying to win over traditional Republican states. But advertising in Democratic states would require campaign managers to take the kind of risks that campaign managers don't like to take. NIEBLER: It doesn't pass the gut check to a lot of campaign managers, I think. Someone can easily look and say, you spent $100,000 advertising in San Francisco, when they maybe lose a state by a half a percent or even a couple of hundred votes that they could have won maybe having spent a little bit more money there. VEDANTAM: The bottom line, David, is that campaigns actually tend to be quite risk-averse. A campaign manager who takes this kind of gamble and loses will probably never be hired to run another campaign again. GREENE: Probably not (laughter). Shankar, thanks as always. VEDANTAM: Thanks, David. GREENE: All right. Shankar Vedantam is NPR's social science correspondent.

For Halley Katz, it's huge. HALLEY KATZ: This is the biggest investment anyone in my family's ever made. I have to know for sure that if I'm going to be paying $30,000 a year in tuition, that this is exactly what I want to do. CORNISH: Halley Katz is the first person in her family to go to a four-year college. This fall, she started classes at Point Park University in Pittsburgh after a few semesters of community college. And she had a lot of questions, but her parents couldn't really answer them since neither had a degree. So we connected her with another first-generation college student. TYLER LATTIMORE: Hi, Halley. This is Tyler. KATZ: Hey, Tyler. CORNISH: Tyler Lattimore graduated this spring from Emory University in Atlanta. He sat down to answer some of Halley's questions for our series Been There, connecting people on either end of a shared experience. KATZ: At community college, it's really easy to get really comfortable with doing well. And you're surrounded by other people who are going to community college and didn't have the money to go straight to a four-year school or didn't have the guidance to go straight to a four-year school. Did it ever feel like you had to struggle more to prove that you deserved to be there and that you earned that spot? LATTIMORE: Definitely. And even at certain times, you had people - or my peers - that said that expressly. They based my getting there, my being there on how I looked and what my financial history was. And at the beginning, I kind of felt like I had to prove them wrong, show them that I was just as good as them. Or sometimes you struggle with that, well, are they right? Is that the only reason why I'm here? But for me, it was OK, so what do you do with these emotions? What do you do with these feelings? Do you internalize them in the sense that you kind of give them validation? Or do you kind of look at yourself and you say, I own my experience? I've worked just as hard, in a lot of cases harder than a lot of my peers just because of where I've come from and what the learning curve was before me. And I think that is what kind of keeps me motivated, keeps me going. KATZ: What was it like trying to find common ground with the people that you went to school with? Like, I come from a poor family, and suddenly I'm going to be going to school with people that think it's OK to major in dance. LATTIMORE: You're right (laughter). KATZ: And maybe it is. But from my standpoint, I could never imagine going to school for something that couldn't have a job at the end of it. LATTIMORE: You do deal with that, like your friends who have the money or don't think about it as much, about going out to eat every night or getting an Uber and just casually saying we'll all split it and you're not financially in the same place. There were times where I heard my classmates say they don't even know what financial aid is when we apply every year and my. . . KATZ: What? LATTIMORE: A few of my friends apply every year. Yeah. And I think for me, it was a struggle between OK, do I pretend? Or do I - you know, am I honest with my financial situation? And I found that by being honest, you create an opportunity to educate people, people who haven't thought about money in the same way that we have. KATZ: How did that work for you, by the way? How did you figure out what money looked like and how to balance school and work and trying to maintain some semblance of a social life? LATTIMORE: It was difficult. To be honest with you, you have to make compromises. I mean, for me, it was like, do I skip dinner and hang out and then go to work? Or do I balance everybody coming to dinner with me and walk me to work so we can talk for a few minutes? I just simply couldn't go to hang out with my friends every time they were getting together. And you just kind of have to do what you have to do. I mean, it's going to be some trial and error - at least it was for me - but you have to kind of find that balance. And it's OK to kind of struggle with that. And really try to find that equilibrium. Well, what do you - where do you see yourself or what do you want to be able to say to yourself looking back after you are successful, after you graduate from your four-year? What do you want to look back and tell yourself, I guess? KATZ: That I proved everyone wrong. That my high school guidance counselor who was telling me to go to a vocational school was wrong. That I went out, and I did it, and I made my name and proved that this was where I belonged and that this was what I wanted to do. And being able to look back on it from the end like, I made it.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. In the early 1980s, a couple of researchers wrote an article in The Atlantic that would have far-reaching consequences. The article introduced a new idea about crime and policing. It was called \"Broken Windows. \" The idea was simple - a broken window is a sign of a neglected community, and a neglected community is a place where crime can thrive. The researchers said, if police could fix the small problems, the big ones would disappear. BERNARD HARCOURT: So the broken windows theory was this magical solution that basically everybody could like. VEDANTAM: It quickly became seen as a panacea for crime. Today, we explore how ideas sometimes get away from those who invented them and then are taken to places that were never intended. HARCOURT: It's a beautiful story. And it's a myth. VEDANTAM: Our story begins in 1969. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: The psychologist Philip Zimbardo ran an interesting experiment. He abandoned two cars on the street - one in a mostly poor, crime-ridden section of the Bronx in New York City, and the other in an affluent neighborhood in Palo Alto, Calif. Both cars were left without license plates, parked with the hoods up. Within 10 minutes of leaving the car in the Bronx, passersby began taking things of value. The car was quickly stripped for parts. Then, the random destruction began. Windows was smashed. The car was destroyed. But for more than a week in Palo Alto, the other car remained untouched, until. . . GEORGE L KELLING: Zimbardo himself gave the car a smash with a sledgehammer. And once the car was damaged, it became fair game. VEDANTAM: This is George L. Kelling. He's a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. KELLING: In 1982, I co-authored an article called \"Broken Windows\" with James Q. Wilson. This article has gotten considerable attention in the policing and non-policing world. VEDANTAM: George was fascinated by what had happened in Palo Alto. Once the car was damaged, things played out exactly as they had in the Bronx. KELLING: The idea that, once disorder begins, it doesn't matter what the neighborhood is, things can begin to get out of control. VEDANTAM: George reasoned that the same thing might be true for communities as a whole. A broken window in a neighborhood sends the signal that the neighborhood is uncared for. So if police departments address the little crimes and misdemeanors that might create visible signs of disorder, maybe - just maybe - the bigger stuff wouldn't happen either. KELLING: Once you begin to deal with the small problems in neighborhoods you begin to empower those neighborhoods. And people claim their public spaces, and store owners extend their concerns to what happened on the streets. Residents control park spaces. Communities get strengthened once order is restored or maintained, and it is that dynamic that helps to prevent crime. VEDANTAM: This wasn't what many police departments were doing. Officers were focused on solving major crimes. George and his co-author suggested police departments ought to change their focus. They ought to clean up the streets, keep people from smoking pot in public, crack down on subway fare beaters. As it turned out, this was exactly what many communities wanted. KELLING: If right now we were to go to some neighborhood meeting about problems in the neighborhood, at least three and probably four of those will be problems of disorder. And that is youths taking over a park, prostitutes hustling fathers in front of their children, drug dealers hanging around corners. Those are the kinds of things that comprise a good share of the calls that come to police departments and the demand that's placed on police to do something about these problems. VEDANTAM: The argument came at an opportune time. HARCOURT: This was a period of high crime and high incarceration. And it seemed as if there was no way out of that dynamic, and it seemed as if there was no way out of just filling prisons as a way to address the crime problem. VEDANTAM: This is Bernard Harcourt, professor of law at Columbia University. As policymakers were scrambling for answers to crime, a new mayor in New York came to power offering a solution. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, the mayor of the city of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani. VEDANTAM: Rudy Giuliani won election in 1993, promising to reduce crime and clean up the streets. Very quickly, he adopted broken windows as his mantra. It was one of those rare ideas that appealed to people on both sides of the aisle. Conservatives liked the policy because it meant restoring order. And liberals liked it, Bernard says, because it seemed like an enlightened way to prevent crime. HARCOURT: All of a sudden, it seems as if, well, instead of, you know, throwing people in prison and cracking down, all you really had to do was just pick up the trash and get rid of a homeless person and - and fix an abandoned building - just these small forms of disorder that, of course, were, you know, pretty widespread in a city like New York. VEDANTAM: Rudy Giuliani and his new police commissioner, William Bratton, focused first on cleaning up the subway system. George Kelling again. KELLING: Here was a system that was entirely out of control. Ridership was dropping. Lawlessness reigned in the subway. And 250,000 people a day weren't paying their fare. VEDANTAM: The mayor and the police commissioner sent hundreds of police officers into the subway to crack down on turnstile jumpers and vandals. Very quickly, they found confirmation for their theory. Going after petty crime led the police to violent criminals. KELLING: In some station, it was found that as many as 1 in 10 people who were not paying the fare were either wanted on a warrant for a felony or were carrying an illegal weapon. Not all fare beaters were criminals, but a lot of criminals were fare beaters. It turns out that serious criminals are pretty busy. They commit minor offenses as well as major offenses. VEDANTAM: The policy was quickly scaled up from the subway system to the entire city of New York. Police ramped up misdemeanor arrests for things like smoking marijuana in public, spraying graffiti, selling loose cigarettes. Almost instantly, they were able to trumpet their success. Crime was falling. The murder rate plummeted. It seemed like a miracle. The media loved the story. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: At first, people laughed when he launched a politeness campaign. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: We begin with sociologist George Kelling and his ideas about how to reduce serious crime by restoring public order in communities. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: It's called broken windows - go after quality-of-life offenses to help reduce bigger crimes. VEDANTAM: George Kelling and another researcher found what they believed was clear evidence of the success of broken windows. In neighborhoods where there was a sharp increase in misdemeanor arrests, suggesting broken windows policing was in force, there was also a sharp decline in crime. By the time Rudy Giuliani was giving his farewell address at the end of 2001, broken windows had become one of his greatest accomplishments. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RUDY GIULIANI: The reality is that the model that was adopted for dealing with crime in New York City is the very, very best way to assure that you can keep a city safe. VEDANTAM: The mayor emphasized the beautiful and simple idea behind the success. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GIULIANI: The broken windows theory replaced the idea that we were too busy to pay attention to street-level prostitution, too busy to pay attention to panhandling, too busy to pay attention to graffiti. Well, you can't be too busy to pay attention to those things because those are the things that underlie the problems of crime that you have in your society. VEDANTAM: In less than a decade, New York was transformed. HARCOURT: That's right, yeah. Everything's going well. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HARCOURT: . . . If you're on the Upper East Side. VEDANTAM: Bernard Harcourt again. HARCOURT: Of course, it's going a lot less well if you're in other boroughs or in other neighborhoods where all of the policing and all the arrests are taking place. VEDANTAM: As broken windows policing was coming into force, some critics said it unfairly targeted communities of color. When we come back, we'll talk about this idea and a deeper problem. Broken windows may not have been quite the raging success we thought it was. HARCOURT: It's a very sugarcoated idea that, would it be true, it would be marvelous. VEDANTAM: Stay with us.

But right from the start, there were signs something was wrong with the beautiful narrative. HARCOURT: Crime was starting to go down in New York prior to the Giuliani election and prior to the implementation of broken windows policing. And of course, what we witnessed from that period - and it's basically from about '91 that crime in the country starts going down - is a remarkable, remarkable drop in violent crime in this country. Now, what's so remarkable about it is how widespread it was. VEDANTAM: So widespread, in fact, that crime dropped not only in New York, but in many other cities where nothing like broken windows policing was in place. In fact, crime even fell in parts of the country where police departments were mired in corruption scandals and largely seen as dysfunctional. HARCOURT: Los Angeles was wracked with terrible policing problems during the whole time. In fact, the period is kind of bookended on one side by the Rodney King scandal and, on the other side, by the Rampart scandal. In between the two, the LAPD is pretty much dysfunctional. And despite the fact that the LAPD isn't doing anything, basically - I mean, it's - and it's certainly not doing broken windows policing - crime drops as much in Los Angeles as it does in New York. VEDANTAM: How could this be? Well, there are many theories. Some attribute the nationwide drop in crime to the growing economy, the end of the crack cocaine epidemic, even environmental factors. Some criminologists credit harsher sentencing guidelines. In 2006, Bernard Harcourt reviewed the study George Kelling had conducted in 2001. The earlier study had powerfully made the case that broken windows policing worked. It found that the areas that saw the largest number of misdemeanor arrests also had the biggest drops in violent crime. HARCOURT: But it turned out that, actually, he had failed to include in his study a very common explanation, which is called a reversion to the mean. And it's something that's well known in the stock market. But basically, the idea is, you know, if something goes up a lot, it tends to go down a lot. VEDANTAM: A graph in George Kelling's 2001 paper is revealing. It shows the crime rate falling dramatically in the early 1990s, but this window of time gives us a selective picture. Right before this decline came a spike in crime. And if you go further back, you'll see a series of spikes and declines. And each time, the bigger a spike, the bigger the decline that follows, as crime reverts to the mean. George Kelling acknowledges that broken windows may not have had a dramatic effect on crime, but he still thinks it has value. KELLING: Even if broken windows did not have a substantial impact on crime, order is an end in itself in a cosmopolitan, diverse world. Strangers have to feel comfortable moving through communities for those communities to thrive. Order is an end in itself, and it doesn't need the justification of serious crime. VEDANTAM: But it's worth noting that this was not the premise on which the theory was sold. Broken windows policing was advertised as an innovative way to control violent crime, not just a way to get panhandlers and prostitutes off the streets. There was also another big problem with broken windows. Here's Bernard Harcourt again. HARCOURT: We immediately saw an increase - a sharp increase - in complaints of police misconduct. And that's actually one of the most interesting things about the period, really, from 1993 to '96, for instance, when Giuliani is implementing the quality-of-life initiative. We always associate it with greater order because crime dropped 60 percent, but complaints of police misconduct increased by 60 percent. And so you might wonder, well, actually, was it a period of greater order, or was it a period of greater disorder? And, of course, this reflects the fact that the notion of orderliness is itself constructed by us and by what we focus on. But if you focus on police-civilian relations, starting in 1993, what you're going to see is a tremendous amount of disorder that erupts as a result of broken windows policing with complaints skyrocketing, with settlements of police misconduct cases skyrocketing and, of course, with incidents - brutal incidents - all of a sudden happening at a faster and faster clip. VEDANTAM: The problem intensified with a new practice that grew out of broken windows. It was called stop-and-frisk. It was embraced in New York City after Mayor Michael Bloomberg won election in 2001. If broken windows meant arresting people for misdemeanors in hopes of preventing more serious crimes, stop-and-frisk said, why even wait for the misdemeanor? Why not go ahead and stop, question, search, anyone who looked suspicious? HARCOURT: Once Bloomberg became mayor, he turned from a policy of high misdemeanor arrests to a policy of stop-and-frisk. They substitute for each other because both of them provide something to the police that the police feels is necessary, which is to be able to come up to an individual, ask them questions, do some kind of a search, whether it's a pat-down or a full search upon arrest, possibly do a records check, check for warrants, et cetera. And so what it does is it gets a lot more information to the police. You make more informants. You can get fingerprints. And those things are - from a policing perspective, those things are always going to be useful. VEDANTAM: There were high-profile cases where misdemeanor arrests or stopping and questioning did lead to information that helped solve much more serious crimes, even homicides. But there were many, many more cases where the police stops turned up nothing. In 2008, police made nearly 250,000 stops in New York for what they called furtive movements. The police did find guns during these stops, but the numbers might surprise you. Only one-fifteenth of 1 percent turned up a gun. Even more problematic - in order to be able to go after disorder, you have to be able to define it. Is it a trash bag covering a broken window, teenagers on a street corner playing music too loudly? In Chicago, the researchers Robert Sampson and Steven Roudenbush analyzed what makes people perceive social disorder. They found that if two neighborhoods had exactly the same amount of graffiti and litter and loitering, people saw more disorder, more broken in windows in neighborhoods with more African-Americans. JAMAL JOHNSON: It was, I think, a Wednesday or Thursday night. I was coming home from dinner with a friend. VEDANTAM: This is Jamal Johnson (ph). He's African-American, 40 years old. JOHNSON: I'd noticed an increased police presence in the neighborhood because after we'd had dinner, we literally came across something like nine or 10 different cops in about a three-block radius. VEDANTAM: Jamal was walking with his friend, but eventually the two split off. JOHNSON: And as I was walking down the street, I noticed the cops looking at us but not really - not really paying us much attention after an initial sort of scan. And then, as I rounded the corner to my block, there was a police officer on the corner. And at that stage, I was by myself and, of course, at that stage, I got stopped. VEDANTAM: Jamal was carrying a small utility knife. He was a filmmaker and it came in handy on set. JOHNSON: I had come from a day of work, and I was working on a photo shoot. And a police officer noticed that I'd had my - my work knife, which I know to be street legal, which he sort of asked me to take out and show to him. And then he asked me for my ID. He then called - he called into dispatch once - once he'd have my ID. He asked me some basic questions about where I lived, what my job was, what I was doing with my evening and so forth. And when he couldn't reach dispatch, he then started to take down my information, at which stage I said to him, please don't put me in the system. You know, you know that I live right here. And you also know that my knife - my knife is legal. At which point he said that the knife wasn't, in fact, legal. And then he asked me if I wanted to - if I preferred to go to jail, to which I said, I think you can understand why I wouldn't like to be in the system. I also think you know that I don't want to go to jail tonight, at which point he said, well, don't give me a hard time. My response was, excuse me, sir (laughter), I certainly didn't mean to do that; thank you (laughter) - at which stage he took down my info, told me not to have my knife on me again and then - and then let me go home with a sort of a sour look. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)JOHNSON: I think it's worse than humiliation to me because it's not personal. And, to me, that's worse because, when your society can detain you, won't let you speak to them, you know, like, in the sense that the guy said, you know, since you - why are you talking back to me? When - when that becomes your relationship with your society, that means that your life or - or at the very least, like, your livelihood - like, you getting to and from work - is at question. So I don't really necessarily need to feel huge - huge moments of pride from every - from every interaction I have with the police, but I certainly need to feel that - that my life or - or even - or even my evening and my - and my police record isn't in danger just arbitrarily. So that - that feeling of and impersonal, not-friendly government standing over you is pretty terrible. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: George Kelling is not an advocate of stop-and-frisk. In fact, all the way back in 1982, he foresaw the possibility that giving police wide discretion could lead to abuse. In our interview, I read him a passage from that article that has proven to be prescient. (Reading) We might agree that certain behavior makes one person more undesirable than another, but how do we ensure that age or skin color or national origin or harmless mannerisms will not also become the basis for distinguishing the undesirable from the desirable? How do we ensure, in short, that the police do not become the agents of neighborhood bigotry? We can offer no wholly satisfactory answer to this important question. KELLING: Yeah, that's a loaded - that's a loaded statement. And it's something that I've struggled with. VEDANTAM: In August of 2013, a federal district court found that New York's stop-and-frisk policy was unconstitutional because of the way it singled out young black and Hispanic men. Later that year, New York elected its first liberal mayor in 20 years. Bill de Blasio celebrated the end of stop-and-frisk.

(APPLAUSE)DE BLASIO: We're all hungry for an approach that acknowledges we are stronger and safer as a city when police and residents work hand-in-hand. VEDANTAM: But he did not do away with broken windows. In fact, he reappointed Rudy Giuliani's police commissioner, Bill Bratton. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DE BLASIO: It is a great day for New York City because I'm proud to announce that I'm appointing Bill Bratton as the next police commissioner of the city of New York. VEDANTAM: Just seven months after taking over again as the head of New York's police department, Bill Bratton's use of broken windows tactics came under fresh scrutiny.

VEDANTAM: In this video, shot on a bystander's cellphone on a sunny July day in New York City in 2014, a man is standing on the sidewalk between two police officers. Several more officers are just outside of the frame. The cops are asking the man whether he was selling loose cigarettes - a misdemeanor. The man is visibly and audibly upset. This is not the first time he has been questioned by police. And then the officers tackle him. They bring him to the ground why restraining him with a chokehold - a practice that is banned in New York City. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: Put your hands behind your back. GARNER: I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. VEDANTAM: The man in the video is Eric Garner. He's African-American, and his name has become synonymous with the growing distrust between police and African-American communities. He died not long after the interaction you just heard. Commissioner Bill Bratton found himself under fire from the media not only about Eric Garner's death, but the entire philosophy of broken windows. Here he is talking with CBS News anchor Maurice Dubois in 2014. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAURICE DUBOIS: Commissioner, critics are blaming your broken windows policy. It's been hailed all around the world as successful - going after low-level crimes before big ones happen, OK? So in this case, many people are upset, however, because they feel it's targeting communities of color. How do you respond to that? BILL BRATTON: We are not targeting communities of color. We are targeting behavior. And the behavior is. . . VEDANTAM: For George Kelling, this was not the end that he had hoped for. As a researcher, he's one of the few whose ideas have left the academy and spread like wildfire. But once politicians and the media fell in love with his idea, they took it to places that he never intended and could not control. KELLING: When, during the 1990s, broken windows was a hot-ticket item, I would occasionally read in a newspaper something like, new chief comes in and says, I just read \"Broken Windows,\" and I'm going to implement broken windows tomorrow. I won't repeat the magic words that go through my mind because we're on the air, but I would listen to that with dismay. VEDANTAM: Dismay because he worried that many officials were so enamored with the simplicity of the broken windows metaphor that they were not willing to stop and think about the nuances. He worried that officers who hadn't received enough training were being asked to exercise discretion and make complex judgments under very high pressure. KELLING: And so do I worry about the implementation about broken windows? A whole lot. Yes, I worry about the implementation of order maintenance because it can be done very badly. It's to the point now where I - I wonder if we should back away from the metaphor of broken windows. Broken windows was a powerful metaphor. Jim and I used it. We didn't know how powerful it was going to be. It - it's simplified. It was easy to communicate. A lot of people got it as a result of the metaphor. It was attractive, and it carried - and it carried us for a long time. But as you know, metaphors can wear out and become stale. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: These days, the consensus among social scientists is that broken windows likely did have modest effects on crime, but few believe it caused the 60 or 70-percent decline in violent crime that it's often credited with. Despite all the evidence, broken windows continues to be popular. Bernard Harcourt says there's a reason for that. HARCOURT: It's a simple story that people can latch onto and that then is a lot more pleasant to live with than the complexities of life. The fact is that crime dropped in America dramatically from the 1990s and that there aren't really good, clean nationwide explanations for it. VEDANTAM: The story of broken windows is a story of our fascination with easy fixes and seductive theories.

In the early 1980s, a couple of researchers wrote an article in The Atlantic that would have far-reaching consequences. The article introduced a new idea about crime and policing. It was called \"Broken Windows. \" The idea was simple - a broken window is a sign of a neglected community, and a neglected community is a place where crime can thrive. The researchers said, if police could fix the small problems, the big ones would disappear. BERNARD HARCOURT: So the broken windows theory was this magical solution that basically everybody could like. VEDANTAM: It quickly became seen as a panacea for crime. Today, we explore how ideas sometimes get away from those who invented them and then are taken to places that were never intended. HARCOURT: It's a beautiful story. And it's a myth. VEDANTAM: Our story begins in 1969. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: The psychologist Philip Zimbardo ran an interesting experiment. He abandoned two cars on the street - one in a mostly poor, crime-ridden section of the Bronx in New York City, and the other in an affluent neighborhood in Palo Alto, Calif. Both cars were left without license plates, parked with the hoods up. Within 10 minutes of leaving the car in the Bronx, passersby began taking things of value. The car was quickly stripped for parts. Then, the random destruction began. Windows was smashed. The car was destroyed. But for more than a week in Palo Alto, the other car remained untouched, until. . . GEORGE L KELLING: Zimbardo himself gave the car a smash with a sledgehammer. And once the car was damaged, it became fair game. VEDANTAM: This is George L. Kelling. He's a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. KELLING: In 1982, I co-authored an article called \"Broken Windows\" with James Q. Wilson. This article has gotten considerable attention in the policing and non-policing world. VEDANTAM: George was fascinated by what had happened in Palo Alto. Once the car was damaged, things played out exactly as they had in the Bronx. KELLING: The idea that, once disorder begins, it doesn't matter what the neighborhood is, things can begin to get out of control. VEDANTAM: George reasoned that the same thing might be true for communities as a whole. A broken window in a neighborhood sends the signal that the neighborhood is uncared for. So if police departments address the little crimes and misdemeanors that might create visible signs of disorder, maybe - just maybe - the bigger stuff wouldn't happen either. KELLING: Once you begin to deal with the small problems in neighborhoods you begin to empower those neighborhoods. And people claim their public spaces, and store owners extend their concerns to what happened on the streets. Residents control park spaces. Communities get strengthened once order is restored or maintained, and it is that dynamic that helps to prevent crime. VEDANTAM: This wasn't what many police departments were doing. Officers were focused on solving major crimes. George and his co-author suggested police departments ought to change their focus. They ought to clean up the streets, keep people from smoking pot in public, crack down on subway fare beaters. As it turned out, this was exactly what many communities wanted. KELLING: If right now we were to go to some neighborhood meeting about problems in the neighborhood, at least three and probably four of those will be problems of disorder. And that is youths taking over a park, prostitutes hustling fathers in front of their children, drug dealers hanging around corners. Those are the kinds of things that comprise a good share of the calls that come to police departments and the demand that's placed on police to do something about these problems. VEDANTAM: The argument came at an opportune time. HARCOURT: This was a period of high crime and high incarceration. And it seemed as if there was no way out of that dynamic, and it seemed as if there was no way out of just filling prisons as a way to address the crime problem. VEDANTAM: This is Bernard Harcourt, professor of law at Columbia University. As policymakers were scrambling for answers to crime, a new mayor in New York came to power offering a solution. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, the mayor of the city of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani. VEDANTAM: Rudy Giuliani won election in 1993, promising to reduce crime and clean up the streets. Very quickly, he adopted broken windows as his mantra. It was one of those rare ideas that appealed to people on both sides of the aisle. Conservatives liked the policy because it meant restoring order. And liberals liked it, Bernard says, because it seemed like an enlightened way to prevent crime. HARCOURT: All of a sudden, it seems as if, well, instead of, you know, throwing people in prison and cracking down, all you really had to do was just pick up the trash and get rid of a homeless person and - and fix an abandoned building - just these small forms of disorder that, of course, were, you know, pretty widespread in a city like New York. VEDANTAM: Rudy Giuliani and his new police commissioner, William Bratton, focused first on cleaning up the subway system. George Kelling again. KELLING: Here was a system that was entirely out of control. Ridership was dropping. Lawlessness reigned in the subway. And 250,000 people a day weren't paying their fare. VEDANTAM: The mayor and the police commissioner sent hundreds of police officers into the subway to crack down on turnstile jumpers and vandals. Very quickly, they found confirmation for their theory. Going after petty crime led the police to violent criminals. KELLING: In some station, it was found that as many as 1 in 10 people who were not paying the fare were either wanted on a warrant for a felony or were carrying an illegal weapon. Not all fare beaters were criminals, but a lot of criminals were fare beaters. It turns out that serious criminals are pretty busy. They commit minor offenses as well as major offenses. VEDANTAM: The policy was quickly scaled up from the subway system to the entire city of New York. Police ramped up misdemeanor arrests for things like smoking marijuana in public, spraying graffiti, selling loose cigarettes. Almost instantly, they were able to trumpet their success. Crime was falling. The murder rate plummeted. It seemed like a miracle. The media loved the story. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: At first, people laughed when he launched a politeness campaign. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: We begin with sociologist George Kelling and his ideas about how to reduce serious crime by restoring public order in communities. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: It's called broken windows - go after quality-of-life offenses to help reduce bigger crimes. VEDANTAM: George Kelling and another researcher found what they believed was clear evidence of the success of broken windows. In neighborhoods where there was a sharp increase in misdemeanor arrests, suggesting broken windows policing was in force, there was also a sharp decline in crime. By the time Rudy Giuliani was giving his farewell address at the end of 2001, broken windows had become one of his greatest accomplishments. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RUDY GIULIANI: The reality is that the model that was adopted for dealing with crime in New York City is the very, very best way to assure that you can keep a city safe. VEDANTAM: The mayor emphasized the beautiful and simple idea behind the success. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GIULIANI: The broken windows theory replaced the idea that we were too busy to pay attention to street-level prostitution, too busy to pay attention to panhandling, too busy to pay attention to graffiti. Well, you can't be too busy to pay attention to those things because those are the things that underlie the problems of crime that you have in your society. VEDANTAM: In less than a decade, New York was transformed. HARCOURT: That's right, yeah. Everything's going well. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HARCOURT: . . . If you're on the Upper East Side. VEDANTAM: Bernard Harcourt again. HARCOURT: Of course, it's going a lot less well if you're in other boroughs or in other neighborhoods where all of the policing and all the arrests are taking place. VEDANTAM: As broken windows policing was coming into force, some critics said it unfairly targeted communities of color. When we come back, we'll talk about this idea and a deeper problem. Broken windows may not have been quite the raging success we thought it was. HARCOURT: It's a very sugarcoated idea that, would it be true, it would be marvelous. VEDANTAM: Stay with us.

But right from the start, there were signs something was wrong with the beautiful narrative. HARCOURT: Crime was starting to go down in New York prior to the Giuliani election and prior to the implementation of broken windows policing. And of course, what we witnessed from that period - and it's basically from about '91 that crime in the country starts going down - is a remarkable, remarkable drop in violent crime in this country. Now, what's so remarkable about it is how widespread it was. VEDANTAM: So widespread, in fact, that crime dropped not only in New York, but in many other cities where nothing like broken windows policing was in place. In fact, crime even fell in parts of the country where police departments were mired in corruption scandals and largely seen as dysfunctional. HARCOURT: Los Angeles was wracked with terrible policing problems during the whole time. In fact, the period is kind of bookended on one side by the Rodney King scandal and, on the other side, by the Rampart scandal. In between the two, the LAPD is pretty much dysfunctional. And despite the fact that the LAPD isn't doing anything, basically - I mean, it's - and it's certainly not doing broken windows policing - crime drops as much in Los Angeles as it does in New York. VEDANTAM: How could this be? Well, there are many theories. Some attribute the nationwide drop in crime to the growing economy, the end of the crack cocaine epidemic, even environmental factors. Some criminologists credit harsher sentencing guidelines. In 2006, Bernard Harcourt reviewed the study George Kelling had conducted in 2001. The earlier study had powerfully made the case that broken windows policing worked. It found that the areas that saw the largest number of misdemeanor arrests also had the biggest drops in violent crime. HARCOURT: But it turned out that, actually, he had failed to include in his study a very common explanation, which is called a reversion to the mean. And it's something that's well known in the stock market. But basically, the idea is, you know, if something goes up a lot, it tends to go down a lot. VEDANTAM: A graph in George Kelling's 2001 paper is revealing. It shows the crime rate falling dramatically in the early 1990s, but this window of time gives us a selective picture. Right before this decline came a spike in crime. And if you go further back, you'll see a series of spikes and declines. And each time, the bigger a spike, the bigger the decline that follows, as crime reverts to the mean. George Kelling acknowledges that broken windows may not have had a dramatic effect on crime, but he still thinks it has value. KELLING: Even if broken windows did not have a substantial impact on crime, order is an end in itself in a cosmopolitan, diverse world. Strangers have to feel comfortable moving through communities for those communities to thrive. Order is an end in itself, and it doesn't need the justification of serious crime. VEDANTAM: But it's worth noting that this was not the premise on which the theory was sold. Broken windows policing was advertised as an innovative way to control violent crime, not just a way to get panhandlers and prostitutes off the streets. There was also another big problem with broken windows. Here's Bernard Harcourt again. HARCOURT: We immediately saw an increase - a sharp increase - in complaints of police misconduct. And that's actually one of the most interesting things about the period, really, from 1993 to '96, for instance, when Giuliani is implementing the quality-of-life initiative. We always associate it with greater order because crime dropped 60 percent, but complaints of police misconduct increased by 60 percent. And so you might wonder, well, actually, was it a period of greater order, or was it a period of greater disorder? And, of course, this reflects the fact that the notion of orderliness is itself constructed by us and by what we focus on. But if you focus on police-civilian relations, starting in 1993, what you're going to see is a tremendous amount of disorder that erupts as a result of broken windows policing with complaints skyrocketing, with settlements of police misconduct cases skyrocketing and, of course, with incidents - brutal incidents - all of a sudden happening at a faster and faster clip. VEDANTAM: The problem intensified with a new practice that grew out of broken windows. It was called stop-and-frisk. It was embraced in New York City after Mayor Michael Bloomberg won election in 2001. If broken windows meant arresting people for misdemeanors in hopes of preventing more serious crimes, stop-and-frisk said, why even wait for the misdemeanor? Why not go ahead and stop, question, search, anyone who looked suspicious? HARCOURT: Once Bloomberg became mayor, he turned from a policy of high misdemeanor arrests to a policy of stop-and-frisk. They substitute for each other because both of them provide something to the police that the police feels is necessary, which is to be able to come up to an individual, ask them questions, do some kind of a search, whether it's a pat-down or a full search upon arrest, possibly do a records check, check for warrants, et cetera. And so what it does is it gets a lot more information to the police. You make more informants. You can get fingerprints. And those things are - from a policing perspective, those things are always going to be useful. VEDANTAM: There were high-profile cases where misdemeanor arrests or stopping and questioning did lead to information that helped solve much more serious crimes, even homicides. But there were many, many more cases where the police stops turned up nothing. In 2008, police made nearly 250,000 stops in New York for what they called furtive movements. The police did find guns during these stops, but the numbers might surprise you. Only one-fifteenth of 1 percent turned up a gun. Even more problematic - in order to be able to go after disorder, you have to be able to define it. Is it a trash bag covering a broken window, teenagers on a street corner playing music too loudly? In Chicago, the researchers Robert Sampson and Steven Roudenbush analyzed what makes people perceive social disorder. They found that if two neighborhoods had exactly the same amount of graffiti and litter and loitering, people saw more disorder, more broken in windows in neighborhoods with more African-Americans. JAMAL JOHNSON: It was, I think, a Wednesday or Thursday night. I was coming home from dinner with a friend. VEDANTAM: This is Jamal Johnson (ph). He's African-American, 40 years old. JOHNSON: I'd noticed an increased police presence in the neighborhood because after we'd had dinner, we literally came across something like nine or 10 different cops in about a three-block radius. VEDANTAM: Jamal was walking with his friend, but eventually the two split off. JOHNSON: And as I was walking down the street, I noticed the cops looking at us but not really - not really paying us much attention after an initial sort of scan. And then, as I rounded the corner to my block, there was a police officer on the corner. And at that stage, I was by myself and, of course, at that stage, I got stopped. VEDANTAM: Jamal was carrying a small utility knife. He was a filmmaker and it came in handy on set. JOHNSON: I had come from a day of work, and I was working on a photo shoot. And a police officer noticed that I'd had my - my work knife, which I know to be street legal, which he sort of asked me to take out and show to him. And then he asked me for my ID. He then called - he called into dispatch once - once he'd have my ID. He asked me some basic questions about where I lived, what my job was, what I was doing with my evening and so forth. And when he couldn't reach dispatch, he then started to take down my information, at which stage I said to him, please don't put me in the system. You know, you know that I live right here. And you also know that my knife - my knife is legal. At which point he said that the knife wasn't, in fact, legal. And then he asked me if I wanted to - if I preferred to go to jail, to which I said, I think you can understand why I wouldn't like to be in the system. I also think you know that I don't want to go to jail tonight, at which point he said, well, don't give me a hard time. My response was, excuse me, sir (laughter), I certainly didn't mean to do that; thank you (laughter) - at which stage he took down my info, told me not to have my knife on me again and then - and then let me go home with a sort of a sour look. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) JOHNSON: I think it's worse than humiliation to me because it's not personal. And, to me, that's worse because, when your society can detain you, won't let you speak to them, you know, like, in the sense that the guy said, you know, since you - why are you talking back to me? When - when that becomes your relationship with your society, that means that your life or - or at the very least, like, your livelihood - like, you getting to and from work - is at question. So I don't really necessarily need to feel huge - huge moments of pride from every - from every interaction I have with the police, but I certainly need to feel that - that my life or - or even - or even my evening and my - and my police record isn't in danger just arbitrarily. So that - that feeling of and impersonal, not-friendly government standing over you is pretty terrible. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: George Kelling is not an advocate of stop-and-frisk. In fact, all the way back in 1982, he foresaw the possibility that giving police wide discretion could lead to abuse. In our interview, I read him a passage from that article that has proven to be prescient. (Reading) We might agree that certain behavior makes one person more undesirable than another, but how do we ensure that age or skin color or national origin or harmless mannerisms will not also become the basis for distinguishing the undesirable from the desirable? How do we ensure, in short, that the police do not become the agents of neighborhood bigotry? We can offer no wholly satisfactory answer to this important question.

It's basically why democracy is messy because everyone can say I'm right and you're wrong. JULIA GALEF: Yeah. If they're in an argument with someone else, they're generally not thinking pensively about the extent to which the other person is right.

So the question is why is our instinct to just defend our own viewpoints and attack other people's viewpoints instead of trying to examine questions objectively?

And this is part of what makes it hard for people to cognitively empathize with how someone else could believe something without being a totally insane, deluded or evil person. And it's also what makes it hard for people to change their minds. RAZ: And there's actually a name for this idea that our biases can make us believe things that are objectively false. That idea is called motivated reasoning. And Julia argues that that kind of thinking can actually be incredibly destructive, for example, the case of Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer in the French army who was falsely convicted of treason. Julia picks up the story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GALEF: So I'm going to take you back to 19th century France, where officers in the French General Staff discovered that someone in their ranks had been selling military secrets to Germany. Their suspicions quickly converged on Dreyfus. He had a sterling record, no past history of wrongdoing, no motive as far as they could tell. But Dreyfus was the only Jewish officer at that rank in the army. And unfortunately, at this time, the French army was highly anti-Semitic. They went and searched Dreyfus's apartment looking for any signs of espionage, and they didn't find anything. And this just convinced them more that Dreyfus was not only guilty but sneaky as well because clearly he had hidden all of the evidence before they had managed to get to it. And they sentenced him to life imprisonment on the aptly named Devil's Island. So there he went, and there he spent his days writing letters and letters to the French government begging them to reopen his case so they could discover his innocence. But for the most part, friends consider the matter closed. This is a case of what scientists call motivated reasoning. It's this phenomenon in which our unconscious motivations, our desires and fears shape the way we interpret information. So some information, some ideas feel like our allies, and we want - we want them to win. We want to defend them. And other information or ideas are the enemy, and we want to shoot them down. So this is why I call motivated reasoning soldier mindset. Our judgment is just strongly influenced unconsciously by which side we want to win. And this is ubiquitous. This shapes how we decide how to vote, what we consider fair or ethical. And what's most scary to me about motivated reasoning or soldier mindset is how unconscious it is. We can think we're being objective and fair-minded and still wind up ruining the life of an innocent man. RAZ: Yeah. I mean, it's interesting because, you know, sometimes we cannot accept that a person that disagrees with us can be right about anything. I mean, you look at an election, for example - right? - and you see a candidate that you disagree with and, you know, you can't accept that what they say is true. GALEF: I think what's going on when people refuse to acknowledge even minor points on which the opposing candidate is correct, part of what's going on there is that we have this instinctive model where if we allow that a single piece of evidence contradicts our worldview, we are obliged to instantly change our mind about this really important topic. Like, if I acknowledge that Trump was right about this one particular point, then I'm sort of forced to acknowledge, oh, well, maybe he is actually a truth teller and maybe Hillary is crooked and maybe Trump should win. And that kind of change feels an absurdly large response to this, you know, piece of evidence. And so given that we feel like our choices are either acknowledge he's correct about this and then, you know, update our model entirely or find some reason to dismiss him as wrong, we opt for the latter because, you know, the former just seems so absurd. And it is absurd. You shouldn't change your mind about a huge topic just based on one additional small piece of evidence. But you have to you have to allow the possibility of that happening at some point by acknowledging when little bits of evidence contradict your worldview. RAZ: OK, so let's go back to the story of Alfred Dreyfus, who most everyone thought was guilty, except for one man, Colonel George Picquart. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GALEF: He's another high-ranking officer in the French army. Like most people in the army, he was at least casually anti-Semitic. But Picquart began to suspect what if we're all wrong about Dreyfus? And what happened was that he had discovered evidence that the spying for Germany had continued even after Dreyfus was in prison. Eventually, Georges Picquart managed to get Dreyfus exonerated, but it took him 10 years. A lot of people feel like Picquart can't really be the hero of this story because he was an anti-Semite and that's bad, which I agree with. But personally, for me, the fact that Picquart was anti-Semitic actually makes his actions more admirable because he had the same prejudices as his fellow officers. But his motivation to find the truth and uphold it just trumped all of that. Picquart is a poster child for what I call scout mindset. It's the drive not to make one idea win or another lose but just to see what's really there. Scouts are curious. They think it's virtuous to test your own beliefs, and they're less likely to say that someone who changes his mind seems weak. RAZ: OK. So basically, Scout mindset - it's kind of like the best version of ourselves. GALEF: Absolutely. It's not always the most natural way to approach an issue, especially an emotionally charged one. But I think, to the extent that our civilization has made progress - especially moral progress - it's been because there are people who are able to to see things through scout mindset. That's what allows us to revise our model of how the world works so that the things that we're trying to do for the world are actually more likely to be good and not bad. RAZ: All right. All right. So I'm going to make a confession here, Julia, which I think is probably self-evident if you've heard some of this this episode. But I actually believe in democracy, right? Like, I think it's a pretty good system. So I'm open, you know, to having my mind changed about a lot of things. But if I met somebody who said, you know, democracy is horrible and it's a terrible system, I don't think they're going to change my mind about that. GALEF: Yeah. I mean, when two people have really different perspectives, I think the most productive thing to do is to try to look for the crux of the disagreement, where the crux is some underlying assumption or empirical question about the world that, you know, if you found out you were wrong about that, would actually change your mind about the broader question, which, in this case is, you know, is democracy the best system? And, you know, do the thought experiments of - OK, let's say I found out that, you know, 10 years from now, the average happiness level in China was higher than the U. S. and people were well-off and, you know, etc. , etc. , then would that budge my opinion of the usefulness of democracy? If not, then, you know, you try another thought experiment, etc. And this does not mean that you're always going to end up agreeing with each other at the end of the conversation. But at the very least, both people end up with a much fuller and more fleshed out model of how the other person is thinking. And I think that is progress. RAZ: Julia Galef - she's co-founder of the Center for Applied Rationality. You can check out her full talk at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz, and on today's show, democracy on trial. And one of the things about democracy is that everyone gets a voice. It's basically why democracy is messy because everyone can say I'm right and you're wrong. JULIA GALEF: Yeah. If they're in an argument with someone else, they're generally not thinking pensively about the extent to which the other person is right. They're reflexively reaching for whatever rebuttals they can find to throw at the other person. So the question is why is our instinct to just defend our own viewpoints and attack other people's viewpoints instead of trying to examine questions objectively? RAZ: This, by the way, is Julia Galef. She's a scholar who studies why it's so hard for people to see things from someone else's perspective. GALEF: It's easy for me to look at someone else's perspective and say that's ridiculous. I just don't understand how anyone could possibly think, you know, there's a giant conspiracy to cover up the truth about global warming. . . RAZ: Yeah. GALEF: . . . That it's all a hoax or. . . RAZ: Right. GALEF: . . . Something. That seems very ludicrous to me. But you can't just evaluate how reasonable that belief is in isolation.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"DOCTOR STRANGE\")TILDA SWINTON: (As The Ancient One) Doctor Strange, you think you know how the world works. What if I told you, through the mystic arts, we harness energy and shape reality? SHAPIRO: And while many people might have gone to see Tilda Swinton there or Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange or perhaps the gravity-bending visual effects, I went to see it for the influence of NPR astrophysicist and blogger Adam Frank. How you doing, Adam? ADAM FRANK: Great to be here again, Ari. SHAPIRO: So you were hired on to this movie to advise them on the science of what exactly? FRANK: It was both the science and the philosophy as well. I know the director from, you know, a few years back. My first book was on science and religion. And the director, Scott Derrickson, is a theist who also has great respect for science. I am a atheist who has great interest in the realms of human spiritual endeavor. So we've been having this conversation for years about where the two overlap or don't overlap. And when he was tapped for this movie, one of the things he wanted me to come in was - and discuss this, these issues of where the two do or don't overlap. SHAPIRO: There is a scene where Tilda Swinton's character, who is known as The Ancient One, sort of knocks Benedict Cumberbatch's character, Doctor Strange, out of his body. Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"DOCTOR STRANGE\")BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH: (As Dr. Stephen Strange) There is no such thing as spirit. We are made of matter and nothing more. It's just another tiny momentary speck within an indifferent universe. SHAPIRO: And that sound was Benedict Cumberbatch's character being knocked out of his body. FRANK: (Laughter). SHAPIRO: What kind of science advice do you give them on a scene like that? FRANK: A lot of the discussions we had was - with the director and the writer was how to actually do that. And for me, the place narratively where you can do that is the idea, the question of the nature of consciousness. Because we don't really have a scientific theory of consciousness. We're doing great with neuroscience but, you know, this vivid first-person intimacy of our own experience, we don't have a science for that yet. And for me that was a great place to ground what you might want to do with \"Doctor Strange's\" story. SHAPIRO: So you're saying we can explore this question because scientists don't really know what the spirit per se is on a scientific level? FRANK: Well, spirit is a, you know, delicate word. It's not one I'm, as a scientist, necessarily going to buy into. You know, there's a lot of astral travelling in the movie. That's not something I'm going to buy into, either. But the deepest question here is one that philosophers and scientists are really struggling with. And it's related to a term called reductionism. Right? Are you and all of your hopes and fears and dreams and experiences - the rich experiences you have, you know, when you have a wonderful meal, is that just neurons? Is that just, like, machinery in your brain? And, you know, the neurons are of course just atoms. And the atoms are just quarks. So, you know, is everything - can everything just be reduced down to the behavior of the smallest particles and their laws? And I started out as a reductionist, many physicists do. But as time has gone on, I kind of feel that like, you know, science is going to have to - may have to add things to the account of the world to deal with consciousness. SHAPIRO: There is a concept that is central to this movie, which I've heard scientists talk about before - the multiverse. Let's listen to a little bit of this. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"DOCTOR STRANGE\")SWINTON: (As The Ancient One) You think that this material universe is all there is. But what if I told you the reality you know is one of many? SHAPIRO: As I've heard it described - and tell me if I'm wrong - the idea of the multiverse is that with an infinite number of universes, there is one in which I'm wearing a blue shirt today and one in which I'm wearing a red shirt today and one on which I was sick to work today and every possible thing that could have happened at any given moment is represented in a different universe. Is that right? FRANK: Yeah, exactly. I mean, that's - there is - it's interesting. Physics has a number of different versions of the multiverse. One comes out of cosmology and the big bang. And that's one - that's the one where each different universe has entirely different laws. But from quantum mechanics, which is the theory of the very small which has enormous interesting philosophical questions around it, there is the possibility that every time a quantum event happens, every time an atom radioactively decays, the universe splits into multiple parallel versions of itself. And that goes on and on and on. So, yeah, there's one universe this morning where you put on blue socks rather than black socks.

S. presidential campaign - tumultuous, divisive, vulgar. Over the past few weeks, we've tried to offer insight into some of the deeper issues underlying all the rancor. We've looked at the hidden frames that shape our political views. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)GEORGE LAKOFF: If you have two different views of the nation, you may have two different views of the family. VEDANTAM: . . . And examine the biases that women face when they seek higher office. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)CAROL MOSELEY BRAUN: I came home that night. I was so upset and demeaned - to use the word - that I thought, OK, that's it. I can't take this anymore. I'm going to quit. VEDANTAM: We've also talked about topics that have surfaced over and over again in the election. Topics like immigration, income inequality and stop-and-frisk policing. Today, we'll conclude our series with a favorite episode from our archives. It's about an issue that didn't get much attention during the election, but will surely confront the next administration - climate change. (SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Last year, my family and I took a vacation to Alaska. This was a much needed, long-planned break. The best part? I got to walk on the top of a glacier. The pale blue ice was translucent. Sharp ridges opened up into crevices dozens of feet deep. Every geological feature, every hill, every valley was sculpted in ice. It was a sunny day and I spotted a small stream of melted water. I got on the ground and drank some. I wondered how long this water had remained frozen. The little stream is not the only ice that's melting in Alaska. The Mendenhall Glacier, one of the chief tourist attractions in Juneau, has retreated over one-and-a-half miles in the last half century. Today you can only see a small sliver of the glacier's tongue from a lookout. I caught up with John Neary, a Forest Service official who tries to explain to visitors the scale of the changes that they're witnessing. JOHN NEARY: I would say that right now we're looking at a glacier that's filling up out of our 180 degree view we have, we're looking at maybe 10 or 15 degrees of it. Whereas if we stood in the same place a hundred years ago, it would have filled up about 160 degrees of our view. VEDANTAM: You are kidding, 160 degrees of our view? NEARY: Exactly. That's the reality of how big this was. And it's been retreating up this valley at about 40 or 50 feet a year, most recently 400 feet a year. And even more dramatically recently is the thinning and the narrowing, as it's just sort of collapsed in on itself in the bottom of this valley instead of dominating much of the valley and being able to see white as a large portion of the landscape, it's now becoming this little ribbon that's at the bottom. VEDANTAM: John is a quiet, soft-spoken man. In recent years as he's watched the glacier literally recede before his eyes, he started to speak up - not just about what's happening, but what it means. But as I was chatting with John, a visitor came up to talk to him. The man said he used to serve in the Air Force and had last seen the Mendenhall Glacier a quarter century ago. There was a look in the man's eyes. It was a combination of awe and horror. How could this have happened, the man asked John. Why is this happening? NEARY: In many ways, people don't want to grasp the reality. It's a scary reality to try to grasp. And so what they naturally want to do is assume, well, this has always happened. It will happen in the future and we'll survive, won't we? They want an assurance from me. But I don't give it to them. I don't think it's my job to give them that assurance. I think they need to grasp the reality of the fact that we are entering into a time when, yes, glacial advance and retreat has happened 25 different times to North America over its long life, but never at the rate and the scale that we see now. And in the very quick rapidity of it means that species probably won't be able to adapt the way that they have in the past over a longer period of time. VEDANTAM: To be clear, the Mendenhall Glacier's retreat in and of itself is not proof of climate change. That evidence comes from a range of scientific measurements and calculations. But the glacier is a visible symbol of the changes that scientists are documenting. It's interesting. I think when people think about climate change, it tends to be an abstract issue most of the time for most people. That you're standing in front of this magnificent glacier right now and to actually see it receding makes it feel real and visceral in a way that it just isn't when I'm living in Washington, D. C. NEARY: Oh, I agree. I think that for too many people the issue is some Micronesian island that's having an extra inch of water this year on their shorelines. Or it's some polar bears far up in the Arctic that they're really not connected with. But when they realize they come here and they're on this nice day like we're experience right now with the warm sun and they start to think about this glacier melting and why it's receding, why it's disappearing, why it doesn't look like that photo just 30 years ago up in the visitor's center. It becomes real for them and they have to start grapple with the issues behind it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: I could see tourists turning these questions over in their minds as they watch the glacier. So even though I had not planned to do any reporting, I started interviewing people using the only device I had available - my phone. DALE SINGER: I just think it's a shame that we are losing something pretty precious and pretty different in the world. VEDANTAM: This is Dale Singer (ph). She and her family came to Alaska on a cruise to celebrate a couple of family birthdays. This was her second trip to Mendenhall. She came about nine years ago, but the weather was so foggy she couldn't get a good look. She felt compelled to come back. I asked Dale why she thought the glacier was retreating. SINGER: Global warming. Whether we like to admit it or not, it's our fault. Or something we're doing is affecting climate change. VEDANTAM: Others are not so sure. For some of Dale's fellow passengers on her cruise, this is a touchy topic. SINGER: Somebody just said they went to a lecture on the ship and the lecturer did not use the word global warming, nor climate change 'cause he didn't want to offend passengers. So there are still people who refuse to admit it. VEDANTAM: As I was standing next to John, one man carefully came up and listened to his account of the science of climate change. When John was done talking, the man told him that he wouldn't trust scientists as far as he could throw them. Climate change was all about politics, he said. I asked the man for an interview but he declined. He said his company had contracts with the federal government and if bureaucrats in the Obama administration heard his skeptical views on climate change, those contracts might mysteriously disappear. I caught up with another tourist. I asked Michael Bull (ph) if he believed climate change was real. MICHAEL BULL: No, I think there's global climate change, but I question whether it's all due to human interaction with the Earth. Yes, you can't deny that the climate is changing. But the causation of that, I'm not sold on as being our fault. VEDANTAM: Michael was worried his tour bus might leave without him, so he answered my question about whether the glacier's retreat was cause for alarm standing next to the idling boss. BULL: So what's the bad part of the glacier receding? And, you know, from what John said to me, if it's the rate at which - and the Earth can't adapt, that makes sense to me. But I think the final story is yet to be written. I think Mother Earth pushes back. So I don't think we're going to destroy her because I think she'll take care of us before we take care of her. (SOUNDBITE OF WATERFALL)VEDANTAM: Nugget Falls is a beautiful waterfall that empties into Mendenhall Lake. When John first came to Alaska in 1982, the waterfall was adjacent to the glacier. Today, there's a gap of three-quarters-of-a-mile between the waterfall and the glacier. SUE SCHULTZ: The glacier has receded unbelievably. It's quite shocking. VEDANTAM: This is Sue Schultz (ph). She said she lived in Juneau back in the 1980s. This was her first time back in 28 years. What did it look like 28 years ago? SCHULTZ: The bare rock that you see to the left as you face the glacier was glacier. And we used to hike on the other side of it. And you could take a trail right onto the glacier. VEDANTAM: And what about this way? I understand the glacier actually came significantly over to this side, close to Nugget Falls. SCHULTZ: Yes, that's true. It was really close. In fact, the lake was a lot smaller, obviously. I mean, yeah, it's quite incredible. VEDANTAM: And so what's your reaction when you see it? SCHULTZ: Global warming. We need to pay attention. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)TERRY LAMBERT: Even if it all melts, it's not going to be the end of the world. So I'm not worried. VEDANTAM: Terry Lambert (ph) is a tourist from Southern California. He's never visited Mendenhall before. He thinks the melting glacier is just part of nature's plan. LAMBERT: Well, it's just like earthquakes and floods and hurricanes. They are just all part of what's going on. You can't control it. You can't change it. I personally don't think it's something that may man's doing that's making that melt. VEDANTAM: I mentioned to Terry some of the possible consequences of climate change on various species. There could be changes. Species could - some species could be advantaged. Some species could be disadvantaged. The ecosystem is changing. You're going to have flooding. You could have weather events, right? There could be consequences that affect you and I. LAMBERT: Yes. But like I said, so far in the future, I'm not worried about it. VEDANTAM: I realized at that moment that the debate over climate change is no longer really about science, unless the science you're talking about is the study of human behavior. I asked John why he thought so many people were unwilling to accept the scientific consensus that climate change was having real consequences. NEARY: The inability to do anything about it themselves. Because it's threatening to think about giving up your car, giving up your oil heater in your house or giving up, you know, many of the things that you've become accustomed to. They seem very threatening to them. And, you know, really, I've looked at some of the brain science actually and talked to folks at NASA in Earth and Sky and they've actually talked about how when that fear becomes overriding for people, they use a part of their brain that's the very primitive part, that has to react. It has to instantly come to a conclusion so that it can lead to an action. Whereas what we need to think about is get rid of that fear and start thinking logically. Start thinking creatively. Allow a different part of the brain to kick in and really think how we as humans can reverse this trend that we've caused. VEDANTAM: Coming up, we explore why the human brain might not be well designed to grapple with the threat of climate change and what we can do about it. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. While visiting the Mendenhall Glacier with my family last year, I started thinking more and more about the intersection between climate change and human behavior. When I got back to Washington, D. C. , I called George Marshall. He's an environmentalist who, like John Neary, tries to educate people about global climate change. GEORGE MARSHALL: I am the founder of Climate Outreach. And I am the author of \"Don't Even Think About It: Why Our Brains Are Wired To Ignore Climate Change. \"VEDANTAM: As the book's title suggests, George believes that the biggest roadblock in the battle against climate change may lie inside the human brain. I call George at his home in Wales. You spent some time talking with Daniel Kahneman, the famous psychologist who won the Nobel Prize in Economics. And he actually presented a very pessimistic view that we would actually come to terms with the threat of climate change. MARSHALL: He said to me that we are, as humans, very poor at dealing with issues that are in the future. We tend to be very focused on the short term. We tend to discount, would be the economic term, to reduce the value of things happening in the future the further away they are. He says we're very cost-averse. Suffice to say, when there is a reward we respond strongly. But when there's a cost, we prefer to push it away just as, you know, I myself will try and leave until the very last minute putting in my tax return. I mean, you just don't want to deal with these things. And he says that we're reluctant to do with uncertainty. If things are uncertain or we perceive them to be, we just say, well, come back and tell me when they're certain. What he said to me was in his view that climate change is the worst possible combination because it's not only in the future, but it's also in the future and uncertain. And it's in the future uncertain and involving costs. And his own experiments - and he's done many, many of these over the years - show that in this combination we have a very strong tendency just to push things on one side. And I think this in some ways explains how so many people if you ask them will say, yes, I regard climate change to be a threat. But if you go and you ask them - and this happens every year in surveys - what are the most important issues? What are the - strangely almost everybody seems to forget about climate change. So when we focus on it we know it's there, but we can somehow push it away. VEDANTAM: You tell an amusing story in your book about some colleagues who are worried about a cellphone tower being erected in their neighborhood and the very, very different reaction of these colleagues to the cellphone tower then to sort of the amorphous threat of climate change. MARSHALL: They were my neighbors, my entire community. I was living at that time in Oxford, which as many of your listeners know is a university town. So it'd like living in, you know, Harvard or Berkeley or somewhere where most of the people were in various ways involved in university, highly-educated. A mobile phone mast was being set up in the middle - alongside actually a school playground. Enormous outcry, everybody mobilized down to the local church hall. They were all going to stop it. People were even going to lay themselves down in front of the bulldozers to prevent it. Because it was here, it was now. There was an enemy, which was this external mobile phone company were going to come in and they were going to put up this mast. It brings in the threat. Psychologists would call the absolute fear of radiation. This is what's called a dread fear. And so now the science, if we go back to the core science, says that this mobile phone mast was as far as we could possibly say harmless. (Laughter) You know, the amount of radiation or - of any kind you get off a single mobile phone mast has never been found to have the slightest impact on anyone. But they were very mobilized. At the same time, I was trying to get them to attend events concerned of climate change and none of them would come. It simply didn't have those qualities. VEDANTAM: You have a very revealing anecdote in your book about the economist Thomas Schelling, who was once in a major traffic jam. MARSHALL: So Schelling, again, a Nobel Prize-winning economist. And he's wondering what's going on. The traffic is moving very, very, very slowly. And then they're creeping along and creeping along. And half an hour along the road, they finally realized what had happened. That there is a mattress lying right in the middle of the - of the middle lane of the road. What happens? He notices and he does the same. It's - but when they reach the mattress, people will simply drive past it and keep going. In other words, the thing that had caused them to become delayed was not something that anyone was prepared to stop and remove from the road. They'd just leave the mattress there and then they keep driving past. Because in a way, why would they remove the mattress from the road? Because they have already paid the price of getting there. They've already had the delay. It's something where the benefit goes to other people. The argument being, but of course it's very hard, especially when people are motivated largely through personal rewards to get them to do things. VEDANTAM: It's interesting that the same narrative affects the way we talk about climate change internationally. There are many countries who now say, look, you know, I've already paid the price. I'm paying the price right now for the actions of other people, for the, you know, things that other people have or have not done. I'm bearing that cost and you're asking me now to get out of my car, pull the mattress off the road to bear an additional cost. And the only people who benefit from that are people who are not me. The collective problems in the end have personal consequences. MARSHALL: I have to say that the way that one talks about this also shows the way that interpretation is biased by your own politics or your own view. This has been labeled for a long time the tragedy of the commons. The idea being that unless the people will - if it's in their own self-interest - destroy the very thing that sustains them because it's not in their personal interest to do something if they don't see other people doing it. In a way it's understandable. But, of course, that depends on a view of a world where you see people as being motivated entirely by their own personal rewards. We also know people are motivated by their sense of identity and their sense of belonging. And we know very well, not least of all in times of major conflict or war, that people are prepared to make enormous personal sacrifices from which they personally derive nothing except loss. But they're making that in the interests of the greater good. For a long time with climate change, we've made a mistake of talking about this solely in terms of something which is economic. What are the economic costs and what are the economic benefits? And we still do this. But, of course, really the motivations for why we want to act on this is we want to defend the world we care about and the world we love. And we want to do so for ourselves and for the people who are going to come. VEDANTAM: So, George, there obviously is one domain in life where you can see people constantly placing these sacred values above their selfish self-interest. You know, I'm thinking here about the many, many religions we have in the world that get people to do all kinds of things that an economist would say is not in their rational self-interest. People give up food. People give up water. People have, you know, suffer enormous personal privations. People sometimes choose chastity for life. I mean, huge costs that people are willing to bear. And they're not doing it because someone says at the end of the year I'm going to give you an extra 200 bucks in your paycheck for an extra $2,000 in your paycheck. They're doing it because they believe these are sacred values that are not negotiable. MARSHALL: And not just economists would find those behaviors strange, but professor Kahneman or kind of pure cognitive psychology might as well. Because these are people who are struggling with and - but also believe passionately in things which are in the long term extremely uncertain and require personal cost. And yet, people do so. It's very important to stress that, you know, when we try and - when we talk about climate change and religion, that there's absolutely no sense at all that climate change is or can or should ever be like a religion. It's not. It's grounded in science. But we can also learn, I think, a great deal from religions about how to approach these issues - these uncertain issues and how to create, I think, a community of shared belief and shared conviction that something is important. VEDANTAM: Right. I mean, if you look at sort of human history with sort of the broad view, you know, you don't actually have to be a religious person to acknowledge that religion has played a very, very important role in the lives of millions of people over thousands of years. And if it's done so, then a scientific approach would say there is something about the nature of religious belief or the practice of religion that harnesses what our brains can accommodate. That they harness our yearning to be part of a tribe. Our yearning to be connected to deeper and grander values than ourselves. Our yearning in some ways to do things for our fellow person in a way that might not be tangible in the here and now but might actually pay off, as you say, not just for future generations but even in the hereafter. MARSHALL: Well, and the faiths that dominate, the half-a-dozen faiths which are the strongest ones in the world are the ones that have been best at doing that. There's a big mistake with climate change because it comes from science, but we assume it just somehow soaks into us. It's very clear that just hitting people over the head with more and more and more data and graphs isn't working. On my internet feeds - I'm on all of the main scientific feeds - there is a new paper every day that says that not only is it bad but it's worse than we thought. And it's extremely, extremely serious. So serious actually that we're finding it very hard even to find words to describe it. That doesn't move people. In fact, actually it tends to push them away. However, if we can understand that there are other things which bind us together, I think that we can find new language. I think it's also very important to recognize that the divides around climate change are social, not scientific. They're social and political, that the single biggest determinant of whether you accept it or you don't accept it is your political values. And that suggests that the solutions to this are not scientific, other than maybe psychology. They are cultural. We have to find ways of saying, sure, we're going to disagree on things politically. But we have things in common that we all care about that are going to have to bring us together.

Over the past few weeks, we've tried to offer insight into some of the deeper issues underlying all the rancor. We've looked at the hidden frames that shape our political views. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) GEORGE LAKOFF: If you have two different views of the nation, you may have two different views of the family. VEDANTAM: . . . And examine the biases that women face when they seek higher office. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) CAROL MOSELEY BRAUN: I came home that night. I was so upset and demeaned - to use the word - that I thought, OK, that's it. I can't take this anymore. I'm going to quit. VEDANTAM: We've also talked about topics that have surfaced over and over again in the election. Topics like immigration, income inequality and stop-and-frisk policing. Today, we'll conclude our series with a favorite episode from our archives. It's about an issue that didn't get much attention during the election, but will surely confront the next administration - climate change. (SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Last year, my family and I took a vacation to Alaska. This was a much needed, long-planned break. The best part? I got to walk on the top of a glacier. The pale blue ice was translucent. Sharp ridges opened up into crevices dozens of feet deep. Every geological feature, every hill, every valley was sculpted in ice. It was a sunny day and I spotted a small stream of melted water. I got on the ground and drank some. I wondered how long this water had remained frozen. The little stream is not the only ice that's melting in Alaska. The Mendenhall Glacier, one of the chief tourist attractions in Juneau, has retreated over one-and-a-half miles in the last half century. Today you can only see a small sliver of the glacier's tongue from a lookout. I caught up with John Neary, a Forest Service official who tries to explain to visitors the scale of the changes that they're witnessing. JOHN NEARY: I would say that right now we're looking at a glacier that's filling up out of our 180 degree view we have, we're looking at maybe 10 or 15 degrees of it. Whereas if we stood in the same place a hundred years ago, it would have filled up about 160 degrees of our view. VEDANTAM: You are kidding, 160 degrees of our view? NEARY: Exactly. That's the reality of how big this was. And it's been retreating up this valley at about 40 or 50 feet a year, most recently 400 feet a year. And even more dramatically recently is the thinning and the narrowing, as it's just sort of collapsed in on itself in the bottom of this valley instead of dominating much of the valley and being able to see white as a large portion of the landscape, it's now becoming this little ribbon that's at the bottom. VEDANTAM: John is a quiet, soft-spoken man. In recent years as he's watched the glacier literally recede before his eyes, he started to speak up - not just about what's happening, but what it means. But as I was chatting with John, a visitor came up to talk to him. The man said he used to serve in the Air Force and had last seen the Mendenhall Glacier a quarter century ago. There was a look in the man's eyes. It was a combination of awe and horror. How could this have happened, the man asked John. Why is this happening? NEARY: In many ways, people don't want to grasp the reality. It's a scary reality to try to grasp. And so what they naturally want to do is assume, well, this has always happened. It will happen in the future and we'll survive, won't we? They want an assurance from me. But I don't give it to them. I don't think it's my job to give them that assurance. I think they need to grasp the reality of the fact that we are entering into a time when, yes, glacial advance and retreat has happened 25 different times to North America over its long life, but never at the rate and the scale that we see now. And in the very quick rapidity of it means that species probably won't be able to adapt the way that they have in the past over a longer period of time. VEDANTAM: To be clear, the Mendenhall Glacier's retreat in and of itself is not proof of climate change. That evidence comes from a range of scientific measurements and calculations. But the glacier is a visible symbol of the changes that scientists are documenting. It's interesting. I think when people think about climate change, it tends to be an abstract issue most of the time for most people. That you're standing in front of this magnificent glacier right now and to actually see it receding makes it feel real and visceral in a way that it just isn't when I'm living in Washington, D. C. NEARY: Oh, I agree. I think that for too many people the issue is some Micronesian island that's having an extra inch of water this year on their shorelines. Or it's some polar bears far up in the Arctic that they're really not connected with. But when they realize they come here and they're on this nice day like we're experience right now with the warm sun and they start to think about this glacier melting and why it's receding, why it's disappearing, why it doesn't look like that photo just 30 years ago up in the visitor's center. It becomes real for them and they have to start grapple with the issues behind it.

She came about nine years ago, but the weather was so foggy she couldn't get a good look. She felt compelled to come back. I asked Dale why she thought the glacier was retreating. SINGER: Global warming. Whether we like to admit it or not, it's our fault. Or something we're doing is affecting climate change. VEDANTAM: Others are not so sure.

VEDANTAM: You tell an amusing story in your book about some colleagues who are worried about a cellphone tower being erected in their neighborhood and the very, very different reaction of these colleagues to the cellphone tower then to sort of the amorphous threat of climate change. MARSHALL: They were my neighbors, my entire community. I was living at that time in Oxford, which as many of your listeners know is a university town. So it'd like living in, you know, Harvard or Berkeley or somewhere where most of the people were in various ways involved in university, highly-educated. A mobile phone mast was being set up in the middle - alongside actually a school playground. Enormous outcry, everybody mobilized down to the local church hall. They were all going to stop it. People were even going to lay themselves down in front of the bulldozers to prevent it. Because it was here, it was now. There was an enemy, which was this external mobile phone company were going to come in and they were going to put up this mast. It brings in the threat. Psychologists would call the absolute fear of radiation. This is what's called a dread fear. And so now the science, if we go back to the core science, says that this mobile phone mast was as far as we could possibly say harmless. (Laughter) You know, the amount of radiation or - of any kind you get off a single mobile phone mast has never been found to have the slightest impact on anyone. But they were very mobilized. At the same time, I was trying to get them to attend events concerned of climate change and none of them would come. It simply didn't have those qualities. VEDANTAM: You have a very revealing anecdote in your book about the economist Thomas Schelling, who was once in a major traffic jam. MARSHALL: So Schelling, again, a Nobel Prize-winning economist. And he's wondering what's going on. The traffic is moving very, very, very slowly. And then they're creeping along and creeping along. And half an hour along the road, they finally realized what had happened. That there is a mattress lying right in the middle of the - of the middle lane of the road. What happens? He notices and he does the same. It's - but when they reach the mattress, people will simply drive past it and keep going. In other words, the thing that had caused them to become delayed was not something that anyone was prepared to stop and remove from the road. They'd just leave the mattress there and then they keep driving past. Because in a way, why would they remove the mattress from the road? Because they have already paid the price of getting there. They've already had the delay. It's something where the benefit goes to other people. The argument being, but of course it's very hard, especially when people are motivated largely through personal rewards to get them to do things. VEDANTAM: It's interesting that the same narrative affects the way we talk about climate change internationally. There are many countries who now say, look, you know, I've already paid the price. I'm paying the price right now for the actions of other people, for the, you know, things that other people have or have not done. I'm bearing that cost and you're asking me now to get out of my car, pull the mattress off the road to bear an additional cost. And the only people who benefit from that are people who are not me. The collective problems in the end have personal consequences. MARSHALL: I have to say that the way that one talks about this also shows the way that interpretation is biased by your own politics or your own view. This has been labeled for a long time the tragedy of the commons. The idea being that unless the people will - if it's in their own self-interest - destroy the very thing that sustains them because it's not in their personal interest to do something if they don't see other people doing it. In a way it's understandable. But, of course, that depends on a view of a world where you see people as being motivated entirely by their own personal rewards. We also know people are motivated by their sense of identity and their sense of belonging. And we know very well, not least of all in times of major conflict or war, that people are prepared to make enormous personal sacrifices from which they personally derive nothing except loss. But they're making that in the interests of the greater good. For a long time with climate change, we've made a mistake of talking about this solely in terms of something which is economic. What are the economic costs and what are the economic benefits? And we still do this. But, of course, really the motivations for why we want to act on this is we want to defend the world we care about and the world we love. And we want to do so for ourselves and for the people who are going to come. VEDANTAM: So, George, there obviously is one domain in life where you can see people constantly placing these sacred values above their selfish self-interest. You know, I'm thinking here about the many, many religions we have in the world that get people to do all kinds of things that an economist would say is not in their rational self-interest. People give up food. People give up water. People have, you know, suffer enormous personal privations. People sometimes choose chastity for life. I mean, huge costs that people are willing to bear. And they're not doing it because someone says at the end of the year I'm going to give you an extra 200 bucks in your paycheck for an extra $2,000 in your paycheck. They're doing it because they believe these are sacred values that are not negotiable. MARSHALL: And not just economists would find those behaviors strange, but professor Kahneman or kind of pure cognitive psychology might as well. Because these are people who are struggling with and - but also believe passionately in things which are in the long term extremely uncertain and require personal cost. And yet, people do so. It's very important to stress that, you know, when we try and - when we talk about climate change and religion, that there's absolutely no sense at all that climate change is or can or should ever be like a religion. It's not. It's grounded in science. But we can also learn, I think, a great deal from religions about how to approach these issues - these uncertain issues and how to create, I think, a community of shared belief and shared conviction that something is important. VEDANTAM: Right. I mean, if you look at sort of human history with sort of the broad view, you know, you don't actually have to be a religious person to acknowledge that religion has played a very, very important role in the lives of millions of people over thousands of years. And if it's done so, then a scientific approach would say there is something about the nature of religious belief or the practice of religion that harnesses what our brains can accommodate. That they harness our yearning to be part of a tribe. Our yearning to be connected to deeper and grander values than ourselves. Our yearning in some ways to do things for our fellow person in a way that might not be tangible in the here and now but might actually pay off, as you say, not just for future generations but even in the hereafter. MARSHALL: Well, and the faiths that dominate, the half-a-dozen faiths which are the strongest ones in the world are the ones that have been best at doing that. There's a big mistake with climate change because it comes from science, but we assume it just somehow soaks into us. It's very clear that just hitting people over the head with more and more and more data and graphs isn't working. On my internet feeds - I'm on all of the main scientific feeds - there is a new paper every day that says that not only is it bad but it's worse than we thought. And it's extremely, extremely serious. So serious actually that we're finding it very hard even to find words to describe it. That doesn't move people. In fact, actually it tends to push them away. However, if we can understand that there are other things which bind us together, I think that we can find new language. I think it's also very important to recognize that the divides around climate change are social, not scientific. They're social and political, that the single biggest determinant of whether you accept it or you don't accept it is your political values. And that suggests that the solutions to this are not scientific, other than maybe psychology. They are cultural. We have to find ways of saying, sure, we're going to disagree on things politically. But we have things in common that we all care about that are going to have to bring us together.

It's about divorce and the emotional challenges that come along with it. MELISSA SMITH: The fear of, oh, God, what's next or, you know, how do I do this are these things that kind of just came out of the blue at you. SARAH WEELDREYER: There are so many little triggers, like, when people ask about your husband or. . . SMITH: Right. WEELDREYER: . . . When you get invited to a family reunion. Like, what's that going to look like? SMITH: Yeah, holidays (laughter). AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: That's Sarah Weeldreyer and Melissa Smith. Sarah's been married for 11 years. She has two kids, and now she's going through a divorce. She and her husband are working with a counselor to help them through the process. They want it to be amicable. SHAPIRO: Melissa Smith is also a mother of two and recently went through her own divorce using mediation. They sat down together for our series Been There, conversations between people at either end of a shared experience. One big question Sarah had was how to explain to friends and family that despite being hurt, she isn't looking for a fight. WEELDREYER: I feel like everybody expects that there's going to be this desire for, you know, really go get him and stick it to him and, you know, that kind of thing. SMITH: Yep. They can try to light a fire in you for sure. And you know, I actually - it got to the point where, you know, I had somebody hand me $500 in cash, and they're like, go get an attorney. And I was like, I'm not - that's not the route I'm going down. WEELDREYER: Right. SMITH: That's not what I want. WEELDREYER: Yeah, I think it - there's an atmosphere of fear around it where it's like if you don't do it first, then he's going to come after you, and you and the kids are going to be out on the street (laughter). SMITH: Yes, and it's so difficult to stay out of that cycle. I think we had two or three mediation sessions, and it would get heated - not like we were screaming and yelling, but it was like, who's going to get this $50,000, you know what I mean? WEELDREYER: Right. SMITH: I mean that's a big deal. You know, he'd be like, that's it. I'm walking out of here. I'm getting an attorney because I know I have a right to some of that money. And then the second you threaten that, then they're like, well, then I'm going after for your 401(k). WEELDREYER: Right. SMITH: Or I'm going to get the kids more than 50-50. And so our mediators did such a wonderful job of keeping us in the room until we were both satisfied. And I don't know how she did it. She was a miracle worker. WEELDREYER: (Laughter). SMITH: But you know, just keeping your eye on the prize, you know? That's what I just had to keep in mind. It's, like, you know, a year from now when, you know, I have to work late, like, I need to know that I can call him and we can have, like, a real discussion about, you know, what's going on with the kids. WEELDREYER: Yeah, that sounds far less stressful than the alternative. SMITH: You know, I would say I trusted him. I really did. And so you kind of need that in order to go that way. WEELDREYER: Right. I think that is going to be one of my biggest hurdles. But (laughter) I am hopeful that the counseling will help with that (laughter). SMITH: And I think the trust is so hard, especially when you're talking about sharing custody with your children. I was terrified that they were going to have frozen pizza every night. WEELDREYER: (Laughter). SMITH: But I can only control what I can control. You just have to trust that they have your children's best interests in mind. And you know, he has really stepped up, so you might be pleasantly surprised. WEELDREYER: Do you guys have sort of a - like, a parenting plan kind of thing, or is it more sort of fluid with just what - you know, work schedules and things like that? SMITH: We do have a parenting plan, and that was part of the paperwork that we drew up with our mediator. And going into it, we were getting along so well. I think we were both just very happy to be throwing in the towel. So you know, I had this kind of false sense of security that, oh, you know what? I can see the kids whenever want. And I had to learn the hard way to be really respectful that I can't just, like, show up and be like, hey, kids. . . WEELDREYER: (Laughter). SMITH: . . . What's for dinner? You know, my ex, the kids' father, was, you know - had to kind of draw some lines and say listen; you know, we can FaceTime every now and again if there's something going on or if the kids ask, but my time with them is my time with them. WEELDREYER: Right. Well, and I think for them to be able to see you both being healthy and separate but living your lives and doing what's right for you - that's a huge life lesson. . . SMITH: Yeah. WEELDREYER: . . . Right? SMITH: Yeah, and when we sat down with our daughter - I mean we literally sat on her floor and held hands and told her, you know, we're still a family. We're just going to be a different kind of family. You are still going to go to swim class. We're still going to read books before bed. You know, you're still going to eat hot dogs for dinner, you know? WEELDREYER: (Laughter). SMITH: So we just went through all the things that are going to stay the same, but we're just - your mommy and daddy are going to live in different houses. SHAPIRO: That was Melissa Smith, who went through an amicable divorce last year, and Sarah Weeldreyer, who is at the beginning of that process. They spoke as part of our series Been There.

You might have heard of supermoons before. When the moon gets particularly close to Earth, it appears larger than usual in the night sky. And tomorrow night, the moon will be the closest it has ever been to Earth since 1948. Here to explain how it all works is Jackie Faherty. She is an astronomer at the American Museum of Natural History. Thanks so much for being with us, Jackie. JACKIE FAHERTY: You're welcome. It's a pleasure. MARTIN: What makes a supermoon so super? FAHERTY: Well, anything called super must be amazing, I feel like. MARTIN: (Laughter). FAHERTY: But the real question is what - why is it super and what makes it super? And it's actually not a science term. It's a term that was coined by an astrologist over 30 years ago. And it didn't have much science behind it except that he coined a term for when the moon was full when it was 90 percent of its closest distance that it could be to Earth. And a couple years ago, it just caught on. MARTIN: So just to clarify, it's not like the moon turns crazy colors or anything. It's just - it's a full moon, and it just seems bigger in the sky? FAHERTY: Yeah. So the moon travels around the Earth every 28 days or so, and it moves in an ellipse. And that means that the distance that the moon is away from us changes. And what's happening this coming Monday is that at the same time that it's coming into its closest approach to the Earth in this orbit, it's also aligned so that you have a full moon, what we astronomers call a perigee-syzygy moon. MARTIN: Now you're just showing off. FAHERTY: Yeah. Well, that's also why supermoon sounds so much better. (LAUGHTER)MARTIN: Does it just look cool, or does it have any kind of tangible effects on the Earth? FAHERTY: So full moon always has an effect on the Earth. We get stronger tides during that time, and that can be very, very minorly amplified when the moon is a bit closer to the Earth. If you were somebody that always went outside and looked at the moon and always saw full moons, you would notice a difference. But for the person that - like, how many times do you go outside and look at the moon? I feel like. . . MARTIN: Not that often. I wish I did more in my life. FAHERTY: So I'm hoping that this will get people to go outside and look at the moon a bit more because it is - it's fun to go out and know that as you're standing out there and looking up that it's closer to you than it's been in quite a long time. MARTIN: What's the best way to see the supermoon? FAHERTY: The moon is one of those great astronomical objects that even if you're in big cities you're going to be able to see it. So I like to tell people to go out and watch the moon at moonrise or moonset because there's this optical illusion which as it's rising or when it's setting, it looks really big. . . MARTIN: Yeah. FAHERTY: . . . This - yeah. So that - that's not even a supermoon (laughter). That's just. . . MARTIN: That's just a regular old moon. FAHERTY: That's just a regular full moon close to the horizon, where you get this optical illusion where your brain doesn't quite know how to interpret the size of the moon with the buildings and the horizon. MARTIN: Where are you going to be? How do you like to watch the moon? Do you have to be at work? Or are you going to be, like, in your backyard? FAHERTY: I'm just going to be outside of my apartment in New York City, looking for the moon and knowing that it's closer to me than it's been in a long time.

Giuliani is best known for using a tactic known as broken windows to police New York City in the 1990s, which basically means going after petty crimes in the hopes of preventing bigger ones. NPR's social science correspondent, Shankar Vedantam, looked at where the broken windows theory comes from and how it has evolved. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Our story begins in 1969. The psychologist Philip Zimbardo abandoned two cars on the street, one in a crime-ridden section of the Bronx, the other in affluent Palo Alto, Calif. Both cars were left without license plates, parked with the hoods up. Within 10 minutes of leaving the car in the Bronx, people quickly began to strip it for parts. Windows were smashed. But for more than a week in Palo Alto, the other car remained untouched until. . . (SOUNDBITE OF GLASS BREAKING)GEORGE L KELLING: Zimbardo himself gave the car a smash with a sledgehammer. And once the car was damaged, it became fair game. VEDANTAM: This is George L. Kelling. KELLING: In 1982, I co-authored an article called \"Broken Windows\" with James Q. Wilson. This article has gotten considerable attention in the policing and non-policing world. VEDANTAM: Kelling and Wilson were fascinated by what had happened in Palo Alto. KELLING: The idea that once disorder begins, it doesn't matter what the neighborhood is. Things can begin to get out of control. VEDANTAM: Was it possible, they asked, that if police could address minor acts of disorder, more serious crime could be prevented? KELLING: Communities get strengthened once order is restored or maintained. And it is that dynamic that helps to prevent crime. VEDANTAM: Kelling and Wilson's argument came during a period of high crime and high incarceration. It appealed to people on both sides of the political spectrum. In 1990s New York, Mayor Rudy Giuliani and his police commissioner, William Bratton, embraced the idea. They went after low-level offenses like smoking marijuana in public, spraying graffiti, selling loose cigarettes. And their strategy seemed to work. By the time Giuliani left office in 2001, broken windows policing had become one of his greatest accomplishments. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RUDY GIULIANI: The broken windows theory replaced the idea that we were too busy to pay attention to street-level prostitution, too busy to pay attention to panhandling, too busy to pay attention to graffiti. Well, you can't be too busy to pay attention to those things because those are the things that underlie the problems of crime that you have in your society. VEDANTAM: Kelling conducted an influential study that showed that in the very neighborhoods where police made the most misdemeanor arrests, meaning broken windows policing was in force, violent crime dropped sharply. KELLING: Once you begin to deal with the small problems in neighborhoods, you begin to empower those neighborhoods. VEDANTAM: It seemed like a miracle. But the crime statistics tell a different story. BERNARD HARCOURT: Crime was starting to go down in New York prior to the Giuliani election and prior to the implementation of broken windows policing. VEDANTAM: Bernard Harcourt is a law professor at Columbia University. He says crime dropped not just in New York, but nationwide, in cities where nothing like broken windows policing was in place. HARCOURT: Los Angeles was wracked with terrible policing problems during the whole time. In fact, the period is kind of bookended on one side by the Rodney King scandal and on the other side by the Rampart scandal. In between the two, the LAPD is pretty much dysfunctional. And despite the fact that the LAPD isn't doing anything basically - I mean, it's - and it's certainly not doing broken windows policing - crime drops as much in Los Angeles as it does in New York. VEDANTAM: In 2006, Harcourt reviewed the Kelling study that had found broken windows policing worked. He discovered that it had failed to account for a fundamental principle known as reversion to the mean, the idea that if something goes up a lot, it tends to go down a lot. Crime did decline dramatically in the 1990s, but it also spiked dramatically in the 1980s. And the dramatic decline in crime was accompanied by an increase in something else. HARCOURT: We immediately saw a sharp increase in complaints of police misconduct. And that's actually one of the most interesting things about the period really from 1993 to '96, for instance, when Giuliani is implementing the quality of life initiative. I mean, we always associate it with greater order because crime dropped 60 percent, but complaints of police misconduct increased by 60 percent. VEDANTAM: But the metaphor of broken windows proved so compelling that many areas of the country simply ignored the evidence. The idea morphed into new forms. In 2002, the New York Police Department moved from broken windows to a policy of stop and frisk. The idea was why wait for minor disorder to break out? Why not check on seemingly suspicious people before they did anything wrong? JAMAL JOHNSON: It was, I think, a Wednesday or Thursday night. VEDANTAM: This is Jamal Johnson. He's African-American, a filmmaker who lives in Brooklyn. Two years ago, he was rounding the corner to his house after an evening out with a friend. A police officer stopped him, frisked him, took down his name and threatened to arrest him because he was carrying a small pocket knife that he uses on film sets. Johnson describes the experience as worse than humiliating. JOHNSON: When your society can detain you, your life - or at the very least, like, your livelihood, like, you getting to and from work - is at question. So that feeling of an impersonal, not friendly government standing over you is pretty terrible. VEDANTAM: New York City's stop and frisk policy was ruled unconstitutional in 2013. So what did city officials do? They returned to familiar ground, broken windows policing. Now, more than three decades after writing the article that introduced broken windows to the world, George Kelling says he still believes the policy has value even if it didn't have dramatic effects on crime. But he's dismayed that many police departments think that broken windows can be a quick fix. KELLING: It's to the point now where I wonder if we should back away from the metaphor of broken windows. Broken windows was a powerful metaphor. Jim and I used it. We didn't know how powerful it was going to be. It simplified. It was easy to communicate. A lot of people got it as a result of the metaphor. It was attractive. And it carried us for a long time. But as you know, metaphors can wear out and become stale. VEDANTAM: Broken windows is that rare example of an idea that left the academy and caught on like wildfire. It remains popular despite evidence it likely had only modest effects on crime. It's a cautionary tale for our times - once a seductive idea takes hold, it's often impossible to get rid of it. Shankar Vedantam, NPR News.

A study suggests that people express their feelings about their partners through the brands that they buy. NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam is all over this story. Hi, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: (Laughter) Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: So what's the study find? VEDANTAM: Well, the study finds that love can shape the course of brands, and brands can shape the course of love. I talked to Gavan Fitzsimons at Duke University. He's a professor of marketing and psychology. He told me that he and a colleague, Danielle Brick, who's now at the University of New Hampshire, were talking. They both study brands, but one day, they got to talking about romantic relationships. GAVAN FITZSIMONS: She and I got to talking one day about what happens when the relationship is not going so well. And we started laughing. We're both married, and we started telling stories about our partners and the ways that they irritated us. And we thought, well, wouldn't it be interesting if people picked brands that they knew their partners hated? And we both burst into laughter, and then we're like, wait a second. INSKEEP: Because they both had done this? VEDANTAM: Well, because they both thought this might actually be a research hypothesis. (Laughter) So they ran a series of experiments, Steve, to examine whether people's feelings about their partners affect the way they make decisions about which brands to purchase. They found, first of all, that when people remembered a time when they felt frustrated with their partner, they seemed to prefer to buy different brands. And people induced to feel frustration about a partner made very specific brand choices relative to the brands preferred by their partner. FITZSIMONS: When people are frustrated, they make dramatically more choices that are oppositional, that are against what their partner would want them to buy. So if my wife is a Diet Pepsi fan, and she has frustrated me in some way, I will choose Diet Coke. And in fact, we find that oftentimes, people in the frustrated conditions will actually choose brands they personally don't like to spite their partners. INSKEEP: Meaning I totally hate Pepsi, and I'm going to buy it anyway. I'm going to drink it anyway because the other person is a Coke person. VEDANTAM: Precisely. Now, it's actually even more pathetic than that. What Fitzsimons and Brick find is that many of these brand decisions are being made in situations where the person's partner has absolutely no knowledge of what brand the person might be choosing. INSKEEP: Happening in secret. But is there something - I mean, this sounds petty. But is there something real being expressed here, a concern that people have? VEDANTAM: I think that's exactly right. So you're frustrated with your partner. You know your partner likes Starbucks coffee. So on your way to work, you stop and buy coffee at Dunkin Donuts. No one other than you knows about this act of defiance. The researchers find a couple of things that are interesting here, Steve. The people who are likely to behave this way are often people who feel powerless in their relationship. So, you know, you feel you're not being heard. You express your frustration through this kind of low-key oppositional behavior. The second thing that they find is that people often feel better after these acts of defiance. So it may be some kind of venting mechanism. INSKEEP: It's a safety valve. I wonder if marketers could take advantage of this. You know, you could have a commercial where maybe there's a woman there and her husband is drinking Pepsi, and it's actually a commercial for Coke. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Well, that's a pretty good idea for an ad, Steve. But from a marketing point of view, you'd have to figure out how someone is feeling on the inside about their partner, figure out what brands the partner likes to buy and then sell the opposing brand to the person - not easy to do. This might actually be more useful when it comes to psychotherapy and counseling. If you see a couple deliberately choosing opposing brands of soda, it might give you a window into what's happening behind the scenes. INSKEEP: Shankar, thanks very much. VEDANTAM: Thanks, Steve.

My name is Jeff Stankiewicz. Welcome to your Friday, Oct. 21, space weather briefing. BICHELL: Jeff Stankiewicz is one of 11 forecasters who work here around the clock. Now, it may come as a surprise that there's weather in space, but there is. And it's happening pretty much all the time. It's caused by particles, which fly through space and smash into Earth's atmosphere, particles that come from the sun. Stankiewicz shows me some videos of the sun, twitching with activity. A dark red puff rises off the surface and disappears into space. It all looks wispy on the screen, but solar burps like this one can be massive. VIERECK: A billion tons of material traveling a million miles an hour. BICHELL: Rodney Viereck is a physicist with the Space Weather Prediction Center. All these sun spewings are the reason why, since the 1970s, a series of satellites have been monitoring weather on Earth and in space. A new one, called GOES-R, is set to launch from Florida this weekend. This one's decked out with better imaging technology than ever because forecasters want to know if nasty space weather is headed our way. VIERECK: It affects GPS. It affects communication. It affects astronauts and satellites. BICHELL: When space weather reaches Earth, it can change the shape of the atmosphere and add a lot of space gunk to it. That can skew navigation systems, bend high-frequency radio signals and mess with the electronics onboard satellites. But the real threat for most of us is that space weather can fry the electrical grid. In the last few decades, it's knocked the power out in Sweden, South Africa and Canada. VIERECK: That's the fear - is the possibility - the remote possibility - but the possibility that there could be an extreme event that would actually put us into a position where we just don't have reliable power for months. BICHELL: A hundred fifty years ago, a massive solar storm lit up the sky. There weren't electric grids to fry back then, but it did put so much electricity in the air that it started fires in telegraph offices. VIERECK: So it was very, very much a huge event. We don't get many of those. That's one of the big questions - how big can it be? BICHELL: For now, there are no giant space storms in sight. But if one of those big events was about to occur, GOES-R and other satellites like it should provide some warning. In the meantime, the satellites will also keep a close eye on Earth weather, mapping lightning strikes and taking rapid-fire images of severe storms. Rae Ellen Bichell, NPR News.

And yet, that's an illusion in the sense that most of what you're tasting - the fruity, the floral, the meaty, the herbal, the burnt and the smoky - are actually being decoded by our nostrils.

And we're able to show that as soon as you change the sound, it changed the crispiness, the crunchiness, the freshness and these other attributes there. RAZ: Charles says how our food sounds even looks can change how it tastes. SPENCE: One might color a white wine artificially red with an odorless, tasteless food dye. And if done appropriately, you'll find the experts - the wine makers - will get fooled into smelling and even tasting what they think is a red wine. All the aromas, you know, of the tobacco and the dark chocolate and the stone fruits and so on, even though what they're actually tasting is the white. RAZ: All of this, Charles says, feeds into a larger idea that how we experience our food is more than just about the ingredients. Here's Charles Spence on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SPENCE: I'm here this morning to tell you about the perfect meal. We're all convinced we can taste the food. We can enjoy the flavors and aromas of the wine in the glass. But in fact a lot of what's going on is that it's created by the atmosphere in which we eat and drink. But the question is how to study it, how to measure it and the tendency amongst the scientists like the neurogastronists is to stick people like you or I in a brain scanner, give them something to eat, something to drink and see which parts of the brain light up. This is kind of your brain on flavor or neurogastronomy. But I think there's one problem here which is that, in fact, if you imagine yourself in one of these brain scanners kind of lying on your back with your head clamped still with a tube in your mouth that periodically squirts in some drink, you can't swallow it because if you swallow it, your head will kind of jolt and that will spoil the brain scan alignment. So it tells you something useful, but it doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal in one of those situations. RAZ: What exactly defines a perfect meal? SPENCE: (Laughter) So it's probably different for each and every one of us. It may come in with something very, very simple. It can be fish and chips by the sea side or it could be, you know, on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere. These often will stick in people's minds as best meals. But what I guess has to be there is the mood you're in and the people you're with. So it's got the social aspects of dining. No one has ever had that perfect meal when they're fighting with their partner, say. Part of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seem to stick with us and resonate and you can never quite capture when you get back home is that - is your mood, your body relaxed, you're on holiday, you're less stressed, you're probably with your family, and all these things come together to help enhance the experience or make it something sort of truly memorable. RAZ: You think about, like - how many times have you met a friend who's just come back from a holiday and they, say, oh, you've got to try this amazing red wine that I tried in Greece. And then you try it and you were sort of thinking. . . SPENCE: So that phenomenon has a name. I think we've all got our own versions of it. RAZ: Yeah. SPENCE: We call it the Provencal Rose paradox. It's used to describe Northern Europeans, particularly, who go for their holidays to the Mediterranean. And they're sitting somewhere on the side of the sea sipping that rose wine probably looking into their lover's eyes. The sun's out. You can hear the sounds of the sea, the smells of the salty air. It's all there. And that tastes like the best glass of wine you've ever had. . . RAZ: Yeah. SPENCE: . . . So great that you want to buy a bottle or a case and bring it back to share with your friends, show what good taste you have and you bring it back. And then you're disappointed. RAZ: And your friends are like this is really cheap rose. SPENCE: Yeah. And you say what happened? Is it something about when the bottles were in the airplane getting a cold and that, you know, spoiled the wine? It's not about that at all. We never eat nor drink nowhere. We're always somewhere in a certain environment, in a certain state of mind. And our mental state and the environment both together kind of impacts what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy it. And we sort of in a way sort of misattribute, I suppose, some of the pleasure of the situation and put some of that pleasure into what we think about the food. RAZ: In fact, says Charles, these ideas about how we experience food have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor enhancement. And these are methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SPENCE: If you're in a good mood, food taste good. If you're in a bad mood, it never tastes good. It's this illusion about flavor. We think we're tasting the wine in the glass, but our brain cares about everything else. The sound of the seagull, the smell of the salty sea air, the warmth of the sun on our backs - all of that is playing into the experience and top chefs are capturing that insight in the dishes they serve. SPENCE: So Denis(sp? ) - a two-Michelin-star restaurant in Vevey in Switzerland - when you get to his two-Michelin-star restaurant, white tablecloths - there's no cutlery on the table. There's no glasses. There are no plates, no nothing. There's just a plastic cow, and people wait - say, well, he told us to be here at 7 o'clock. And we're here. And everyone's here in the restaurant now. I can see all the tables are full. Nothing will happen until somebody picks up, curiously, that plastic cow. And when they pick get up, it'll go (imitating mooing). It's a little cheap, 1-euro cow. And he makes a mooing sound. And as soon as some - the first table does it, they'll be laughing. And then you can guarantee within a minute, you'll have a whole restaurant full of mooing cows, laughing diners - and that is the moment when the first dish comes out because Denis has successfully, with nothing more than 1 euro a table, enhanced the mood. And he knows that will improve even the taste of a two-Michelin-star restaurant. RAZ: Wow. So, like, from a neurological perspective, do we fully understand what's happening, Like, why that's the case? SPENCE: (Laughter) No. So we don't know that it does happen, but it is the case. It's all a kind of classic example of just how important the environment is to what we taste. I work with a young chef called Jozef Youssef here in London. And he's been sending out questionnaires several weeks after people have been to his restaurant to say, what do you remember? RAZ: Yeah. SPENCE: And he'll say, what flavor was the soup? And people are convinced they can remember. But in fact, when you check what was actually on the menu, they're kind of constructing something. They remember the experience, what they felt about it. And their brain kind of fills in the rest about the details of what they think they thought they were eating. RAZ: Are most chefs that you talked to - are they on board with your ideas? Do they think - yeah, it is about the experiences -he's right. Or do they say - no, this is totally absurd. It's all about the food and the taste of the food. SPENCE: Of course there are still some chefs who say - no, no. It is just what I was taught in culinary school. It is just the saucing, the preparation but nothing else. But you sort of say OK. So in your restaurant, do you serve the food with, you know, plastic cutlery? No, no. It's silver, isn't it? And where is your restaurant exactly? Oh, it's in a country manor house looking out at nature. So they're saying all these things on the one hand, but, clearly, you can never sort of serve food just by itself. It's always served on something, in a certain environment. And those kind of contextual factors are always there. They cannot be avoided. So certainly, I think there are a growing number of the younger chefs who are now popping up, starting up their own venues - who are really, I think, for the first time in history saying, we don't need to just know about the ingredients and cooking preparation techniques. We really need to know about the mind of those that we're serving. RAZ: Charles Spence wrote about his research on how we experience food in his latest book. It's called \"The Perfect Meal. \" You can see his entire talk at ted. npr. org. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, Food - why we eat what we eat and why our food is sometimes so much more than what we put on our plates. CHARLES SPENCE: We all think we taste food in our mouths. And yet, that's an illusion in the sense that most of what you're tasting - the fruity, the floral, the meaty, the herbal, the burnt and the smoky - are actually being decoded by our nostrils. But our brain is doing this wonderful job of ventriloquizing the information I get from my nose and making me believe as if it's coming from my mouth. RAZ: This is Charles Spence. SPENCE: Head of the Crossmodal Research Laboratory at Oxford University. RAZ: What is the Crossmodal Research Laboratory? SPENCE: It's a lab here in the psychology department where we look at how the senses interact. RAZ: And, yes, our mouth and nose interact when we eat but so do our mouth and our ears.

And he worked on it. STEPHEN AGYEI: I would watch my standup in comparison to other comics. Like, I would go do a five-minute set one night, I would put it on the TV and right next I'd put a DVD of Chris Rock in. And I'll watch, like, a minute of mine and then, like, 10, 15 minutes of his. I'm like, how did he get all them damn laughs and I got one laugh? MCEVERS: Now Stephen gets a lot more laughs than he used to. He does standup regularly in Denver, where he lives. But he still has a day job, so he's trying to decide - is it time to make the leap and do comedy full time? To help him answer that question, we connected Stephen with one of his idols. ROY WOOD: Steve. AGYEI: Roy, what's going on? WOOD: What's going on, man? How you feeling, sir? AGYEI: I'm not too bad. How are you doing? WOOD: Another day in these trenches, sir. MCEVERS: That's Roy Wood Jr. You might know him from \"The Daily Show,\" where he's a fake news correspondent. But before that, Roy was hustling from gig to gig just like Stephen. And he had some advice for Stephen on how to turn those gigs into a full-time career. They talked about it for our series Been There, connecting someone about to take a big step with someone who's already taken it. AGYEI: What inspired you to get into comedy? Like, what - when did you know you wanted to be a comic? WOOD: So I was a waiter at Golden Corral. And I figured out if I could make a table laugh, I generally got a better tip from them. And so by the end of the month, I was like, that's technically comedy. I just performed a joke individually for each table. So if you put all those people in the same room, then maybe I could do comedy. And I had always had an itch. I had always had an inkling to do it. So I started doing open mics. But, you know, for me it was a little different because I had to travel a lot because at that time, where there's only one open mic a month - so if you want to get up every week, you've got to get on the Greyhound. I didn't have a car. I'd call it hopping the dog. I'd hop on the dog and go to Atlanta, Charlotte or Tampa or wherever and just keep doing open mics. And that's kind of where my growth came. So where you are now, how do you feel? Because comics, we tend to always feel behind, like, but I should've got that last year or I should've gotten that. Like, what's happened to our career? Am I in a tailspin? AGYEI: Yeah, I feel like we've arrived to this point now where I'm pretty established here. But I'm still working this day job. I'm, like, thinking, like, do I save up to a number and then just bounce and, you know, go to the coast? Because I want to do some TV stuff, you know, a \"Daily Show\" type thing, whether it's sitcom, whether it's movies. I want to do all of that. But I'm on that tipping point. You know, I'm 27 right now and still got a lot of energy. I could still, you know, hit the ground hard in another city, you know, late nights and early mornings or whatever. WOOD: Do you like the job that you work? Does the job relate to comedy in any way, or is it. . . AGYEI: You know what? It's human services. So I do, like, food stamps and Medicaid and stuff for people. WOOD: OK. So then that becomes life experience. AGYEI: Yeah. WOOD: If there's something in that world that's funny, you know, and it's - you'll look up and you'll realize everything you'd been doing up until that point had been simply preparing you for wherever you land. And in my experience and in my opinions, you know, once you're the king of the city, once you can just show up and go up in any comedy club in your region, it's probably time to leave. AGYEI: Ultimately, you're saying you know - once you know you want more, just get out and gamble for it and. . . WOOD: You've got to keep living in an uncomfortable zone. AGYEI: True. WOOD: You can't just work to pay bills and hopefully this club will move me up to headline or now I'll make a little more money. How is this helping you sell a script or shoot a sketch? Also, who are you surrounded by? The advantage that you have on the coast is when it's time to cast your web series or find someone with a camera who'll shoot your web series - like, you meet so many other dreamers. . . AGYEI: Right. WOOD: . . . In these cities. This is where dreams converge. Man, I did so many gigs with vets that just didn't give a damn anymore, haven't written a new joke in 10 years. And that stuff is corrosive and it rubs off on you. And some of that stuff rubbed off on me. AGYEI: Also, because I was thinking back, you know, how you were saying you were a server and stuff - how long did you, you know, work as a server and then - you know, doing standup until you made that decision to just go full standup? WOOD: For me, in my head, I was always a full-time comic. Like, you couldn't tell me I wasn't no full-time comic. I had two gigs a month. I'm, like, yeah, man. You know, it's going - it's slow right now, but that thing's going to speed up. AGYEI: Right. WOOD: I still never officially quit Golden Corral, if you want to be technical about it. AGYEI: (Laughter) You're still employed, just absent? WOOD: Yeah. I told Ms. Darlene in, like, 2000. And I said, hey, look, just don't put me on the schedule this week and I'll pick up some call-in shifts. And she said, no problem, baby. Just let me know. AGYEI: (Laughter). WOOD: And that was the last time I was in Golden Corral. I still have my apron and my name tag. AGYEI: You should just show up one day and say, hey, I'm back. WOOD: You know, I. . . (LAUGHTER)WOOD: Just show up in my uniform and get an employee discount. AGYEI: (Laughter).

Even people who have no interest in football should visit a field. So says science reporter Adam Cole, who runs NPR's YouTube channel Skunk Bear. He says a football field is the perfect spot to contemplate humanity's place in history. ADAM COLE, BYLINE: Last week, Skunk Bear got a question from listener Grant Ernhart. He recorded it up in the Canadian Rockies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GRANT ERNHART: I'm standing next to some mountains that are millions of years old, and the Earth is itself 4 and a half billion years old. How do I even wrap my mind around that length of time? COLE: That's a tough one. Humans only live 100 years or so, and we've only been around as a species for a few hundred thousand. The only way I could get my head around that 4. 5 billion years was to visit a football field. (SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLE)COLE: Here I am standing at one end zone. Let's say this is the moment in time when the Earth formed. And way down at the other end of the field, that's the present. I'm going to walk the 100 yards in between, time traveling through the whole of Earth's history. This first 10 yards - that's the first half billion years - is pretty dangerous. Our baby planet is being pummeled by space rocks. But by the time I reach the 15 or 16-yard line, things are more peaceful. And this is where scientists think life began. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: First life, 3. 8 billion years ago. COLE: It's just simple life, single cells floating in a vast ocean. And there won't be much to see for a while, so I'm going to jog the next couple billion years. New kinds of cells are showing up all the time, and some of them are figuring out how to get energy from the sun. OK, I've made it to the 50-yard line, halfway through Earth's history. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: 2. 3 billion years ago. COLE: Luckily, there's now enough oxygen in the air to let me catch my breath. But there's still no humans in sight. There's not even a single animal. So on we go past the 40, the 30, the 20. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Thirteen-yard line, 600 million years ago. COLE: Now things are really starting to pop up - fungus, anemones, mollusks. Animals are crawling on the land and in the sea. Fish give us a huge innovation - bones. (APPLAUSE)COLE: I'm passing the 10-yard line now, and there are sharks, amphibians, dinosaurs, flowers. And there up by the one-yard line is the Tyrannosaurus Rex. I've run almost the entire length of the field, billions of years, and I just got to a creature we humans think of as prehistoric. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Mass extinction 66 million years ago. COLE: Our friend the T-Rex is gone, killed off along with three-quarters of all life on Earth. Who done it? Either an asteroid, a bunch of volcanoes, climate change or some combination of all three. (SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLE)COLE: Now I'm just a few steps from the end zone and still no humans. But the age of mammals has arrived - camels, whales, the ancestors of dogs and cats, giraffes and hippos all packed into this last yard. And where are the humans?

Someone is looking right at you, waving, saying hello, they're happy to see you and you have no idea who this person is. Some of us are really good at recognizing faces. Others of us are not. To explain why, here's our social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam from NPR's Hidden Brain podcast. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Marty Doerschlag has a super power that I would love to have. He can remember a face forever. MARTY DOERSCHLAG: If I spend about 30 seconds looking at somebody, I will remember their face for years and years and years. VEDANTAM: His wife Julie says one time they were in Las Vegas sitting down for dinner at a restaurant and Marty looked at the waiter. JULIE DOERSCHLAG: He's like, oh, you waited on me in Columbus, Ohio, in X year. The guy just froze. And then he's like, oh, yeah - and I don't know how you put it together, you named the restaurant, the time, the place. It was probably 15 years before. And he said, yeah, you're right. VEDANTAM: Here's the thing, Marty's wife Julie, she's terrible with faces. J. DOERSCHLAG: I've had a lot of uncomfortable situations forgetting people and have been accused of being a snob. VEDANTAM: Now, you might think that with his gift, Marty could at least be Julie's crutch. But it doesn't always work out that way. M. DOERSCHLAG: If we're in a place, I'll always - sometimes and I whisper in the back of her ear that's Jim, you know, who works at so-and-so. J. DOERSCHLAG: Well, sometimes he doesn't catch me in time. I think we were at one of your friend's apartments, a guy came in and I went up and hugged him and said, oh, it's so good to see you again. And Marty's friend leaned over and said why is Julie hugging the caterer? So. . . M. DOERSCHLAG: Oh, yeah, I remember that, too, and I. . . J. DOERSCHLAG: . . . Because they thought that was funny. M. DOERSCHLAG: But I saw it coming, too. I saw Julie approaching the guy. And I said to my friend - I said, watch, she's going to think that's your roommate because they look sort of - they look - I mean, they had the same color hair, I think, or something and they were the same size. And I said to him here it comes, watch. And sure enough, she did it. It was. . . J. DOERSCHLAG: But I touched him. I hugged him, so that goes into another - you have to be careful. VEDANTAM: So on the facial recognition spectrum from Marty to Julie, where do most of us fall? MIKE BURTON: I think that nobody really knew until the last few years just how bad we all are with unfamiliar faces. And it's just becoming clear now. VEDANTAM: This is Mike Burton, a professor of psychology at the University of York in the United Kingdom. He says we're remarkably bad at recognizing the faces of people we don't know very well. To make matters worse, many of us think we are great at it. Mike wanted to find out why that is, why we think we're good when in fact we're not. BURTON: So we set up this little experiment where we asked people to match pairs of faces. They just have to say are these two faces the same person or not. VEDANTAM: Volunteers were shown faces they were familiar with and faces that were unfamiliar. They were given a matching task where they were given two photos and had to tell if it was the same person. Sure enough, they were great at matching photos when it came to familiar faces. They were terrible at matching photos when it came to unfamiliar faces. That wasn't so surprising. But here's what stood out to Mike Burton. Volunteers tended to think the faces they found easy to recognize would be the faces everyone would find easy to recognize. Here's his take on what's going on. BURTON: We are fantastic at recognizing faces, those faces of people we know. We can recognize our family and friends across a huge range of conditions - you know, distances, in bad light, all kinds. But we falsely assume that this means we're quite good at faces in general, and in fact we're not. VEDANTAM: While it's funny to see our confidence in our own abilities cut down to size, there are serious implications here. Just think of every time you go through airport security and you hand over your license or your passport to the officer. BURTON: Interestingly, even professionals are really bad at it. So we did some work with passport offices last year where we showed that even passport officers find this a very difficult task and are often inaccurate. VEDANTAM: You know how sometimes the TSA officer looks at your I. D. , looks at your face, then the I. D. , then your face again? Mike says these sorts of techniques don't improve accuracy. Neither does experience. Mike has studied passport officers who've done the job for 20 years. They aren't any better than fresh recruits. Now, for Marty and Julie Doerschlag back on the quiet street in Washington, D. C. , where they live, the stakes are a lot lower when it comes to recognizing faces. For Marty, his superpower to spot faces doesn't help him fight crime. Mostly, it's a superpower for creating awkward situations. M. DOERSCHLAG: You don't want to make people feel uncomfortable. So when I have that approach with someone and they obviously don't have any idea what I'm talking about, it's just not worth it, I think, you know, to cause them that discomfort. VEDANTAM: That's not to say that things are any easier for his wife Julie at the other end of the spectrum. She no longer approaches just about anyone she catches on the street. And even when she does say hello to someone. . . J. DOERSCHLAG: So if I shake their hand, I'll say, oh, right, do I know you from somewhere? And they're like - if they say I don't think so, I said, OK, you just looked a little familiar. I'd rather err on that side then not knowing them. And if they finished the sentence, I said, yes, that's right. Good to see you again. But I don't use again until I know that they've filled in the blank. VEDANTAM: As someone in the same boat as Julie, my request for the next NPR office party, everyone please wear nametags. Shankar Vedantam, NPR News.

Researchers have found a treasure trove of fossils in a woodsy area behind the Lowe's. And each week, they invite dozens of kids to join in on the digs. Elana Gordon from member station WHYY in Philadelphia recently took a trip there. ELANA GORDON, BYLINE: Mya Mutcherson and Isabella Mazzuca cannot contain themselves. What are you doing here? ISABELLA MAZZUCA: We're going to find some fossils. MYA MUTCHERSON: We're going to find some fossils. GORDON: How do you feel about that? ISABELLA: We're pretty excited. MYA: We're pretty excited. GORDON: Who could blame them? KENNETH LACOVARA: Hey, who wants to find some fossils? UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Me. SPENCER ALBANO: These South Jersey fourth graders are on a fossil dig, a real one. Spencer Albano is armed with a plastic beach shovel. He dives right onto a big pile of dirt with a bunch of other kids. SPENCER: I've been at a museum with my dad where we kind of got to do a little tiny fossil dig. They just placed them there though. It's not real fossils. GORDON: Not like here. Welcome to Rowan University's Fossil Park. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Good luck, bud. GORDON: The mastermind behind it is Ken Lacovara, dean of the department of Earth and Environment. LACOVARA: Every kid that comes here who tries a little bit and who isn't afraid to get dirty is going to find a 65-million-year-old fossil with their own hands that they get to take home. GORDON: That's right, a 65-million-year-old fossil. Lacovara says the site is basically a bottomless pit. They're not going to run out, at least not for the next, oh, 600 years. He's been coming to this old quarry for a while. It used to be mined for its greensand. And this entire region is known for fossils dating back to when New Jersey was but an ocean floor. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: I've already found one. GORDON: Within moments, kids start running up to Lacovara with questions about their tiny discoveries. LACOVARA: This is a fossil coral right here. Yep. You know what a jellyfish is, right? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Yeah. LACOVARA: So imagine an upside-down jellyfish stuck inside a little horn. That's what it's like.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   A long time ago in South Jersey, long before a Lowe's, a Chick-Fil-A and a PetSmart were built off of Route 55, mosasaurs, crocodiles and other sea creatures ruled the area. Researchers have found a treasure trove of fossils in a woodsy area behind the Lowe's. And each week, they invite dozens of kids to join in on the digs. Elana Gordon from member station WHYY in Philadelphia recently took a trip there. ELANA GORDON, BYLINE: Mya Mutcherson and Isabella Mazzuca cannot contain themselves. What are you doing here? ISABELLA MAZZUCA: We're going to find some fossils. MYA MUTCHERSON: We're going to find some fossils. GORDON: How do you feel about that? ISABELLA: We're pretty excited. MYA: We're pretty excited. GORDON: Who could blame them? KENNETH LACOVARA: Hey, who wants to find some fossils? UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Me. SPENCER ALBANO: These South Jersey fourth graders are on a fossil dig, a real one. Spencer Albano is armed with a plastic beach shovel. He dives right onto a big pile of dirt with a bunch of other kids. SPENCER: I've been at a museum with my dad where we kind of got to do a little tiny fossil dig. They just placed them there though. It's not real fossils. GORDON: Not like here. Welcome to Rowan University's Fossil Park. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Good luck, bud. GORDON: The mastermind behind it is Ken Lacovara, dean of the department of Earth and Environment. LACOVARA: Every kid that comes here who tries a little bit and who isn't afraid to get dirty is going to find a 65-million-year-old fossil with their own hands that they get to take home. GORDON: That's right, a 65-million-year-old fossil. Lacovara says the site is basically a bottomless pit. They're not going to run out, at least not for the next, oh, 600 years. He's been coming to this old quarry for a while. It used to be mined for its greensand. And this entire region is known for fossils dating back to when New Jersey was but an ocean floor. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: I've already found one. GORDON: Within moments, kids start running up to Lacovara with questions about their tiny discoveries. LACOVARA: This is a fossil coral right here. Yep. You know what a jellyfish is, right? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Yeah. LACOVARA: So imagine an upside-down jellyfish stuck inside a little horn. That's what it's like.

You will also need to become a Greenland shark. Scientists have discovered this species can live for about 400 years and maybe even longer, as we hear in this encore report from NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The first time Julius Nielsen ever saw Greenland shark, he was working on a research vessel that was studying other Arctic fish. JULIUS NIELSEN: One day we, by accident, caught a Greenland shark. It was a really a big one, and everyone went up and saw this interesting animal. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It looked different than a great white shark, but it had the shark fins and big teeth. Nielsen was intrigued. NIELSEN: You don't really expect sharks to be swimming around between icebergs and things like that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He soon learned that scientists know almost nothing about the Greenland shark. NIELSEN: Perhaps, the biggest of the mysteries was how old these apparently very slow-growing sharks get. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Biologists had some hints that these sharks grow less than a centimeter a year, but adult sharks can be over 16 feet long. So if they were really slow-growing, they'd have to live a long time. To test that idea, Nielsen teamed up with some colleagues at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark where he works as well as researchers in other countries. They obtained 28 female Greenland sharks that were caught accidentally, and then they used radiocarbon dating techniques on the lenses of the sharks' eyes. The results were astonishing. These sharks live longer than any other creature advanced enough to have a backbone. NIELSEN: We only expected that the sharks might be very old. And it was of course a very big surprise to learn that it was actually the oldest vertebrate animal in the world. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The most likely age of the biggest, oldest shark was about 390 years. But there is some uncertainty in that estimate. NIELSEN: What we can say is that it was with 95 percent certainty between 272 and 512 years old. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The results appear in the journal Science, and they impressed Steven Austad. He studies the biology of aging at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. STEVEN AUSTAD: It's a fascinating paper, and it certainly moves back to the vertebrate longevity record by a substantial amount. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That record was held by the bowhead whale. Austad says its maximum lifespan has been shown to be at least 211 years. And while you hear other tales of long-lived turtles or fish, they're hard to verify. AUSTAD: The reports are virtually all anecdotal. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says the Greenland shark age estimates are convincing. And if these sharks really can live as long as five centuries. . . AUSTAD: That means the pilgrims, you know, may have been around the same time some shark that's swimming around now was born. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Austad studies a kind of clam that can live for more than 500 years. Scientists know that because its shell has annual growth lines that can be counted like the rings inside a tree. He notes that the oldest specimens of this clam have come from waters near Iceland, and the bowhead whale and Greenland shark also both live far up north. AUSTAD: So there does seem to be something that's attributable to cold or living in the cold that may confer longevity. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says it would be great to figure out what that icy secret is. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

The nearly $9 billion observatory will replace the aging Hubble Space Telescope, and astronomers are giddy about the wealth of new information they expect to gain if they get the telescope to work. NPR's Joe Palca reports. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: A virtual army of scientists and engineers has been laboring to get the new telescope ready for launch. Astrophysicist and systems engineer Begona Vila is a relative newcomer on the project. BEGONA VILA: Oh, only 10 years. PALCA: Vila works at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. It's here that the telescope's mirrors and instruments are frozen, shaken and rattled to make sure they'll survive their trip to a spot a million miles from Earth. Unlike Hubble, the James Webb telescope is primarily designed to look at the universe at what's called infrared wavelengths. This allows it to peer through dust clouds and to see how the earliest stars and galaxies formed. But to work properly, infrared telescopes have to be kept cold - very cold. Vila says the Webb telescope uses a multi-layered sunshield to protect it from the sun's heat. VILA: That's like a big umbrella - beach umbrella - so we keep that facing the sun and the Earth so all the heat on it dissipates - all the heat through the layers. So that allows all the instruments to cool to the temperatures that we need. PALCA: Now, the sunshield is big - about the size of a tennis court. And for launch, it has to fit into a much smaller space - about the size of a school bus. So the sunshield has to fold up, as does the large main mirror and a variety of other essential instruments. The unfolding takes place in a carefully choreographed sequence of steps over two weeks. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Solar panels extend. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: Antenna deployment.

VILA: We do as much testing as we can, as thorough a test as we can. And we also have multiple review teams that check results and make sure that we are not missing anything and that, you know, we are doing the best we can to confirm everything is going to work.

A while back, we asked you to challenge astrophysicist and NPR blogger Adam Frank with your questions about physics, astronomy or science in general. You did. And Adam Frank is here with some answers. Hi, there. ADAM FRANK, BYLINE: Great to be back. SHAPIRO: All right. Today's question comes from Randall Russell (ph). He tweeted to ask how the search for dark matter is going, asking, what are the prevailing theories? Adam, first remind us what dark matter is. FRANK: Right now, when we think of dark matter, we think of it as, like, a cloud of invisible particles, right? So it's definitely - it's a particle. . . SHAPIRO: Do you mean literally invisible, or just not detectable by, like, a telescope? FRANK: Here's the cool thing. It's literally invisible in the sense that - like, you know, when you put your hand on the table, why does your hand stop, right? It's because the matter in the particle and the matter in your hand are interacting right there, exerting forces on each other so your hand doesn't just pass through the table. SHAPIRO: Uh-huh. FRANK: But these dark-matter particles barely interact with everything else, right? So right now right - if there is dark matter, right now there is a stream of dark-matter particles passing through you. And they're like ghosts in a sense. They just barely ever interact with any other kind of matter except through gravity, which is actually pretty weak. SHAPIRO: Wait. So we're not just talking about stuff that's light-years away. We're talking about stuff that is here now. . . FRANK: Oh, yeah. SHAPIRO: . . . On Earth. . . FRANK: If dark matter. . . SHAPIRO: . . . Around us? FRANK: If dark matter exists - so the way to think of it - there's a - you know, think about the galaxy. We think of the galaxy as being this beautiful pinwheel sort of thing. If dark matter's true, that's not the galaxy. The actual galaxy is this giant ball of particles, this giant gas of dark-matter particles. And that's where most of the matter is, right? The irony of dark matter and dark energy is most of the universe seems to be in this dark, invisible, non-interactable - or barely interactable - form. SHAPIRO: But, ultimately, it sounds like the answer to the question, how goes the search for dark matter, is pretty much the way it's been going, which is that there's no real progress. FRANK: When it comes to the direct detection, yeah, there's no real progress. We're doing lots of interesting studies. And we're putting limits on them. But nobody's found a direct detection. There's been no direct detection. But if you're talking about this sort of seeing the effects of what we think is dark matter, that's getting better and better all the time. We are definitely convinced that something is going on out there, whether it's dark matter - or we're going to have to invent something else - that is still for the future to decide. SHAPIRO: And by out there, you mean also in here. FRANK: Yes, in here. We're talking about the fundamental structure of the universe, right? We think of the universe as being all of this stuff that we can touch. But what we're - you know, if dark matter and dark energy is true, actually, that's like the pond scum on top of this giant, dark ocean. Most of the universe, if this is true, is going to be in a dark form. SHAPIRO: Is there a reason we should care about this? FRANK: On your day-to-day life, probably, you know, not. But, you know, if all of us are concerned with our being - right? We all know that we're going to die someday. And we wonder, like, wow, what's the universe? What's going on? And, you know, this is an (laughter) essential answer about what's going on - that it could be that most of the universe is in this other invisible form.

The alternative, lab-grown diamonds, are finally emerging as a real competitor after nearly a half-century of research. Technology has advanced now to the point that it's possible for these labs to churn out huge, white diamonds - just the type you might want to wear. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on how this is changing the diamond industry. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: There's a company outside of Washington, D. C. , called WD Lab Grown Diamonds. Yarden Tsach runs the place. He unwraps a little parcel of white tissue paper to show me a sparkly diamond. YARDEN TSACH: So this will be a round stone that is about two carats. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It looks like, you know, your typical engagement ring stone. TSACH: Yeah, yeah. And this is what we do. GREENFIELDBOYCE: What they do is make diamonds. Tsach takes me into the lab. He doesn't let me get a close look at the machines, but I peek through a window. He says inside each machine is a vacuum chamber. At the bottom, they put a little bit of solid diamond. That's the seed for diamond growing. Then they add gases to the chamber and microwaves. This creates a reaction that deposits more and more carbon onto the seed, building the diamond up until it's big enough to look good on a ring. TSACH: On most of the cases on the floor here it will think about eight weeks. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And let's be clear - this isn't cubic zirconia or some fake. TSACH: So it is diamond. It's not something else. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But compared with diamonds mined from the ground, it can be more than 30 percent cheaper. That means people can buy a bigger diamond. TSACH: The market is huge. We cannot satisfy the demand. We're expanding, and we still cannot satisfy the demand. GREENFIELDBOYCE: This is just one of a bunch of diamond growing companies out there. Manmade diamonds are now appearing at tony retailers, like Barneys New York, which introduced them in October as a high-tech, eco-friendly alternative to mined gems. To see how all of this is going over it with the traditional diamond industry, I headed to New York City's famous diamond district. This one block of West 47th Street is crammed with shop windows filled with glittering diamonds. Right around the corner is the International Gemological Institute. It grades diamonds on the famous four Cs - cut, clarity, carats and color. David Weinstein is the executive director. DAVID WEINSTEIN: I deal with diamond all day long for three decades. To me, diamonds aren't anything spectacular. You know, it's hard to get me to say wow. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He pulls out some envelopes from a stack on his cluttered desk. WEINSTEIN: And these are all laboratory-grown. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says in the old days, the rare lab-grown diamonds you'd see would be yellow or brownish - not any more. WEINSTEIN: The quality has got to the point where they're astonishingly white. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Lots of these diamonds come into his lab, and there's going to be a lot more. A recent report from the investment firm Morgan Stanley found that lab-grown diamonds currently make up maybe 1 percent of the global market, but it predicted that could grow to as much as 7 to 15 percent in the next few years. The Federal Trade Commission says gemstone marketers must be truthful about exactly what they're selling. WEINSTEIN: I think there'll always be a distinction between what came out of the ground - what took millions and millions of years to make - and what was made in the last, you know, 72 hours. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Weinstein can tell the difference between natural and lab-grown diamonds. For one thing, companies often laser-inscribe their manufactured diamonds, putting words like lab-grown right on them. But even if they didn't, Weinstein has microscopes and other instruments that can reveal a diamond's origin. WEINSTEIN: We're not fooled. We feel a hundred percent confident that's something we can do, you know, all the time. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The problem is while bigger diamonds generally get tested, a significant part of the diamond trade is very small stones. They're used to accent larger gems, or you might have a ring studded with teeny diamonds. WEINSTEIN: For many manufacturers who make jewelry with small stones, it's just not economically feasible for them to send 10,000 stones into a laboratory and pay the expense to have every stone tested. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Already there's been cases of undisclosed lab-grown diamonds getting mixed in with bulk batches of little diamonds. A few weeks ago, the U. S. jewelry Council hosted a meeting in New York for major players in the diamond business to discuss how to deal with this threat. One solution is new testing technologies. The Gemological Institute of America is a non-profit research institute. Its gleaming office building looms over the diamond district. Tom Moses is the chief research officer in this lab. He shows me a prototype of a machine that can test incredibly small diamonds in bulk. It looks like a glass box the size of a refrigerator with tubes and moving metal parts. TOM MOSES: So you see all the little diamonds? GREENFIELDBOYCE: No, I don't. MOSES: Down there? You see them going in this white tray being loaded and picked up? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Oh, those are diamonds. MOSES: Yeah. There's thousands in there. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They're the size of poppy seeds. Testing each one takes about two seconds and costs eight cents. The machine sorts the diamonds into either lab-grown or natural. Moses says his organization doesn't have any bias for one over the other. MOSES: That's not our job to determine, you know, what's the right kind of diamond for an individual. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But as lab-grown diamonds become more common, he thinks it's important that anyone buying a diamond is clear on whether it's mined or manufactured. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  Most diamonds are formed deep within the Earth, and sometimes the way they are mined can raise environmental and ethical concerns. The alternative, lab-grown diamonds, are finally emerging as a real competitor after nearly a half-century of research. Technology has advanced now to the point that it's possible for these labs to churn out huge, white diamonds - just the type you might want to wear. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on how this is changing the diamond industry. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: There's a company outside of Washington, D. C. , called WD Lab Grown Diamonds. Yarden Tsach runs the place. He unwraps a little parcel of white tissue paper to show me a sparkly diamond. YARDEN TSACH: So this will be a round stone that is about two carats. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It looks like, you know, your typical engagement ring stone. TSACH: Yeah, yeah. And this is what we do. GREENFIELDBOYCE: What they do is make diamonds. Tsach takes me into the lab. He doesn't let me get a close look at the machines, but I peek through a window. He says inside each machine is a vacuum chamber. At the bottom, they put a little bit of solid diamond. That's the seed for diamond growing. Then they add gases to the chamber and microwaves. This creates a reaction that deposits more and more carbon onto the seed, building the diamond up until it's big enough to look good on a ring. TSACH: On most of the cases on the floor here it will think about eight weeks. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And let's be clear - this isn't cubic zirconia or some fake. TSACH: So it is diamond.

C. , pizza restaurant. He says he was investigating online claims that Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager John Podesta were running a child sex trafficking ring from the basement of that restaurant. Now, these online claims are false and have been repeatedly debunked, but it got us wondering what would drive a person to believe wild stories like this, especially when there are so many facts that clearly disprove them. So we called up Viren Swami, a professor of social psychology at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge in the United Kingdom. The psychology of conspiracy theories is among his research interests, and I started by asking him if there's a profile of the kind of a person who tends to believe in conspiracy theories. VIREN SWAMI: There are a number of psychological traits that we have found to be associated with belief in conspiracy theories. I would suggest that profiling the conspiracy theorist is going to be quite difficult because, A, there are a range of different conspiracy theories, and B, I think the conspiracy narrative itself is believed by so many people that to come to a profile that fits everyone just wouldn't be possible. MARTIN: How is this different from people who are just, say, bigots - you know, who just adhere to certain fixed beliefs about certain people? SWAMI: I think they can be separate. I think there are some times when they may be inherently linked. But I think they're very different narratives, and they're very different belief systems. I think one of the things about conspiracy theories is - particularly in the United States is that nationally representative surveys suggests that up to about 50 percent of the population believe in at least one conspiracy theory. And there aren't any clear ideological divides. So you find conspiracist ideation among the left wing, among the middle ground, among the right wing. Now, the content of the conspiracy theories might differ. So a common right-wing conspiracy theory would be the Obama birther conspiracy theory, whereas a left-wing conspiracy theory might be this idea that the financial crisis was intentionally caused in order to extend the power of the Federal Reserve. So the content might change, but the prevalence of it doesn't seem to differ whether you're left-wing or right-wing. I think some people who believe in conspiracy theories believe in those ideas because it restores a sense of agency. It gives them a sense of power. It gives them a sense that they can do something about the world. Now, one of the things we find quite consistently is that people who believe in conspiracy theories tend to be alienated, tend to be divorced from mainstream politics. MARTIN: The New York Times in reporting on this recounts a recent poll conducted by Fairleigh Dickinson University that says that 63 percent of registered American voters believe in at least one political conspiracy theory. Now, why might that be, particularly in a country like the United States where people really pride themselves on being optimistic and can-do? Why would that be such a pervasive part of the character of our politics? SWAMI: I think there are going to be lots of different explanations for that. I think one explanation would center on the basis that a huge swathe of the American population feel disaffected, feel alienated. They don't feel like big politics represents them. One of the other things I think - as an outsider looking in at American politics, I think one of the big changes we've seen is the use of a conspiracy narrative as a means of mobilizing people. So Trump and the people around him are using a conspiracy narrative in my view to - not just to kind of have an argument with people but actually to mobilize people, to use it as a way of getting people involved in a campaign. And I think that was one of the big changes for me. I don't think historically it's incredibly rare to see that actually happen. MARTIN: I'm wondering if what your take is on the effect of the Internet on this propensity to believe conspiracy theories. I think that one might assume that access to more information would attenuate this because people can easily find out that what they think is true is not true or that there are countervailing facts. But it doesn't seem to work that way. SWAMI: Human beings have a very natural tendency to take in information that fits their own perspective of the world. And we tend to reject information or reject evidence that we disagree with. And we do that for a very simple reason. We don't like it when we feel wrong. We don't like it when people tell us we're wrong because that damages our psychological well-being. We don't like thinking that our view of the world, our perspective of the world is incorrect. So what tends to happen is that we look for information; we look for evidence that fits what we already know or what we already believe, and we try to avoid information or evidence that we either disagree with or that we know doesn't fit with our perspective. And if someone comes along and says, here's the evidence, your natural tendency's actually to rehearse arguments against that evidence. MARTIN: So what does one do? I mean what does one do because people who are in the information-disseminating business as you are and as we are, frankly, tend to believe that, you know, the facts matter and that this is important and that if you continue to kind of repeat the truth, that that somehow drives out the false narrative. That doesn't seem to be the case, so is there another way we should be thinking about this? SWAMI: I think the first thing I would say is that we need to teach people and teach everyone how to be better critical thinkers, how to use information, how to understand pieces of information and how to look at information and work out whether it's good or bad information. That for me is the first step. But I don't think that's going to be enough. I think if you kind of go along with this idea that conspiracy theories are more likely to emerge when people feel disaffected, when people feel alienated, then the natural outcome of that - the natural answer to what we should do is that we should be promoting greater democratic access. We should allow for everyone to be part of a democratic process in which they have a say, in which they have a voice. And once you start to have that, I think you will start to see the conspiracy theories start to diminish. MARTIN: That's Viren Swami. He's a professor of social psychology at Anglia Ruskin University. That's based in Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Thank you so much for speaking with us. SWAMI: Thank you.

Earlier I spoke with Eric Holthaus, a leading voice in this social-media-driven archiving campaign. He's a meteorologist and hosts \"Warm Regards,\" a podcast on climate change. We started by talking about what's driving the effort given that as far as our science reporting team can see, there's been nothing to suggest the incoming administration plans to dump or delete data. ERIC HOLTHAUS: I wouldn't expect the Trump team to come out and say, you know, by the way, we're going to just delete all of the work that you guys have done for the last decades. I think the most likely scenario is that there will be across-the-board budget cuts in the realm of climate science across multiple parts of the government. NASA and the EPA and the Department of Energy come to mind. People that work there are going to have to make tough choices, and maybe that means not being able to maintain data sets in the same way that they have over the last several years. CORNISH: All right, so help us understand what kind of data is out there. HOLTHAUS: There are climate data sets that are scattered all throughout the federal government. The ones that come to mind are those at NASA and NOAA that take the temperature of the planet from weather stations, from satellites, from ocean buoys. There are satellites that take an assessment periodically of forest fires. There are assessments of Arctic sea ice. Any and all knowledge that we have of the climate system - in many cases, the U. S. government is the leader on that in the entire world. And scientists all over the world rely on the data that's collected here. Sometimes these data sets are only stored in United States government servers, so there hasn't really been an effort to catalog those in other countries because we haven't thought it was necessary before. CORNISH: So you believe this is necessary now, and you put out a call online, on Twitter and social media. Who's helping you, you know, and how are they saving this data? HOLTHAUS: So these were climate scientists or people that use climate data that volunteered their knowledge of what is most important. We also have developers, tech companies that are working on their own time. We have data storage companies that have volunteered space. We have computer science professors. It's truly remarkable the quick attention that it's received and the number of people that are volunteering to help. CORNISH: Is it any more helpful to have all of this data kind of scattered around the world and on random servers? HOLTHAUS: So part of the reason that we are interested in storing this data either on the cloud or scattered across the world is that it's harder for someone who maybe maliciously would want to destroy it to access it. So there are ways of keeping this data open and publicly available and uninterrupted during any sort of era (laughter) of our government that might be hostile to climate science. And it definitely feels like we are entering a time when climate scientists feel the need to sort of hunker down and preserve what they've done so far. This project is helping them to continue their work uninterrupted. CORNISH: What's your response to people who look at this and see paranoia, right? Donald Trump can't kind of walk into some computing center in the government and hit a button that says delete. HOLTHAUS: Sure. And again, the goal in this project is not out of some paranoia of a conspiracy to erase knowledge from humanity. It's to make sure that we are advocating for climate science in the sense that these scientists have devoted their lives, and they are now going to be operating under a government that is hostile to climate science. And we don't really know what to expect. We're acting out of an abundance of caution. It's not because of something that we think will happen. It's because we can't honestly project what might happen anymore. CORNISH: Eric Holthaus is a meteorologist. He writes for Slate and is host of \"Warm Regards,\" a podcast about climate change.

And, of course, when the future seems so uncertain, it's normal to want to look to the past for lessons to people like Gandhi or Mother Teresa or Nelson Mandela. You know, how would they have reacted to what's happening in the world today? ELIZABETH LESSER: Everyone loves to lionize, let's say, Dr. King. RAZ: Yeah. LESSER: And we know the words to his speeches, and it all sounds so wonderful. But ask to really put it into practice with your kid, your mate, the jerk boss. Suddenly, all that idealism we love to talk about goes out the window, and we don't do it. RAZ: Yeah. LESSER: And I am interested in how we do it in the smallest ways every day. RAZ: This is Elizabeth Lesser. She's a co-founder of the Omega Institute. LESSER: One of the largest teaching centers in the world for all sorts of subjects from healing yourself to healing society. RAZ: And that kind of healing, Elizabeth says, it doesn't start with big, sweeping movements like the kind led by Martin Luther King. It starts with people, with individuals choosing to change the way they think about conflict. LESSER: It's rare that you have a conflict and two people or two groups who are equally mature in their desire or capacity to get there. That doesn't mean it can't happen. What it means is that one person has to take the lead, has to be bigger. I call that kind of person the new first responder. The person who takes the first step in a conflict toward the other, those are brave people. Here's a name it would be great if everyone knew. Her name is Antoinette Tuff. Have you ever heard of her name, Antoinette Tuff? RAZ: No. LESSER: We should. We should know her name. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: (Unintelligible) address of your emergency? ANTOINETTE TUFF: Yes, ma'am. I'm second avenue and the school. And the gentleman said tell them to hold down the police officers from coming. And he said he going to start shooting. So tell them to back off. LESSER: She was the receptionist at an elementary school a few years ago. A young man burst into the school with a machine gun and lots of loads of ammunition, held hundreds of kids captive. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TUFF: He said he don't care if he die. He don't have nothing to live for. And he says he's not mentally stable. LESSER: She went into the room, and she started talking to the young man. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TUFF: It's going to be all right, sweetie. I just want you to know that I love you though, OK? And I'm proud of you. That's a good thing that you've given up and don't worry about it. We all go through something in life. LESSER: She started talking about her divorce and her disabled child. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TUFF: You know I tried to commit suicide last year after my husband left me? But look at me now. I'm still working and everything is OK. LESSER: She finally talked him down. He finally gave himself in. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED OFFICER: Do not move. Get on the ground. RAZ: Antoinette Tuff that day on the phone with 911. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TUFF: I'm going to tell you something, baby, I ain't got this (unintelligible) days of my life. degree. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: But you did great. RAZ: She somehow found a way to see parts of herself in that gunman and not to demonize him, but to connect in spite of the conflict that was playing out. And, obviously, it took incredible courage to do that. But Elizabeth Lesser says it's a capacity we all have. Here she is on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)LESSER: I'm deeply disturbed by the ways in which all of our cultures are demonizing the other. This is why I'm launching a new initiative, and it's to help all of us, myself included, to counteract the tendency to otherize. And I realize we're all busy people, so don't worry. You can do this on a lunch break. I'm calling my initiative take the other to lunch. If you are a Republican, you can take a Democrat to lunch or if you're a Democrat, think of it as taking a Republican to lunch because there is no shortage of the other right in your own neighborhood, maybe that person who worships at the mosque or the church or the synagogue down the street or someone from the other side of the abortion conflict - or maybe your brother-in-law who doesn't believe in global warming. (LAUGHTER)LESSER: Anyone whose lifestyle may frighten you or whose point of view makes smoke come out of your ears. RAZ: So you are a person of the left, right? Fair to say? LESSER: Fair to say. RAZ: Fair to say. OK. And you gave this talk back in 2010, we should say. And you started to reach out to people on the right and say, hey, like, you know, let's have lunch? LESSER: Yes. RAZ: And how'd it go? LESSER: In some cases, really well, to the point where I'm still in touch with these people. And in some cases OK. RAZ: Just, like, weird, uncomfortable conversations? LESSER: I made sure we got at least to comfortable. And it was kind of sobering to know that we were never going to see eye to eye. But I would have to say in all the cases - and, of course, this is a self-selected group of people who would even say yes to it - in all of the cases, there was a sense of gratitude. Thank you for doing this. No one from your side has ever done this. RAZ: So it's not about changing someone's mind, and it's not about having your mind changed? It's just about making a connection? LESSER: We'll never change everyone's minds. We're not supposed to. Diversity is good. We need each other's ideas. Now, I'm not talking about racist ideas or misogynistic ideas or cruel or criminal ideas. I'm talking about most of us who have very varied experiences, needs and ideas. It's really about believing that it's an important part of healing our country. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)LESSER: A couple of weeks ago, I took a conservative Tea Party woman to lunch. I asked her why her side makes such outrageous allegations and lies about my side. What? She wanted to know. Like we're a bunch of elitist, morally corrupt terrorist lovers. Well, she was shocked. She thought my side beat up on her side way more often, that we called them brainless gun-toting racists. And we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people we actually know. And since we had established some trust, we believed in each other's sincerity. We agreed we'd speak up in our own communities when we witnessed the kind of otherizing (ph) talk that can wound and fester into paranoia and then be used by those on the fringes to incite. RAZ: So when you gave this talk in 2010 about this initiative, I mean, you said, I'm going to launch this initiative. It's going to be called Take the Other to Lunch. We're going to go out there. (Unintelligible) Super idealistic. It's - I mean, now things are obviously much, much more divided than they were then. And I wonder whether your talk almost strikes you as kind of naive, you know? Or do you hear it and think, no, you know, those principles still apply? LESSER: More than ever. And I actually don't think we're more divided than we were. I think it's more evident. It's more evident because of the internet. It's more evident because feelings have been whipped up by a very divisive election. And I think it's good that it's out in the open. I think it's better that people actually are saying what they feel. Especially, people are saying, I'm not heard. I don't have a voice in this country. That's a place where we can meet because I know people react often to this idea of Take the Other to Lunch as if it's some Pollyanna strategy and I'm naive. I'm not naive. I know how hard it is to get along. But I also know that if we allow ourselves into the gridlock of tribalism, we're in trouble. Talking to each other instead of talking about each other is not some kind of nicey-nice (ph) idea. It's the difference between societies falling apart and societies getting something wonderful done.

And for much of the last century, California had one of the most active sterilization programs in the country. A state law from 1909 authorized the surgery for people judged to have, quote, \"mental disease which may have been inherited. \" That law remained on the books until 1979. University of Michigan Professor Alexandra Minna Stern has been working to identify people who were forcibly sterilized under California's program. Welcome. ALEXANDRA MINNA STERN: Glad to be here. CHANG: So did you find any patterns among the 20,000 names you discovered? STERN: We have found a variety of patterns, and we keep discovering more. For example, we have determined that patients with Spanish surnames were much more likely to be sterilized than other patients, demonstrating that there was a racial bias in the sterilization program. One of the interesting things we discovered is that initially more men were sterilized. But by the 1930s, that pattern started to change. So that by the '40s and '50s, more women were being sterilized. CHANG: So these people that were picked for the sterilization program - they were picked because of so-called, quote, \"mental disease which may have been inherited. \" Can you give us some examples? STERN: Well, it's very important to take that terminology with many historical grains of salt. It often meant people who were poor, people who lacked education, perhaps didn't speak sufficient English to make it through school and so on. But what it meant for those who were enacting the law were people who were determined to have low IQs, people with certain psychiatric disorders. Often, the way it was used was much more as a catch-all category. For example, young girls who are from broken homes - maybe they'd suffered some abuse in their family - they ended up out in the streets, not going to school. They were picked up by juvenile authorities. They would be sent to a girls' home, and then, eventually, they would be sent to a place like the Sonoma State Home, where they would be sterilized. CHANG: You've determined there may be more than 800 of these people still alive. Have you found anyone who is still alive? STERN: I haven't found anyone who's still alive. I have been contacted by relatives, particularly people who contacted me whose aunts or uncles were sterilized at some of these institutions. What we've done is we've generated the most reliable estimate. So what we could do is we could go and look at the records - and that's where I'd like to work with the state of California because what we've essentially created is a eugenics registry - we can look at the records and identify likely individuals and then reach out and contact them. However, I would like to mention that in the two states that have enacted policies for monetary reparations for sterilization victims, in North Carolina and Virginia, the state took the lead in creating a kind of committee and a registry. And because it was the state seeking to provide some redress and to acknowledge this history, the state was able to actively set up a program and seek out and try to identify individuals. It's not that they should come to me, it's that they should go to the state. But our research can help facilitate that process.

You've got the regular stress of your job. You're blowing cash on gifts. Add to that a dash of family dysfunction, and it's truly a special time. And all that anxiety, it needs a place to go. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: All right, so do you want me to just tell you my dream? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: My anxiety dream - well, one of them anyway. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: So you want both my anxiety dreams? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: I have three different anxiety dreams to share with you. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I am amazed that people don't always have anxiety dreams. The only dreams I can remember are anxiety dreams. CHANG: Why do we have these anxiety dreams? This seemed like a really good excuse to pry into our coworkers' personal lives, so we asked some of them to tell us about their deepest, darkest, most stressful dreams. And maybe we tipped the scales by asking our coworkers because a lot of the anxiety dreams they told us about were about work. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: We're in the middle of a show, Morning Edition. It's David Greene and Steve. All of a sudden, all the power goes out. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: I am in there directing the live show. Stuff is happening. News is breaking, and suddenly I lose my eyesight. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #6: And someone walks into the studio and hands me this little kitten. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: There's a giant clock on the wall. And it's ticking, ticking, ticking up to 4 o'clock. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: And I have to direct the show through feel. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: And I am running, sprinting for the studio. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #7: You get in the studio, the on-air light goes on, and you don't have your script. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: And she can't figure out how to use the mouse. And so I took the mouse from her, but the mouse was suddenly a real-life mouse, like, a little furry mouse, like, a white one. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: At the same time, while I'm trying to run and run and run, I have a vision of Robert Siegel, and he's going. . . ROBERT SIEGEL, BYLINE: Where's Stu? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #7: And you have absolute lockjaw. Nothing comes out. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #8: And that's it. And I just have it all the time. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #9: There was a period when I had these every night for a month. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Laughter) I died. Like, I didn't die in reality, but I felt horrible, horrible, like, just skin-crawling anxiety. And then I woke up. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #10: So what does it all mean? ROBERT STICKGOLD: It looks like our dreams serve a function of trying to identify, first of all, information that we have, things that we've learned, stuff that we know that is incomplete in some ways. So we haven't solved some problems. CHANG: That's Robert Stickgold of Harvard Medical School. He's a cognitive neuroscientist who studies sleep, dreams and memory. STICKGOLD: And when the brain identifies these areas with lingering questions, it actually spends a lot of time while we're asleep trying to solve those problems. And it tends to be situations where it's imagining how things might turn out. And these are perfect examples. These are things that people worry about might happen. And then it sort of says, OK, let's run with that and see where it goes. CHANG: I mean, as we heard, work obviously is a pretty good reason for so many anxiety dreams. But here's another common theme courtesy of NPR's Sam Sanders. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: I will be in college and there'll be a course - it's usually a mathy (ph) or science kind of class, like calculus or engineering or other things that I don't like. And I'll be going to college the whole semester but not going to that class. And then I'll get a notification that I've missed too many classes and that I have to go to the final or I'll fail everything and I'll flunk out of college and my life will be over and my mother will disown me and I'll have to move out of the house and nothing will ever go my way in life ever again. And then I try to go to the final and I flunk the final, of course. CHANG: Oh (laughter). Actually, I have a very, very similar recurring anxiety dream. So what's up with that? Are there some themes in anxiety dreams that are just more common than others? STICKGOLD: There are, absolutely. And I think it's because that there are anxieties that are more common. I've heard a Nobel laureate start a lecture by saying, I had that exam dream again last night. And the whole audience just moaned. I mean, it never stops. And I think what's going on - and that - the exam dream is an excellent example - is that we have, in the course of our lives, taken thousands of exams, each of which is a little bit traumatic. It's sort of like not death by a thousand cuts, but anxiety by a thousand cuts. So you're - when you're sleeping, your brain's sort of looking through its files, if you will, and it's saying, OK, what's not settled? What's still an issue? And it's all those exams piled on top of each other. It's such a huge pile that it sticks out like a beacon. CHANG: Do people who identify themselves as anxious people - do those people have more anxiety dreams? Or do anxiety dreams afflict all of us? STICKGOLD: Well, they certainly afflict all of us. We've done some studies where we looked at emotion in dreams, and I'm very sad to tell you that anxiety is the most common emotion reported during dreams. And in fact, dreams overall tend to be more negative than positive. And in fact, they tend to get more negative as they proceed over the course of a longer dream. It might be that people who are more anxious have more of these dreams, and certainly when you reach the extreme condition of PTSD there's no question. But they have, you know, very high frequencies of these extremely wrought, beyond anxious into terrifying dreams. CHANG: Yeah. Are there any ways people can limit the amount of anxiety dreams they have? Or are anxiety dreams just part of the human condition and there's nothing any of us can do about it? STICKGOLD: Well, those are two different questions. I think anxiety dreams are part of the human condition. I think one of the things that the brain does is it asks itself the question, what's bothering me? Because anything that's bothering me is something that I could perhaps spend some time tonight working on and trying to figure out. CHANG: I wish the brain would ask, what makes me happy tonight? STICKGOLD: I know. I know. What would I like to dream tonight? What would be fun to dream tonight? But, I mean, what you can do is you can - I mean, and it's not useful to say this - is you can be less anxious. Go on vacation. I know know when I go on vacation, I actually stop worrying. And do my dreams change? I don't think anyone's done this study. One question would be how fast can your dreams change? I don't know if we know the answer to that. CHANG: Robert Stickgold. Thank you for being with us today. STICKGOLD: It's been a dream. (SOUNDBITE OF LONDON FESTIVAL ORCHESTRA PERFORMANCE OF MAX STEINER'S \"A SUMMER PLACE THEME\") AILSA CHANG, HOST:  You don't need me to tell you this - the holidays can be really stressful. You've got the regular stress of your job. You're blowing cash on gifts. Add to that a dash of family dysfunction, and it's truly a special time. And all that anxiety, it needs a place to go. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: All right, so do you want me to just tell you my dream? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: My anxiety dream - well, one of them anyway. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: So you want both my anxiety dreams? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: I have three different anxiety dreams to share with you. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I am amazed that people don't always have anxiety dreams. The only dreams I can remember are anxiety dreams. CHANG: Why do we have these anxiety dreams? This seemed like a really good excuse to pry into our coworkers' personal lives, so we asked some of them to tell us about their deepest, darkest, most stressful dreams. And maybe we tipped the scales by asking our coworkers because a lot of the anxiety dreams they told us about were about work. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: We're in the middle of a show, Morning Edition. It's David Greene and Steve. All of a sudden, all the power goes out. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: I am in there directing the live show. Stuff is happening. News is breaking, and suddenly I lose my eyesight. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #6: And someone walks into the studio and hands me this little kitten. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: There's a giant clock on the wall. And it's ticking, ticking, ticking up to 4 o'clock. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: And I have to direct the show through feel. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: And I am running, sprinting for the studio. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #7: You get in the studio, the on-air light goes on, and you don't have your script. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: And she can't figure out how to use the mouse. And so I took the mouse from her, but the mouse was suddenly a real-life mouse, like, a little furry mouse, like, a white one. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: At the same time, while I'm trying to run and run and run, I have a vision of Robert Siegel, and he's going. . . ROBERT SIEGEL, BYLINE: Where's Stu? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #7: And you have absolute lockjaw. Nothing comes out. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #8: And that's it. And I just have it all the time. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #9: There was a period when I had these every night for a month. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Laughter) I died. Like, I didn't die in reality, but I felt horrible, horrible, like, just skin-crawling anxiety. And then I woke up. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #10: So what does it all mean? ROBERT STICKGOLD: It looks like our dreams serve a function of trying to identify, first of all, information that we have, things that we've learned, stuff that we know that is incomplete in some ways. So we haven't solved some problems. CHANG: That's Robert Stickgold of Harvard Medical School. He's a cognitive neuroscientist who studies sleep, dreams and memory. STICKGOLD: And when the brain identifies these areas with lingering questions, it actually spends a lot of time while we're asleep trying to solve those problems. And it tends to be situations where it's imagining how things might turn out. And these are perfect examples. These are things that people worry about might happen. And then it sort of says, OK, let's run with that and see where it goes. CHANG: I mean, as we heard, work obviously is a pretty good reason for so many anxiety dreams. But here's another common theme courtesy of NPR's Sam Sanders. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: I will be in college and there'll be a course - it's usually a mathy (ph) or science kind of class, like calculus or engineering or other things that I don't like. And I'll be going to college the whole semester but not going to that class. And then I'll get a notification that I've missed too many classes and that I have to go to the final or I'll fail everything and I'll flunk out of college and my life will be over and my mother will disown me and I'll have to move out of the house and nothing will ever go my way in life ever again. And then I try to go to the final and I flunk the final, of course. CHANG: Oh (laughter). Actually, I have a very, very similar recurring anxiety dream. So what's up with that? Are there some themes in anxiety dreams that are just more common than others? STICKGOLD: There are, absolutely. And I think it's because that there are anxieties that are more common. I've heard a Nobel laureate start a lecture by saying, I had that exam dream again last night. And the whole audience just moaned. I mean, it never stops. And I think what's going on - and that - the exam dream is an excellent example - is that we have, in the course of our lives, taken thousands of exams, each of which is a little bit traumatic. It's sort of like not death by a thousand cuts, but anxiety by a thousand cuts. So you're - when you're sleeping, your brain's sort of looking through its files, if you will, and it's saying, OK, what's not settled? What's still an issue? And it's all those exams piled on top of each other. It's such a huge pile that it sticks out like a beacon. CHANG: Do people who identify themselves as anxious people - do those people have more anxiety dreams? Or do anxiety dreams afflict all of us? STICKGOLD: Well, they certainly afflict all of us. We've done some studies where we looked at emotion in dreams, and I'm very sad to tell you that anxiety is the most common emotion reported during dreams. And in fact, dreams overall tend to be more negative than positive. And in fact, they tend to get more negative as they proceed over the course of a longer dream.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: That's Zack Labe, a doctoral students studying Arctic climate at the University of California, Irvine. Over Skype, he explained what's going on. He said warmer than usual air temperatures and even warmer ocean temperatures have kept Arctic waters from refreezing as much as they normally do this time of year.

He'll also look at how thick the sea ice gets. He's concerned it will remain thin, but he hasn't ruled out the opposite.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE\")SHAPIRO: OK, so what actually is going on? How does ice make this \"Star Wars\" blaster sound?

NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam brings us the story of one woman who's had to reinvent herself again and again. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Maya Shankar remembers exactly how she felt when her mom first put a violin in her hands. MAYA SHANKAR: I was immediately taken kind of by the tactile sensation of the instrument. I just loved the feeling of playing the violin. VEDANTAM: Maya practiced constantly. She got good, very good. The music you're hearing in this piece is Maya performing at age 12. (SOUNDBITE OF VIOLIN MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Her mother wanted to find a teacher who could take her to the next level. So one day when they were in New York, they stopped by Juilliard, the famous performing arts school - just walked in, no appointment. SHANKAR: We happened to run into a student in the elevator, and my mom talked to that family and said, would you mind if we just had about five or 10 minutes at the end of your lesson where Maya could play for your teacher? And they were really gracious, and they said, sure, no problem. (SOUNDBITE OF VIOLIN MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Maya played for the other student's music teacher, and she got accepted into a summer program. Soon she was taking classes at Juilliard. She was talented, hard-working. The path before her seemed clear. SHANKAR: I really wanted to be a violinist. I was so passionate about it. I never felt more comfortable than when I was performing. VEDANTAM: One day when Maya was 15, she was practicing at Itzhak Perlman's Shelter Island campus at the eastern edge of Long Island. SHANKAR: I was playing a passage from a very challenging Paganini Caprice. (SOUNDBITE OF VIOLIN MUSIC)SHANKAR: And I simply overstretched my finger on one note, and I felt like kind of a popping. (SOUNDBITE OF VIOLIN MUSIC)SHANKAR: I overstretched the tendon, and it didn't really heal as expected. VEDANTAM: It never did heal properly. Doctors finally told her she had to stop playing completely. Just like that, Maya's dream to become a concert violinist was over. SHANKAR: I was really devastated to lose something that I was completely in love with and so passionate about and that had really constituted such a large part of my life and my identity. You know, I was first and foremost a violinist. VEDANTAM: Back home for the summer in Connecticut, she started to ask herself, would she ever find anything that could make her as happy as the violin? SHANKAR: This was the summer before college. And just by luck, I was helping my parents clean their basement in Cheshire, Conn. , and I stumbled upon an old course book of my sister's. It was called \"The Language Instinct\" by Steven Pinker. VEDANTAM: Maya started reading, and the more she read, the more excited she became. SHANKAR: It really wet my appetite for learning more about the mind and for exploring in more depth kind of the brilliance of the brain. VEDANTAM: She started to study cognitive science, went on to get her Ph. D. at Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship. She got a postdoctoral fellowship. A promising career in academia lay ahead of her. But here again came another unexpected turn. SHANKAR: So over Thanksgiving break of the final year of my postdoc, I was visiting my undergraduate adviser from college. She was telling me about the U. S. Department of Agriculture's efforts to get free and reduced-price lunches into the hands of more eligible students. VEDANTAM: Students were going hungry because the process of getting certified for the lunch program was cumbersome. The Department of Agriculture came up with a simple idea. Instead of having a multistep sign-up system, states could use information they already had about poor families to help enroll children in the lunch program. SHANKAR: It's just a matter of data matching and cross-enrolling these students. But as a result of this common sense reform, you know, 12. 4 million students had access to lunches and were able to thrive at school. And I remember being so moved by this example. VEDANTAM: To Maya, it was just magical. SHANKAR: It was just like a light bulb went off in my head, and I thought, OK, this is what I need to be doing with my life. VEDANTAM: She tracked down an email address for Thomas Kalil, who was helping the Obama administration with its science policy. SHANKAR: I sent Tom a cold email (laughter). Like. . . VEDANTAM: This is the Juilliard method. SHANKAR: This is the Juilliard - this is my mom's Juilliard. I get to give her full credit for this. She is totally fearless. But cold-emailed him, and he asked me to pitch to him ideas that I had around interventions where behavioral science could improve public policy outcomes. VEDANTAM: Maya ended up joining the White House. She was asked to put together a team that could marshal ideas from social science research and apply them to public policy challenges. One problem she and her team have worked on was to ensure that kids who've been accepted to college actually go to college. Lots of them don't. They miss deadlines. They don't show up on the first day of school. The idea that Maya and her team came up with - send the students eight text messages reminding them of impending deadlines. SHANKAR: What we found was a 9 percent increase in college enrollment rates as a result of eight text messages. I mean that is really profound. Eight text messages is what I send my best friend (laughter) on any given day, and that can make the difference between a college-accepted student showing up on day one ready to learn or not going to college. VEDANTAM: This is not the work Maya Shankar thought she'd do when she was growing up. But it's the work she loves. SHANKAR: One of the great blessings of playing the violin is that it allowed me to see what it really felt like to be in love with something. There are so many ways in which passion can manifest. VEDANTAM: As the Obama administration finishes its remaining days in office, Maya Shankar is planning to leave the White House. She is preparing yet again for another transition.

But here again came another unexpected turn. SHANKAR: So over Thanksgiving break of the final year of my postdoc, I was visiting my undergraduate adviser from college. She was telling me about the U. S. Department of Agriculture's efforts to get free and reduced-price lunches into the hands of more eligible students. VEDANTAM: Students were going hungry because the process of getting certified for the lunch program was cumbersome. The Department of Agriculture came up with a simple idea. Instead of having a multistep sign-up system, states could use information they already had about poor families to help enroll children in the lunch program. SHANKAR: It's just a matter of data matching and cross-enrolling these students. But as a result of this common sense reform, you know, 12. 4 million students had access to lunches and were able to thrive at school. And I remember being so moved by this example. VEDANTAM: To Maya, it was just magical. SHANKAR: It was just like a light bulb went off in my head, and I thought, OK, this is what I need to be doing with my life. VEDANTAM: She tracked down an email address for Thomas Kalil, who was helping the Obama administration with its science policy. SHANKAR: I sent Tom a cold email (laughter). Like. . . VEDANTAM: This is the Juilliard method. SHANKAR: This is the Juilliard - this is my mom's Juilliard. I get to give her full credit for this. She is totally fearless. But cold-emailed him, and he asked me to pitch to him ideas that I had around interventions where behavioral science could improve public policy outcomes. VEDANTAM: Maya ended up joining the White House. She was asked to put together a team that could marshal ideas from social science research and apply them to public policy challenges. One problem she and her team have worked on was to ensure that kids who've been accepted to college actually go to college. Lots of them don't. They miss deadlines. They don't show up on the first day of school. The idea that Maya and her team came up with - send the students eight text messages reminding them of impending deadlines. SHANKAR: What we found was a 9 percent increase in college enrollment rates as a result of eight text messages. I mean that is really profound. Eight text messages is what I send my best friend (laughter) on any given day, and that can make the difference between a college-accepted student showing up on day one ready to learn or not going to college. VEDANTAM: This is not the work Maya Shankar thought she'd do when she was growing up. But it's the work she loves. SHANKAR: One of the great blessings of playing the violin is that it allowed me to see what it really felt like to be in love with something. There are so many ways in which passion can manifest. VEDANTAM: As the Obama administration finishes its remaining days in office, Maya Shankar is planning to leave the White House. She is preparing yet again for another transition.

It's letting scientists make changes in DNA in ways that were never possible before. NPR health correspondent Rob Stein has been tracking how this is raising hopes for new medical breakthroughs but also stirring deep fears. He joins us now to talk about what he's found. So, Rob, welcome to the program. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Nice to be here. WERTHEIMER: First of all, let's talk about this new kind of genetic engineering. What is it exactly, and what does it let scientists do? STEIN: So, Linda, first of all, it's got this kind of funny name. It's called CRISPR-Cas9. And what it does is it enables scientists to make changes in DNA much more easily and much faster than ever before. WERTHEIMER: You took us over the last year to the research labs that are using this gene modification technology in controversial ways. STEIN: So the first place I went was to a lab in California at the University of California, Davis. And scientists there are using CRISPR to do something that might sound like something out of a bad science fiction movie. They're creating embryos that are part human and part animal. And they're doing this by using CRISPR to genetically modify the embryos of farm animals, and then they're putting human stem cells into these embryos. WERTHEIMER: Why would anyone want to do that? STEIN: Well, there's a couple of reasons. One is if scientists can create cows, pigs and sheep that are partially human, that have partially human brains or other body parts, they could use them for medical research and maybe learn a lot about new ways to treat diseases like Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's or diabetes. And they're also hoping that someday they might be able to grow fully functional human organs - you know, like hearts, kidneys, livers and pancreases - that could save thousands of people who are waiting for organ transplants. WERTHEIMER: Where else did you go in your travels? STEIN: Yeah, so I also went to Stockholm. And there, scientists at the Karolinska Institute are using CRISPR to try to edit the DNA in healthy human embryos for the first time. And they're hoping to learn more about basic human embryonic development in the hopes of learning more about what causes, say, infertility and maybe come up with new ways to help women have healthy babies. WERTHEIMER: Well, that sounds mostly positive. Are people concerned about this one, too? STEIN: Well, yes, they are because the concern here is that if you do it for medical research, what's to stop other scientists to try to do it for other reasons, like, for example, to try to create designer babies that are taller or smarter or better athletes? Now, we're nowhere near being able to do anything like that. But the concern is that this could open the door to someday creating genetic haves and have-nots. WERTHEIMER: So, Rob, these CRISPR researchers are involved in projects that have tremendous promise to benefit our lives, but also raise very difficult ethical and moral questions. STEIN: That's right. That's right. And another example I could give you is I just got back from a trip to London. And there, scientists are using CRISPR to genetically modify mosquitoes that spread a mutant gene to wipe out the mosquitoes that spread the malaria parasite. And the idea there is to try to wipe out this disease that kills hundreds of thousands of people every year, most of them children. Now, the fear here is that they're using CRISPR to modify these insects with something known as a gene drive. And a gene drive spreads a genetic modification through an entire species really quickly. So something could go wrong. You know, it could wipe out an entire species of mosquito. And that could upset the delicate balance of an ecosystem some way that could maybe unleash some new epidemic or cause the ecosystem to collapse and cause famine. WERTHEIMER: So how close are we to these technologies actually doing something that would touch our lives? STEIN: So the application that probably is the closest is scientists are using CRISPR to try to genetically modify human immune system cells to attack certain cancer cells. And actually, the first patients are supposed to start receiving genetically modified human immune system cells at the University of Pennsylvania sometime next year. WERTHEIMER: A lot of hope and a lot of room for debate. Rob Stein, NPR's health correspondent. Thank you for joining us. STEIN: Oh, sure, great to be here.

The astronomer Vera Rubin discovered evidence of dark matter in the 1980s. She died over the weekend at the age of 88. Vera Rubin and her work influenced many other scientists, including Risa Wechsler, a professor of physics at Stanford University. She joins us now from Miami. Welcome to the program. RISA WECHSLER: Thank you. SHAPIRO: Since Dr. Rubin's legacy is so tied to dark matter, I think we have to start by briefly explaining what dark matter is and why it's so important to science. WECHSLER: It's really hard to overstate the importance of her contribution to how we understand the universe today. What she discovered was that around every single galaxy there is extra matter that we can't see, that doesn't emit light. And that's really foundational to how we understand how the universe evolves and how galaxies form. So it's really at the heart of what the universe is made of and why we are here in our galaxy today. SHAPIRO: If that was her impact on science, can you tell us a little bit about her impact on you as a younger scientist? WECHSLER: Absolutely. She was an incredible role model for me and for really generations of scientists for a couple of reasons. The first was just essentially her relentless curiosity and the way she went about her work. You know, as a woman scientist of her generation, she faced pretty extreme barriers at many stages, you know, including she was the first woman to be able to use the telescope that she did her groundbreaking work - and essentially just whenever there was a barrier, she found a way around. So, you know, I think that's an incredible, inspiring story for me and for many scientists who face barriers in their work. SHAPIRO: Apart from knocking down barriers in her own path, she was generally a very strong advocate for women in science. How much do you think she can be credited with shrinking the gender gap for women in science? WECHSLER: Well, she certainly played a role through her own example and through her advocacy. I've talked to many astronomers even in the last day who have their own stories about how Vera took them seriously, you know, even when they were students, sort of inspired them to take their own work seriously. And in addition to that, she really pushed at a broader national level for women in science and for generally broadening participation in science, and for the role of science in society. SHAPIRO: Do you think that at the end of her life she was satisfied that women had achieved as much as they had the potential to? Or were there still barriers to women in science even today? WECHSLER: I think Vera saw that those barriers still do exist both within science itself and within society. She had four children, all of whom were scientists. And she told this story about how her daughter went to a meeting where she was the only woman. It was very sad for her. So I think she recognized that there was progress, but that it really had been too slow. SHAPIRO: Do you think that during her life she got the recognition she deserved? WECHSLER: Well, she's certainly very well-recognized among astronomers and cosmologists. But I think although she did get many of the top awards, given the importance of the work, given how foundational it is to how we understand the universe that there's a strong feeling that she was certainly deserving of a Nobel Prize, which in physics has not gone to a woman in more than 50 years. SHAPIRO: When did you last speak to her? WECHSLER: I last had the chance to speak to Vera at a conference which was in honor of her 80th birthday. And she was just so gratified to see this entire room full of cosmologists whose field essentially was started by her foundational work. SHAPIRO: Dr. Risa Wechsler.

There, I said it. But it's true. You've got to read the same books every night. You've got to play the same games. I've got to eat chicken nuggets and broccoli every night. NPR's Shankar Vedantam is here to help me through the boredom of parenting. Hi, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: (Laughter). Hi, Rachel. How are you? MARTIN: I'm well. And I don't want anyone to get the impression that I don't love my children, and I appreciate all the time we spend, but it is hard. There are parts of parenting that are boring, and I need your help. VEDANTAM: That's right. So what we're going to do now Rachel is we're going to read \"Goodnight Moon\" for the next three minutes over and over again to see if you can tolerate it. No, actually. . . . MARTIN: No, let's not do that. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). So researchers are trying to figure out how satiation works in the brain. Now this work has lots of implications. Obviously, as a parent, you get bored with some aspects of parenting, and you want to know how to not be bored. MARTIN: Yes. VEDANTAM: If you're a marketer or a chef, it would be nice to not have customers get bored with the things that you make so that they're going to come back and buy those things over and over again. MARTIN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: I was speaking with Julio Sevilla. He's a marketing professor at the University of Georgia. What he did is he ran a series of experiments along with Barbara Kahn and Jiao Zhang. They had volunteers do a number of things. One thing they found is that a lot of satiation is actually happening in the mind. In your mind, Rachel, satiation is not just about what you've done, but about what you think you're going to do. When volunteers feel that something they are doing at the present is going to be identical to something they will do in the future, they satiate more quickly in the here and now. But if they are told to imagine that they're going to experience variety in the future, they feel less satiated doing what they're doing in the present. JULIO SEVILLA: When we tell them, OK, you're going to eat orange jelly beans right now, and then next week when you come back you're going to eat orange jellybeans again, then we find a high level of satiation. But in cases when you have them eat the orange jelly beans, if you tell them they're going to eat something different next week, for example Cherry jelly beans, then they satiate a little slower. MARTIN: So maybe I'm missing something, but explain the connection between satiation and boredom. VEDANTAM: So satiation really is the form of boredom. You know, when you're satiated with something, you really don't want to do it again. You're - when you read the same story to your kids over and over again, you get satiated with it because you're bored with it. MARTIN: I think of being satiated as being content and satisfied, but not so in this context. VEDANTAM: Yes. I think, in this context, it's really about saying, I really don't want to be doing this again. I've eaten a pizza. I've read \"Goodnight Moon\" 12 times; I really don't want to read it 13th time. And what this is saying is, if you can imagine tomorrow night reading a different story to them, then you will enjoy reading \"Goodnight Moon\" today a little bit more. MARTIN: If I know there's variety in the future, I'm OK with monotony in the present. VEDANTAM: Exactly. Now, with all behavioral interventions, Rachel, because human beings are really complex, it's important to remember there are going to be exceptions to this rule. For example, Sevilla says this principle of thinking about variety might not be such a good idea in romantic relationships. MARTIN: (Laughter). SEVILLA: In a romantic relationship, then you know that you're going to be with the same person. So in that case, maybe thinking about different people, for example, may actually tempt you. So I guess that may be an exception to this. But in our experiences, you know, like, food, entertainment, even work, et cetera, then thinking about variety is something positive because it's OK to just have variety in those domains in your life. VEDANTAM: Not such a good idea to tell your spouse, I'm thinking about this hot movie star so I don't get bored with you. MARTIN: (Laughter) Good advice. Shankar Vedantam, he regularly joins us to talk about social science research. Thanks, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Thanks, Rachel.

(SOUNDBITE OF FRUIT BATS SQUEAKING)SIMON: That symphony of squeaks is a cave of Egyptian fruit bats as they argue over food, mates and sleeping space. Egyptian fruit bats are part of a small group of animals that communicate individually within their species - person to person, if you please, if you were a fruit bat. Dr. Yossi Yovel is a neuro-ecologist at Tel Aviv University and part of the research team that is now decoding Egyptian fruit bat banter. Dr. Yovel, thanks very much for being with us. YOSSI YOVEL: You're welcome. Hi. SIMON: So what are they saying to each other? YOVEL: So it's not as if we can now understand everything, it's not as if we have a bat to English dictionary. But what we found is that this cacophony that you could hear, which is very typical if you enter a bat cave, that's exactly what it sounds like - actually contains much more information than previously believed. So all of these shouting, all of these vocalizations that were previously all categorized as aggressive vocalizations, we can now divide them. For example, we can classify whether the bats are arguing over food or over mating or over sleeping position or over other contacts. We can recognize the individuals vocalizing, and we can even to some extent say who they are vocalizing to. SIMON: How unusual is this among animals? I mean, I know we do it, right? YOVEL: It's only part of a big question - how complex is animal communication? When I say apple, you immediately imagine a red, round object, you know, with a certain taste. This is something that is very, very important factor in human communication. And animals have almost never been shown to have this ability. We show that bat vocalizations contain a lot of information about the context of the vocalization. For example, a third bat eavesdropping on a conversation between two individual bats can tell to some extent what is this conversation about, what is this argument about, which is more than we previously believed. SIMON: So you mentioned food, mates and sleeping space. So does this mean the bats are saying she's mine, no, she's mine? Or I'll take that glop of whatever it is? Or you've got your claws on my head turn over? YOVEL: Something like that. Maybe I should first point out - it's very important that bats don't only argue. OK. There are other vocalizations that bats emit. SIMON: They support each other emotionally, I'm sure. YOVEL: Exactly. Yeah. Some people get the wrong impression that bats only argue. We, in purpose, wanted to take this huge bulk of aggressive vocalizations and see if we can classify them. And, indeed, I think - exactly like you suggested - I think what they're saying is stuff like why did you wake me up, get out of my way. In the case of mating, it's usually the female protesting against a man who is trying to mate with her. SIMON: Can you tell, doctor, did the fruit bats bicker much over Clinton versus Trump? YOVEL: (Laughter) I can say that in another study we are following bats in Mexico, and these bats are actually flying over the U. S. -Mexican border, so if there is going to be a wall there, it will have to be very, very high. SIMON: (Laughter) Is it possible that one day human beings will be able to communicate with bats and really find out about their lives? YOVEL: You know, step by step we are getting closer to deciphering their communication. I don't think we will, not in my time at least, be able to really talk with them, so to speak.
