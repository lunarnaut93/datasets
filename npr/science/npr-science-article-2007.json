Today, lifting a burden. A lot of kids are home this week taking a vacation from schoolwork and their heavy backpacks. Those bags may someday feel much lighter thanks to a scientist who's invented a new backpack. It suspends the weight on bungee cords. NPR's Nell Boyce reports. NELL BOYCE: Larry Rome has two sons. One of them is a sophomore in high school. Professor LARRY ROME (Biology, University of Pennsylvania): And he's taking all these advanced placement courses and they essentially have college textbooks. These huge things, they weigh a ton. BOYCE: And his younger son in middle school usually lugs around 20 pounds or more. Now, Rome is a scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. He studies how fish swim and how frogs jump. But a couple of years ago, he designed a backpack that could generate electricity as a person walks. And now he's thought of a way to make another pack, one that lightens a load. Unlike a regular pack, the weight is not held tightly against the body. Prof. ROME: It's suspended by a very, very long bungee cord that is strung up inside of the frame of the backpack. BOYCE: Because the weight is suspended, it barely moves up and down as a person walks. Prof. ROME: The person is going up and down, but the load is staying still. BOYCE: He says the result feels dramatic, especially when you're running. Say, in a normal backpack, you carry 48 pounds. For the same physical effort in this backpack, you could carry 60 pounds. Prof. ROME: So, essentially, it gives you the possibility of carrying 12 extra pounds of whatever you need for free. BOYCE: Rome describes his invention in the journal Nature. Other experts say the design looks impressive. Rodger Kram studies biomechanics at the University of Colorado Boulder. He expects that springy backpacks will get used first by people who often have to run while carrying a heavy load. Professor RODGER KRAM (Biomechanics, University of Colorado Boulder): Marine-types, soldier-types, EMTs, that's sort of thing. It seems like a really good idea. BOYCE: Later, Kram says, the idea could find its way into school bags for kids. Larry Rome has founded a company, Lightning Packs, to commercialize his springy design. So far, though, it's only built a few prototypes. Nell Boyce, NPR News.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host:  And every Monday, our business report focuses on technology. Today, lifting a burden.

The answer - say growers, scientists and government officials - is no, not always. That's one the biggest challenges facing California growers as they work on food safety guidelines to be released early this year. From member station KAZU, Ben Adler reports. BEN ADLER: It's almost as if David Atchison could see the future. He's the Food and Drug Administration's point man on all the recent E. coli outbreaks. And back in late September, when his agency lifted its consumer alert on spinach, he issued a warning: if farmers didn't put better food safety standards in place, there's a good chance he'd be back two months from then to talk about another E. coli outbreak. Well, that next outbreak did come about two months later at Taco Bell restaurants. Clearly bacteria don't wait for food safety guidelines, or for that matter, science. Ms. LINDA HARRIS (Food Safety Researcher, university of California at Davis): Ten years ago we weren't even talking about good agriculture practices for fruits and vegetables. They weren't even on the radar screen. ADLER: Linda Harris is a top food safety researcher at the University of California at Davis. That's her lab equipment in the background. She says scientists are still trying to find out all the ways E. coli and other dangerous bacteria can get into produce. Ms. HARRIS: Any of the work that's been done in this area has been done in the last decade. In fact, probably in the last eight years. And so it's an 8-year-old, it's not even a teen. ADLER: This has put an awful lot of pressure on farmers here in California's Salinas Valley, known as the salad bowl of America. The spinach scare was the 20th E. coli outbreak in the last decade. At least nine of those outbreaks have been traced back here. Now the federal and state governments and major supermarket chains are insisting that growers come up with uniform, verifiable food safety guidelines. This field I'm standing next to, a few minutes southwest of Salinas, demonstrates many of the food safety issues facing growers. The Salinas River flows to my right, cows graze in rolling hills to my left. So how far from the cows and the river should the crops be grown, and how often do you test the irrigation water? Mr. BOB MARTIN (Farmer): How much research can you do on how far can a live bacterial cell blow in the wind? ADLER: Salinas Valley farmer Bob Martin is among those working on the guidelines. He says it's difficult to translate what's still an imprecise science into specific rules and standards. Mr. MARTIN: You know, what kind of wind, what are the conditions? So it's basically we're taking a wild guess at a lot of these things. ADLER: At this point, all that guess work puts a limit on what food safety guidelines can realistically achieve. Ms. HARRIS: We will never eliminate food-bourn illness entirely. Mr. TREVOR SUSLOW (University of California at Davis): I don't honestly believe it can ever be zero. Mr. MARTIN: We can't look you right in the eye and say with 100 percent certainty that there may not be an element beyond our control. Mayor DENNIS DONOHUE (Salinas Valley, Farmer): People will continue getting sick for eternity as long as they eat food. The only way they're not is in the future when they feed everybody pills. ADLER: Those are two veteran Salinas Valley growers, Bob Martin and Dennis Donohue. Before them, two UC-Davis E. coli experts, Trevor Suslow and Linda Harris. In other words, nothing in life is 100 percent safe. The goal is always to minimize the risk. And that's where the new food safety guidelines will come in. Growers will agree to follow those good agricultural practices, they'll pay the state to inspect them and their leafy greens will get an official certification mark stamped on their package. But grower and recently elected Salinas Mayor Dennis Donohue wonders about the inevitable - when a certified bag makes someone sick. Mayor DONOHUE: When it happens again, as it most certainly will, you're right back to square one. ADLER: The pressure from the government is on and consumer confidence is low. So California growers want the new safety standards in place before this year's growing season. But while the industry's risk is huge, experts say the individual consumers' risk is actually quite small. That's why UC-Davis researcher Trevor Suslow still has fresh-bagged spinach in his fridge. Mr. SUSLOW: I know concerns about what we buy in the supermarket, you know, what I get at the farmer's market when we shop there. And I guess I just choose to have faith that our produce sources are ultimately - the preponderance of them - very safe to consume. ADLER: After all, the U. S. government says only about 60 Americans die each year from E. coli in meat or produce, compared to more than 40,000 who die from car crashes. For NPR News, I'm Ben Adler in Monterrey, California.

It's only been found in three cows in the United States. It causes brain damage and death, and in rare cases it can infect people. Concerns about mad cow nearly ruined the beef industry in Great Britain. Now scientists have made cows that seem to be immune. NPR's Nell Boyce reports. NELL BOYCE: James Robel(ph) grew up in a farm in central Kansas. Mr. JAMES ROBEL (Biologist, Hemotech): We have one dairy cow that I milked every morning and every night. So I grew up working with cows, and I worked with cows ever since. BOYCE: These days he's not after milk. Robel is a biologist at a company called Hemotech in South Dakota. It's in the business of genetically altering cows so that  they make pharmaceuticals in their milk or blood. Mr. ROBEL: We were embarking on a path to use the cow as a production system for something that people would inject into their veins. BOYCE: Their products would have to be absolutely free of cow diseases, like mad cow, also known as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, or BSE. So they turn to genetic engineering for a solution. Robel knew that this disease targets a particular protein in the brain. What if he made cows that simply didn't have this protein? He could do this by disabling or knocking out the gene for the protein. Mr. ROBEL: The challenges I guess started right in the beginning. Nobody has been able to knockout a gene in a cow. BOYCE: Until now. Robel and his colleagues spent years working with cow cells and embryos. Now they've published a report in the journal \u201cNature Biotechnology\u201d. They made a dozen calves - all lack the brain protein. Mr. ROBEL: They are cute animals when they're born, particularly the Holstein Jerseys. They have these nice big sad eyes. BOYCE: So far, the two-year-old cows seem perfectly healthy. And in lab tests their brain tissues seem to resist the infectious agent that causes mad cow. A few of the cows have now been exposed to the agent. They'll be watched for several years to see if they develop the disease. Some experts seriously doubt that dinner plates soon will feature mad-cow-resistant stakes. James Hodges is president of the American Meat Institute Foundation. Mr. JAMES HODGES (President, American Meat Institute Foundation): As a research model, I think it's positive development. But the impact on the industry will probably be quite minimal in the short term. You're not going to replace the entire cattle herd at the United States. BOYCE: Hodges says even if the industry wanted to introduce these cows, they couldn't. The Food and Drug Administration recently said it's safe to eat cloned cows, pigs and goats, but the agency has not issued an opinion on the safety of animals with genes that have been altered in the lab. George Sidel is a livestock expert at Colorado State University. He says no one knows if any person who has gotten mad cow after eating beef raised in this country\u2026 Professor GEORGE SEIDEL (Biomedical Science, Colorado State University): But theoretically, if there were a problem, the animals without this gene couldn't get the disease or transmit it. BOYCE: And he says that may be attractive to people who worry about getting mad cow from eating beef. Prof. SEIDEL: In some cultures, some situations, people may be willing to pay a premium for animals that can't possibly have that problem. BOYCE: That isn't a market that Hemotech plans to pursue, even though James Robel says he personally wouldn't mind eating this kind of gene-altered beef. Prof. ROBEL: I wouldn't have any problem with eating clones. I don't really have any problems with eating a genetically modified animal.

S. the next big earthquake will hit. California and the Northwest are likely places. And engineers there have designed buildings to survive all but the biggest quakes. But the quake worthiness of smaller wood-frame buildings is something of a mystery. So engineers built a two-story frame house on a huge shake table and then last fall, shook it. Morning Edition was there with a recorder to capture the moment. Unidentified Man: We stand by as we begin. (Soundbite of simulated earthquake) MONTAGNE: Now, engineers have examined the house more closely. And as NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, they've got some ideas for making building codes better. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: The big shake took place inside a hangar-sized building at the University of Buffalo in New York. It only lasted a few seconds and it didn't seem like much happened - the roof held, the walls didn't collapse, even the windows stayed put. But inside the house, it was a different story. The house was furnished - from a dining room set for four to a typical college student's bedroom. Microphones planted inside, recorded the bedlam. (Soundbite of simulated earthquake in house) It was the equivalent of a 6. 7 magnitude quake, like the one that hit Northridge, California, in 1994. Andre Filiatrault, one of the engineers in charge, says the quake threw objects around with a force equal to one and a half times their weight. Mr. ANDRE FILIATRAULT (Engineer): It would have been difficult, perhaps, to stand up during the shaking. A 150 percent your body weight is significant -pushed laterally - coupled with all the contents flying left and right. And in the dorm room, the television flew almost eight feet across the room just from that shaking, from that force. JOYCE: As nice as it looked after the shake, this house was totaled. Here's why. Many wood frame houses are built on a concrete slab. Around the perimeter, you bolt down a piece of two by four called a sill plate. Then the walls of the house are anchored to that sill plate. During the test, the sill plate failed. Mr. FILIATRAULT: We found that this was completely cracked all around the perimeters. So what it means, of course, if it was a real event, that building - its capability to resist an aftershock, for example, could be questionable. JOYCE:  And as far as fixing the house is concerned. Mr. FILIATRAULT: It would probably mean that as you need to jack up the buildings, so lift the building completely, go underneath, remove this sill plate, put a new one in, and that's - in terms of economic issue, that could overwhelm an owner. JOYCE: There were other intriguing results. Filiatrault says energy from the vibrations is carried through the walls. Large gaps, in this case, the garage door opening, don't transmit this energy. So that puts extra stress on the surrounding walls. In essence, the end of the house twisted around the garage door opening. Filiatrault says one goal of the research is to give property owners in quake zones new building codes designed not just to save lives, but to save property as well. Mr. FILIATRAULT: Many owners believe, wow, my building performed well. But its damaged, and economically the cost is very high. Well, you have to remember that our codes are there mainly for life safety performance objectives. JOYCE: The engineering team is writing up its final results. They say, at the very least, homebuilders in earthquake zones might want to build a stronger sill plates and reinforce areas around large openings, and it wouldn't hurt to tie down your TV either.

KEITH DEVLIN: Hi, good morning, Linda. Nice to be here. WERTHEIMER: So what happens at a mathematics convention? Do your colleagues pull down the chalkboard and quip out a few giant equations like that numbers guy on TV? DEVLIN: Yeah. Actually, this is one of the few times where we don't have chalkboards. We have to use overhead projectors or PowerPoint. This is the big annual North American meeting of mathematicians. About 5,000 of us roughly gather every January. . . WERTHEIMER: That's terrifying. A terrifying thought. (Soundbite of laughter) DEVLIN: It's almost always in a warm climate. And this year, it's warm and sunny - at least today, at New Orleans. It's a four-day meeting. And during that four days, about 1,800 mathematicians will present papers. WERTHEIMER: Oh, good Lord. Could you give us some details about the big items on the agenda? DEVLIN: Yeah. I've got the program in front of me, and I thought I'd just read off at random a couple of the talks that are going on. One is called - and this maybe is not such a surprise - called Hurricane Modeling and Katrina. There's actually a lot of talks this year on climate modeling, how we might predict hurricanes, how we might deal with them. WERTHEIMER: And a wonderful thing if it could be done. DEVLIN: You know, we're getting better at doing those things, but Mother Nature always has the last laugh. And it's sometimes a rather cynical laugh, I'm afraid. Another talk that I'm looking up is - and brace yourself, because this is not typical of the kind of titles we have -Acceleration of an Iterative Method for the Evaluation of High Frequency Multiples Scattering Effects. WERTHEIMER: I'm fascinated. (Soundbite of laughter) DEVLIN: I have to say, I have a vague sense of what that one's about. But sometimes the audience is maybe five or six people, sometimes as many as a few hundred. There's a little bit of focus on math education. The (unintelligible) government state and federal policy setting. There is some people here from industry and from various unnamed government organizations, like the NSA and CIA. . . WERTHEIMER: Mysterious agencies. DEVLIN: In fact, it's generally believed that the National Security Agency is the largest single employer of Ph. D. 's in mathematics in the world. We don't know for sure, because that's actually a classified piece of information. But it's almost certainly correct. And the reason the NSA needs so many mathematicians is because what they do primarily is code breaking, and, ever since the days of the Second World War, code breaking has been 99. 9 percent mathematics and . 1 percent inspiration. WERTHEIMER: There must be quite a lot of buzz around there that \"Science\" magazine gave its breakthrough of the year award to a mathematician this year. DEVLIN: Yeah. That was a conjecture that went back to 1904 by a French mathematician called Henri Poincar\u00e9. That was the first time ever that a proof a theorem in pure mathematics has been declared the most significant scientific breakthrough of the year. The Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture, in a sense, is a question of physics. WERTHEIMER: Does that mean that math is a science in the view of this magazine? DEVLIN: You know, that's one of these eternal questions that people debate - usually not in the coffee bar, but in the alcohol bar in the evenings - as to whether mathematics is an art or a science, whether it's the master of science or the subject of science. The standard definition of science - it makes predictions. You can then test those predictions by performing some kind of an experiment or by measuring something. If you can't make a prediction that can be tested by looking at the world, the definition goes, then it ain't science. Well, for most mathematics that's not the case. The test for truth in mathematics is whether something has been proved from the basic assumptions you start with. Why then did \"Science\" declare this scientific breakthrough of the year? I think, in part, it is about a fundamental question in physics: what is the shape of the universe we live in? Unfortunately, that's the kind of question that physics itself can't answer because we can't perform experiments to determine the answer of that kind of question. WERTHEIMER: So, Keith, it sounds like you're having a high old time. (Soundbite of laughter) DEVLIN: We're having a ball here. I don't know if you can tell the excitement in my voice, but this is one of those times in the year where I'm surrounded by 5,000 people who don't think I'm unusual. (Soundbite of laughter) WERTHEIMER: Well, Keith, thanks very much. DEVLIN: Okay. My pleasure.

That's what I said. Dogs. JULIE ROVNER: The American Veterinary Medical Association says nearly half of America's best friends weigh more than they should. Susan Strickland, who breeds Pembroke Welsh Corgis in southeastern Pennsylvania, has seen more than her share of pudgy pets. Ms. SUSAN STRICKLAND (Breeder of Pembroke Welsh Corgis): I had one that came back to me at two years of age that weighed 70 pounds.

She had all kinds of problems that were related only to her weight. ROVNER: And there weren't any drugs yet for fat dogs, so it took a year of careful diet and exercise.

ROVNER: Wilson says the new drug does for dogs what drug makers wish they could do for people.

ROVNER: Reactions like abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, among others. And Sundlof says it simply doesn't work in people, or even cats for that matter. Susan Strickland questions a need for a drug to help fat dogs slim down. Ms. STRICKLAND: I think people should feed their dogs less food and save their money. Buy them a nice, new toy instead.

I'm Joe Palca. A lot of what we know about the inner workings of matter comes from particle accelerators. Sure atoms are made up of protons, electrons, and neurons, but those particles are made up of even more basic particles themselves, things with names like quarks, bosons, gluons, and more. To see these, you have to break them out of their larger hosts, usually by slamming the larger particles into each other at very high energies to make them break into pieces, then hoping to take a picture of those tiny pieces before they disappear, and they disappear very quickly. Later this year, a new particle accelerator is scheduled to start operation at CERN in Switzerland. Called the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, it will fire beams of protons into each other with very large amounts of energy. Scientists hope that these high-energy collisions will be enough to kick free particles they've never seen before, including one which has been sought after with great intensity called the Higgs boson. Joining me now are my three guests for the rest of the hour. David Barney is the outreach coordinator for the Compact Muon Solenoid. That's one of four detectors - detector experiments at the LHC collider part of CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. He joins me by phone from France. Welcome to the program, Dr. Barney. Dr. DAVID BARNEY (Outreach Coordinator, Compact Muon Solenoid): Hi, nice to be there, virtually at least. PALCA: Well, it's good to have you. Jacobo Konigsberg is a professor at the Department of Physics at the University of Florida and is a spokesman for The Collider Detector at Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois. Welcome to the program. Dr. JACOBO KONIGSBERG (Spokesman, The Collider Detector at Fermilab): Thank you. Good to be here. PALCA: And I think I mispronounced. It should be Jacobo, right? Dr. KONIGSBERG: No, Jacobo is correct. PALCA: Jacobo, OK, very good. And Barry Barish is the director of the Global Design Effort for the International Linear Collider Project. That's another new collider still in the planning stages. He's also an emeritus professor of high energy physics at Cal Tech. He joins me from the studios of member station KPCC in Pasadena. Welcome back to the program, Dr. Barish. Dr. BARRY BARISH (Director, Global Design Effort, International Linear Collider Project): Hi, I'm happy to be here. PALCA: Great. And as always, if you want to join the conversation, please give us a call. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. And I guess, Dave Barney, we should start with you and get a little bit of a description of LHC, this new collider that's coming to completion later this year. Dr. BARNEY: Hi, yeah, I mean I'm working for, as you said, one of the experiments that's being based at the LHC. And the LHC is going to be the highest energy machine of its type ever made. It's housed inside a ring about 27 kilometers or about 15 miles in circumference, about 100 meters or 100 yards underneath the border between Switzerland and France, near Geneva. So this accelerator we've actually been working on for the best part of the past 15 years, from concepts to design to actual construction, and now we're in the phase of - we'll be starting the commissioning of the machine later in this year. And this essentially circular device makes protons travel near to the speed of light in both directions around this ring, and these protons collide with each other at four specific points around the ring. And where they collide is where we build our detectors, or our experiments, to try and see what actually happened during those collisions. So as I said, I work for one of those four detectors, called CMS, which somewhat cryptically stands for Compact Muon Solenoid. But don't let the name Compact fool you here. I mean Compact means we've tried to squeeze as much as possible into a fairly small space, but in fact that space is about 23 yards long and about 15 or 16 yards high. PALCA: Hmm. Dr. BARNEY: And it's a device that weighs about 12 and a half thousand tons, so Compact doesn't necessarily mean small. PALCA: Got it. So these are detectors - these particles that come off, they don't come off with little nametags on them. So what are you trying to detect? How do you know what you're seeing? Dr. BARNEY: Essentially what we've tried to do is we design our detector to look for the particles that we know and love, in fact things such as you mentioned earlier, like the electron or the neutron or the proton, or similar things a bit more exotic, such as pions. And these particles are what we call the stables ones. We know how they behave, and they live for a relatively long time. So that once they come out of the collision, they travel through the detector and leave telltale signatures inside. So they'll leave different sort of signals in the different layers of our detector. And you can imagine our detector looks somewhat like an onion, albeit a cylindrical onion. But it has different layers that do different jobs and see the different particles in different ways. So we look for these signatures of these particles that we know. And what happens is if we create something in our proton-proton collision that's interesting, let's say, such as this Higgs particle that may or may not be there, then we know from the theory of this particle what it might decay into. And the Higgs particle will only live for a very short time before it decays into something else, into these well-known particles eventually. So what we look for is these well-known things and trace back, a bit like a detective at the scene of a crime, looking back to see what actually happened in the first place. PALCA: Got it. Well, let me turn to you, Jacobo Konigsberg, and ask - I mean what has the LHC, this new machine, got that you guys at Fermilab don't have? Dr. KONIGSBERG: That's a good question. I would turn it around. What do we have at the moment that they don't have? And which is data. And we are running - we're running an experiment that has been gathering data for about five, six years now. And we are very engaged in analyzing this data, the way that Dave very eloquently described, trying to understand what are the particles that we are producing them. We have a lot of experience with this machine because this accelerator Tevatron at Fermilab started operating in earnest perhaps 20 years ago. And this machine has been upgraded every so often to really achieve high - ever higher collision rates. This machine now is operating at its peak, and we actually have a good opportunity to see and search for many things that we don't know. We really at the moment, and hopefully for two or three more years, while the LHC machine turns on - the turn on of that machine is going to be slow, but it's coming - and through that time, we expect to continue the wonderful studies. We have an incredible collaboration of about 700 physicists from 60 institutions and on universities across the world - very committed, very curious and passionate people. And we are - you introduced the segment as the new toys for high energy physics. . . (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. KONIGSBERG: . . . so at the moment are playing in the sandbox. We are the ones playing. We're having a lot of fund. We invested a lot of time here. And we actually have maybe a good or maybe not such a good shot at finding the Higgs. We can also think of the impact that not finding it, or that excluding certain regions where the Higgs mass(ph) maybe will have in the LHC experiment. So in a way we are also training students, we're providing a lot of people transitioning to the LHC with lots of experience, and we are a community. I don't think we should see these two efforts as entirely competitive. This is really a transition that the field of high energy physics is going through. PALCA: A community that likes to compete, though, I think. . . Dr. KONIGSBERG: Absolutely. PALCA: Or at least at some level. OK, well, then maybe I can turn to you, Barry Barish, and ask if, you know, what - if Fermilab is providing some interesting data and LHC will provide some interesting data, what is the International Linear Collider going to provide that these guys won't? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. BARISH: Well, first, we represent the dream or the future, or what we think might be the future, of the field. And the more they find, the more interesting that is actually. We're talking in our community worldwide, about maybe what you'd call a companion machine for the large Hadron Collider that has the history of several decades of the way we've studied particle physics, and that is to have also the complementarity(ph) of the collision of electrons and positrons, not protons - which are very complex objects - in the same energy regime. So we're trying to develop the technology, the design of a machine that covers the same energy range as the LHC but collides electrons and positrons. And because they're so much more elementary in electron and positron we're able to study this science in a very different way - or a complementary way. PALCA: All right. So we have these three instruments. And we're going to learn a lot about physics. And maybe we can ask our callers if they have any questions about that. So let's start now with Bill in Jackson, Wyoming. Bill, welcome to the program. BILL (Caller): Hi. Thanks for taking my call. PALCA: Sure. BILL: I just wanted to ask with the energy crisis (unintelligible)\u2026 PALCA: Okay. Bill, are you\u2026 BILL: \u2026over immediate application like wind power and solar power. I was wondering what the guests think the practical applications of the results of this (unintelligible) might be. PALCA: Ah, the practical applications questions. That's a tough one. But maybe Barry Barish, do you want to take a swing at that? Dr. BARISH: Sure. First let me say I'm not going to avoid the question. It's a shame that it's the first question, because we're more about science than about applications. But let me\u2026let me say how we kind of have a different environment than what we lived in the beginning. Physics basic research studies fundamental things. And often we don't know how they'll pay off. In recent generations we've had, for example, in physics laboratories nuclear magnetic resonance. That ended up being the physics experiments - we didn't know it at the time - that have developed MRIs that we use to understand the insides of our bodies, medically. The development of lasers - lasers were only developed several decades ago as a basic physics principle. And they're now used in our CD machines and everything else that we have. PALCA: Hm-hmm. Dr. BARISH: More recently - even in one of the labs being talked about here - at CERN they developed the Worldwide Web which we all are finding indispensable tool even though at the time it was developed, a little more than a decade ago, it was just to communicate between two physics labs. And, you know, more other daily applications we use physics principles, like general relativity, to - and couldn't do what a GPS does, to tell us where things are, without using general relativity. So as we master physics we're able to find many, many applications. The kind of thing that we're doing here doesn't have direct applications except through the technologies. A lot of the technologies we are developing directly push the state of the art. And we're able to do that because we build one-of-a-kind things to do science research while industry has to worry about a bottom line. So we develop abilities to have advanced electronics control systems, ability to handle seismic vibrations, and so forth, in our laboratories and then they get applied. So we don't immediately solve the energy problem, or we don't know what problem we solve, but we master physics. And that helps us master kind of the environment around us. PALCA: OK. Well that - that sounds like a\u2026 Dr. Konigsberg: We also may be training people who will solve the energy problem. PALCA: Exactly. Exactly. So\u2026 Dr. Konigsberg: That's another aspect of this science. PALCA: \u2026all right. Well we're talking about the new - the new tools and toys, I guess, of high energy physics. I'm Joe Palca. And this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Let's see if we can get a more sciency(ph) question now from Michael, Michael in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Welcome to the program. MICHAEL (Caller): Hi. Thanks for having me on. PALCA: Sure. MICHAEL: I just wondered, you guys talked on the Higgs boson particle, I believe it is, earlier. And I'm not much of - I know a little bit about physics. Not much. But I'm just wondering if you could explain that a little more and what it means if it actually does exist. PALCA: Oh good. Well let's - let's throw this one to Dave, Dave Barney. I'm sure the French - at least sitting in France - must give you a good perspective on that question. Dr. BARNEY: Yeah. I would say right now I'm not actually French. I'm English. PALCA: Oh really. Dr. BARNEY: Just been living here for the past nearly 15 years now and working here. PALCA: Uh-huh. Dr. BARNEY: The Higgs particle - well let me go back a step. I mean we have some fairly fundamental, simple questions about the universe that like a 10-year-old child wouldn't be afraid of asking, that most adults just think all that's taken for granted. And they don't even think about asking it. Like, for example, as Joe mentioned right at the beginning, we have different particles, such as protons, neutrons, electrons, that we know about. But there are very simple things we don't know about these particles, such as why one type is heavier than another. Now it sounds like a philosophical question, if you like. You know, do we really care about this? Well, in fact we do because the mass of the particles governs the way our world is. If the electron were heavier than it is then people would be much smaller than they currently are. And the whole world would be a completely different environment. So it's a very interesting question to us, and a very basic thing. Now the best theory that we have at the moment or perhaps the best theory is that there's another part of particle that we haven't yet discovered that was postulated by a Scottish theorist called Peter Higgs plus a couple of other people, that was termed the Higgs boson. Now this particle is supposed to essentially give all the other particles mass. And it interacts with different particles, more strongly or more weakly, dependent on what that particle is. So it might give some particle some mass. It might not give others anything. It might give some a lot more. So we believe - or our best guess at the moment, is that this particle is there somewhere. And what we need to do is try to find it. The biggest problem is that so far we haven't yet found them. So despite the best attempts on both sides of the Atlantic, and in Japan, and in other places around the world such as Germany, we haven't yet found this thing. Now what we believe is that the LHC is probably the best chances of finding this although it was said earlier that the Fermilab experiments might also do this. But the difficulty is that the chances of finding something, or the chances of creating this illusive particle where we know from our theory about it that it's very remote, it's very difficult thing to create. So what we have to do is we have to collide particles together, protons together, extremely often. And on - in the hope that one in a million or one in a billion times you actually create one of these Higgs particles and you manage to see it with your detector. PALCA: Well we're going to have\u2026 Dr. BARNEY: (unintelligible) trying to do at the moment\u2026 PALCA: Right. Try\u2026 Dr. BARNEY: \u2026trying to get as many collisions as possible\u2026 PALCA: We're going to have to take - I'm sorry. I don't mean to interrupt. But we have to take a short break. And we'll try to sort this out when we come back. So don't go away. We'll be back. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) PALCA: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca. This program note, coming on Monday a couple of very unlikely friends. While writing his latest book, veteran war reporter Thomas Ricks created a soundtrack to work by including the music of an up and coming young folk rocker. And on Monday Tom Ricks joins Neal Conan for a live performance by his friend, Josh Ritter. That's Monday on TALK OF THE NATION. This hour we're talking about high energy physics. My guests are David Barney from CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, Jacobo Konigsberg from Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois, and Barry Barish, he's the director of the global design effort for the International Linear Collider Project. And David Barney, I think you were just finishing up the description that the Higgs boson is going to be hard to find. And is there anything else that you briefly wanted to add to that? Dr. BARNEY: No, no, no. That's the end of my description about that. PALCA: All right. Well I thought it was actually - I thought it was quite excellent. Let's take - let's take some more calls now. And let's go to Roland in St. Louis, Missouri. Roland, welcome to the program. ROLAND (Caller): Thank you for accepting my question. PALCA: Sure. ROLAND: It's more of an engineering question. Exactly how does your detector work? PALCA: Ah. Ah. Well I'm sure we get three answers if we ask that to three people. But I'll start maybe with you, Jacobo Konigsberg. How does your detector work? ROLAND: I'll take my question off the air. PALCA: OK. Thanks. Dr. Konigsberg: Right. Well it's a complicated answer because each of these detectors, as Dave described, is really made of a tremendous amount of components that they all need to act together. So you need to think of each of these big detectors as a 3-D puzzle. Each of the pieces has to look at these collisions simultaneously with the other ones. And as these particles come out of the collision traverse each of these pieces, they need to immediately digitize, let's say, the passage of these particles through these detectors. And then we need to build very sophisticated electronics to very quickly understand whether this particle collision - we call them events - were interested or interesting enough to pass it on to another level of sorting before we decide to write these events to a medium where we can analyze them further. So it is like a camera that has to operate at a very, very fast rate. But taking pictures of detectors that are built of very thin wires embedded in gas with very high voltage in them that I - particles, charged particles, have passed through this gas, ionize the gas, and then the signals get recorded by the wires, or sandwiches of plastic and iron or lead that really capture the particles passing through them and convert their energy into a measurable quantity. I think we can go on and on\u2026 PALCA: Yes. I understand. But\u2026 Dr. Konigsberg: \u2026on this but I hope this is\u2026 PALCA: \u2026no that was - that was very interesting. And actually before I let you go - because I want to ask Barry Barish something. But before I let you go you've been collecting data for quite a while now. Is it possible that the data that has the proof of the Higgs boson has already been collected and it's buried somewhere yet to be analyzed? Dr. Konigsberg: Most definitely. The problem with that is that it's not enough to have a few of those events collected among the millions, or really billions, of other events that we've collected. What we need to do is collect enough of these Higgs events so that we can really look very, very carefully at everything and convince ourselves that we have some events that really are Higgs. And this is a very, very tricky business. We have experience with a top quark(ph) that we discovered in Fermilab in 1995 where we were producing top and anti-top pairs every 10 billion collisions. PALCA: Ah. Dr. Konigsberg: OK? And we collected data for about two years. And we very carefully and very slowly analyzed it until we were able to convince ourselves and others that there was no other choice but to have a new process that has - hadn't been seen before that was very consistent with production of top corks. We're trying to do the same with Higgs. The only problem is that Higgs, at the Tevatron, is even more rare than the top quarks. Instead of every 10 billion collisions producing at top quark we may have every 100 billion collisions producing a Higgs, if it's light enough, or every one trillion collisions producing the Higgs. PALCA: Got it. Dr. Konigsberg: Now given time we can collect enough data to do this work. PALCA: Got it. Well, and as I gather time is coming - is coming to a close. But maybe - maybe I can turn to you, Barry Barish. I mean as I listen to these descriptions, first of the Higgs boson and what I would call a heroic description of by Jacobo Konigsberg to explain how a detector works, is this a problem for the field of high energy physics that it is a little bit esoteric and hard for the general public, even the scientifically interested general public, to appreciate the importance of? Mr. BARISH: Oh, I think definitely. You know, we look at problems that seem very esoteric, the names of the particles we talk about, the particular questions we ask, but I think it was pointed out that - earlier in this program - that many of the questions that we're asking now could be almost understood, at least as questions, by a 10-year-old. And I think that's true, and it's been a change of the nature of the field. When we did particle physics two or three decades ago, we basically built a new accelerator and knew we'd find and make new discoveries, and all we did was move into a new let's say window on that universe. Today we actually are designing the accelerators and the particle detectors much more to answer specific questions. We've been talking about one, which is the Higgs Boson, but the underlying question there is what is mass all about? We know that our planet, ourselves, are made out of - we have mass. Where does it comes from and how do we understand it? We have a lot of other questions like that that are guiding us. We think we live in what we call a four-dimensional world. We all know that we can go forward and backwards, up and down, sideways, and time is different today than yesterday, and those are our four dimensions. But modern theory indicates that there may be other dimensions that we haven't seen yet, and it's really because they're smaller than we can see with in our everyday life. And so we're asking fundamental questions like how many dimensions there are in nature and what causes mass? Those are very, very basic. You'd think we could explain it to everybody, but it certainly doesn't affect everyday life every much. So it is, I think, a real problem for us to communicate the importance of the questions we are asking, our ability to answer those, the direction we have to the general public. PALCA: We're talking about high energy physics and some of the experiments that are being done in that world. I'm Joe Palca, and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And I've said that at the wrong time, haven't I? Yes, of course. Anyway, let's take another call now, and this time let's go to - I'm sorry, Brian in Muskegon, Michigan. BRIAN (Caller): Hi, thanks for taking my call. PALCA: You're welcome. BRIAN: I was wondering that if while you're doing your experiments, if you were to get something that you totally didn't expect, how would you be able to discern that, and I mean would you even be able to make sense of out anything like that? PALCA: Interesting question. Maybe Barry Barish, you want to take a quick swing at that? Mr. BARISH: Yeah, actually I just talked about the fact that we're very directed now, compared to decades ago, but still the serendipitous discovery has always been maybe the most exciting thing in science, that we see things we don't expect. When we design these experiments, these complicated experiments like we heard just explained, we actually use our imagination as much as possible to cover the bases, if you want, to try to make a design that doesn't just answer the directed questions that we're aiming for, like how we can see the particular decay modes of this Higgs particle, but might see other things. And we always have adventurous experimenters that look at the data exactly for those reasons. They look to find the particular events that look funny and see if they look funny because the instrument behaved funny or maybe there's a new phenomenon that we haven't seen before. And actually, the advances in this field and in other fields are some combination of directed research and kind of the surprising discovery, and it's part of what makes it exciting to be a scientist. PALCA: All right. Let's take one more call now from Piers(ph) in St. Paul, Minnesota. Welcome to the program. PIERS (Caller): Yes, sir. I'm honored to be part of this. I wish you'd talk a little bit about the consequences of not finding the Higgs Boson. Suppose after another 10 years of operation of the LHC, and you know you're doing everything right, and you don't find it, then what? PALCA: Okay, that's a good question. Dave Barney, will you give the money back? Mr. DAVID BARNEY (Outreach Coordinator, Compact Muon Solenoid, CERN): No, we'll take it and run. PALCA: I see. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. BARNEY: Essentially it is a good question. One of the - and it sort of stems also from what Barry was saying about the unknown, and indeed with the detectors being built at the LHC and the LHC itself, we don't really know what we're going to find, if anything at all. Now what we do know from the current theories that we have that work extremely well and the bits that go on the end, like this Higgs Boson theory and so on -what we know is that if that particle exists, then the LHC has the energy and it has the collision rate to discover this thing within a few years of operation. There are two really big experiments being built - CMS, that I'm working for, and another one called ATLAS - that are what we call general-purpose detectors. They're being designed to try to see whatever might be there. If the Higgs is there or something like it, something that could explain mass that fits in our current theories, it will be found at the LHC. There's no doubt about that. The problem comes in that if we don't see it at all in several years of running, it means it really isn't there, and in fact our theories are wrong in some way. Now, this might sound like a get-out clause, if you like, but in fact to a lot of people that would be even more interesting. And for the last 10, 15 years, we were running experiments such as the ones at Fermilab and other ones at CERN that were taking very precise data about our current understanding of the universe, a thing called the standard model that describes the particles that we all know and love, and it worked extremely well, with amazing precision, probably the most accurate experiments ever done. And we know that this is our theory at the moment, but maybe we've got it completely wrong, and we're just seeing an approximation of something else that might be there. Perhaps there are more dimensions of space, as Barry was saying, and maybe this is hiding something much more fundamental from us. I think it will be very interesting if we don't find Higgs. PALCA: We are talking about high energy physics, and I'm Joe Palca, and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Well, maybe I can ask you, Jacobo Konigsberg, would you be satisfied that the lack of evidence is the proof that there's something lacking? Dr. KONIGSBERG: You mean at the LHC or -PALCA: Right, yes. I mean, do you agree with -Dr. KONIGSBERG: I think I agree with that. It will be very interesting to understand that the standard model finally does not hold together the way we think, and that there is conclusive evidence from our accelerators that there should be something different and that we need to revise the understanding we have. What Barry said is quite correct. One of the things that make this whole enterprise really exciting is searching for the unknown, and we have these theoretical guidelines that more or less predict or suggest what good solutions are for the various problems we find, such as the mass hierarchies (unintelligible), the problem that we don't really know the source of why different particles have different masses. And understanding that is fundamental, and why it's fundamental because historically it's been so. When we set out to understand the periodic table of elements, we learned a whole lot about the universe. We understood the atom, and quantum mechanics came out of that. Every time we see patterns in the universe, and humankind has been pursuing these questions, mostly very, very interesting things happen. So it's a fantastic enterprise, and we really are very excited to be part of it, and great nations do great enterprises. So we're very hopeful that we continue on this path, and I'm sure Barry shares that. PALCA: Let's go to Jim now, Jim in Paltney(ph), New York. Jim, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. JIM (Caller): Hi. Thanks for talking my call and especially thank you for discussing real, cutting edge physics and real science, and my question is, given that the Large Hadron Collider could create conditions which would generate a small black hole, would you explain to us how you decide the size of a black hole? Is it mass or is it volume? PALCA: Maybe I could ask Barry Barish to take a swing at that. Is that possible? Mr. BARISH: Sure. These kind of questions sometimes don't really have very sharp answers. We know we can create something like a small black hole, but remember, a black hole is a very complicated object that has to do with space-time. One of our biggest questions in physics is somehow reconciling space-time, if you want, or general relativity, with particle physics. So when we get into a realm of asking a question like the one you asked, it gets to some of the deepest questions we have. How do we bring together a very successful theory, quantum mechanics, with another very successful theory, general relativity? And we have ideas how to do that, and those ideas can end up creating things on particle accelerators that come out of both theories, but I would say we're on very shaky grounds writing it down theoretically. If that's so, then it becomes more like the kinds of searches that we were kind of talking about before; that is, that we see something - we don't know exactly how to search then, so we basically see something in the data that we're not expecting, and then we try to interpret it. PALCA: Well, you know, this is the kind of program that concerns me a little bit because it gets to the point where it's so interesting that you figure you could go on talking about it for hours and hours. But alas, I think we've come to that point where I have to say goodbye. So I would like to thank my guests this hour. David Barney is the outreach coordinator for the Compact Muon Solenoid, the CMS. That's one of the four detector experiments at the LHC. That's part of CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. Thank you very much. Dr. BARNEY: Yeah, thank you very much. It's been an enjoyable half an hour. PALCA: And Jacobo Konigsberg is a professor in the department of physics at the University of Florida and is the spokesman for the Collider Detector at Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois. Thank you. Dr. KONIGSBERG: Thank you very much. PALCA: And finally, Barry Barish is the director of the global design effort for the International Linear Collider Project. That's another new collider, still in the planning stages. He's also an emeritus professor of high energy physics at Cal Tech. Mr. BARISH: Thank you for having us. PALCA: You're welcome. Thanks to all of you.  JOE PALCA, host:  From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca.  A lot of what we know about the inner workings of matter comes from particle accelerators. Sure atoms are made up of protons, electrons, and neurons, but those particles are made up of even more basic particles themselves, things with names like quarks, bosons, gluons, and more.  To see these, you have to break them out of their larger hosts, usually by slamming the larger particles into each other at very high energies to make them break into pieces, then hoping to take a picture of those tiny pieces before they disappear, and they disappear very quickly.  Later this year, a new particle accelerator is scheduled to start operation at CERN in Switzerland. Called the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, it will fire beams of protons into each other with very large amounts of energy. Scientists hope that these high-energy collisions will be enough to kick free particles they've never seen before, including one which has been sought after with great intensity called the Higgs boson.  Joining me now are my three guests for the rest of the hour. David Barney is the outreach coordinator for the Compact Muon Solenoid. That's one of four detectors - detector experiments at the LHC collider part of CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. He joins me by phone from France. Welcome to the program, Dr. Barney.  Dr. DAVID BARNEY (Outreach Coordinator, Compact Muon Solenoid): Hi, nice to be there, virtually at least.  PALCA: Well, it's good to have you. Jacobo Konigsberg is a professor at the Department of Physics at the University of Florida and is a spokesman for The Collider Detector at Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois. Welcome to the program.  Dr. JACOBO KONIGSBERG (Spokesman, The Collider Detector at Fermilab): Thank you. Good to be here.  PALCA: And I think I mispronounced. It should be Jacobo, right?  Dr. KONIGSBERG: No, Jacobo is correct.  PALCA: Jacobo, OK, very good. And Barry Barish is the director of the Global Design Effort for the International Linear Collider Project. That's another new collider still in the planning stages. He's also an emeritus professor of high energy physics at Cal Tech. He joins me from the studios of member station KPCC in Pasadena. Welcome back to the program, Dr. Barish.  Dr. BARRY BARISH (Director, Global Design Effort, International Linear Collider Project): Hi, I'm happy to be here.  PALCA: Great. And as always, if you want to join the conversation, please give us a call. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. And I guess, Dave Barney, we should start with you and get a little bit of a description of LHC, this new collider that's coming to completion later this year.  Dr. BARNEY: Hi, yeah, I mean I'm working for, as you said, one of the experiments that's being based at the LHC. And the LHC is going to be the highest energy machine of its type ever made. It's housed inside a ring about 27 kilometers or about 15 miles in circumference, about 100 meters or 100 yards underneath the border between Switzerland and France, near Geneva. So this accelerator we've actually been working on for the best part of the past 15 years, from concepts to design to actual construction, and now we're in the phase of - we'll be starting the commissioning of the machine later in this year.  And this essentially circular device makes protons travel near to the speed of light in both directions around this ring, and these protons collide with each other at four specific points around the ring. And where they collide is where we build our detectors, or our experiments, to try and see what actually happened during those collisions. So as I said, I work for one of those four detectors, called CMS, which somewhat cryptically stands for Compact Muon Solenoid. But don't let the name Compact fool you here. I mean Compact means we've tried to squeeze as much as possible into a fairly small space, but in fact that space is about 23 yards long and about 15 or 16 yards high.  PALCA: Hmm.  Dr. BARNEY: And it's a device that weighs about 12 and a half thousand tons, so Compact doesn't necessarily mean small.  PALCA: Got it. So these are detectors - these particles that come off, they don't come off with little nametags on them. So what are you trying to detect? How do you know what you're seeing?  Dr. BARNEY: Essentially what we've tried to do is we design our detector to look for the particles that we know and love, in fact things such as you mentioned earlier, like the electron or the neutron or the proton, or similar things a bit more exotic, such as pions. And these particles are what we call the stables ones. We know how they behave, and they live for a relatively long time. So that once they come out of the collision, they travel through the detector and leave telltale signatures inside. So they'll leave different sort of signals in the different layers of our detector.  And you can imagine our detector looks somewhat like an onion, albeit a cylindrical onion. But it has different layers that do different jobs and see the different particles in different ways. So we look for these signatures of these particles that we know. And what happens is if we create something in our proton-proton collision that's interesting, let's say, such as this Higgs particle that may or may not be there, then we know from the theory of this particle what it might decay into. And the Higgs particle will only live for a very short time before it decays into something else, into these well-known particles eventually. So what we look for is these well-known things and trace back, a bit like a detective at the scene of a crime, looking back to see what actually happened in the first place.  PALCA: Got it. Well, let me turn to you, Jacobo Konigsberg, and ask - I mean what has the LHC, this new machine, got that you guys at Fermilab don't have?  Dr. KONIGSBERG: That's a good question. I would turn it around. What do we have at the moment that they don't have? And which is data. And we are running - we're running an experiment that has been gathering data for about five, six years now. And we are very engaged in analyzing this data, the way that Dave very eloquently described, trying to understand what are the particles that we are producing them.  We have a lot of experience with this machine because this accelerator Tevatron at Fermilab started operating in earnest perhaps 20 years ago. And this machine has been upgraded every so often to really achieve high - ever higher collision rates. This machine now is operating at its peak, and we actually have a good opportunity to see and search for many things that we don't know. We really at the moment, and hopefully for two or three more years, while the LHC machine turns on - the turn on of that machine is going to be slow, but it's coming - and through that time, we expect to continue the wonderful studies. We have an incredible collaboration of about 700 physicists from 60 institutions and on universities across the world - very committed, very curious and passionate people. And we are - you introduced the segment as the new toys for high energy physics. . .  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. KONIGSBERG: . . . so at the moment are playing in the sandbox. We are the ones playing. We're having a lot of fund. We invested a lot of time here. And we actually have maybe a good or maybe not such a good shot at finding the Higgs. We can also think of the impact that not finding it, or that excluding certain regions where the Higgs mass(ph) maybe will have in the LHC experiment. So in a way we are also training students, we're providing a lot of people transitioning to the LHC with lots of experience, and we are a community. I don't think we should see these two efforts as entirely competitive. This is really a transition that the field of high energy physics is going through.  PALCA: A community that likes to compete, though, I think. . .  Dr. KONIGSBERG: Absolutely.  PALCA: Or at least at some level. OK, well, then maybe I can turn to you, Barry Barish, and ask if, you know, what - if Fermilab is providing some interesting data and LHC will provide some interesting data, what is the International Linear Collider going to provide that these guys won't?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. BARISH: Well, first, we represent the dream or the future, or what we think might be the future, of the field. And the more they find, the more interesting that is actually. We're talking in our community worldwide, about maybe what you'd call a companion machine for the large Hadron Collider that has the history of several decades of the way we've studied particle physics, and that is to have also the complementarity(ph) of the collision of electrons and positrons, not protons - which are very complex objects - in the same energy regime. So we're trying to develop the technology, the design of a machine that covers the same energy range as the LHC but collides electrons and positrons. And because they're so much more elementary in electron and positron we're able to study this science in a very different way - or a complementary way.  PALCA: All right. So we have these three instruments. And we're going to learn a lot about physics. And maybe we can ask our callers if they have any questions about that.  So let's start now with Bill in Jackson, Wyoming. Bill, welcome to the program.  BILL (Caller): Hi. Thanks for taking my call.  PALCA: Sure.  BILL: I just wanted to ask with the energy crisis (unintelligible)\u2026  PALCA: Okay. Bill, are you\u2026  BILL: \u2026over immediate application like wind power and solar power. I was wondering what the guests think the practical applications of the results of this (unintelligible) might be.  PALCA: Ah, the practical applications questions. That's a tough one. But maybe Barry Barish, do you want to take a swing at that?  Dr. BARISH: Sure. First let me say I'm not going to avoid the question. It's a shame that it's the first question, because we're more about science than about applications. But let me\u2026let me say how we kind of have a different environment than what we lived in the beginning.  Physics basic research studies fundamental things. And often we don't know how they'll pay off. In recent generations we've had, for example, in physics laboratories nuclear magnetic resonance.  That ended up being the physics experiments - we didn't know it at the time - that have developed MRIs that we use to understand the insides of our bodies, medically. The development of lasers - lasers were only developed several decades ago as a basic physics principle. And they're now used in our CD machines and everything else that we have.  PALCA: Hm-hmm.  Dr. BARISH: More recently - even in one of the labs being talked about here - at CERN they developed the Worldwide Web which we all are finding indispensable tool even though at the time it was developed, a little more than a decade ago, it was just to communicate between two physics labs.  And, you know, more other daily applications we use physics principles, like general relativity, to - and couldn't do what a GPS does, to tell us where things are, without using general relativity.  So as we master physics we're able to find many, many applications. The kind of thing that we're doing here doesn't have direct applications except through the technologies. A lot of the technologies we are developing directly push the state of the art. And we're able to do that because we build one-of-a-kind things to do science research while industry has to worry about a bottom line.  So we develop abilities to have advanced electronics control systems, ability to handle seismic vibrations, and so forth, in our laboratories and then they get applied.  So we don't immediately solve the energy problem, or we don't know what problem we solve, but we master physics. And that helps us master kind of the environment around us.  PALCA: OK. Well that - that sounds like a\u2026  Dr. Konigsberg: We also may be training people who will solve the energy problem.  PALCA: Exactly. Exactly. So\u2026  Dr. Konigsberg: That's another aspect of this science.  PALCA: \u2026all right. Well we're talking about the new - the new tools and toys, I guess, of high energy physics. I'm Joe Palca. And this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  Let's see if we can get a more sciency(ph) question now from Michael, Michael in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Welcome to the program.  MICHAEL (Caller): Hi. Thanks for having me on.  PALCA: Sure.  MICHAEL: I just wondered, you guys talked on the Higgs boson particle, I believe it is, earlier. And I'm not much of - I know a little bit about physics. Not much. But I'm just wondering if you could explain that a little more and what it means if it actually does exist.  PALCA: Oh good. Well let's - let's throw this one to Dave, Dave Barney. I'm sure the French - at least sitting in France - must give you a good perspective on that question.  Dr. BARNEY: Yeah. I would say right now I'm not actually French. I'm English.  PALCA: Oh really.  Dr. BARNEY: Just been living here for the past nearly 15 years now and working here.  PALCA: Uh-huh.  Dr. BARNEY: The Higgs particle - well let me go back a step. I mean we have some fairly fundamental, simple questions about the universe that like a 10-year-old child wouldn't be afraid of asking, that most adults just think all that's taken for granted. And they don't even think about asking it.  Like, for example, as Joe mentioned right at the beginning, we have different particles, such as protons, neutrons, electrons, that we know about. But there are very simple things we don't know about these particles, such as why one type is heavier than another.  Now it sounds like a philosophical question, if you like. You know, do we really care about this? Well, in fact we do because the mass of the particles governs the way our world is. If the electron were heavier than it is then people would be much smaller than they currently are. And the whole world would be a completely different environment.  So it's a very interesting question to us, and a very basic thing. Now the best theory that we have at the moment or perhaps the best theory is that there's another part of particle that we haven't yet discovered that was postulated by a Scottish theorist called Peter Higgs plus a couple of other people, that was termed the Higgs boson.  Now this particle is supposed to essentially give all the other particles mass. And it interacts with different particles, more strongly or more weakly, dependent on what that particle is.  So it might give some particle some mass. It might not give others anything. It might give some a lot more.  So we believe - or our best guess at the moment, is that this particle is there somewhere. And what we need to do is try to find it. The biggest problem is that so far we haven't yet found them.  So despite the best attempts on both sides of the Atlantic, and in Japan, and in other places around the world such as Germany, we haven't yet found this thing.  Now what we believe is that the LHC is probably the best chances of finding this although it was said earlier that the Fermilab experiments might also do this. But the difficulty is that the chances of finding something, or the chances of creating this illusive particle where we know from our theory about it that it's very remote, it's very difficult thing to create.  So what we have to do is we have to collide particles together, protons together, extremely often. And on - in the hope that one in a million or one in a billion times you actually create one of these Higgs particles and you manage to see it with your detector.  PALCA: Well we're going to have\u2026  Dr. BARNEY: (unintelligible) trying to do at the moment\u2026  PALCA: Right. Try\u2026  Dr. BARNEY: \u2026trying to get as many collisions as possible\u2026  PALCA: We're going to have to take - I'm sorry. I don't mean to interrupt. But we have to take a short break. And we'll try to sort this out when we come back. So don't go away. We'll be back.  This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  PALCA: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca. This program note, coming on Monday a couple of very unlikely friends. While writing his latest book, veteran war reporter Thomas Ricks created a soundtrack to work by including the music of an up and coming young folk rocker. And on Monday Tom Ricks joins Neal Conan for a live performance by his friend, Josh Ritter. That's Monday on TALK OF THE NATION.  This hour we're talking about high energy physics. My guests are David Barney from CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, Jacobo Konigsberg from Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois, and Barry Barish, he's the director of the global design effort for the International Linear Collider Project.  And David Barney, I think you were just finishing up the description that the Higgs boson is going to be hard to find. And is there anything else that you briefly wanted to add to that?  Dr. BARNEY: No, no, no. That's the end of my description about that.  PALCA: All right. Well I thought it was actually - I thought it was quite excellent. Let's take - let's take some more calls now. And let's go to Roland in St. Louis, Missouri. Roland, welcome to the program.  ROLAND (Caller): Thank you for accepting my question.  PALCA: Sure.  ROLAND: It's more of an engineering question. Exactly how does your detector work?  PALCA: Ah. Ah. Well I'm sure we get three answers if we ask that to three people. But I'll start maybe with you, Jacobo Konigsberg. How does your detector work?  ROLAND: I'll take my question off the air.  PALCA: OK. Thanks.  Dr. Konigsberg: Right. Well it's a complicated answer because each of these detectors, as Dave described, is really made of a tremendous amount of components that they all need to act together.  So you need to think of each of these big detectors as a 3-D puzzle. Each of the pieces has to look at these collisions simultaneously with the other ones. And as these particles come out of the collision traverse each of these pieces, they need to immediately digitize, let's say, the passage of these particles through these detectors.  And then we need to build very sophisticated electronics to very quickly understand whether this particle collision - we call them events - were interested or interesting enough to pass it on to another level of sorting before we decide to write these events to a medium where we can analyze them further.  So it is like a camera that has to operate at a very, very fast rate. But taking pictures of detectors that are built of very thin wires embedded in gas with very high voltage in them that I - particles, charged particles, have passed through this gas, ionize the gas, and then the signals get recorded by the wires, or sandwiches of plastic and iron or lead that really capture the particles passing through them and convert their energy into a measurable quantity.  I think we can go on and on\u2026  PALCA: Yes. I understand. But\u2026  Dr. Konigsberg: \u2026on this but I hope this is\u2026  PALCA: \u2026no that was - that was very interesting. And actually before I let you go - because I want to ask Barry Barish something. But before I let you go you've been collecting data for quite a while now. Is it possible that the data that has the proof of the Higgs boson has already been collected and it's buried somewhere yet to be analyzed?  Dr. Konigsberg: Most definitely. The problem with that is that it's not enough to have a few of those events collected among the millions, or really billions, of other events that we've collected.  What we need to do is collect enough of these Higgs events so that we can really look very, very carefully at everything and convince ourselves that we have some events that really are Higgs.  And this is a very, very tricky business. We have experience with a top quark(ph) that we discovered in Fermilab in 1995 where we were producing top and anti-top pairs every 10 billion collisions.  PALCA: Ah.  Dr. Konigsberg: OK? And we collected data for about two years. And we very carefully and very slowly analyzed it until we were able to convince ourselves and others that there was no other choice but to have a new process that has - hadn't been seen before that was very consistent with production of top corks.  We're trying to do the same with Higgs. The only problem is that Higgs, at the Tevatron, is even more rare than the top quarks. Instead of every 10 billion collisions producing at top quark we may have every 100 billion collisions producing a Higgs, if it's light enough, or every one trillion collisions producing the Higgs.  PALCA: Got it.  Dr. Konigsberg: Now given time we can collect enough data to do this work.  PALCA: Got it. Well, and as I gather time is coming - is coming to a close. But maybe - maybe I can turn to you, Barry Barish. I mean as I listen to these descriptions, first of the Higgs boson and what I would call a heroic description of by Jacobo Konigsberg to explain how a detector works, is this a problem for the field of high energy physics that it is a little bit esoteric and hard for the general public, even the scientifically interested general public, to appreciate the importance of?  Mr. BARISH: Oh, I think definitely. You know, we look at problems that seem very esoteric, the names of the particles we talk about, the particular questions we ask, but I think it was pointed out that - earlier in this program - that many of the questions that we're asking now could be almost understood, at least as questions, by a 10-year-old.  And I think that's true, and it's been a change of the nature of the field. When we did particle physics two or three decades ago, we basically built a new accelerator and knew we'd find and make new discoveries, and all we did was move into a new let's say window on that universe.  Today we actually are designing the accelerators and the particle detectors much more to answer specific questions. We've been talking about one, which is the Higgs Boson, but the underlying question there is what is mass all about? We know that our planet, ourselves, are made out of - we have mass. Where does it comes from and how do we understand it?  We have a lot of other questions like that that are guiding us. We think we live in what we call a four-dimensional world. We all know that we can go forward and backwards, up and down, sideways, and time is different today than yesterday, and those are our four dimensions.  But modern theory indicates that there may be other dimensions that we haven't seen yet, and it's really because they're smaller than we can see with in our everyday life. And so we're asking fundamental questions like how many dimensions there are in nature and what causes mass?  Those are very, very basic. You'd think we could explain it to everybody, but it certainly doesn't affect everyday life every much. So it is, I think, a real problem for us to communicate the importance of the questions we are asking, our ability to answer those, the direction we have to the general public.  PALCA: We're talking about high energy physics and some of the experiments that are being done in that world. I'm Joe Palca, and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  And I've said that at the wrong time, haven't I? Yes, of course. Anyway, let's take another call now, and this time let's go to - I'm sorry, Brian in Muskegon, Michigan.  BRIAN (Caller): Hi, thanks for taking my call.  PALCA: You're welcome.  BRIAN: I was wondering that if while you're doing your experiments, if you were to get something that you totally didn't expect, how would you be able to discern that, and I mean would you even be able to make sense of out anything like that?  PALCA: Interesting question. Maybe Barry Barish, you want to take a quick swing at that?  Mr. BARISH: Yeah, actually I just talked about the fact that we're very directed now, compared to decades ago, but still the serendipitous discovery has always been maybe the most exciting thing in science, that we see things we don't expect.  When we design these experiments, these complicated experiments like we heard just explained, we actually use our imagination as much as possible to cover the bases, if you want, to try to make a design that doesn't just answer the directed questions that we're aiming for, like how we can see the particular decay modes of this Higgs particle, but might see other things.  And we always have adventurous experimenters that look at the data exactly for those reasons. They look to find the particular events that look funny and see if they look funny because the instrument behaved funny or maybe there's a new phenomenon that we haven't seen before.  And actually, the advances in this field and in other fields are some combination of directed research and kind of the surprising discovery, and it's part of what makes it exciting to be a scientist.  PALCA: All right. Let's take one more call now from Piers(ph) in St. Paul, Minnesota. Welcome to the program.  PIERS (Caller): Yes, sir. I'm honored to be part of this. I wish you'd talk a little bit about the consequences of not finding the Higgs Boson. Suppose after another 10 years of operation of the LHC, and you know you're doing everything right, and you don't find it, then what?  PALCA: Okay, that's a good question. Dave Barney, will you give the money back?  Mr. DAVID BARNEY (Outreach Coordinator, Compact Muon Solenoid, CERN): No, we'll take it and run.  PALCA: I see.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. BARNEY: Essentially it is a good question. One of the - and it sort of stems also from what Barry was saying about the unknown, and indeed with the detectors being built at the LHC and the LHC itself, we don't really know what we're going to find, if anything at all.  Now what we do know from the current theories that we have that work extremely well and the bits that go on the end, like this Higgs Boson theory and so on -what we know is that if that particle exists, then the LHC has the energy and it has the collision rate to discover this thing within a few years of operation.  There are two really big experiments being built - CMS, that I'm working for, and another one called ATLAS - that are what we call general-purpose detectors. They're being designed to try to see whatever might be there. If the Higgs is there or something like it, something that could explain mass that fits in our current theories, it will be found at the LHC. There's no doubt about that.  The problem comes in that if we don't see it at all in several years of running, it means it really isn't there, and in fact our theories are wrong in some way. Now, this might sound like a get-out clause, if you like, but in fact to a lot of people that would be even more interesting.  And for the last 10, 15 years, we were running experiments such as the ones at Fermilab and other ones at CERN that were taking very precise data about our current understanding of the universe, a thing called the standard model that describes the particles that we all know and love, and it worked extremely well, with amazing precision, probably the most accurate experiments ever done.  And we know that this is our theory at the moment, but maybe we've got it completely wrong, and we're just seeing an approximation of something else that might be there. Perhaps there are more dimensions of space, as Barry was saying, and maybe this is hiding something much more fundamental from us.  I think it will be very interesting if we don't find Higgs.  PALCA: We are talking about high energy physics, and I'm Joe Palca, and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  Well, maybe I can ask you, Jacobo Konigsberg, would you be satisfied that the lack of evidence is the proof that there's something lacking?  Dr. KONIGSBERG: You mean at the LHC or - PALCA: Right, yes. I mean, do you agree with - Dr. KONIGSBERG: I think I agree with that. It will be very interesting to understand that the standard model finally does not hold together the way we think, and that there is conclusive evidence from our accelerators that there should be something different and that we need to revise the understanding we have.  What Barry said is quite correct. One of the things that make this whole enterprise really exciting is searching for the unknown, and we have these theoretical guidelines that more or less predict or suggest what good solutions are for the various problems we find, such as the mass hierarchies (unintelligible), the problem that we don't really know the source of why different particles have different masses.  And understanding that is fundamental, and why it's fundamental because historically it's been so. When we set out to understand the periodic table of elements, we learned a whole lot about the universe. We understood the atom, and quantum mechanics came out of that. Every time we see patterns in the universe, and humankind has been pursuing these questions, mostly very, very interesting things happen.  So it's a fantastic enterprise, and we really are very excited to be part of it, and great nations do great enterprises. So we're very hopeful that we continue on this path, and I'm sure Barry shares that.  PALCA: Let's go to Jim now, Jim in Paltney(ph), New York. Jim, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  JIM (Caller): Hi. Thanks for talking my call and especially thank you for discussing real, cutting edge physics and real science, and my question is, given that the Large Hadron Collider could create conditions which would generate a small black hole, would you explain to us how you decide the size of a black hole? Is it mass or is it volume?  PALCA: Maybe I could ask Barry Barish to take a swing at that. Is that possible?  Mr. BARISH: Sure. These kind of questions sometimes don't really have very sharp answers. We know we can create something like a small black hole, but remember, a black hole is a very complicated object that has to do with space-time.  One of our biggest questions in physics is somehow reconciling space-time, if you want, or general relativity, with particle physics. So when we get into a realm of asking a question like the one you asked, it gets to some of the deepest questions we have. How do we bring together a very successful theory, quantum mechanics, with another very successful theory, general relativity?  And we have ideas how to do that, and those ideas can end up creating things on particle accelerators that come out of both theories, but I would say we're on very shaky grounds writing it down theoretically.  If that's so, then it becomes more like the kinds of searches that we were kind of talking about before; that is, that we see something - we don't know exactly how to search then, so we basically see something in the data that we're not expecting, and then we try to interpret it.  PALCA: Well, you know, this is the kind of program that concerns me a little bit because it gets to the point where it's so interesting that you figure you could go on talking about it for hours and hours. But alas, I think we've come to that point where I have to say goodbye.  So I would like to thank my guests this hour. David Barney is the outreach coordinator for the Compact Muon Solenoid, the CMS. That's one of the four detector experiments at the LHC. That's part of CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. Thank you very much.  Dr. BARNEY: Yeah, thank you very much. It's been an enjoyable half an hour.  PALCA: And Jacobo Konigsberg is a professor in the department of physics at the University of Florida and is the spokesman for the Collider Detector at Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois. Thank you.  Dr. KONIGSBERG: Thank you very much.  PALCA: And finally, Barry Barish is the director of the global design effort for the International Linear Collider Project. That's another new collider, still in the planning stages. He's also an emeritus professor of high energy physics at Cal Tech.  Mr. BARISH: Thank you for having us.  PALCA: You're welcome. Thanks to all of you. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2007 NPR.  All rights reserved.

That concerns advocates like 50-year-old Lorna Harvey. She is a self-employed single mom living in Missouri City, Texas, located just outside Houston. Lorna's 10-year-old son Kyle suffers from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, otherwise known as ADHD. Lorna didn't have the money to buy regular health insurance for her child. And for quite a while, she was uninsured. Fortunately, Lorna's son was accepted into a program in her state called CHIP, which stands for the Children's Health Insurance Program. CHIP helps families who earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford private insurance. Lorna shares her story in her own words. Ms. LORNA HARVEY (Health Care Advocate): Imagine sitting at a football game, I'm thinking of that because of the Super Bowl this weekend, and you've got the World Series playing in the back of your mind. And then you start thinking about that ball, and you think about when you were a boy, you were playing bowling with your best friend, and how your best friend - what he did and what school he went to. And then imagine the marching band coming in from behind and ten of your favorite shows going on at one time. That's my son's brain. Now imagine trying to decipher all of that stimuli at one time. My son, sadly to say, suffers from all parts of the ADHD. He was diagnosed as having very severe combined ADHD, and that has affected every part of his life. They normally have to refer you to a doctor, and normally that test is done in a facility either through a pedia neuropsychologist or through a psychiatrist, and that can be a long battery of questions. So without the insurance coverage, you don't have the ability to have that. My son was failing. He was failing school miserably. And now for him, with the medication and the counseling that we've done, my son averages two to three B's every semester, and two to three A's every semester. And one of the greatest things that my friend told me that a parent wants is for that child with ADHD to have friendships and to be able to go on a sleepover, and have people come and knock on their door because so many times kids like this, they get to a point that nobody wants to be with them and they become outcasts. And so when I can tell you that my son went to summer camp for the first time this past summer, and he has friends and we have friends in the neighborhood, and he goes on sleepovers, and the kids come back continually to play with my son, that is a success. When we had no insurance and my son was sick, you immediately take the child to the emergency room. An emergency room is not able to provide the level of care that you need for a chronically ill child. My son alone for just maintenance, not including anything that happens, takes about $700 worth of medication a month. But I could not afford that. And when you ask me how does this, well, how does this make me feel? I feel like a parent who's providing the best thing for my son by having this insurance. COX: Again, that's single mom Lorna Harvey of Missouri City, Texas. By enrolling in the CHIP insurance program, she says her son Kyle has gotten the medical attention he needs and is doing fine now. Still, many are not as fortunate. It's estimated that eight million kids are without health insurance in this country.

Now, he says it's to help turn kudzu, that profligate vine that grows and grows all over the American South, into ethanol, a source of power. Mr. Rowland is 18 and has been working on this prolonged science project for four years. He won the grand prize of his school science fair last week and heads to the regionals next week at Florida State University. Tyler Rowland joins us now from the headmaster's office at the McClay School in Tallahassee. Mr. Rowland, thanks so very much for being with us. Mr. TYLER ROWLAND (High School Senior): Thank you. SIMON: Is there anything in particular about Kudzu that you think make it a good candidate to be used for ethanol? Mr. ROWLAND: Well, currently ethanol is one of our top uses of fuel source, you know, probably second to gasoline, and even our gasoline is a mixture of ethanol to reduce the harmful emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants. But our current, you know, sources of ethanol production are corn, potatoes and even wheat. The nice thing about kudzu is it's so abundant, we don't really have a strong use for it yet, and it's not a food source, so we're just using a pest plant to make something good out of it. SIMON: You've tried other stuff with kudzu, haven't you? Mr. ROWLAND: Yeah, fertilizer was my 10th grade project and the data supported that plants that were given the extract as a fertilizer grew faster and taller than those plants that were just treated with regular water. And then last year was my biggest use so far. The data supported the idea that the extraction from kudzu leaves and kudzu roots can be use as an insect repellant on (unintelligible) when administered to green bean plants. SIMON: If you could figure out the key to turning kudzu into something useful, it sounds like you're going to try a little bit of everything. Help us understand what that could mean, because there are lot of people that just don't know what to do with kudzu in the South, aren't there. Mr. ROWLAND: Yeah, it will just completely cover or blankets, you know, a telephone pole or the side of the building and you won't realize there's a building there. SIMON: So you're trying to turn a nuisance into a source of energy. Mr. ROWLAND: You can put it that way. SIMON: We mentioned at the top that you've just gotten a permit for a still. Now, do you really need a still to convert kudzu into usable ethanol or is this just a high school prank to get a still in the school? Mr. ROWLAND: No, it's not a high school prank. What it is is when you have fermentation, you get an alcohol solution and right now we're using a breathalyzer on it and comparing it to controls, hypothesizing that it's roughly five percent to 15 percent ethanol. And that is, however, not just ethanol; it's got other mixture solutions such as water or any other byproduct of fermentation, which is hard to distinguish what it is. The stilling just separates all the different materials into separate groups. SIMON: Can you tell us what your headmaster's face looked like when you said I need a permit for a still, sir?

I'm Michele Norris. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Last month, a California woman died and five family members fell seriously ill after eating mushrooms they had picked in the woods. Health officials believe the culprit was the death cap mushroom, the most common cause of deadly mushroom poisoning in the United States. A biologist named Anne Pringle is trying to understand why the death cap mushroom is suddenly spreading like crazy in California. She is just starting her career at Harvard University. It's a wonderful job that lets her follow her passion for fungus. It's also a huge challenge. NPR's Richard Harris has her story. RICHARD HARRIS: When Anne Pringle moved from a postdoctoral fellowship at Berkeley to a Harvard professorship in the fall of 2005, she created an unusual bicoastal relationship. Her husband and two young daughters came with her to Massachusetts, but the fungus that holds her fascination stayed behind in California. So in December, she spent one last evening with David and the girls before heading west for a weeklong visit. (Soundbite of a baby) HARRIS: Fungus has clearly crept into the fabric of this family. Even three-year-old Penelope has developed a rather sophisticated knowledge of mushrooms. Professor ANNE PRINGLE (Biologist): Okay, what's that on your placemat? What's that mushroom? Ms. PENELOPE PRINGLE (Daughter of Anne Pringle): Black trumpets. Professor PRINGLE: Are they your favorite? What's your favorite mushroom? Ms. P. PRINGLE: The boletes. Professor PRINGLE: The boletes. HARRIS: The boletes are your favorite, oh. Do you like to eat mushrooms? Ms. P. PRINGLE: No. I hate mushrooms. HARRIS: At least to eat, which is probably just as well, since many of the mushrooms this family goes out to the woods to collect are deadly poison. This time the family will stay behind as Anne Pringles sets off for California. Professor PRINGLE: So, where is momma going tomorrow. Ms. P. PRINGLE: California. Professor PRINGLE: I'm going to miss you, baby. Ms. P. PRINGLE: I'm going to miss you. Professor PRINGLE: Oh, yeah. Okay? Ms. P. PRINGLE: Are we going to be able to talk? Professor PRINGLE: I'll call you on the phone everyday. Okay? Ms. P. PRINGLE: But everyday, in the morning -Professor PRINGLE: It's not world famous Anne Pringle. Harvard professor is taking out the trash at the hostel at Point Reyes. HARRIS: Yes, the youth hostel at the Point Reyes National Seashore. This area is a hotspot for the rapidly spreading death cap mushroom, Amanita phalloides. Pringle hasn't yet been able to raise any grant money for her research into this runaway species, so she is traveling on the cheap, bedding down in bunk rooms with her postdoc and graduate student. The hostel manager figured a mushroom scientist would be the logical person to take out the compost. Professor PRINGLE: Which is true. I can handle compost, too. There's actually heat, those signs are in compost piles. Oh, my. See that kind of (unintelligible) culture on the side? HARRIS: The green looking thing is the fungus? Professor PRINGLE: Yes. HARRIS: She dumps the banana peels and wilted lettuce and returns the bucket to hostel manager Bob Bayes(ph). Staying at the hostel does have a benefit. Bayes has let Anne Pringle turned the dining room into a lab. They've set up a microscope, laptops and a mushroom dryer. Professor PRINGLE: Hey Bob, would you mind if we left our mushroom dryer while we're gone for the day? Mr. BOB BAYES: No, not at all. Do you need it going all day? Professor PRINGLE: Yeah. Mr. BAYES: Okay, well just leave it there. Professor PRINGLE: It's perfectly safe as long as it's on low heat. So as soon as everybody is ready, we'll go. HARRIS: And soon, she, Franck Richard(ph) and Ben Wolfe are off to look for mushrooms. Professor PRINGLE: Here comes the rain. HARRIS: Undaunted, the research teams sets off along a path lined with bay laurel trees, sword ferns and oaks dripping with nets of lichen. Professor PRINGLE: Why don't we split up. Then you and Frank want to stay and take one  -Mr. BEN WOLFE: Yep. Professor PRINGLE: - and then get litter. It looks so beautiful. Mr. WOLFE: Yeah. HARRIS: Tomales Bay, a narrow crease formed by the San Andreas Fault, peeks through the rain-soaked foliage. Professor PRINGLE: (Unintelligible) HARRIS: She already sees mushrooms. Professor PRINGLE: Yeah. They're not just any, they're phalloides. Yeah. Everywhere. Wow, so here it is, the deadly Amanita phalloides. HARRIS: We kneel down and look at a fist-sized mushroom, white with a tinge of green, sitting in a fleshy cup in the ground. There's a ring around the stem. HARRIS: It seems such an obscure thing to get passionate about. Yet clearly you are. How did that come about? Professor PRINGLE: It's a challenge to study something that's so different from you. Because, you know, a fungus is not a human. It's not an animal. And it doesn't act the same way, so you really have to think hard and challenge your assumptions about everything that it's doing. It's a challenge and it's really appealing to me. HARRIS: Recently, Pringle did some fancy detective work with old books and newfangled DNA techniques to prove that the death cap mushroom is actually an invader from Europe. People accidentally brought it here on the roots of imported trees many decades ago. Now that it's spreading like crazy, Anne Pringle is trying to figure out what native species it might be crowding out in the process. Truth be told, scientists think they haven't even identified 95 percent of the fungi in the world, let alone what's growing here. Professor PRINGLE: So for every species that we have a name for, there are many, many more species that we don't have a name for. So there's a lot we don't know. But yet, here we have this thing that by all accounts is taking over a habitat. We're losing something that we haven't even had a chance to discover yet. And that's not the tropics, it's Northern California. HARRIS: And as if to prove this point, later on, we round a corner on the trail and come across her postdoc, Franck Richard, belly down in an alder swamp. Mr. FRANCK RICHARD (Postdoc Assistant): Something got you. Run. Go. HARRIS: He's not hurt, but ecstatic. Richard's lab back in France studies fungi that only grow in alder patches. And here, on Point Reyes, he finds something similar to the European species but clearly different. In fact, it's a species unknown to science. And not just one, another and then another. Mr. RICHARD: Okay, I got it. I got it. Look, it's purple. This is pretty. Professor PRINGLE: Oh, it's so small. Wow, it's lovely. It's very beautiful. HARRIS: Anne Pringle and grad student Ben Wolfe joined in the hunt, and with little effort, they find eight new undiscovered species. One looks like a small gray potato. Another is luminous white. Professor PRINGLE: I told you. It's like an Easter egg hunt everyday. Mr. WOLFE: Think we don't -Professor PRINGLE: Hey Ben, look at this. Mr. WOLFE: Oh, wow. Oh, look at the bottom. Professor PRINGLE: Yeah, look at the fuzz and look at the gray color. Mr. WOLFE: And the color. It's white. That's amazing. Professor PRINGLE: Isn't that beautiful. I think that's my favorite mushroom -Mr. WOLFE: It's really cool. Professor PRINGLE: - apart from phalloides, maybe. Mr. WOLFE: You have a nice collection of butterflies and sticks on your back. Professor PRINGLE: Oh, lovely. Great. HARRIS: An honest days work. Professor PRINGLE: Yeah. It's not even work. It's not work. It's something else. I don't know what it is. HARRIS: The rain comes in squalls as the scientists fan out across their study area. This is good. Fungi usually live invisibly underground, threads slinking through the soil. But rain coaxes the fungus to sprout mushrooms. Oddly enough, mushrooms are really umbrellas providing shelter for the spores that hide under the cap. Those spores have to stay dry. Fortunately, we don't. You seem utterly undisturbed by the rain. You're not even bothering with your hood. Professor PRINGLE: I love to be outside. I could care less what its like. HARRIS: Anne Pringle's job today is to collect some of the invading death caps. But as we head up the trail, she spots a russula mushroom in the undergrowth. Professor PRINGLE: These are fun mushrooms. If you throw them against a tree, they'll smash into a million pieces. They're brittle like crackers. Russula-smashing is one of Zoe's favorite activities. HARRIS: Pretty good. Professor PRINGLE: If you wanted to save that mushroom, that's a terrible field characteristic because you just splattered it into thousand of pieces. HARRIS: Mushrooms typically rely on plants as partners. They usually play fair with their hosts. They bring the trees nitrogen and take some carbon in return. But Pringle wonders whether the death cap is breaking that rule. One hypothesis is it is doing so well here because it has found a way to cheat the oak trees it lives on. It could be taking nutrients without giving anything back. She plunges a trowel deep into the soil to collect the tree roots as well as the mushrooms. Professor PRINGLE: Okay, look, wow, the earthworms are going nuts. Hi. Look, he's like, that was my home, but you took it away. It's like \"James and the Giant Peach. \" HARRIS: She handles the mushroom so casually, it's startling to think that just a small piece of this is enough to melt your liver and kill you. Professor PRINGLE: It's not a pleasant death. HARRIS: She admits that the creepy aspect of the death cap mushroom is part of the allure. Professor PRINGLE: It is, of course, fun that there's such a deep cultural history associated with this mushroom. You know, you can read about this emperor who was poisoned by eating an Amanita phalloides, or people tell you that it smells like death. And, you know, people are fascinated by this mushroom and the fact that it kills you. There's no denying that. Some people - my friends don't like it when I use the word charismatic, they prefer to use the word notorious, which is fair enough. But I, actually, find it charismatic. HARRIS: As the day progresses, Pringle's fingernails get dirtier and dirtier and she gets more and more absorbed into the damp embrace of the world around her. Professor PRINGLE: Oh, look at the eggs. HARRIS: What are they? Professor PRINGLE: They're eggs of somebody but I don't know who? Insects or something. HARRIS: Yeah. I think you might have one of those eggs in your hair. Professor PRINGLE: Yeah. I've had enough of head lice this year. HARRIS: Not even a Harvard professor's family gets a pass on that undiscriminating pest. Professor PRINGLE: But, you know, the girls were really excited about their head lice in the end because we get - we've identified all stages of the life cycle. And we could do little experiments with the head lice and hair and the water and see the head lice swim to the hair and cling onto it - that was pretty funny. HARRIS: They really are little naturals. Professor PRINGLE: Yeah. Yeah. Yes, they really are, there's no doubt. HARRIS: Then, suddenly the conversation turns serious. Professor PRINGLE: I don't want my kids to be scientists. HARRIS: You don't? Professor PRINGLE: No. Not unless they really want it. It's hard, you know. I don't think you should do it unless you really feel passionately about what you do. And if they feel passionately, then that's okay, but I'm not going to push them in this direction. HARRIS: Much as she loves what she does, she does feel the pressure of her young scientific career. In about five years, Pringle will be asked to write her own job description. Harvard University will then advertise that job, and if she's judged the best applicant, she'll get tenure. Otherwise, it will be time to move on. Professor PRINGLE: I talked to a group of undergraduates the other day, and you know, I think as far as they were concerned, I've made it. I have my job, that was it. My life is set. It was interesting to have that conversation because I started to tell them, you know, this is the most dangerous time of my career, as a matter of fact, this time between having a job and getting tenure. So this is really flying blind in lots of ways. It's okay, though, I'm comfortable with that. Yeah. HARRIS: Yeah. When you pick a project like this or a topic like this, do you think well, gee, what does this going to mean for tenure and various sorts of concrete or career things? Professor PRINGLE: No, I don't care so much about those things. I care about finding important problems and solving them. HARRIS: And here, digging up death caps in the dripping California woods, she's doing just that. Richard Harris, NPR News. NORRIS: A little from the NPR mushroom desk - one more reason to study them -possible medicinal uses. Researchers at the University of Western Sydney in Australia, for instance, want to know if a particular fungus will help treat diabetes. SIEGEL: They're starting an experiment with a mushroom called the Gandoderma lucidum. It's sometimes called the king of herbs and it's already used in Chinese medicine. NORRIS: Scientists wonder if it could help reduce blood sugar. In Boston, another study tests whether a mushroom helps fight cancer. SIEGEL: This one's called Phillinus linteus. A study published in the British Cancer Journal indicates an extract seems to make some cancer cells, in labs at least, easier to kill. No way of knowing if those approaches would work in animals, let alone in people. NORRIS: None of that has helped drive up worldwide mushroom prices. There's report this week that British mushroom companies are in financial trouble. SIEGEL: And in Ukraine, are down almost 30 percent. That could be related to the strong growth of another European mushroom power, Poland.  MICHELE NORRIS, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Michele Norris.

Cornell University and the National Audubon Society, once again, are asking amateur ornithologists and bird enthusiasts in the United States and Canada to go out and count the highest number of each species they see, then send the tally to a special Website, birdcount. org. The count ends Monday, February 19th.  Miyoko Chu, is a science editor at Cornell University's Lab of Ornithology, and she joins us from Ithaca, New York.  Hi, Miyoko. Dr. MIYOKO CHU (Cornell University: Hi, Liane. HANSEN: First, how does this work? Do I just go out into my backyard and if I see, say, four cardinals and six geese and two blue jays and a pigeon, I just write it down and send it to the site? I don't need anything special? Dr. CHU: You can absolutely do that. And you can do it anywhere, whether it's your backyard or a local park. And yes, you count the birds that you see and you tally the highest number that you see at any one time of each species. And then you go to the Web site and you put in your tallies. And they will zip over and help create a real time picture of where birds are at your location and across the continent. HANSEN: Are you seeing interesting patterns, and patterns changing over the past 10 years? Dr. CHU: The thing about bird populations is that they're constantly in flux. And it's really a challenge for scientists to track changes in hundreds of bird species across the continent. You can well imagine. But last year, for example, participants counted seven and a half million birds of 622 different species, which is a massive amount of information in a short amount of time. And each of those species they reported has its own story. So just for example, over the last 10 years, people have contributed to pictures of migration, like of sand hill cranes on their migration flyways. And they have made it farther distances north depending on the weather conditions that year.  HANSEN: Is there one bird that kind of tops the list of the tallies? Dr. CHU: Well, last year the Canada goose was the most numerous bird reported, followed by the snow goose and the European starling. And what's interesting about the European starling is that about 120 years ago, had this count been occurring, you would have had zero.  So you have this bird that's up in the top in the most numerous birds that wasn't even here 120 years ago, until people decided to introduce them to New York's Central Park, because they wanted all of the birds Shakespeare had mentioned to be in the United States.

Cornell University and the National Audubon Society, once again, are asking amateur ornithologists and bird enthusiasts in the United States and Canada to go out and count the highest number of each species they see, then send the tally to a special Website, birdcount. org. The count ends Monday, February 19th.   Miyoko Chu, is a science editor at Cornell University's Lab of Ornithology, and she joins us from Ithaca, New York.   Hi, Miyoko.  Dr. MIYOKO CHU (Cornell University: Hi, Liane.  HANSEN: First, how does this work? Do I just go out into my backyard and if I see, say, four cardinals and six geese and two blue jays and a pigeon, I just write it down and send it to the site? I don't need anything special?  Dr. CHU: You can absolutely do that. And you can do it anywhere, whether it's your backyard or a local park. And yes, you count the birds that you see and you tally the highest number that you see at any one time of each species. And then you go to the Web site and you put in your tallies. And they will zip over and help create a real time picture of where birds are at your location and across the continent.  HANSEN: Are you seeing interesting patterns, and patterns changing over the past 10 years?  Dr. CHU: The thing about bird populations is that they're constantly in flux. And it's really a challenge for scientists to track changes in hundreds of bird species across the continent. You can well imagine. But last year, for example, participants counted seven and a half million birds of 622 different species, which is a massive amount of information in a short amount of time. And each of those species they reported has its own story. So just for example, over the last 10 years, people have contributed to pictures of migration, like of sand hill cranes on their migration flyways. And they have made it farther distances north depending on the weather conditions that year.   HANSEN: Is there one bird that kind of tops the list of the tallies?  Dr. CHU: Well, last year the Canada goose was the most numerous bird reported, followed by the snow goose and the European starling. And what's interesting about the European starling is that about 120 years ago, had this count been occurring, you would have had zero.   So you have this bird that's up in the top in the most numerous birds that wasn't even here 120 years ago, until people decided to introduce them to New York's Central Park, because they wanted all of the birds Shakespeare had mentioned to be in the United States.

I'm Scott Simon.  This year marks the 400th anniversary of the first permanent English settlement in America. A group of Englishmen, including John Smith, who later was befriended by Pocahontas, built a fort at Jamestown, Virginia in 1607, 13 years before the Pilgrims crossed the Atlantic on the Mayflower. And for the past 14 years, Bill Kelso has been working to uncover the secrets of Jamestown. NPR's Thomas Pierce has more. THOMAS PIERCE: It was Spring when the English explorers found a channel so close to shore that they could tie their ships to the trees. The maze of tidal creeds in the Chesapeake were sun-warmed then, and the salt marsh grasses green. Compared to the cold they'd left behind in England, this was paradise. But five months later, more than half of the original group of 104 men were dead, most from famine. This is often cited by as historians to show that the settlers were ill suited to the task of staying alive in a new world. Mr. BILL KELSO (Archaeologist): The traditional story is that this is just a bunch of gentlemen who weren't used to working hard, they were put out in the wilderness, didn't know what to do, and all sat around and waited to die from hunger or something. PIERCE: Archaeologist Bill Kelso has a different view. He's with the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, in charge of their Jamestown team. (Soundbite of digging) PIERCE: Two assistants are digging close to a well where they found all kinds of trashy treasures. Preserved beneath the water table for 400 years, metal breastplates and a loaded pistol and discarded animal bones. He says all of it is proof that the settlers weren't just sitting around. Mr. KELSO: They were cutting down trees, digging holes, building forts, building buildings, digging ditches, burying people. They were exploring. PIERCE: Tough men with skills and training, he says. Kelso himself is a husky man with a bright white mustache. Put him in some armor and you might mistake him for an explorer. And in a sense he is. He's every bit as tenacious and curious as the settlers who managed to erect a triangular fort here within 19 days after landing. Mr. KELSO: Well, right over here I think is really a mathematical center of this triangle. If I can get it lined up. Yeah, right here. Arguably this is where the America as we know began. Right here at this spot. And that gets me every time. I get really emotional about it. PIERCE: Kelso's team has rebuilt segments of the fort's walls, and they've begun constructing a building on this site using only mud and rough cut timber to better understand the challenges of the settlers' lives. Several years ago, director Terrence Malick hired Kelso to advise him about how the set should look for \"The New World,\" his film about Jamestown. Mr. KELSO: If you want to know what it was like to be in Jamestown in the early 17th century, see this movie. (Soundbite of movie, \"The New World\") Mr. COLIN FARRELL (Actor): (As John Smith) Every man will stop what he's doing right now and start digging the well. Those of you that can't carry the dirt in buckets shall carry it with your own hands. He that will not work shall not eat. The labors of honest and industrious men should not be consumed to maintain the idleness of a few. PIERCE: And the exhausting work wasn't their only problem, Kelso says. Mr. KELSO: The Indians didn't want them here most of the time. And so there was nobody protecting you, covering your back. And then even the people you're with, you know, could be a problem. PIERCE: In fact, one of the first skeletons they uncovered was a gunshot victim, most likely killed by a fellow settler's musket. The fall of 1607 was a stressful time for the colony. There was civil unrest; men were dying from famine, Indian arrows, disease, exertion and gunshot wounds. In one section of the fort alone, Kelso's crew has marked some 30 overlapping gravesites with crosses. But Kelso is drawn to one grave in particular, a grave set apart from the rest. Two years ago Kelso found the remnants of a coffin filled with more than bones. Inside was a captain's staff, and he knew he had someone important. Based on the skeleton's age and the date of burial, he thinks he's found none other than Bartholomew Gosnold. Mr. KELSO: Gosnold was one of the designers of the fort. And here's an unmarked, unknown - sort of unknown soldier grave that, you know, can now be marked. His named doesn't appear anywhere. He died so early on. And yet Smith himself said that Gosnold was the most important person in the whole colonial effort at Jamestown. And yet we've never heard of him. PIERCE: But not everyone's convinced the grave is Gosnold's. Last year, DNA tests were performed using a skeleton believed to have belonged to Gosnold's sister that came back negative. But Kelso is skeptical that they even had the sister's remains. (Soundbite of squeaky gate) PIERCE: Kelso doesn't live very far from the grave he still believes is Gosnold's. He's greeted at the gate by one of his basset hounds, Bart. (Soundbite of dog) PIERCE: Short for Bartholomew Gosnold, of course. When Kelso's not digging in the fort, you can find him with his dogs or with one of his bluegrass bands. Turns out he handles a banjo as well as a shovel. Mr. KELSO: There is a song that's kind of archeological. (Soundbite of music)  Mr. KELSO: \"The Old Home Place. \" (Soundbite of music)  PIERCE: Jamestown is more than just an old home place for long-since dead men like John Smith and Bartholomew Gosnold. This is Kelso's home too. And when the 400th anniversary celebrations begin in a few months, he'll be ready for his guests, ready to show them the artifacts he spent a lifetime collecting.  (Soundbite of song, \"The Old Home Place\") Mr. KELSO: (Singing) It's been 10 long years since I left my home in a hollow where I was born. Well, cool fall nights make the wood smoke rise and a foxhunter blows his horn. . . PIERCE: Thomas Pierce, NPR News. (Soundbite of a song, \"Old Home Place\") Unidentified Man: (Singing) I fell in love with a girl from the town I thought that she would be true. I ran away to Charlottesville and worked in a sawmill or two. What have we done to the old home place? Why did they tear it down? And why. . .

S. companies are also pushing the idea of carbon caps. One of them is Duke Energy, one of the largest power companies in the country. Its CEO Jim Rogers joined us in the studio to talk about why he's taking action. Mr. JAMES ROGERS (President and CEO, Duke Energy): We're looking out and developing a timeline in trying to limit the emissions at a certain level over 10, 20, and 30 years. And over time, it will lead to the reversal of the emissions level. MONTAGNE: Now your plants at Duke Energy, they burn what - coal, oil? Mr. ROGERS: Ninety-eight percent of the electricity that we provide comes from coal and nuclear. MONTAGNE: Reducing emissions is going to cost money, the various things that have to be done, some of them quite big projects as far as plants go. What is that money going to come out of? Profits, or is it that customers will carry the burden? Mr. ROGERS: The caps will translate into higher cost for our consumers. It requires significant investment and research development and deployment of new technologies. The money for this is going to come from the government. It will come from the industry. It is critical that we bring even more money in to develop this technology if we're going to hit - be able to achieve the aggressive reduction goals that we have set out for ourselves. We're in the beginning of a building cycle where we have to build base-low coal, nuclear and gas plants. It's important that, as we plan, when we build our power plant, that plant will be around for 50 years. So if we're going to build a coal plant, which has significant emissions, we want to make sure we've designed the plant in a way that is capable of connecting a CO2 scrubber-type technology to the unit so we can get reductions of CO2. MONTAGNE: Do you still see using coal in 50 years? Mr. ROGERS: Today, 50 percent of our electricity comes from coal. We have a 250-year supply. But its success in the future and our use of coal is dependent on the ability to create technologies that allow us to take the CO2 out. MONTAGNE: Do you have 10 or 20 years to wait for this technology and to delay really strict caps on emissions? Mr. ROGERS: I would have never agreed to the cap proposal, where the caps are very tough, very soon, if I didn't believe we have the capability to hit those targets.

Jim Rogers is the CEO of Duke Energy. It's one of the largest energy companies in the U. S. Along with nine other large American firms, he's been talking to policymakers about creating regulation to reduce greenhouse gases. We'll hear from him in a few minutes. First, we'll talk to Sir Nicholas Stern. He's an economic adviser to the British government and the man who the government tapped to study impact of climate change. The result was the Stern Review, which was published late last year. Nicholas Stern has said that unchecked climate change could cause economic disruption on the scale of the Great Depression. To keep this from happening, he says carbon emissions have to be reduced dramatically and immediately. Sir NICHOLAS STERN (Author, The Stern Review): People are realizing now the urgency of the situation. If we leave it very much longer, we're going to end up in a position where it's extremely difficult to hold the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to tolerable levels. The later we leave it, the more difficult the adjustments will be, the bigger the cost we have to bear. MONTAGNE: Well, let's get to your talks. You've been on Capitol Hill this week and you've been meeting with Bush administration officials. Is your message for the United States? Sir STERN: It's for everybody. And we've come to the United States this week. We've been going around the world trying to discuss the problems, and share our findings, and talk to people about the possible ways forward because different countries are doing different things. And it's remarkable that most countries around the world now are actively engaged in this problem. The challenge, of course, is to do enough and quickly enough. MONTAGNE: Of course, the United States, at least the Bush administration, hasn't ratified the Kyoto protocol on climate change. What are you hearing now from the Bush administration that suggests to you that anything would change? Sir STERN: Well, I think you have to look at different states and different businesses, and there are many people in the United States moving strongly on this. California has strong ambitions. You have many cities in the United States committed to this. We've had 10 big firms writing to President Bush after his State of the Union message. And in the State of the Union message itself there was a very strong emphasis on energy security, and a recognition that the kinds of things that you do for energy security are also the kind of things that you would do to curb the emission of greenhouse gases and to help stop global warming. And President Bush recognized that clearly in his speech. MONTAGNE: But even if the United States could shut down all of its carbon emissions, it couldn't stop the direction that global warming is heading in. If other nations in other areas of the world aren't included, how do you get developing countries like China and India who are now responsible for a great deal of the carbon emissions, and will increasingly be so in the future, to lower their output, to agree to, say, caps on carbon emissions? Sir STERN: The big majority of the emissions still come from the rich countries. United States is the biggest emitter by quite a long way because it's a richer economy. It's got more economic activity. And so what happens in the United States is of real significance to the rest of the world, because it's a big part of the problem, at least 20 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions come. Now in China there's a growing recognition of the problem. China has a very ambitious energy efficiency program. Over the next five years they'll reduce the energy used in relation to output by 20 percent. China is moving in a strong way in a good direction. And with the right kind of collaboration, I think that China would move still faster. If we recognize what others are doing and we act strongly and together, then I think we can make really effective progress, and that's why carbon trading is so important. MONTAGNE: Talk to us about carbon trading. It's something that businesses have looked kindly on in the United States. Tell us what that is. Sir STERN: Each firm gets a cap. It's not allowed to emit carbon beyond that cap. And if it does want to go beyond that cap, then it has to buy permits from other people. And it buys the permits from other people because those other people have found ways, they hope cheaply, to go below their cap. So it works, we call it cap and trade. And the advantage of that is it gets your carbon's reductions done in the cheapest possible place. MONTAGNE: Sir Nicholas Stern is the key adviser to the British government on climate change.

The Tasmanian devil makes plenty of trouble in Warner Brothers' cartoons, but in real life, the devil is in serious trouble. The cause: deadly facial tumors. ALEX CHADWICK, host: Ten years ago, there were an estimated 200,000 devils living on the island of Tasmania. It's off the southeast corner of Australia. Now there are only 50 or 60 thousand. Earlier, I spoke with John Hamilton. He runs the Tasmanian Devil Conservation Park in Tasmania. Mr. JOHN HAMILTON (Founder and Director, Tasmanian Devil Conservation Park): The Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease first presents as a small lesion around the mouth of the Tasmanian devil. That then grows into what can be a truly horrific-looking cancer or tumor that can take over the whole of the face, and eventually that ends up going to the lymphatic system and affecting other organs. So the Tasmanian devils, from the first sign of the disease to death, is typically five to six months, and in all cases so far, it's found to be fatal. CHADWICK: Well, what do the veterinarians say is the cause? Mr. HAMILTON: Tasmanian devils are fairly feisty little animals, hence the nature of the well-known cartoon character, which is partially representative of the devil's nature. In this case, one animal bites another and implants a rogue cell, which happens to be cancerous, so then that turns into a lesion and in turn, cancer. So what we have is a fatal, transmissible cancer, and such a creature has never been known before. CHADWICK: Well, what measures are you taking down there to try to protect the Tasmanian devils? Mr. HAMILTON: There is a number of wildlife centers, of which we're the largest and the oldest, and all the Tasmanian devils in our centers are disease-free. The other thing is that there is a peninsula in the area where we live, and there's no disease in this region, and it's considered that this peninsula could hold out the best hope of retaining a disease-free wild population. CHADWICK: How large is the peninsula? How many Tasmanian devils could exist there, do you think? Mr. HAMILTON: We hope that there could be some thousands. I wouldn't say tens and tens of thousands. That would not be sustainable. What we have to make sure is that within that sustainable population we have as much genetic diversity as possible. And that's not so easy because the devil now has a narrow genetic base, and that may be the reason, inbreeding in fact, that the devil has had a bit of a breakdown in its immune system, and that's why it's susceptible to this transmissible cancer. CHADWICK: John Hamilton, you run a conservation park for Tasmanian devils there, so you're very fond of these creatures. Mr. HAMILTON: Well absolutely. What we do is in fact look after them, and they're quite friendly, and these are endearing little creatures, especially when they're small. When they're large, they're pretty ugly looking, but they are quite fascinating creatures. CHADWICK: John Hamilton runs the Tasmanian Devil Conservation Park in Tasmania.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Ten years ago today, the term Dolly took on new significance. Forget Madison and Parton, Dolly the sheep was introduced to the world by Scottish scientists, the first cloned mammal. And her arrival triggered often hysterical speculation that human cloning was just around the corner. But as NPR's Joe Palca reports, today human cloning may indeed be just around the corner, but not in the way people feared a decade ago. JOE PALCA: Each one of my skin cells contains all the DNA necessary to make me. But because it's a skin cell, the DNA has undergone some physical changes. These changes have the effect of turning off lots of genes that aren't needed for making my skin. The same is true for virtually all the cells in my body. The Scottish scientists showed that it was possible to undo those changes by putting a cell into an egg. Somehow the egg is able to rejuvenate the DNA. It restores the potential of any adult cell's DNA to make an entire animal. That's how Dolly was made, and the technique took off. Unidentified Man: First there was Dolly the sheep, and now there is Cumulina the mouse. SIEGEL: Scientists in Texas say that they've succeeded in creating the world's first cloned cat. Unidentified Woman #1: . . . created world's first cloned horse. Unidentified Woman #2: . . . the world's first cloned mule. Unidentified Woman #3: . . . the first cloned dog every created. PALCA: Despite all the success with four-legged animals, there were no credible reports suggesting human cloning was possible, until this one. Unidentified Woman #3: Scientists in Korea have successfully cloned a human embryo. PALCA: But it turned out this was a breakthrough that wasn't. Although the claim appeared in the prestigious journal Science, it turned out to be fraudulent. Now the Korean scientists weren't trying to make a cloned baby. They were trying to make cloned embryos in order make embryonic stem cells. Here's why: If one of my skin cells was used to make a cloned embryo, any stem cell from that embryo would be genetically identical to me and my immune system wouldn't reject them if I got stem-cell therapy. This promise of tailor-made therapies has prompted several teams of scientists around the world to try to make embryonic stem cells from cloned embryos. But Robert Lanza of the biotech firm ACT says no one's managed it yet. Mr. ROBERT LANZA (Senior Scientist, Advanced Cell Technology): There have now been, you know, at least a dozen or two different species cloned, but for each species there's been a unique set of problems, and the human is no different. PALCA: One reason the roadblocks to human cloning are hard to overcome is the shortage of human eggs for research. Robert Blelloch of the University of California San Francisco says that made him decide to begin his work on human cloning by studying monkeys first. Professor ROBERT BLELLOCH (Urology, University of California San Francisco): If we can figure out these big roadblocks in a system where we have better access to healthy eggs, then I think we'll be in a much better position. Once we figure those roadblocks out, we can move on to humans. PALCA: Another hurdle is ignorance about precisely how a fertilized egg begins to divide and grow. Susan Fisher is a stem-cell scientist at UC San Francisco. Professor SUSAN FISHER (Biomedical Science, University of California San Francisco): Because the federal government has prohibited academic institutions from working on embryos, we really know almost nothing about human embryos in the beginning stages. PALCA: The opportunities for gaining that knowledge are probably greatest in California, where Fisher and Blelloch work, because California has committed to spending $3 billion on cloning and stem-cell research over the next decade. Prof. FISHER: So for us to get somewhere, I really think that we need to understand the basic biology. Otherwise, we're just technicians who are trying a whole bunch of things, and there's so much to try. PALCA: Despite the hurdles, Fisher, Blelloch and Lanza don't hesitate when asked whether someone will succeed in cloning a human embryo. Prof. FISHER: Oh, I absolutely do think it's going to happen. Prof. BLELLOCH: Yeah, I definitely do. Mr. LANZA: Absolutely. I don't think there's any biological reason why the human is any different than other mammalian species. PALCA: Of course, while it may be technically possible to make a cloned human embryo, President Bush and others have argued it's morally wrong and not something scientists should do.

I'm Luke Burbank MADELEINE BRAND, host: And I'm Madeleine Brand. You know, it's hard out there for a chimp, but those animals may be a lot tougher than we thought. A new study of West African chimpanzees shows that they're now making their own weapons, the first animals other than humans to do that. And they're using those weapons to attack other animals. Joining us now is Jill Pruetz. She's an anthropologist at Iowa State University and a lead researcher in the study. And, welcome to DAY TO DAY. Dr. JILL PRUETZ (Iowa State University): Well, hi. Thanks. BRAND: Okay. So what exactly were they doing, these chimps? Ms. PRUETZ: Well, what they're doing is actually fashioning these sturdy stick tools and using them to incapacitate bush babies, which are small primates themselves. They're prosimian primates. And basically, this is a very clever way of keeping these - their prey from escaping, and then are able to retrieve them later. BRAND: And they're actually fashioning crude spears? Ms. PRUETZ: Right. And they have a fairly systematic way of fashioning the tools. They can use up to five or more steps. And some individuals even go so far as to sharpen the tip of the tool with their incisors, in effect, making a point. BRAND: Wow. And then they go in and find where the bush babies are hiding or sleeping and stab them to death? Ms. PRUETZ: Well, we haven't been able to see exactly what goes on in the hollow, but often they made tool while they're in a tree that has a hollow. And then they will stab the tool in there multiple times, using a very forceful jabbing motion. They'll do this multiple times. They'll pull the tool out and then either smell it, sniff it or lick it sometimes, and they may proceed to stab it in there again. Sometimes they'll abandon a tool and make another. BRAND: Well, it sounds quite murderous. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. PRUETZ: I mean, well, you know, they have to eat. So. . . BRAND: Yeah. Right. Ms. PRUETZ: And they do eat other primates at the site. Males eat monkeys. I guess one thing that was really exciting about this finding was the fact that it's not predominantly an adult male behavior. And usually in chimps, we think of males as being the hunters in the species. BRAND: So, you're saying that it was the females that were carrying out this? Ms. PRUETZ: Well, individuals we saw that exhibited the behavior most were actually adolescent females. There were some young males that performed the behavior as well, but by and large, the adolescent females were ones that we witnessed doing this the most. BRAND: Teenage girls. Ms. PRUETZ: Yeah. Teenage girls. (Soundbite of laughter) BRAND: Well, this is kind of surprising, because you think well, they're spending all their time really, you know, taking care of their babies. Do they really have time to go out on the hunt? Ms. PRUETZ: Right. And well, I think this one way that females are able to go out on a hunt. You know, one of the - the adult female that I saw performing this type of behavior actually had a little, you know, fairly small infant clinging to her belly while she was performing this behavior, and it was just kind of trying to hang on. Females that have infants, especially, are not able to effectively hunt monkeys like males do and immature - or probably not very efficient hunters, but they can perform this type of behavior. It's not a very costly behavior. And I think it's just a really creative, innovative solution to a problem that they get around - basically they use their brains to solve, I guess. BRAND: Well, what does this mean in terms of understanding humans and evolution? Ms. PRUETZ: I think it just supports some of the hypothesis and theories that have been around there for a while, that we tend to maybe ignore, that we should consider females in terms of technology - the evolution of technology - a little more seriously. So I think it just supports what others have said. Sometimes it's hard to get away from that old man, the hunter paradigm that I think anthropologists have kind of adhered to for a very long time.

I'm Michele Norris. MELISSA BLOCK, host: And I'm Melissa Block. On Capitol Hill today, a Senate committee considered an idea that's been kicking around Washington for more than a decade: having the Food and Drug Administration regulate tobacco. People who have been working for decades on this issue, say for the first time there is a real chance the FDA could make rules about how cigars, cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are manufactured, advertised, and sold. NPR's Joanne Silberner reports. JOANNE SILBERNER: At least one man has been waiting for this day for a long, long time, former FDA Commissioner David Kessler. Mr. DAVID KESSLER (Former Commissioner, FDA): I mean FDA regulates everything that is put on the skin, everything that we eat, all our medicines - we take vaccines, drugs - the FDA doesn't regulate tobacco? The most dangerous of products, and there is no federal regulation. SILBERNER: In the 1990s when Kessler was FDA commissioner in both Republican and Democratic administrations, he fought to regulate cigars, cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. There were hearings on Capitol Hill. Tobacco products were declared drug delivery devices, addictive and lethal, and the agency tried to restrict advertising in marketing. But the tobacco industry filed suit, the case made it all the way to the Supreme Court - in the end Kessler and the FDA were swatted down for the time being. Mr. KESSLER: What the Supreme Court said was that FDA under the current law, did not have jurisdiction. Four justices said yes, the FDA did, five said no -said Congress can change the law if it wants to regulate cigarettes. SILBERNER: Over the years, some in Congress tried. They were blocked by Congress members from tobacco growing states and by Republicans who objected to giving a government agency more power. Now the Democrats are in control, and today, an influential Senate committee considered new legislation. It would allow the FDA to restrict advertising, limit sales of tobacco to minors, control what the tobacco companies say about the safety of their products, and order the reduction of dangerous components of tobacco, such as carcinogens and nicotine. Long-time tobacco opponent Alan Blum actually testified against the legislation, saying smokers might be falsely reassured if the FDA is involved. Mr. ALAN BLUM (Anti-tobacco Activist): If consumers are told that one, two or even 22 cancer causes in tobacco smoke have been reduced they're going to assume that a problem has been taken care of. They're going to believe that cigarettes are safer, and they're going to continue to smoke. SILBERNER: And Republican Senator Mike Enzi said he doesn't think the FDA, which had come under harsh criticism of late, could handle the extra work. Senator MIKE ENZI (Republican, Wyoming): The FDA is overworked and underfunded. SILBERNER: But others said that $300 million in fees from tobacco companies would enable the agency to do the job. This time around the tobacco industry appears to be resigned to some sort of government oversight. Tommy Payne is an executive vice president for Reynolds America, which makes Camel, Kools and Winston. Mr. TOMMY PAYNE (Executive Vive President, Reynolds America): We believe that there is a need for a national regulatory policy regarding the manufacturing, the use and the marketing of tobacco products in the United States. SILBERNER: He does, though, think the current legislation goes too far in limiting advertising, which he says will also limit competition between tobacco companies. And, he says, if the FDA dramatically reduces nicotine levels a black market in high nicotine cigarettes could develop, and there would be a drop in the money the states get from cigarette taxes. Philip Morris, the nation's largest tobacco manufacturer has spoken out in favor of the bill. That support, plus the Democratic majorities in both houses are why many people are so optimistic,  including former FDA head, David Kessler. Mr. KESSLER: The only missing piece is it has to be enacted into law. SILBERNER: Is this the time? Mr. KESSLER: I think this is the time. SILBERNER: The sponsors of the Senate bill promised to fast-track it and the strong bipartisan support in the House of Representatives as well. Joanne Silberner, NPR News, Washington.

Mr. DAVID KESSLER (Former Commissioner, FDA): I mean FDA regulates everything that is put on the skin, everything that we eat, all our medicines - we take vaccines, drugs - the FDA doesn't regulate tobacco? The most dangerous of products, and there is no federal regulation.  SILBERNER: In the 1990s when Kessler was FDA commissioner in both Republican and Democratic administrations, he fought to regulate cigars, cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. There were hearings on Capitol Hill. Tobacco products were declared drug delivery devices, addictive and lethal, and the agency tried to restrict advertising in marketing. But the tobacco industry filed suit, the case made it all the way to the Supreme Court - in the end Kessler and the FDA were swatted down for the time being.  Mr. KESSLER: What the Supreme Court said was that FDA under the current law, did not have jurisdiction. Four justices said yes, the FDA did, five said no -said Congress can change the law if it wants to regulate cigarettes.  SILBERNER: Over the years, some in Congress tried. They were blocked by Congress members from tobacco growing states and by Republicans who objected to giving a government agency more power. Now the Democrats are in control, and today, an influential Senate committee considered new legislation. It would allow the FDA to restrict advertising, limit sales of tobacco to minors, control what the tobacco companies say about the safety of their products, and order the reduction of dangerous components of tobacco, such as carcinogens and nicotine.  Long-time tobacco opponent Alan Blum actually testified against the legislation, saying smokers might be falsely reassured if the FDA is involved.  Mr. ALAN BLUM (Anti-tobacco Activist): If consumers are told that one, two or even 22 cancer causes in tobacco smoke have been reduced they're going to assume that a problem has been taken care of. They're going to believe that cigarettes are safer, and they're going to continue to smoke.  SILBERNER: And Republican Senator Mike Enzi said he doesn't think the FDA, which had come under harsh criticism of late, could handle the extra work.  Senator MIKE ENZI (Republican, Wyoming): The FDA is overworked and underfunded.  SILBERNER: But others said that $300 million in fees from tobacco companies would enable the agency to do the job. This time around the tobacco industry appears to be resigned to some sort of government oversight. Tommy Payne is an executive vice president for Reynolds America, which makes Camel, Kools and Winston.  Mr. TOMMY PAYNE (Executive Vive President, Reynolds America): We believe that there is a need for a national regulatory policy regarding the manufacturing, the use and the marketing of tobacco products in the United States.  SILBERNER: He does, though, think the current legislation goes too far in limiting advertising, which he says will also limit competition between tobacco companies. And, he says, if the FDA dramatically reduces nicotine levels a black market in high nicotine cigarettes could develop, and there would be a drop in the money the states get from cigarette taxes.  Philip Morris, the nation's largest tobacco manufacturer has spoken out in favor of the bill. That support, plus the Democratic majorities in both houses are why many people are so optimistic,  including former FDA head, David Kessler.  Mr. KESSLER: The only missing piece is it has to be enacted into law.  SILBERNER: Is this the time?  Mr. KESSLER: I think this is the time.  SILBERNER: The sponsors of the Senate bill promised to fast-track it and the strong bipartisan support in the House of Representatives as well.  Joanne Silberner, NPR News, Washington.

MICHELE NORRIS, Host: And I'm Michele Norris. Archeologists say they've identified what is by far the oldest astronomical observatory in the Americas. A series of towers near a temple in coastal Peru was built in the fourth century B. C. Those towers turn out to mark the sun's progress across the sky, according to a study in the latest Science magazine. It seems the sun played an important role in religious and political life long before the Incas' sun cult appeared. NPR's Richard Harris reports. RICHARD HARRIS: Nineteenth century explorers came across a curious scene in coastal Peru. An ancient fortress stood near a long ridge dotted with 13 stubby towers, kind of like a sea serpent's back. The early explorers suggested that the towers had something to do with the movement of the moon, and left it at that. A few years ago, Ivan Ghezzi at long last drummed up enough funding to excavate the site, which is called Chankillo, to uncover its secrets. IVAN GHEZZI: Number one on my list was this possible relationship to astronomy. HARRIS: Ghezzi is at the Catholic University of Peru and the national director of archeology. He quickly came to realize that the towers had nothing to do with the moon, but everything to do with the sun, when viewed from either of two structures that stood nearby. GHEZZI: We could actually watch the sun rise aligned with the northernmost tower during the June solstice, and with the opposite tower at the other end of the line, you could see the sun rise at the December solstice. So we realized that here we had an astronomical device that was designed to keep track of the movement of the sun and therefore keep track of time. HARRIS: And it's by far the earliest example of an observatory in the Americas. Ghezzi knows frustratingly little about the people who built the towers and the fortifications at Chankillo. For example, there is no telling whether they were in any way forerunners of the Incas, famous sun worshippers who appeared on the scene many centuries after this structure was built. GHEZZI: We know that the Incas made powerful political statements based on the relationship between the sun and the king. And the Inca claimed to be the offspring of the sun. But now we have a society that is 1,800 years before the Inca and that clearly is using the sun as a way to make a political, social and ecological statement. HARRIS: The towers weren't just a fancy sundial. For one thing, the fortifications nearby appear to protect a temple. Anthony Aveni is an archeo-astronomer at Colgate University. He agrees with Ghezzi's interpretation that the site is of great cultural and political significance, in addition to its practical use for timing, plantings, and harvests. ANTHONY AVENI: So you have not just agricultural practicalities, the practical idea of keeping a calendar for agriculture, but embedded - that is all embedded within this religious ritual that they conducted. And then of course associated with religious ritual is hierarchical powers. HARRIS: The priests who controlled the temple presumably held sway over the people around them and used their knowledge of astronomy as part of their mystique. The question as always in situations like this is whether the towers were really built with the astronomy in mind, or if the layout turns out to be a happy coincidence. But Aveni, for one, is convinced that this observatory is the real deal. AVENI: It does work, and it works in a way that makes sense given what we know about Andean calendars. HARRIS: The towers help mark other solar events, and they help count out a 10-day week, which Andean people used. Ivan Ghezzi says tourists may soon be able to judge this for themselves. He's working hard to turn the well-preserved ruins of Chankillo into a major destination. Richard Harris, NPR News. MELISSA BLOCK, Host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

They followed similar paths, but Katrina remained strong as it approached land while Rita faded. As NPR's Jon Hamilton reports, scientists say they're beginning to understand why the two storms behaved so differently. JON HAMILTON: A hurricane is a bit like a figure skater doing a spin. Skaters revolve slowly when their arms and legs are extended, but pull in those arms and legs and the skater becomes a spinning blur. Robert Houze of the University of Washington says hurricanes rotate, too. ROBERT HOUZE: The storm is a circular vortex swirling around very, very fast. HAMILTON: And in a hurricane, he says, the equivalent of a skater's arms and legs is the wall of thunderstorms that surrounds the eye. As this eyewall contracts, the storm spins faster. Houze says that's what was happening with Katrina as it approached Louisiana and Mississippi. Just hours before landfall, it was still a Category 5 storm with winds of more than 160 miles per hour. An amateur storm-chaser managed to record those winds as they blasted through a multi-level parking lot in Biloxi, Mississippi. (SOUNDBITE OF WIND)HAMILTON: Rita was a different story. It had become a Category 5 storm out in the Gulf, but by the time it neared the coast forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said the news was getting better. Unidentified Man: Rita remains a very dangerous hurricane, still Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Maximum winds remain at 125 miles per hour. HAMILTON: Remember that spinning skater extending her arms and legs? Houze says Rita had done something similar. The eyewall had gotten bigger. HOUZE: A second ring of clouds formed, surrounding the inner ring of clouds. HAMILTON: It eventually replaced them. HOUZE: When that happens, the storm de-intensifies. It loses its punch rather quickly. Although it was still a very powerful storm, it was not as strong. HAMILTON: If Rita had spent another day or two in the Gulf, the new eyewall would have begun to contract, causing the storm to speed up again. Houze says he and other scientists were able to look at both storms in detail because during that summer they were studying hurricanes using planes equipped with high-resolution radar. Their timing was perfect. HOUZE: Katrina and Rita have given us almost a natural controlled experiment, because the storms followed very similar paths, yet Rita formed a secondary eyewall and Katrina didn't. HAMILTON: And now they've got to figure out why this so-called eyewall replacement happens. There are some hints. For example, Rita had higher humidity near its center and lower humidity farther away. But even without knowing why a new and bigger eyewall might form, it should now be possible to create a computer model that includes this possibility. Hugh Willoughby is a researcher at Florida International University. He says the limitations of current models mean that forecasters still occasionally underestimate a storm. HUGH WILLOUGHBY: Yeah, you're nervous about it, but it's not the monster storm of your nightmares. And then wham, 12 hours later or six hours later it's this nasty, devastating storm. HAMILTON: Hurricane Andrew in 1992 behaved a bit like that. It went through an eyewall-replacement cycle out at sea. At first, the new, larger eyewall caused Andrew to slow down. Then, Willoughby says, the new eyewall began to contract. WILLOUGHBY: It had completed the cycle, and it was re-intensifying as it came across the Gulf Stream and as it came on shore. That was what made it such a bad hurricane. HAMILTON: Willoughby says forecasters are getting better at predicting the intensity of storms, and he says investing more of the kind of the technology used to study Rita and Katrina should help with future hurricanes.

I'm Farai Chideya. Not long ago, we told you about a national report that focused on the beliefs and actions of African-American youth aged 15-25. The study titled, \"The Black Youth Project,\" picked the brains of young people regarding a variety of issues, from politics to pop culture. One of those topics addressed in the study is especially controversial, that would be sex. According to the Black AIDS Institute, more than half of the annual new infections in this country are among 13 to 24-year-olds. And the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cites in a recent study that young African-Americans reported the highest rates of having intercourse - 67 percent compared to 42 percent of whites. So with that, we wondered what's on the minds of black youth when it comes to issues regarding sex? Back on the program with us is the study's lead researcher, Cathy Cohen. She's professor of political science and director of the Center for the Study of Race, Politics and Culture at the University of Chicago. Professor Cohen joins us from WBEZ in Chicago. Welcome. Professor CATHY COHEN (Director, Center for the Study of Race, Politics and Culture, University of Chicago): Thank you. CHIDEYA: I know you led a national study that was recently released and you talked to 15 to 25-year-olds. And when you were on with us before, we spoke primarily about politics but not about sex. So with that, what is it that you learned most about African-American teens and youth and their ideas, thoughts and concerns about sex? Prof. COHEN: We learned a number of different things, part of it having to do with the sexual behaviors. But I think some of the more interesting findings have to do with really their sexual attitudes. As you said in the intro, we do know that African-American youth or black youth are having more sexual intercourse than other young people. We also know, however, that white young people tend to engage in oral sex more often than African-American youth or Latino youth. But I think we often don't kind of ask questions about how do they feel about sex. What do they think they need to know to make better decisions about sex? And that was one of the areas that we tried to probe in this research. CHIDEYA: You compared the views of nearly 1,600 young people of different racial and ethnic groups in the study. And I understand that you found that 68 percent of blacks believe the government would do more to find a cure for AIDS if more whites were infected. Is that one of the things that we're talking about with attitudes regarding sex? Prof. COHEN: That's one of the ideas here, is that, in fact, first of all, there's great cynicism, I think, about the government. So when we ask something not only about HIV and AIDS and the government's response to that, but when we ask, for example, should the government only be funding abstinence-only sex education, an overwhelming majority of young people said that that was the wrong governmental policy. They believe, in fact, that the government should be funding sex education projects and programs that give a comprehensive understanding of sex. And really, 90 percent of young people across racial identities believe that, in fact, sex education should be mandatory in schools, 70 percent, at least, believe that in fact condom should be given out in schools. So these young people are telling us that, in fact, they want kind of complete information when making sexual decisions so that they can make healthy sexual decision. CHIDEYA: They want the information, but do they understand the dangers of engaging in unprotected sex? And how does that compared to other ethnic groups? Prof. COHEN: What we're finding among young people is that sex kind of serves some multiple purposes. Clearly, it's a part of the developmental process. Every young person goes through a process where in fact they engage at some level or to some extent in sex. But I think sex also works to provide a domain for young black people where they feel like they're in control and have some success. If you think about the fact that we are losing kind of good manufacturing jobs, that it's difficult for young blacks to have a good living wage jobs, that they suffer twice the unemployment, for example, that white people do, this is one of the areas, believe it or not, where they feel like they have great success, where they're in control and where they're pretty efficacious. And what I mean by that is young black people tell us that they're more able to talk to their partners about what they want to do and when they want to have sex. So they believe, in fact, that they have some control in this area. Now, the reality is that they may believe that they have control but the consequences of kind of risky sexual decision making is evident in the disproportionate numbers of African-American youth who contract HIV and suffer from AIDS. CHIDEYA: Through 2001, African-Americans accounted for nearly three quarters of the diagnosed HIV infections among 13 to 19-year-old girls and two thirds of 20 to 24-year-old women. Now have you seen any differences in the ways that black boys and black girls handle life choices when it comes to sex? Prof. COHEN: Well, you know, it's interesting because in fact when we look at questions that ask about protection, repeatedly in kind of numerous studies we find that young black males say that they use condoms more often than, for example, young white males. I think one of the things we're finding is that although they are reporting that they use condoms, they don't use them consistently and they don't use them in what they consider to be serious relationships. CHIDEYA: I just want to take some of the information you're giving us and put it in a different context. On a personal level, I come from a family with a lot of teachers, K through 12 teachers. And I hear stories all the time about six graders having sex, sometimes people even younger. And your study is really dealing with people who are just a little bit older. What do you think the implications of your work is about some of the things that even younger minors might face? Prof. COHEN: Well, I think one of the things we have to kind of recognize is that these young people are inundated with images and ideas about sex. It's not only rap music videos, it's, you know, watching NBC or ABC and what are considered kind of mainstream television shows. Not to mention kind of HBO and Showtime. So they're getting the message that, in fact, sex is okay or at least it's a part of life pretty constantly. I would say another kind of part of what our data suggests is that we have to figure out what sex is doing or how it's functioning in the lives of young black people. It's not just about pleasure, which is an important part of, again, human development. But I think it's substituting for other opportunities in areas of success that some young people actually have access to. So if you don't think you're going to have a good job, if you believe that, in fact, your school doesn't have the resources it needs to really give you a proper education, you may try to figure out those areas where you can feel proud of yourself, or you can feel successful, or you can feel like you've dominated something. And unfortunately, I think in our society the realm of sex operates that way for too many young black Americans. CHIDEYA: We've discussed a bit about sex education and abstinence-only versus other kinds of sex education. What role do you teen educators, peer educators play in this whole map of how teens think about sex? Prof. COHEN: I believe that teen educators and peer educators are really kind of critical. It's important for family members to talk to the young people in their lives about kind of sexual decision making and the factors they face in trying to decide not only kind of about sex but intimate relationships. But we found over and over again that it is much easier for young people to talk to other young people. They share, in many cases, the same culture. And I mean by culture kind of popular culture. They have access often to the same forms of technology and really understand that technology, so they understand MySpace and YouTube. And they also share kind of the same difficulties and dilemmas about sex. The pressure from peers, the feeling of wanting an intimate relationship, how do you negotiate how far to go. And I think that's a really important intervention in terms of thinking about how to change some of the data and the trends around sex that we see that many find disturbing. It will undoubtedly come from families and from churches and even from schools. Some schools are critical here, but I think we really need to build an infrastructure of teen-peer educators who can talk to other young people. CHIDEYA: Well, Professor Cohen, thanks so much. Prof. COHEN: Thank you. CHIDEYA: Cathy Cohen is a professor of political science and director of the Center for the Study of Race, Politics and Culture at the University of Chicago.

And that was one of the areas that we tried to probe in this research.  CHIDEYA: You compared the views of nearly 1,600 young people of different racial and ethnic groups in the study. And I understand that you found that 68 percent of blacks believe the government would do more to find a cure for AIDS if more whites were infected. Is that one of the things that we're talking about with attitudes regarding sex?  Prof. COHEN: That's one of the ideas here, is that, in fact, first of all, there's great cynicism, I think, about the government. So when we ask something not only about HIV and AIDS and the government's response to that, but when we ask, for example, should the government only be funding abstinence-only sex education, an overwhelming majority of young people said that that was the wrong governmental policy.  They believe, in fact, that the government should be funding sex education projects and programs that give a comprehensive understanding of sex. And really, 90 percent of young people across racial identities believe that, in fact, sex education should be mandatory in schools, 70 percent, at least, believe that in fact condom should be given out in schools. So these young people are telling us that, in fact, they want kind of complete information when making sexual decisions so that they can make healthy sexual decision.  CHIDEYA: They want the information, but do they understand the dangers of engaging in unprotected sex? And how does that compared to other ethnic groups?  Prof. COHEN: What we're finding among young people is that sex kind of serves some multiple purposes. Clearly, it's a part of the developmental process. Every young person goes through a process where in fact they engage at some level or to some extent in sex. But I think sex also works to provide a domain for young black people where they feel like they're in control and have some success. If you think about the fact that we are losing kind of good manufacturing jobs, that it's difficult for young blacks to have a good living wage jobs, that they suffer twice the unemployment, for example, that white people do, this is one of the areas, believe it or not, where they feel like they have great success, where they're in control and where they're pretty efficacious. And what I mean by that is young black people tell us that they're more able to talk to their partners about what they want to do and when they want to have sex. So they believe, in fact, that they have some control in this area.  Now, the reality is that they may believe that they have control but the consequences of kind of risky sexual decision making is evident in the disproportionate numbers of African-American youth who contract HIV and suffer from AIDS.  CHIDEYA: Through 2001, African-Americans accounted for nearly three quarters of the diagnosed HIV infections among 13 to 19-year-old girls and two thirds of 20 to 24-year-old women. Now have you seen any differences in the ways that black boys and black girls handle life choices when it comes to sex?  Prof. COHEN: Well, you know, it's interesting because in fact when we look at questions that ask about protection, repeatedly in kind of numerous studies we find that young black males say that they use condoms more often than, for example, young white males. I think one of the things we're finding is that although they are reporting that they use condoms, they don't use them consistently and they don't use them in what they consider to be serious relationships.  CHIDEYA: I just want to take some of the information you're giving us and put it in a different context. On a personal level, I come from a family with a lot of teachers, K through 12 teachers. And I hear stories all the time about six graders having sex, sometimes people even younger. And your study is really dealing with people who are just a little bit older. What do you think the implications of your work is about some of the things that even younger minors might face?  Prof. COHEN: Well, I think one of the things we have to kind of recognize is that these young people are inundated with images and ideas about sex. It's not only rap music videos, it's, you know, watching NBC or ABC and what are considered kind of mainstream television shows. Not to mention kind of HBO and Showtime. So they're getting the message that, in fact, sex is okay or at least it's a part of life pretty constantly.  I would say another kind of part of what our data suggests is that we have to figure out what sex is doing or how it's functioning in the lives of young black people. It's not just about pleasure, which is an important part of, again, human development. But I think it's substituting for other opportunities in areas of success that some young people actually have access to.  So if you don't think you're going to have a good job, if you believe that, in fact, your school doesn't have the resources it needs to really give you a proper education, you may try to figure out those areas where you can feel proud of yourself, or you can feel successful, or you can feel like you've dominated something. And unfortunately, I think in our society the realm of sex operates that way for too many young black Americans.  CHIDEYA: We've discussed a bit about sex education and abstinence-only versus other kinds of sex education. What role do you teen educators, peer educators play in this whole map of how teens think about sex?  Prof. COHEN: I believe that teen educators and peer educators are really kind of critical. It's important for family members to talk to the young people in their lives about kind of sexual decision making and the factors they face in trying to decide not only kind of about sex but intimate relationships.  But we found over and over again that it is much easier for young people to talk to other young people. They share, in many cases, the same culture. And I mean by culture kind of popular culture. They have access often to the same forms of technology and really understand that technology, so they understand MySpace and YouTube.  And they also share kind of the same difficulties and dilemmas about sex. The pressure from peers, the feeling of wanting an intimate relationship, how do you negotiate how far to go. And I think that's a really important intervention in terms of thinking about how to change some of the data and the trends around sex that we see that many find disturbing. It will undoubtedly come from families and from churches and even from schools. Some schools are critical here, but I think we really need to build an infrastructure of teen-peer educators who can talk to other young people.  CHIDEYA: Well, Professor Cohen, thanks so much.

She's a high school student and a teen advocate for Planned Parenthood in New York City. Welcome, Shaquana. Ms. SHAQUANA GARDNER (Teen Advocate, Planned Parenthood): Thank you for having me. CHIDEYA: So you obviously have a voice because you are speaking to peers all the time. Ms. GARDNER: Yes. CHIDEYA: What exactly is a teen advocate? Ms. GARDNER: The teen advocate program is basically a group of teens that get educated about sexual reproduction and health. And we get educated in the summertime like through an intensive training and then throughout the year. We go and create skits and learn how to facilitate workshops, and then we go to different community organizations and we facilitate those workshops and build those skits in front of other teens. CHIDEYA: What kinds of questions do people come to you with? Ms. GARDNER: They range from a lot of questions. Some people come and they'll say, you know, I had unprotected sex. Do you know how I can get emergency contraception? Or other people say, you know, is it possible that I could have STD, you know, and they'll give me certain symptoms, like you know, burning while urinating or itching, that type of stuff. Or they'll be, like, I've had a lot of sexual partners, does that mean, like, is that bad or is that good, those types of questions. CHIDEYA: Black youth are particularly at risk for HIV and AIDS. What kind of messaging do you do around HIV and AIDS? And also since you were with Planned Parenthood, I'm assuming that you're not giving them an abstinence talk, more of a different kind of talk that focuses on how to deal with sexual behavior in addition to abstinence. Ms. GARDNER: We just tell them their options. We say, you know, the most protective method is abstinence, which is 100 percent. And then if you choose not to remain abstinent, then you should do this. You can get on condoms and birth control and that type of stuff. HIV is a major risk for black youth, and for Latino youth also, so like I'm really happy that we're in the Lower East Side where there are a lot of black and Latino youth. And I try and give the information as best as I know it and tell them, you know, just stay protected because it really isn't that difficult to use a condom. So just stay protected. If you choose to have sex, just protect yourself because your life is worth a lot, so is your body, and you should try and protect both. CHIDEYA: When you think about yourself as a 17-year-old, how has it changed your life being a peer educator? How has it changed your relationship to issues of sex and sexuality being someone who's out there talking to people your own age? Ms. GARDNER: I would say that it's made me a major activist. And if you asked me, like, four years ago what I'd be, like, thinking in the way I think, I don't think I would have. Because becoming a teen advocate, it really opened my eyes to like so much - so what's going around, you know, the laws that are trying to keep teens from knowing this and knowing that. And I love to teach and I love to learn. And I feel like I get to do both of those. And I want everybody to know their options. Like, I think having options is the most important thing a person can have in their life. CHIDEYA: Well, Shaquana, it sounds like you got a lot on your plate. Thanks for talking to us.

I'm Michele Norris. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. A new study links autism to subtle changes in a wide range of genes. The finding suggests that autism can have many causes. It also suggests that whatever triggers autism usually occurs long before birth. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports. JON HAMILTON: Autism can run in families, but most children with autism come from families without any history of it. That's been a puzzle for researchers studying the genetic roots of the disorder. So a team of researchers took a close look at the genes of more than 260 families. Some had members with autism; others didn't. Jonathan Sebat led the study. He's a geneticist at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. Sebat says the goal was to compare the genes of autistic children with the genes of their parents. Mr. JONATHAN SEBAT (Geneticist, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory): By comparing the two, we could find mutations that were in the child that was not inherited from either parent. HAMILTON: It turned out that children with autism were much more likely than other kids to have these so-called spontaneous mutations, genetic changes that were not present in either parent. These mutations affected bits of genetic code that tend to appear more than once. They're like duplicate copies of certain pages of a book. In many children with autism, some of these extra copies were deleted. For example, Sebat says one child in the study was missing a copy of the gene for oxytocin, a hormone that seems to influence social behavior. Mr. SEBAT: That child has one copy of oxytocin instead of the normal two copies, and that may have resulted in the corresponding decrease in the levels of oxytocin. HAMILTON: Which could have affected normal social development. But Sebat says that in other children with autism the deletions affected other genes. Mr. SEBAT: There may, in fact, be many genes, I would speculate 100 or more, that play some role in cognitive development and when they are altered could cause autism. HAMILTON: That's many more than researchers have found involved in inherited autism. And Sebat's work is causing a lot of excitement among autism researchers. Ezra Susser is an epidemiologist at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. Professor EZRA SUSSER (Epidemiology, Columbia University): I think what it does is it changes our thinking about what kind of genetic causes are important, and knowing that, it changes our thinking about what kind of environmental causes are important. Because I think everybody believes that there's an interplay of genes and environment in most diseases, and that would be true for autism too. HAMILTON: Susser says the sort of mutations found in the study tend to occur in eggs or sperm before conception, or in the earliest stages of an embryo's development. That suggests things like exposure to vaccines after birth probably aren't the main causes of autism. Susser says the study suggests a new direction for researchers seeking the causes of autism. Prof. SUSSER: It doesn't mean that we should stop looking for in-utero exposures. It doesn't mean that we should stop looking for early-life exposures, but it does mean that we should start looking for exposures that might be pre-conceptional also. HAMILTON: Susser has already shown that older fathers are more likely to have mutations in their sperm and more likely to have a child who is autistic. He says researchers need to ask whether a parent's exposure to certain chemicals has a similar effect. In the meantime, the new research offers at least one practical application: Parents who already have a child with autism could undergo genetic testing to see what sort of mutations are present. If the mutations are spontaneous rather than inherited, future children would have no special risk for autism. The research appears in the journal Science. Jon Hamilton, NPR News.

But it is big enough to make Routs worry about a side effect. Mr. ROUTS: The thing I'm personally concerned about and the company is concerned about is the impact on the food chain. So the competition between food and fuel. Today already we see that corn prices have doubled and that a lot of the corn is going into the fuel side. That, of course, drives the food chain for people and also cattle up by quite a bit and then it affects the economy. And we don't know where this is going to go. The same thing is happening on the sugar cane side, and sugar prices. INSKEEP: And so you're looking for things that are not being used as food that you can turn to. . . Mr. ROUTS: That's right. INSKEEP: I presume that the average middle-class American, if the corn price doubles, they pay a few dollars more. It's probably something they can afford even if they don't like it. Is this a situation that could actually cause people to go hungry in other parts of the world. Mr. ROUTS: Well, that's the issue. I mean, it doesn't only hit the United States, it's a global trade like anything else. And if the prices in Mexico - the tortillas in Mexico - double, then, of course, there is going to be an issue of affordability out there. INSKEEP: Can you completely avoid that problem of taking food off the table literally, of competing for food. Do you have enough alternatives that that problem can be solved? Mr. ROUTS: Well, the future will tell. I mean we've done studies where we see that there is enough waste material around for us to work with going into the future. The market will decide where that balance is going to be going forward. INSKEEP: I would speculate that a number of people listening to you will assume - because you're from a large multinational oil company - that anything you're doing in this area is for public relations. What would you say to somebody to persuade them that you're not just in this area for a little PR? Mr. ROUTS: It's never been really a matter of reputation. It's really an asset of market forces and to government mandates. It's clear to us and to me where the world wants to go. It wants to make ethanol and other biocomponents or biodiesels a major component of the fuel mix going forward. So if we want to stay in this business, then it's important that we find solutions and answers to those questions. I mean for us the debate about climate change is over. All right. We want to take action and the whole biofuels equation is one answer to that. INSKEEP: Is it also a question of you're not sure that you'll always be able to get as much access to as much oil as you have in the past? Mr. ROUTS: We tend to say to our investors that easy oil is over. Now we have to go to 10,000 feet of water to find oil, we have to go into oil sands, oil shales. So the battle to replace the oil that is there is not getting easier. INSKEEP: Can you envision a time when Shell might not be primarily a petroleum company? Mr. ROUTS: If that's going to happen, it's quite a long time away. Every three years we look ahead 30 years and we look at the total need or consumption of energy in the world as we see it at that point. We throw a couple of scenarios at it and see how we can survive as a company and make money as a company going forward. Those energy scenarios still tell us that by 2050, 50 percent of the world's energy comes out of hydrocarbons, out of oil. So we're still going to be an oil company for a while. INSKEEP: Okay.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Anorexia, self-starvation and bulimia, gorging and purging, are eating disorders associated with women and girls that can be dangerous and sometimes fatal. Most specialists believe that males made up only about 10 percent of eating disorder cases, but a study by researchers at Harvard reports that percentage is up to 25 percent, and if binge-eating is included, 40 percent. Females typically develop eating disorders from an obsession with thinness. In men, the Harvard study says, it's the pursuit of ripped stomach muscles, the so-called six-pack abs, and males face some problems women don't have. They're often reluctant to get help, especially for a condition associated with women, and doctors may overlook the problem. Later in the program, Europe's tiny smart car hits the United States. It's cute, easy to park, and fuel efficient. Would you buy one? First, eating disorders and men. If you face the problem yourself or if you know someone who does, our number is 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. The e-mail address is talk@npr. org. You can also join the conversation on our blog: npr. org/blogofthenation. Our first guest is Ron Saxen, a model who graced the covers of magazines 20 years ago. His eating disorder destroyed his modeling career and threatened his health and his sanity. He's written a book about it called \"The Good Eater,\" and he joins us now from the studio at the University of California at Berkeley's School of Journalism. And thanks very much for being with us today. Mr. RON SAXEN (Former Model): Thank you, Neal, for having me on. CONAN: And when did you realize you had an eating disorder? Mr. SAXEN: Well, my disordered eating acts was very young, at the age of 11, but when I knew that something was desperately wrong was in 1982 at the age of 19. At that time there was no formal classification for binge-eating disorder, so I didn't know what it was. I knew it was a flaw. It was something I was embarrassed with, ashamed of, and I felt that it was just something I needed to buck up, get strong, get over and stop doing it. CONAN: And that's not easy to do on your own, is it? Mr. SAXEN: No, it's not. I mean - I wouldn't say it's impossible to do on your own, but the problem that most people face - men especially - is we want to solve our own problems. And kind of one of the messages in my book is don't put off starting your journey to recovery no matter what it is - anorexia, bulimia, bingeing disorder, alcoholism, whatever - and begin your journey and step forward. I wasted probably 15 to 20 good years of my life that I'll never get back with feeling in mental and physical chaos. And there's, you know - you can try to do it on your own. I told myself every single day before I go to bed that I would never do that again, starting tomorrow I'll be perfect. And of course I never was. So you know, help - you know, there's plenty of books. There's organizations like NEDA. Look out for the resources and go forward. CONAN: How did you control your weight if you were a binge eater and a model, who presumably you needed to be very trim? Mr. SAXEN: Yeah, that's almost - that's the impossible thing. That's what the story so compelling. You know, you can be anorexic and be too thin or bulimic and eat too much and vomit, but when you binge 10,000 calories and don't purge, you have a problem. And so I was - you know, my weight would go up and then it would come down because I would arrest the behavior using something called will power, which is worthless. Until you figure out what the eating disorder function is in your life and arrest it and replace it and put the eating disorder out of business, you're always going to go back, because will power isn't solving anything. And so I would go and down in weight, and one time I got really low. Right before I typically would go up, I got a little extra low. And people came to me and said, so are you a male model? And I was like, are you kidding me? I haven't had a date in two years. I don't think I'm a model. And at that time I was a 21-year-old virgin and wasn't proud of it. So I went down to the bookstore and I checked a book out on male models and saw that I was about 20 pounds overweight. And so I did some horrible things that are very unhealthy to get that last 20 pounds off. The next thing you know I was signing a one-year modeling contract. And the deal was, it wasn't if I was going to blow head gasket, it was when I was going to blow a head gasket. I thought by being a male model, that my life would be perfection, that these beautiful people - how can you be any happier? You can get the girl, you can get rid of that virginity thing you're ashamed of, and that the magic - which is the title of my first chapter - would be so powerful that it would push my crazy insanity that I did not understand, because back in '82 there was no formal classification for BED; that didn't come until 1992. CONAN: Mm-hmm. Mr. SAXEN: And of course I was wrong. I mean I would do a fashion show, and about four days later I'd do a binge. And I'd go run 10 miles, 15 miles, get it off. Then the next time I'd be on TV, and then the binge would be two days later. Until one time I had a photo session with an awesome photographer, very famous, and I was lucky to be in front of her lens, and three hours later I was eating 3,000 calories. And then one day it all ended when - at a fashion show the guy said I like your look, I need you to lose five pounds, because it was an underwear set, and you got to look good. And at the point I pulled the pin on my career, went off and gained 70 pounds in six months, and was never heard from again. CONAN: In an odd way, it sounds like what you're describing is an addiction. Mr. SAXEN: Yeah, well, what it is is this. It's an addiction, yeah. It can be addiction. What happens is, all eating disorders serve what's call an adaptive function. They have a function in your life, and my function was that my eating disorder was how I managed stress and anxiety. I had a very chaotic childhood. It was tough on me and my brothers and sisters. We had a fundamentalist religion that preached to us the world could end at any moment, plus the other stuff, and I didn't want to feel. And I discovered through an accidental three pounds of chocolate that it could take away the feeling and I could feel nothing. And so as you get older and you go on and you learn that the way to get rid of anxiety and to block it out is to numb yourself with food - of course, when you do that at 11, 12, 15, 20, 30, you know, it stunts your growth and bad things happen. And so instead of facing a problem like normal people do and say what do I do - do I go left, do I go right, do I confront the issue, the person, the job, whatever - you escape in food. And you do that enough and then one day you end up where I was, with a full-blown binge-eating disorder. CONAN: And you're also hiding it from people. This is embarrassing. Mr. SAXEN: Oh, exactly. And that's the one disorder - binge-eating disorder is the easiest to hide. I only got busted - 20 years of partying like a rock star, I got popped one time. And what it taught the moment I got caught, by my college roommate, eating all the cake and the box of Honeycombs, was that, one, I was hoping that he would scare the hell out of me and I'd somehow - that would make me stop. Of course it didn't. But it made me say, well, I'll never do that again. You know, with anorexia, you can't hide. You look like hell, you look like Auschwitz pretty soon, and you die. You can't hide that. If you have bulimia, you suddenly get these kind of jowls because the glands pop and then you - it's strange how you always go to the bathroom after a meal. . . CONAN: (Unintelligible) Mr. SAXEN: Yeah, so binge eating disorder you just go off in your car like I did and you do your thing. No one knows. And everybody gains weight. Men - you know, we all get overweight. And so when you gain a bunch of weight, you're just obese like a lot of people are, they don't have an eating disorder. So it's easy to hide. It's the most hidden disorder of all. CONAN: Let's see if we can get some listeners in on the conversation. We're talking with Ron Saxen, a former male model who's written about his eating disorder in a book called \"The Good Eater. \" If you'd like to join us: 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. The e-mail address is talk@npr. org. And a reminder of our blog, Blog of the Nation at npr. org/blogofthenation, all one word. And let's get Jim on the line. Jim's with us from Kent, Ohio. JIM (Caller): Hi. CONAN: Hi. Mr. SAXEN: Hello. CONAN: Jim. JIM: Hello. CONAN: Yes. JIM: I'm glad to be on the show. CONAN: Yes, go ahead, please. JIM: I have experienced a lot of what you've been talking about. I'm now 40 years old, but probably since about the time I was 18 is when I started lifting weights, and I started binge-eating to try to gain weight. And I thought that if I could have this perfect look and this perfect body, that women would be attracted to me. I also grew up without a mother, so I think that drove me even further to try and get women in my life. And I still experience that today. I'm 40 years old, I'm married, I have two children, but I still go through bouts where I will eat and - binge-eat - and then I will go to the gym, and I'll try and lose weight, and then I'll change my eating immediately. And it just - it drives my wife crazy, and it drives - and I still experience that today. And I was talking to the producer earlier, and I said that I also experience body dysmorphia, where I think - I used to think I was really skinny. And now, you know, and I look at pictures of me when I was lifting weights, and I'm like I was pretty big. And I always had this image in mind that I was a smaller person than what I really was. CONAN: Yeah, and have you gotten help I wonder, Jim? JIM: No, I never - I've been through counseling through issues in my life as far as having a mother who was an alcoholic. But as far as specific issues on eating and things like that, I never actually went to a counselor. I'm still kind of, I think, embarrassed and ashamed about that. Mr. SAXEN: But now you have gone to a counselor for other things, right? JIM: For - yeah, yeah. Mr. SAXEN: OK, that's great, because tell you what, men don't go to the counselor for anything. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. SAXEN: So if you've done the deed and you've gone to a counselor for something, that says a lot about you because that's something I didn't want to do. There's no way I wanted to cross that threshold into craziness, because -you know, you're not crazy. But I would say if you've had the guts to embrace this other issue that you've had to seek help, there's organizations called, like, the National Eating Disorder Association. They can put you in contact - just Google. There's lots of things you can do. But if you've been brave enough to seek help for other things, you should seek help for this. JIM: I didn't\u2026 Mr. SAXEN: And it's not uncommon - go ahead. JIM: I didn't even realize that - I didn't think about the severity of what I was doing until, you know, I met my wife and she pointed out these unusual eating patterns and - the binge eating and then switching to eating very healthy, and going back and forth. And I just thought that was, you know, I wanted to make my body better, so I would just go to the extreme and, you know, and just eat really well\u2026 Mr. SAXEN: Sure. JIM: \u2026and work out really hard, and\u2026 Mr. SAXEN: So two - mm-hmm. . . JIM: \u2026and then all of a sudden, I'd go to the other way and just total be out of control and eating fast food and gaining weight and everything. And I - like I said, I still struggle with that today. Mr. SAXEN: Yeah, there's a lot there. You know, one of the things that you touched on was something called cognitive distortion, that basically not perceiving things accurately. You see yourself as. . . JIM: (unintelligible) Mr. SAXEN: . . . oh, I'm too skinny back then, and the truth about it, you wasn't. But the - I'm sorry, I lost track of what you were talking about. It was a good point that I was going. . . JIM: Just about the binge eating and going back and. . . Mr. SAXEN: OK, OK, here - thank you very much for keeping me on track. The deal is that, you know, the DSM-IV, which is this psychological thing, it says to be classified as BED, you've got to do it twice a week for six months. Of course, that's where I was at one point in my life, and the goal is not to get there. You don't wait till you're there and then try to deal with it, because then it's really sucks, because it's a lot to come back from. But if you've got things that you're doing now that are disordered eating acts - like when I was 11, I had disordered eating acts, but I did not have BED. So if you can stop this along the way, that's a good thing. Now there's one other thing. There's book out there called (unintelligible) and I bet you eat healthy, but you also eat things that you don't like mentally and physically. JIM: Yeah. Mr. SAXEN: So when you deprive yourself, when you're being this health thing that you're doing, then suddenly you're not getting satiation in your body and your mind. And then suddenly you get sick of that, and then you go off on a bad eating situation instead of a healthy eating situation. So I recommend that book. It talks about balance. You know, it's good to eat really healthy things that aren't actually mentally satisfying, but it's also good to eat things that are kind of fun that are mentally satisfying. CONAN: Jim\u2026 Mr. SAXEN: So I think that would be very helpful for you. CONAN: Jim, good luck to you. JIM: OK, thanks. Thanks for your time. CONAN: And Ron Saxen, thank you so much for joining us today. Mr. SAXEN: Thank you for having me on. CONAN: Ron Saxen is the author of \"The Good Eater. \" He joined us today from Berkeley, California. And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, which is coming to you - if you'd like to join the conversation: 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. E-mail: talk@npr. org. This is NPR News. And we're going to be joined by a doctor who treats eating disorders after we get back from a break. Again, if you'd like to join the conversation, give us a call: 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. The e-mail address: talk@npr. org. (Soundbite of music) CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan, in Washington. We're talking today about eating disorders. Long associated with women and girls, now a new study shows that more men suffer from anorexia, bulimia and binge eating than previously thought. And joining us now is Dr. Terrill Bravender, director of adolescent medicine at the Duke University Medical Center, who treats people with eating disorders. And Dr. Bravender, nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION today. Dr. TERRILL BRAVENDER (Director, Adolescent Medicine, Duke University Medical Center): Hi, Neal, thanks for having me on. CONAN: And we'd like to welcome those of you listeners who face this problem or know someone who has to give us a call at 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. E-mail is talk@npr. org. And Dr. Bravender, we just heard Ron Saxen talking earlier, and some of the callers with him - men are very reluctant to get help. Dr. BRAVENDER: Well, you know, if you look at all medical visits for any reason at all in adolescents and young adults, about 65 to 70 percent of all those visits are by women. So very, very few men go to the doctor for anything at all. And I think when it comes to a mental health issue, men are even more reluctant to come in and get help. I mean, if the old stereotype is right about men never wanting to stop and ask for directions, how simple is that compared to actually saying that you're struggling with something like an eating disorder? CONAN: Mm-hmm. And the reluctance also is because it's a condition associated with women. Dr. BRAVENDER: Well, exactly. And I think that women who come in for treatment for an eating disorder illicit a whole team approach. And the first thing that people will think of, I think, if a woman comes in with symptoms of anorexia is anorexia. Back when I was a resident in training about 15 years ago, I was taught that any adolescent boy or a young man coming in with symptoms of anorexia should have a much, much more extensive evaluation, including a head MRI and complete scans to rule out any other illness because anorexia was, I was taught, was so incredibly rare in men that it almost never happened. I think we know that's not the case anymore. But still, getting people to come in to get treatment is the next challenge. CONAN: Here's an e-mail we have from one of our listeners named Tony. My 15-year-old son has been in the hospital for the past two weeks with an eating disorder. We're not sure how long he will be hospitalized. His problems are very complex. He's truly suffering with gender identity, among many other issues. Since this is considered a female disorder, he's the only boy on a girls' ward and is having a tough time opening up in therapy sessions. I'm wondering with a kid that's suffering from a gender issue, is it healthy for him to be with a group of girls in therapy? Does this make it more difficult for his recovery? Any insight you might provide would be helpful. Dr. BRAVENDER: That's, you know, that's a tough issue, and that's one that we struggle with down here. And I've had a number of my male patients say that they feel very unusual coming into our eating disorders program because the waiting room is always filled with girls and young women. I think that number one issue for this boy is to get the treatment he needs, and I think that bringing those issues out into the open about how uncomfortable he feels being around the girls is the best you can do right now. I think that if he needs in-patient care that - it's called milieu therapy -meaning how he interacts with other - the other patients is important, but again, I think that needs to be brought up with the group. Unfortunately, I think the family is going to be hard-pressed to find any in-patient treatment center that isn't primarily focused on girls and young women, because that's who come in for treatment the most. CONAN: Let's get some listeners in on the conversation. This is Carolyn, Carolyn with us from East Lansing in Michigan. CAROLYN (Caller): Hello. CONAN: Hi, you're on the air. CAROLYN: OK, I was wondering if you could talk about what some of the symptoms might be or how to talk about - if you suspect someone has an eating disorder, how would you know about it and how could you talk to them about it? Dr. BRAVENDER: Uh-huh. Sure, this is a question that we get very frequently. And like the author previously to this said, certainly binge eating disorder can remain hidden for years and years, and similarly with bulimia. And I think that for people concerned - either about a friend or certainly parents who are concerned - I think it's important to bring this up with the young person in a very caring manner, so in a non-accusatory way. And one of the suggestions that I often use is to use what are called I statements. So rather than saying I think you're doing this, you say I'm worried and here's why. So I'm worried because it seems like you're much more isolated than you used to be, or I'm worried about your weight loss, or I'm worried because I can't find the food that's disappearing. And say - and couch it in terms that indicate you want to help that person or find a professional who can offer help rather than accusing them of doing something wrong, because anything that's accusing is just going to exacerbate the kind of feelings of shame that go along with many of these eating disorders. CAROLYN: Thank you very much. CONAN: Carolyn, good luck. CAROLYN: Thank you. CONAN: One should not underestimate the ability of people to hide these disorders, too. Dr. BRAVENDER: Oh, absolutely, and I think that when you mentioned the disorders can appear almost like an addiction, I think that's a model that we use quite frequently. And binge eating disorder certainly is hidden, and bulimia is, too. And I think one of the misconceptions about bulimia I would like to bring up is that patients don't have to vomit after they eat in order to have bulimia, and they can use any kind of maladaptive, compensatory behavior to make up for that binge. So I had one patient who would have huge binges and then fast for two or three days after the binge and compulsively exercise, and she fit the diagnostic criteria for bulimia. Now she never binged. She didn't look abnormal. She was a normal weight. But that type of behavior fit criteria for bulimia, and she had been going about it for about two or three years before finally her roommate noticed her behavior when she was in college and called her parents, who finally brought her in for treatment. CONAN: Mm-hmm. Let's see if we get some more callers on the line. And this is - we'll go to Rick. Rick's with us from Salt Lake City in Utah. RICK (Caller): Hello. CONAN: Hi. You're on the air, Rick. RICK: Hi, 35-year-old guy, six-three, range between 220, 250 pounds, and the last guy that you would look at on the street and say, well, there walks a bulimic, but have struggled, you know, with the bingeing and purging - and not always purging, just like was mentioned - you know, bingeing and then compensating, you know, some other way for years and years, and didn't address it until I addressed my alcoholism and then realized that, you know, that binge eating and that part of it became extreme and that kind of took over, and it was all about control. I mean, it had really nothing to do with a weight issue. I mean, I didn't want to look like a model. I didn't have any delusion that I ever could. But that part of my life that I could control was the issue. And when I - and I still haven't - other than just in my, you know, 12-step meetings - dealt with the specific issue, but I think that I need to at some point address it separately from my alcoholism. And what do you, you know, what is the advise for that? CONAN: Dr. Bravender? Dr. BRAVENDER: Sure. You know, from the study that we've been citing by Dr. Hudson and colleagues that was published recently regarding men and eating disorders, one of the findings in that study showed that of all the people they identified with bulimia, almost 95 percent had some co-morbid psychiatric diagnosis. So that ranged from anxiety disorder and depression, all the way up to alcoholism and other drug abuse disorders. So it's not surprising that bulimia goes hand in hand with other problems, particularly substance abuse. And I think that just brings up to the forefront how much of an addictive nature these disorders have. And with our patients whom we see who have multiple different diagnoses going on at the same time, it's almost like which are you going to treat first? And we know that they all feed off one another. And what we usually end up doing is taking a hierarchy of harm and addressing those issues which are causing the greatest physical harm initially, working on that, and then working through the others. But sometimes, it takes treatment for one issue - such as alcoholism -before you can even begin to address the others. Now just like with treatment of an addiction, I think Ron said earlier that you can't expect the eating disorder to get better if you don't replace it with something else to fill the need that the eating disorder is filling. And it's the same way with alcoholism. You can't just simply stop without finding some other healthier coping mechanism. CONAN: Rick, good luck with\u2026 RICK: (Unintelligible). CONAN: I'm sorry, did you have another question? RICK: Well, I was just going to say that - exactly. The addictive nature - my addictive self, you know, as soon as I gave up alcohol it said, well, you know, we don't need alcohol. We've got - you know, there's a multiple range of other things that we can, you know, stick in there and, you know, plague you with. But, thank you very much. Enjoy the show. I'm really glad that somebody's talking about men and this issue. Thank you very much. CONAN: Thanks for the call, Rick, and good luck to you. Here's an e-mail we have from John in Cleveland. In the past five years I've met five different men who had bulimia. All of them, including myself, are homosexual. My question for the doctor is this: did any results from the study indicate homosexuals are more likely to fall victim to this illness? Dr. BRAVENDER: Yeah, that's been - that actually been a common assumption in teaching, is that gay men - we do know that gay men are at greater risk for a number of psychological issues. We know that gay men are more likely to suffer from depression and are significantly more likely to have attempted suicide than straight men. It's been long held that gay men are at greater risk for eating disorders. And there are lots of theories as to why that might be, whether it's an increased emphasis on body or looks or appearance, or a feeling of other kind of social alienation from the greater culture at large. The study in question here didn't really address that, and there have been small case series and smaller reports that, but no population based studies yet. But I think from my clinical experience, and from other's clinical experience, that probably is the case. CONAN: One thing the study did say was that as opposed to women who were in pursuit of thinness, men seemed to be in pursuit of that perfect ripped body. And is that your experience as well? Dr. BRAVENDER: I think many men are, and there's a wonderful book that came out probably about five years ago now, called \"The Adonis Complex,\" which examined this and looked at kind of young men's perception of the ideal body type. And one of the most distressing pieces of that was that if you ask teenage and college age men to identify in these line drawings what they think the ideal male body type looks like, the vast majority of them will pick a body type that is unattainable without using steroids. CONAN: Hmm. Dr. BRAVENDER: So no matter how much weights they lift, how strict their diets, how much they work out, the body type they choose as ideal cannot be attained naturally. CONAN: Our guest is Dr. Terrill Bravender, who's an associate professor of pediatrics, psychiatry and family medicine, director of adolescent medicine at Duke University Medical Center. And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And we'll talk now with Christine. Christine calling us from Rochester in New York. CHRISTINE (Caller): Hi. CONAN: Hi. CHRISTINE: Oh, it's so great to talk to you. I'm a huge fan of the show. CONAN: Well, thank you very much. CHRISTINE: Just wanted to comment or ask the question. I've been a high school English teacher for about 13 years now and I watch these young men cycling through. In sports these kids are athletes and they deprive themselves of food. They starve themselves for a week in order to make - for weeks on end in order to make weight. And then they go on eating binges. It seems so incredibly unhealthy and I'm just sort of wondering is this considered an eating disorder or is it just considered normal training or rites of passage? Dr. BRAVENDER: I consider it an eating disorder. And I think that, you know, it used to be - again, back when I was a resident it was taught that the only men who developed eating disorders were wrestlers. And we know that's not true, that other men do too, but I think that type of behavior is a horrible setup for altering kind of a normal satiety controls and the perception of what your normal body can be. And I know that probably about 10 years ago there were a number of high profile deaths on division one college wresting teams that made the NCAA take a better look at this and put in some stricter controls. But anybody who deals with high school or college athletes knows that it continues, particularly with wrestling teams. But any athlete who participates in a sport that has weight cutoffs is always trying to get down to that lower weight classification for some perceived advantage. CONAN: And I guess the parallel stereotype was restricted to girls who were ballet dancers? Dr. BRAVENDER: Right. And, you know, girls who are ballet dancers, or gymnasts, or ice skaters are also at pretty significant risk. And the way we often think about that is that athletes who either are divided into weight classes are at risk, or those whose performance is judged subjectively. So the figure skater or the gymnast who's depending on that judge's score is more likely to suffer from an eating disorder than someone who has a non-negotiable outcome. Like a basketball or soccer player. CONAN: Mm-hmm. Christine, thank for the call. CHRISTINE: Thank you so much. CONAN: Here's an e-mail from Victoria in Tempe, Arizona. I have a nephew, age 29, who suffered with bulimia for 14 years. He's been to several rehabs for food disorders. Unfortunately, nothing has worked. He still believes his problem is due to other people. He won't take responsibility for his disease. His disease has almost bankrupted his parents. Do you know of anything we can do that will bring him to an understanding to fully recover? Dr. BRAVENDER: Well, this is - this sounds like a very, I mean, very difficult and tragic situation. I think the way I would think about this really has to do with that addiction model. And at this age, once he's a young adult, I think thinking about it like an addiction is probably the best way for his family to help him, in the same way that an alcoholic may go in and out of different rehab programs. An alcoholic, as they teach in many 12 steps programs, almost has to hit rock bottom first, before coming to the acceptance of it and giving themselves over to appropriate levels of treatment. And I think that the family needs to be there for him, and, again, working in a non-blaming, non-accusatory way, which can be very difficult. There's no doubt about that. But letting him know that the family's there and supportive of him and concerned, and is willing to help him out. But when it comes to the changes, it's something he is going to have to do. CONAN: We're going to have to take a short break and when we come back we'll take more of your questions about male eating disorders. Our guest, again, is Dr. Terrill Bravender, associate professor of pediatrics, psychiatry and family medicine, director of adolescent medicine Duke University. 800-989-8255, if you'd like to join the conversation. We're also going to be talking about a tiny taste of Europe ready to launch here in the United States, the smart car. 800-989-8255. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) Right now, we're talking with Dr. Terrill Bravender, a professor of pediatrics, psychiatry and family medicine at Duke University Medical Center, about eating disorders in men. If you'd like to join that conversation: 800-989-8255. E-mail: talk@npr. org. And let's get another caller on the line. This is Matt. Matt with us from Modesto, California. MATT (Caller): Hi, Dr. Bravender. I was calling because I had a question. I was wondering if you felt or have noticed if it's more socially acceptable for women to come out about their eating disorders than it is for men? Dr. BRAVENDER: You know, that's a great question, and I think it is. Particularly in teenagers. And I've seen a number of my patients who, as young women, who are almost proud of their eating disorder. And it's part of their identity and who they are. And all their friends know they have eating disorders, their teachers know, their parents know. And when they come into the clinic it's something they're very proud of. I have never seen that in a teenage boy or a young man. It seems to be much ore hidden. Again, I think because most of the press that eating disorders get are about women. I think that most of the treatment centers are focused on women's health, and it remains a fact, still, that eating disorders do affect mostly women. Although many, many more men, I think, than we previously thought are also suffering with eating disorders. CONAN: Does that perverse pride in an eating disorder, does that make it more difficult to treat? Dr. BRAVENDER: Well, in a way it does, because just like, you know, part of the treatment of the eating disorder is trying to figure out what role the eating disorder is playing in that individual's life, and then trying to find something more productive to fill that role. And if an individual's identity is tied up in having an eating disorder, then replacing that - it can be done, but it's going to be a long road to go down. CONAN: Hmm. Matt, thanks for the call. It's interesting, too, in treatment of eating disorders, in extreme cases they require hospitalization. It's simply the fact that a lot of - before people go into the hospital, family, friends, they can't be nearly tough enough with somebody who suffers from, for example, bulimia or anorexia. Dr. BRAVENDER: Mm-hmm. Well, one of the - you know, one of the key components of our program at Duke involves bringing the family in and actually training, particularly the parents, in how to deal with their children with eating disorders. You know, virtually every treatment program in the nation uses a multi-disciplinary approach that involves people from medicine, psychology, psychiatry, nutrition. We may have social workers involved. Kind of body work professionals, like massage therapists or physical therapists or yoga work and things like that. And we found that a key piece really involves bringing the family in, whether that means a spouse, grandparents, or parents, somebody else, because certainly in the outpatient realm we're only with these patients for an hour or, you know, two, maybe three a week. Whereas, the family members are with these patients all the time. And they're really looking for help to figure out how to help their loved ones. And we're doing our best to teach them how to do that in a productive way. CONAN: And you've made the comparison with addiction. Is it typical for people with eating disorders to have relapses? Dr. BRAVENDER: Well, it is. And, you know, we're always cautious when we have a patient come in and things get better. Or, you know, an individual has anorexia and when that child gains weight parents think, yay, great. We're done. Thank you very much for your help. And we won't ever come in to see you again. And that's not the case. And we tell most people that even the most successful cases whom we treat will have to be with us for about a year in the outpatient setting. And we're going to anticipate roadblocks along the way. And just like with other addictions, that should be anticipated. And we should help the parents -and the patient, too - predict what those are going to be and figure out ways of addressing that before they happen. CONAN: One final call. Let's get Jennifer on the line. Jennifer, another call from Rochester, New York. JENNIFER (Caller): Yes. Hi. I was wondering - there's an older family member - male family member - in our family who seems to have - seems to be somewhat of an unhealthy kind of preoccupation with maintaining a certain weight. I was wondering what would generally kind of classify eating disorders in men? And is it any - really any different than that in women? Dr. BRAVENDER: Well, the diagnostic classifications that we use are pretty much the same for men and women. And the - Ron earlier mentioned the DSM, which is the diagnostic and statistical manual. It's kind of the diagnostic Bible for psychiatry, and it lists different behaviors and other parameters that you must have for certain eating disorders. So for example, anorexia nervosa, you have to be below 85 percent of ideal body weight as well as having a morbid fear of fat and some other psychological parameters. Bulimia, you have to have a certain number of binges with compensatory behaviors afterwards. And then binge eating disorder, I think Ron mentioned, you have to have binge eating defined in a specific way and some guilt associated with that that takes place over a certain period of time. JENNIFER: OK. All right. Well\u2026 Dr. BRAVENDER: And those are - yeah, those are all - those are all listed there. JENNIFER: \u2026great. Dr. BRAVENDER: But here's the interesting thing, is that those are really artificial constructs. And other data has shown that there's this kind of catch-all phrase for eating disorders that don't fit those like artificial categories called eating disorder not otherwise specified. JENNIFER: Mm-hmm. Dr. BRAVENDER: People who come in for treatment who are worried about their eating or their families are worried about their eating, if we look at measures of psychological health and well-being in those folks with eating disorder not otherwise specified, they're just as impaired as those with the diagnosable eating disorders. JENNIFER: Mm-hmm. Dr. BRAVENDER: So those definitions we've got really are kind of blunt instruments for figuring out who has the disorder. And I think I would look at how much it's impairing his life, and as well as his physical health is the most important pieces to look at. JENNIFER: All right. Well thank you very much. I - for answering the question. I really - I love the show. CONAN: Thanks very much, Jennifer. JENNIFER: Thank you. CONAN: I appreciate your call. Dr. Bravender, thanks very much for taking the time to be with us today. Dr. BRAVENDER: All right. Thank you for having me on. CONAN: Terrill Bravender, associate professor of pediatric psychiatric and family medicine, director of adolescent medicine at Duke University's Medical Center with us today from a studio on the campus at Duke University. When we come back, Smart Car.  NEAL CONAN, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  Anorexia, self-starvation and bulimia, gorging and purging, are eating disorders associated with women and girls that can be dangerous and sometimes fatal. Most specialists believe that males made up only about 10 percent of eating disorder cases, but a study by researchers at Harvard reports that percentage is up to 25 percent, and if binge-eating is included, 40 percent.  Females typically develop eating disorders from an obsession with thinness. In men, the Harvard study says, it's the pursuit of ripped stomach muscles, the so-called six-pack abs, and males face some problems women don't have. They're often reluctant to get help, especially for a condition associated with women, and doctors may overlook the problem.  Later in the program, Europe's tiny smart car hits the United States. It's cute, easy to park, and fuel efficient. Would you buy one?  First, eating disorders and men. If you face the problem yourself or if you know someone who does, our number is 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. The e-mail address is talk@npr. org. You can also join the conversation on our blog: npr. org/blogofthenation.  Our first guest is Ron Saxen, a model who graced the covers of magazines 20 years ago. His eating disorder destroyed his modeling career and threatened his health and his sanity. He's written a book about it called \"The Good Eater,\" and he joins us now from the studio at the University of California at Berkeley's School of Journalism. And thanks very much for being with us today.  Mr. RON SAXEN (Former Model): Thank you, Neal, for having me on.  CONAN: And when did you realize you had an eating disorder?  Mr. SAXEN: Well, my disordered eating acts was very young, at the age of 11, but when I knew that something was desperately wrong was in 1982 at the age of 19. At that time there was no formal classification for binge-eating disorder, so I didn't know what it was. I knew it was a flaw. It was something I was embarrassed with, ashamed of, and I felt that it was just something I needed to buck up, get strong, get over and stop doing it.  CONAN: And that's not easy to do on your own, is it?  Mr. SAXEN: No, it's not. I mean - I wouldn't say it's impossible to do on your own, but the problem that most people face - men especially - is we want to solve our own problems. And kind of one of the messages in my book is don't put off starting your journey to recovery no matter what it is - anorexia, bulimia, bingeing disorder, alcoholism, whatever - and begin your journey and step forward. I wasted probably 15 to 20 good years of my life that I'll never get back with feeling in mental and physical chaos. And there's, you know - you can try to do it on your own. I told myself every single day before I go to bed that I would never do that again, starting tomorrow I'll be perfect. And of course I never was. So you know, help - you know, there's plenty of books. There's organizations like NEDA. Look out for the resources and go forward.  CONAN: How did you control your weight if you were a binge eater and a model, who presumably you needed to be very trim?  Mr. SAXEN: Yeah, that's almost - that's the impossible thing. That's what the story so compelling. You know, you can be anorexic and be too thin or bulimic and eat too much and vomit, but when you binge 10,000 calories and don't purge, you have a problem. And so I was - you know, my weight would go up and then it would come down because I would arrest the behavior using something called will power, which is worthless. Until you figure out what the eating disorder function is in your life and arrest it and replace it and put the eating disorder out of business, you're always going to go back, because will power isn't solving anything.  And so I would go and down in weight, and one time I got really low. Right before I typically would go up, I got a little extra low. And people came to me and said, so are you a male model? And I was like, are you kidding me? I haven't had a date in two years. I don't think I'm a model. And at that time I was a 21-year-old virgin and wasn't proud of it. So I went down to the bookstore and I checked a book out on male models and saw that I was about 20 pounds overweight. And so I did some horrible things that are very unhealthy to get that last 20 pounds off. The next thing you know I was signing a one-year modeling contract.  And the deal was, it wasn't if I was going to blow head gasket, it was when I was going to blow a head gasket. I thought by being a male model, that my life would be perfection, that these beautiful people - how can you be any happier? You can get the girl, you can get rid of that virginity thing you're ashamed of, and that the magic - which is the title of my first chapter - would be so powerful that it would push my crazy insanity that I did not understand, because back in '82 there was no formal classification for BED; that didn't come until 1992.  CONAN: Mm-hmm.  Mr. SAXEN: And of course I was wrong. I mean I would do a fashion show, and about four days later I'd do a binge. And I'd go run 10 miles, 15 miles, get it off. Then the next time I'd be on TV, and then the binge would be two days later. Until one time I had a photo session with an awesome photographer, very famous, and I was lucky to be in front of her lens, and three hours later I was eating 3,000 calories. And then one day it all ended when - at a fashion show the guy said I like your look, I need you to lose five pounds, because it was an underwear set, and you got to look good. And at the point I pulled the pin on my career, went off and gained 70 pounds in six months, and was never heard from again.  CONAN: In an odd way, it sounds like what you're describing is an addiction.  Mr. SAXEN: Yeah, well, what it is is this. It's an addiction, yeah. It can be addiction. What happens is, all eating disorders serve what's call an adaptive function. They have a function in your life, and my function was that my eating disorder was how I managed stress and anxiety. I had a very chaotic childhood. It was tough on me and my brothers and sisters. We had a fundamentalist religion that preached to us the world could end at any moment, plus the other stuff, and I didn't want to feel. And I discovered through an accidental three pounds of chocolate that it could take away the feeling and I could feel nothing.  And so as you get older and you go on and you learn that the way to get rid of anxiety and to block it out is to numb yourself with food - of course, when you do that at 11, 12, 15, 20, 30, you know, it stunts your growth and bad things happen. And so instead of facing a problem like normal people do and say what do I do - do I go left, do I go right, do I confront the issue, the person, the job, whatever - you escape in food. And you do that enough and then one day you end up where I was, with a full-blown binge-eating disorder.  CONAN: And you're also hiding it from people. This is embarrassing.  Mr. SAXEN: Oh, exactly. And that's the one disorder - binge-eating disorder is the easiest to hide. I only got busted - 20 years of partying like a rock star, I got popped one time. And what it taught the moment I got caught, by my college roommate, eating all the cake and the box of Honeycombs, was that, one, I was hoping that he would scare the hell out of me and I'd somehow - that would make me stop. Of course it didn't. But it made me say, well, I'll never do that again. You know, with anorexia, you can't hide. You look like hell, you look like Auschwitz pretty soon, and you die. You can't hide that. If you have bulimia, you suddenly get these kind of jowls because the glands pop and then you - it's strange how you always go to the bathroom after a meal. . .  CONAN: (Unintelligible)  Mr. SAXEN: Yeah, so binge eating disorder you just go off in your car like I did and you do your thing. No one knows. And everybody gains weight. Men - you know, we all get overweight. And so when you gain a bunch of weight, you're just obese like a lot of people are, they don't have an eating disorder. So it's easy to hide. It's the most hidden disorder of all.  CONAN: Let's see if we can get some listeners in on the conversation. We're talking with Ron Saxen, a former male model who's written about his eating disorder in a book called \"The Good Eater. \" If you'd like to join us: 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. The e-mail address is talk@npr. org. And a reminder of our blog, Blog of the Nation at npr. org/blogofthenation, all one word. And let's get Jim on the line. Jim's with us from Kent, Ohio.  JIM (Caller): Hi.  CONAN: Hi.  Mr. SAXEN: Hello.  CONAN: Jim.  JIM: Hello.  CONAN: Yes.  JIM: I'm glad to be on the show.  CONAN: Yes, go ahead, please.  JIM: I have experienced a lot of what you've been talking about. I'm now 40 years old, but probably since about the time I was 18 is when I started lifting weights, and I started binge-eating to try to gain weight. And I thought that if I could have this perfect look and this perfect body, that women would be attracted to me. I also grew up without a mother, so I think that drove me even further to try and get women in my life.  And I still experience that today. I'm 40 years old, I'm married, I have two children, but I still go through bouts where I will eat and - binge-eat - and then I will go to the gym, and I'll try and lose weight, and then I'll change my eating immediately. And it just - it drives my wife crazy, and it drives - and I still experience that today.  And I was talking to the producer earlier, and I said that I also experience body dysmorphia, where I think - I used to think I was really skinny. And now, you know, and I look at pictures of me when I was lifting weights, and I'm like I was pretty big. And I always had this image in mind that I was a smaller person than what I really was.  CONAN: Yeah, and have you gotten help I wonder, Jim?  JIM: No, I never - I've been through counseling through issues in my life as far as having a mother who was an alcoholic. But as far as specific issues on eating and things like that, I never actually went to a counselor. I'm still kind of, I think, embarrassed and ashamed about that.  Mr. SAXEN: But now you have gone to a counselor for other things, right?  JIM: For - yeah, yeah.  Mr. SAXEN: OK, that's great, because tell you what, men don't go to the counselor for anything.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. SAXEN: So if you've done the deed and you've gone to a counselor for something, that says a lot about you because that's something I didn't want to do. There's no way I wanted to cross that threshold into craziness, because -you know, you're not crazy. But I would say if you've had the guts to embrace this other issue that you've had to seek help, there's organizations called, like, the National Eating Disorder Association. They can put you in contact - just Google. There's lots of things you can do. But if you've been brave enough to seek help for other things, you should seek help for this.  JIM: I didn't\u2026  Mr. SAXEN: And it's not uncommon - go ahead.  JIM: I didn't even realize that - I didn't think about the severity of what I was doing until, you know, I met my wife and she pointed out these unusual eating patterns and - the binge eating and then switching to eating very healthy, and going back and forth. And I just thought that was, you know, I wanted to make my body better, so I would just go to the extreme and, you know, and just eat really well\u2026  Mr. SAXEN: Sure.  JIM: \u2026and work out really hard, and\u2026  Mr. SAXEN: So two - mm-hmm. . .  JIM: \u2026and then all of a sudden, I'd go to the other way and just total be out of control and eating fast food and gaining weight and everything. And I - like I said, I still struggle with that today.  Mr. SAXEN: Yeah, there's a lot there. You know, one of the things that you touched on was something called cognitive distortion, that basically not perceiving things accurately. You see yourself as. . .  JIM: (unintelligible)  Mr. SAXEN: . . . oh, I'm too skinny back then, and the truth about it, you wasn't. But the - I'm sorry, I lost track of what you were talking about. It was a good point that I was going. . .  JIM: Just about the binge eating and going back and. . .  Mr. SAXEN: OK, OK, here - thank you very much for keeping me on track. The deal is that, you know, the DSM-IV, which is this psychological thing, it says to be classified as BED, you've got to do it twice a week for six months. Of course, that's where I was at one point in my life, and the goal is not to get there.  You don't wait till you're there and then try to deal with it, because then it's really sucks, because it's a lot to come back from. But if you've got things that you're doing now that are disordered eating acts - like when I was 11, I had disordered eating acts, but I did not have BED. So if you can stop this along the way, that's a good thing.  Now there's one other thing. There's book out there called (unintelligible) and I bet you eat healthy, but you also eat things that you don't like mentally and physically.  JIM: Yeah.  Mr. SAXEN: So when you deprive yourself, when you're being this health thing that you're doing, then suddenly you're not getting satiation in your body and your mind. And then suddenly you get sick of that, and then you go off on a bad eating situation instead of a healthy eating situation. So I recommend that book. It talks about balance. You know, it's good to eat really healthy things that aren't actually mentally satisfying, but it's also good to eat things that are kind of fun that are mentally satisfying.  CONAN: Jim\u2026  Mr. SAXEN: So I think that would be very helpful for you.  CONAN: Jim, good luck to you.  JIM: OK, thanks. Thanks for your time.  CONAN: And Ron Saxen, thank you so much for joining us today.  Mr. SAXEN: Thank you for having me on.  CONAN: Ron Saxen is the author of \"The Good Eater. \" He joined us today from Berkeley, California. And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, which is coming to you - if you'd like to join the conversation: 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. E-mail: talk@npr. org. This is NPR News.  And we're going to be joined by a doctor who treats eating disorders after we get back from a break. Again, if you'd like to join the conversation, give us a call: 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. The e-mail address: talk@npr. org.  (Soundbite of music)  CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan, in Washington.  We're talking today about eating disorders. Long associated with women and girls, now a new study shows that more men suffer from anorexia, bulimia and binge eating than previously thought. And joining us now is Dr. Terrill Bravender, director of adolescent medicine at the Duke University Medical Center, who treats people with eating disorders. And Dr. Bravender, nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION today.  Dr. TERRILL BRAVENDER (Director, Adolescent Medicine, Duke University Medical Center): Hi, Neal, thanks for having me on.  CONAN: And we'd like to welcome those of you listeners who face this problem or know someone who has to give us a call at 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. E-mail is talk@npr. org.  And Dr. Bravender, we just heard Ron Saxen talking earlier, and some of the callers with him - men are very reluctant to get help.  Dr. BRAVENDER: Well, you know, if you look at all medical visits for any reason at all in adolescents and young adults, about 65 to 70 percent of all those visits are by women. So very, very few men go to the doctor for anything at all. And I think when it comes to a mental health issue, men are even more reluctant to come in and get help. I mean, if the old stereotype is right about men never wanting to stop and ask for directions, how simple is that compared to actually saying that you're struggling with something like an eating disorder?  CONAN: Mm-hmm. And the reluctance also is because it's a condition associated with women.  Dr. BRAVENDER: Well, exactly. And I think that women who come in for treatment for an eating disorder illicit a whole team approach. And the first thing that people will think of, I think, if a woman comes in with symptoms of anorexia is anorexia. Back when I was a resident in training about 15 years ago, I was taught that any adolescent boy or a young man coming in with symptoms of anorexia should have a much, much more extensive evaluation, including a head MRI and complete scans to rule out any other illness because anorexia was, I was taught, was so incredibly rare in men that it almost never happened. I think we know that's not the case anymore. But still, getting people to come in to get treatment is the next challenge.  CONAN: Here's an e-mail we have from one of our listeners named Tony. My 15-year-old son has been in the hospital for the past two weeks with an eating disorder. We're not sure how long he will be hospitalized. His problems are very complex. He's truly suffering with gender identity, among many other issues. Since this is considered a female disorder, he's the only boy on a girls' ward and is having a tough time opening up in therapy sessions.  I'm wondering with a kid that's suffering from a gender issue, is it healthy for him to be with a group of girls in therapy? Does this make it more difficult for his recovery? Any insight you might provide would be helpful.  Dr. BRAVENDER: That's, you know, that's a tough issue, and that's one that we struggle with down here. And I've had a number of my male patients say that they feel very unusual coming into our eating disorders program because the waiting room is always filled with girls and young women. I think that number one issue for this boy is to get the treatment he needs, and I think that bringing those issues out into the open about how uncomfortable he feels being around the girls is the best you can do right now.  I think that if he needs in-patient care that - it's called milieu therapy -meaning how he interacts with other - the other patients is important, but again, I think that needs to be brought up with the group. Unfortunately, I think the family is going to be hard-pressed to find any in-patient treatment center that isn't primarily focused on girls and young women, because that's who come in for treatment the most.  CONAN: Let's get some listeners in on the conversation. This is Carolyn, Carolyn with us from East Lansing in Michigan.  CAROLYN (Caller): Hello.  CONAN: Hi, you're on the air.  CAROLYN: OK, I was wondering if you could talk about what some of the symptoms might be or how to talk about - if you suspect someone has an eating disorder, how would you know about it and how could you talk to them about it?  Dr. BRAVENDER: Uh-huh. Sure, this is a question that we get very frequently. And like the author previously to this said, certainly binge eating disorder can remain hidden for years and years, and similarly with bulimia. And I think that for people concerned - either about a friend or certainly parents who are concerned - I think it's important to bring this up with the young person in a very caring manner, so in a non-accusatory way.  And one of the suggestions that I often use is to use what are called I statements. So rather than saying I think you're doing this, you say I'm worried and here's why. So I'm worried because it seems like you're much more isolated than you used to be, or I'm worried about your weight loss, or I'm worried because I can't find the food that's disappearing. And say - and couch it in terms that indicate you want to help that person or find a professional who can offer help rather than accusing them of doing something wrong, because anything that's accusing is just going to exacerbate the kind of feelings of shame that go along with many of these eating disorders.  CAROLYN: Thank you very much.  CONAN: Carolyn, good luck.  CAROLYN: Thank you.  CONAN: One should not underestimate the ability of people to hide these disorders, too.  Dr. BRAVENDER: Oh, absolutely, and I think that when you mentioned the disorders can appear almost like an addiction, I think that's a model that we use quite frequently. And binge eating disorder certainly is hidden, and bulimia is, too. And I think one of the misconceptions about bulimia I would like to bring up is that patients don't have to vomit after they eat in order to have bulimia, and they can use any kind of maladaptive, compensatory behavior to make up for that binge.  So I had one patient who would have huge binges and then fast for two or three days after the binge and compulsively exercise, and she fit the diagnostic criteria for bulimia. Now she never binged. She didn't look abnormal. She was a normal weight. But that type of behavior fit criteria for bulimia, and she had been going about it for about two or three years before finally her roommate noticed her behavior when she was in college and called her parents, who finally brought her in for treatment.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. Let's see if we get some more callers on the line. And this is - we'll go to Rick. Rick's with us from Salt Lake City in Utah.  RICK (Caller): Hello.  CONAN: Hi. You're on the air, Rick.  RICK: Hi, 35-year-old guy, six-three, range between 220, 250 pounds, and the last guy that you would look at on the street and say, well, there walks a bulimic, but have struggled, you know, with the bingeing and purging - and not always purging, just like was mentioned - you know, bingeing and then compensating, you know, some other way for years and years, and didn't address it until I addressed my alcoholism and then realized that, you know, that binge eating and that part of it became extreme and that kind of took over, and it was all about control. I mean, it had really nothing to do with a weight issue.  I mean, I didn't want to look like a model. I didn't have any delusion that I ever could. But that part of my life that I could control was the issue. And when I - and I still haven't - other than just in my, you know, 12-step meetings - dealt with the specific issue, but I think that I need to at some point address it separately from my alcoholism. And what do you, you know, what is the advise for that?  CONAN: Dr. Bravender?  Dr. BRAVENDER: Sure. You know, from the study that we've been citing by Dr. Hudson and colleagues that was published recently regarding men and eating disorders, one of the findings in that study showed that of all the people they identified with bulimia, almost 95 percent had some co-morbid psychiatric diagnosis. So that ranged from anxiety disorder and depression, all the way up to alcoholism and other drug abuse disorders. So it's not surprising that bulimia goes hand in hand with other problems, particularly substance abuse. And I think that just brings up to the forefront how much of an addictive nature these disorders have.  And with our patients whom we see who have multiple different diagnoses going on at the same time, it's almost like which are you going to treat first? And we know that they all feed off one another. And what we usually end up doing is taking a hierarchy of harm and addressing those issues which are causing the greatest physical harm initially, working on that, and then working through the others. But sometimes, it takes treatment for one issue - such as alcoholism -before you can even begin to address the others.  Now just like with treatment of an addiction, I think Ron said earlier that you can't expect the eating disorder to get better if you don't replace it with something else to fill the need that the eating disorder is filling. And it's the same way with alcoholism. You can't just simply stop without finding some other healthier coping mechanism.  CONAN: Rick, good luck with\u2026  RICK: (Unintelligible).  CONAN: I'm sorry, did you have another question?  RICK: Well, I was just going to say that - exactly. The addictive nature - my addictive self, you know, as soon as I gave up alcohol it said, well, you know, we don't need alcohol. We've got - you know, there's a multiple range of other things that we can, you know, stick in there and, you know, plague you with.  But, thank you very much. Enjoy the show. I'm really glad that somebody's talking about men and this issue. Thank you very much.  CONAN: Thanks for the call, Rick, and good luck to you.  Here's an e-mail we have from John in Cleveland.  In the past five years I've met five different men who had bulimia. All of them, including myself, are homosexual. My question for the doctor is this: did any results from the study indicate homosexuals are more likely to fall victim to this illness?  Dr. BRAVENDER: Yeah, that's been - that actually been a common assumption in teaching, is that gay men - we do know that gay men are at greater risk for a number of psychological issues. We know that gay men are more likely to suffer from depression and are significantly more likely to have attempted suicide than straight men.  It's been long held that gay men are at greater risk for eating disorders. And there are lots of theories as to why that might be, whether it's an increased emphasis on body or looks or appearance, or a feeling of other kind of social alienation from the greater culture at large.  The study in question here didn't really address that, and there have been small case series and smaller reports that, but no population based studies yet. But I think from my clinical experience, and from other's clinical experience, that probably is the case.  CONAN: One thing the study did say was that as opposed to women who were in pursuit of thinness, men seemed to be in pursuit of that perfect ripped body. And is that your experience as well?  Dr. BRAVENDER: I think many men are, and there's a wonderful book that came out probably about five years ago now, called \"The Adonis Complex,\" which examined this and looked at kind of young men's perception of the ideal body type.  And one of the most distressing pieces of that was that if you ask teenage and college age men to identify in these line drawings what they think the ideal male body type looks like, the vast majority of them will pick a body type that is unattainable without using steroids.  CONAN: Hmm.  Dr. BRAVENDER: So no matter how much weights they lift, how strict their diets, how much they work out, the body type they choose as ideal cannot be attained naturally.  CONAN: Our guest is Dr. Terrill Bravender, who's an associate professor of pediatrics, psychiatry and family medicine, director of adolescent medicine at Duke University Medical Center. And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  And we'll talk now with Christine. Christine calling us from Rochester in New York.  CHRISTINE (Caller): Hi.  CONAN: Hi.  CHRISTINE: Oh, it's so great to talk to you. I'm a huge fan of the show.  CONAN: Well, thank you very much.  CHRISTINE: Just wanted to comment or ask the question. I've been a high school English teacher for about 13 years now and I watch these young men cycling through. In sports these kids are athletes and they deprive themselves of food. They starve themselves for a week in order to make - for weeks on end in order to make weight. And then they go on eating binges.  It seems so incredibly unhealthy and I'm just sort of wondering is this considered an eating disorder or is it just considered normal training or rites of passage?  Dr. BRAVENDER: I consider it an eating disorder. And I think that, you know, it used to be - again, back when I was a resident it was taught that the only men who developed eating disorders were wrestlers. And we know that's not true, that other men do too, but I think that type of behavior is a horrible setup for altering kind of a normal satiety controls and the perception of what your normal body can be.  And I know that probably about 10 years ago there were a number of high profile deaths on division one college wresting teams that made the NCAA take a better look at this and put in some stricter controls. But anybody who deals with high school or college athletes knows that it continues, particularly with wrestling teams.  But any athlete who participates in a sport that has weight cutoffs is always trying to get down to that lower weight classification for some perceived advantage.  CONAN: And I guess the parallel stereotype was restricted to girls who were ballet dancers?  Dr. BRAVENDER: Right. And, you know, girls who are ballet dancers, or gymnasts, or ice skaters are also at pretty significant risk. And the way we often think about that is that athletes who either are divided into weight classes are at risk, or those whose performance is judged subjectively.  So the figure skater or the gymnast who's depending on that judge's score is more likely to suffer from an eating disorder than someone who has a non-negotiable outcome. Like a basketball or soccer player.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. Christine, thank for the call.  CHRISTINE: Thank you so much.  CONAN: Here's an e-mail from Victoria in Tempe, Arizona.  I have a nephew, age 29, who suffered with bulimia for 14 years. He's been to several rehabs for food disorders. Unfortunately, nothing has worked. He still believes his problem is due to other people. He won't take responsibility for his disease. His disease has almost bankrupted his parents. Do you know of anything we can do that will bring him to an understanding to fully recover?  Dr. BRAVENDER: Well, this is - this sounds like a very, I mean, very difficult and tragic situation. I think the way I would think about this really has to do with that addiction model. And at this age, once he's a young adult, I think thinking about it like an addiction is probably the best way for his family to help him, in the same way that an alcoholic may go in and out of different rehab programs.  An alcoholic, as they teach in many 12 steps programs, almost has to hit rock bottom first, before coming to the acceptance of it and giving themselves over to appropriate levels of treatment. And I think that the family needs to be there for him, and, again, working in a non-blaming, non-accusatory way, which can be very difficult. There's no doubt about that.  But letting him know that the family's there and supportive of him and concerned, and is willing to help him out. But when it comes to the changes, it's something he is going to have to do.  CONAN: We're going to have to take a short break and when we come back we'll take more of your questions about male eating disorders. Our guest, again, is Dr. Terrill Bravender, associate professor of pediatrics, psychiatry and family medicine, director of adolescent medicine Duke University. 800-989-8255, if you'd like to join the conversation.  We're also going to be talking about a tiny taste of Europe ready to launch here in the United States, the smart car. 800-989-8255. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  Right now, we're talking with Dr. Terrill Bravender, a professor of pediatrics, psychiatry and family medicine at Duke University Medical Center, about eating disorders in men. If you'd like to join that conversation: 800-989-8255. E-mail: talk@npr. org.  And let's get another caller on the line. This is Matt. Matt with us from Modesto, California.  MATT (Caller): Hi, Dr. Bravender. I was calling because I had a question. I was wondering if you felt or have noticed if it's more socially acceptable for women to come out about their eating disorders than it is for men?  Dr. BRAVENDER: You know, that's a great question, and I think it is. Particularly in teenagers. And I've seen a number of my patients who, as young women, who are almost proud of their eating disorder. And it's part of their identity and who they are. And all their friends know they have eating disorders, their teachers know, their parents know. And when they come into the clinic it's something they're very proud of.  I have never seen that in a teenage boy or a young man. It seems to be much ore hidden. Again, I think because most of the press that eating disorders get are about women. I think that most of the treatment centers are focused on women's health, and it remains a fact, still, that eating disorders do affect mostly women. Although many, many more men, I think, than we previously thought are also suffering with eating disorders.  CONAN: Does that perverse pride in an eating disorder, does that make it more difficult to treat?  Dr. BRAVENDER: Well, in a way it does, because just like, you know, part of the treatment of the eating disorder is trying to figure out what role the eating disorder is playing in that individual's life, and then trying to find something more productive to fill that role.  And if an individual's identity is tied up in having an eating disorder, then replacing that - it can be done, but it's going to be a long road to go down.  CONAN: Hmm. Matt, thanks for the call. It's interesting, too, in treatment of eating disorders, in extreme cases they require hospitalization. It's simply the fact that a lot of - before people go into the hospital, family, friends, they can't be nearly tough enough with somebody who suffers from, for example, bulimia or anorexia.  Dr. BRAVENDER: Mm-hmm. Well, one of the - you know, one of the key components of our program at Duke involves bringing the family in and actually training, particularly the parents, in how to deal with their children with eating disorders.  You know, virtually every treatment program in the nation uses a multi-disciplinary approach that involves people from medicine, psychology, psychiatry, nutrition. We may have social workers involved. Kind of body work professionals, like massage therapists or physical therapists or yoga work and things like that.  And we found that a key piece really involves bringing the family in, whether that means a spouse, grandparents, or parents, somebody else, because certainly in the outpatient realm we're only with these patients for an hour or, you know, two, maybe three a week. Whereas, the family members are with these patients all the time.  And they're really looking for help to figure out how to help their loved ones. And we're doing our best to teach them how to do that in a productive way.  CONAN: And you've made the comparison with addiction. Is it typical for people with eating disorders to have relapses?  Dr. BRAVENDER: Well, it is. And, you know, we're always cautious when we have a patient come in and things get better. Or, you know, an individual has anorexia and when that child gains weight parents think, yay, great. We're done. Thank you very much for your help. And we won't ever come in to see you again. And that's not the case. And we tell most people that even the most successful cases whom we treat will have to be with us for about a year in the outpatient setting.  And we're going to anticipate roadblocks along the way. And just like with other addictions, that should be anticipated. And we should help the parents -and the patient, too - predict what those are going to be and figure out ways of addressing that before they happen.  CONAN: One final call. Let's get Jennifer on the line. Jennifer, another call from Rochester, New York.  JENNIFER (Caller): Yes. Hi. I was wondering - there's an older family member - male family member - in our family who seems to have - seems to be somewhat of an unhealthy kind of preoccupation with maintaining a certain weight.  I was wondering what would generally kind of classify eating disorders in men? And is it any - really any different than that in women?  Dr. BRAVENDER: Well, the diagnostic classifications that we use are pretty much the same for men and women. And the - Ron earlier mentioned the DSM, which is the diagnostic and statistical manual. It's kind of the diagnostic Bible for psychiatry, and it lists different behaviors and other parameters that you must have for certain eating disorders.  So for example, anorexia nervosa, you have to be below 85 percent of ideal body weight as well as having a morbid fear of fat and some other psychological parameters. Bulimia, you have to have a certain number of binges with compensatory behaviors afterwards.  And then binge eating disorder, I think Ron mentioned, you have to have binge eating defined in a specific way and some guilt associated with that that takes place over a certain period of time.  JENNIFER: OK. All right. Well\u2026  Dr. BRAVENDER: And those are - yeah, those are all - those are all listed there.  JENNIFER: \u2026great.  Dr. BRAVENDER: But here's the interesting thing, is that those are really artificial constructs. And other data has shown that there's this kind of catch-all phrase for eating disorders that don't fit those like artificial categories called eating disorder not otherwise specified.  JENNIFER: Mm-hmm.  Dr. BRAVENDER: People who come in for treatment who are worried about their eating or their families are worried about their eating, if we look at measures of psychological health and well-being in those folks with eating disorder not otherwise specified, they're just as impaired as those with the diagnosable eating disorders.  JENNIFER: Mm-hmm.  Dr. BRAVENDER: So those definitions we've got really are kind of blunt instruments for figuring out who has the disorder. And I think I would look at how much it's impairing his life, and as well as his physical health is the most important pieces to look at.  JENNIFER: All right. Well thank you very much. I - for answering the question. I really - I love the show.  CONAN: Thanks very much, Jennifer.  JENNIFER: Thank you.  CONAN: I appreciate your call. Dr. Bravender, thanks very much for taking the time to be with us today.  Dr. BRAVENDER: All right. Thank you for having me on.  CONAN: Terrill Bravender, associate professor of pediatric psychiatric and family medicine, director of adolescent medicine at Duke University's Medical Center with us today from a studio on the campus at Duke University.

I'm Robert Siegel. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. We've spent a fair amount of time on this program talking about racial discrimination or gender discrimination or bias against those who are older or overweight. Today, we're going to talk about genetic discrimination. Congress is on the verge of breaking a 12-year impasse over legislation that would ban employers and health insurers from denying coverage or a job to anyone whose genetic test results indicate risk for future disease. The Senate has passed similar bills twice in recent years. And this January, President Bush added his endorsement. President GEORGE W. BUSH: I really want to make it clear to the Congress that I hope they pass legislation that makes genetic discrimination illegal. SIEGEL: Well, now for the first time, it looks likely the House may pass such a bill, too. That is welcome news in the science and health community, where many people say the bill is long overdue. NPR's Julie Rovner reports. JULIE ROVNER: Rebecca Fisher was 31 when she was diagnosed with an aggressive breast cancer that had already spread to her lymph nodes. Breast cancer runs in her family. A test showed both Rebecca and her mother have a gene that's been linked to breast and ovarian cancer. So before her only daughter, Katie, left for college five years ago, Rebecca pressed her to be tested, too. Ms. REBECCA FISHER: At that point, I was just desperate to know. I think there was just something, Julie, about not wanting to release her into the world without that information. ROVNER: The test showed Katie does have the breast cancer gene. Fisher says that she and her daughter had prepared themselves for that bad news, but there was something else the doctors said that scared them almost as much. Ms. FISHER: They explained everything health-wise and summed it up by saying, don't ever be without a group health insurance plan. And that was a stunning, stunning realization. ROVNER: Fisher says that was the first time she realized how little legal protection there is for people with a known genetic predisposition to cancer or any other disease. Employers can require anyone applying for a job to take a genetic test or fire a worker for having a genetic mutation. And health insurance companies can use a family history or genetic-test result to deny coverage or raise premiums for anyone who doesn't have group health insurance. Rebecca saw Katie's career choices slipping away \u2014 forget being self-employed or jumping from job to job as many young people do. So far, Katie has been lucky. She graduated from college and got a job with a worldwide consulting firm. Ms. FISHER: And she lives in Atlanta. She is under a group health insurance plan. And so she cannot ever be without that until we have something that protects her. ROVNER: The person who's been working hardest to get that sort of protection written into law is Francis Collins. He directs the National Human Genome Research Institute. He says the lack of legal protection has stalled important research into genetic links to disease. Dr. FRANCIS COLLINS (Director, National Human Genome Research Institute): The most common reason why people who, otherwise, want to be part of a research study whether it's about genetics of breast cancer or diabetes or whatever condition, decide not to participate is fear of discrimination. And we can't look them in the eye and tell them their fears are unwarranted until we have effective federal legislation to prevent that. ROVNER: And as Collins told lawmakers at a hearing earlier this month, if people aren't willing to undergo genetic testing, there is no way to realize the promise of so-called personalized medicine. Dr. COLLINS: We all have glitches somewhere in our instructions books that place us at risk for something. The opportunity to discover those and to individualize our individual plans of prevention is one of the major hopes that we have for reducing our health care costs and keeping people healthy. ROVNER: Even the health insurance industry has signed onto the importance of genetic privacy. In theory, some business groups, however, worry that the bill could invite frivolous lawsuits. And there are concerns about the language of the bill. Janet Trautwein is with the National Association of Health Underwriters. She worries how the term genetic information is defined. Ms. JANET TRAUTWEIN (Executive Vice President, National Association of Health Underwriters): You know, now, that the definition is so broad you could bring in something like cholesterol screening and potentially define that as a genetic test. ROVNER: Right now, health insurers are allowed to base the premiums they charge for individual policies on a person's medical history. Trautwein says if the new law walls off too much of that information, it could do more harm than good. Ms. TRAUTWEIN: If we make the definition too broad so that we can ask fewer and fewer questions, then underwriters will have to be more and more conservative in their rates. The costs will go up, and I'm very afraid that people will be priced out of coverage. ROVNER: But with Democrats back in charge in the House, those objections are carrying less weight. That's a relief to the bill's longtime sponsor, New York Democratic congresswoman and microbiologist Louise Slaughter. Representative LOUISE SLAUGHTER (Democrat, New York): There needs to be some privacy, and most Americans want that. I think it will pass rather handsomely, and the nicest thing is the president will sign it. He's already said that. ROVNER: The full House and Senate are expected to vote on the bill in the next few weeks. Julie Rovner, NPR News, Washington.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

If the goal is to curb the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases we're pumping into the atmosphere, that conventional wisdom always - how do we stop that - conventional wisdom has been to suggest a cap on carbon emissions, limit how much carbon can be spewed out of tailpipes and smokestack. Straight cap on, but there is an alternative called carbon trading. Joining us now to make the case for carbon trading is the chief scientist for environmental defense. He has co-authored a paper in this week's Science magazine that says a cap-and-trade system is the only way to guarantee a drop in CO2 levels by a target date. Our number: 1-800-989-8255, if you like to join in the discussion. Bill Chameides is the chief scientist at Environmental Defense in New York. He joins us here in our SCIENCE FRIDAY studios. Welcome to the program. Mr. BILL CHAMEIDES (Chief Scientist, Environmental Defense, New York): Hi, Ira, thanks for having me. FLATOW: Please, do a better job than I've been explaining what do you mean by the cap and trade. Mr. CHAMEIDES: Okay. FLATOW: Then why it's better. Mr. CHAMEIDES: The most important part of what we're talking about is the cap part. Actually, in Congress, as the representative was talking about, there are lots of bills that they're considering. And some of them, I would characterize as pretender bills and some of them are real bills. The real bills mandate a decrease in emissions over time. They apply a cap. So the first part is cap. The next question is, if you go in and have a cap, what's the most effective, what's the most efficient way of limiting costs and getting the reductions as quickly as possible? And experience has shown quite often that the way to do that is let the marketplace figure it out. And the way you harness the power of the marketplace is by allowing a commodity to be traded. In this case, you would trade carbon emissions across emitters and people who can save emissions and that's what - that's the trade part. That's the carbon trading part. FLATOW: So, only to just see if I can tweak(ph) - tease(ph) this out a little bit. If I make cleans(ph), if I - in fact, really - let's say, I'm a power plant and I put clean, carbon-free emissions, I could have credits for those that I can now swap, right, with someone who might not be so clean and sell them for money? Mr. CHAMEIDES: That's right. Think about it as two power plants. They both have the same cap. One power plant - your power plant is really smart. And if - you figure out a way to lower your emissions even below - further than below your cap, I'm not so smart, I'm going to have to give you money to make up that difference. So we reward innovation. FLATOW: Now how do you know that this will work better than mandatory - just caps system? Mr. CHAMEIDES: Well, I think the only way to do a cap system is allow for trading. The reason it works better is because it gives rewards to people to go beyond the limit. Suppose we're - again, we're two power plants. And you have your allowance and I have my allowance. If we can't trade, all I want to do in my power plant, all you're going to do in your power plant is get to the allowance. You're not going to do anything more than that. On the other hand, if you know, you can make money by coming up with a new technology that's going to get your further down the road, you're going to do it. I'm going to try to do it, too. Everybody's going to try to it and you're going to spark innovation. FLATOW: Now, this is something because the earth doesn't care where the CO2 is coming form. Mr. CHAMEIDES: That's absolutely right. FLATOW: The earth could do it any - you could trade international. Mr. CHAMEIDES: That's right. You can trade internationally. For example, a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the world are coming from burning tropical rainforests. Power plants could pay tropical rainforest countries to slow the rate of deforestation, save that precious resource and get relatively cheap benefits in terms of, in terms of lowering their emissions and everybody wins. FLATOW: I have a question for it, a challenge to this system. Mr. CHAMEIDES: Okay. FLATOW: Because I think it's an interesting idea. A significant amount of greenhouse gases in the form of methane come from cattle. And the, I think research show that the worse off the cattle are, the more methane they actually put. Healthy cattle don't put out as much methane. Could you do that with farmers? Also, with cap-and-trade. . . Mr. CHAMEIDES: You could. In fact, if you have what we call carbon offsets, where you allow for people to figure out ways of lowering emissions even though they don't have enough part of the emission scenario, they don't have allowances. They can sell those as credits. So for example, if I'm a hog farmer, and I know the waste - that you might not want to think about exactly what that is. . . FLATOW: Right. Mr. CHAMEIDES: . . . but the manure  gives off methane. I can figure out a way to capture that methane, use that as a credit and sell it to a power plant to make up for their emissions. So there's all sorts of opportunities for people to figure out ways to prevent emissions from natural systems, to enhance the uptake of greenhouse gases in natural systems like farms and forests and use those as offsets to sell to emitters. FLATOW: In order to do a cap-and-trade system that's binding, how big a hurdle is it? Do you think that Congress is going to, you know, they're not thinking. You heard the congressmen when I brought it up. He said that's an option. Well, is it something that's on their radar screen or they just either all cap or no cap? Mr. CHAMEIDES: Well, this is definitely on their radar screen. There are several bills in Washington that are - have been proposed and are being considered, and a number of those have in them a cap, a real cap on emissions that allow for carbon trading, different limitations on that carbon trading. And I think it remains to be seen what comes out. From my point of view, the question is not whether we're going to have climate legislation in the United States; I think we're clearly going to. Whether that legislation is going to be meaningful. And meaningful legislation will have a real cap on emissions that requires a decrease in emissions over time and that will have the flexibility that we need to allow for carbon trading. And there are some bills that do that now. FLATOW: Let's talk about the track record that cap-and-trade has. It's had a pretty good track record with acid rain. It worked with acid rain. . . Mr. CHAMEIDES: Sure. When we had. . . FLATOW: . . . did it not? Mr. CHAMEIDES: We had a cap-and-trade system put in place with the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments for acid rain that involved a cap on sulfur oxide emissions over time and trading among power plants. At the time it was put in place, there was a lot of criticism - it wasn't going to work, it will be too expensive. We met the targets ahead of time, at about one-third the cost. And because we had that trading, there were all sorts of incentives for power plants to figure out cheap ways of lowering their sulfur oxide emissions, and it turned out to be much less expensive than had been originally predicted. We also did trading, some limited trading in lowering CFC emissions for the stratospheric ozone depletion process problem, and there was some trading in lowering lead in gasoline as well. So we've had some experience with it each time we've done this work quite well. FLATOW: Let's go to the phones - 1-800-989-8255. Phil in Frederick, Maryland. Hi, Phil. PHIL (Caller): Yeah, hi. I guess my question as a homeowner is or a taxpayer is, I'm assuming all these corporations that are going to be doing these caps-and-trades, country to country or whatever, but how are the rest of us going to understand, actually, this cap-and-trade is leading to a valid result. . . Mr. CHAMEIDES: Did we lose Phil? PHIL: . . . records of all cap and trade, if that makes any sense. And also, are taxpayers or corporations rather getting sort of a subsidy from this? Mr. CHAMEIDES: Okay, let me try to answer those questions sequentially. Hello, Phil, incidentally. The way you would apply the cap is just upstream, a high upstream in the process as possible so we wouldn't be applying the cap to individuals. We would be applying the cap to power plants to or build manufacturers, to refineries and so forth. The way you make sure it's actually making a difference, it turns out that for most of the greenhouse gas emissions, which is carbon dioxide, it's a no-brainer. How much gasoline you use, how much coal you use, how much natural gas you use immediately tells us how much CO2 gets into the atmosphere because we know the carbon content of those fuels. So if we simply monitor how much fuel is being used, if we can demonstrate that those fuel numbers are going down, we know we're making a difference. And typically, in a cap-and-trade system, the government plays a fairly light role - it applies the cap and allows the marketplace to do most of the work, but a very, very important role for the government is enforcement. The government has to make sure that the companies that have the allowances that they'd have the caps meet those caps. And we've done this is the past, for example, the sulfur oxide emissions and it's worked, worked quite well. Your second question, which, excuse me for a second, what was the second question? FLATOW: I think he's gone, so we're. . . Mr. CHAMEIDES: He's gone. Did you remember what's the second question? FLATOW: No, no. I think your answer is. . . Mr. CHAMEIDES: Okay. Basically, it was. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Lots of questions. Let's to go Vivian in Suffolk County, Long Island. Hi, Vivian. VIVIAN (Caller): Hi, how are you doing? FLATOW: Hi, how are you? Go ahead. Mr. CHAMEIDES: Hi, Vivian. VIVIAN: This is a terrific show. I always listen to you. I'm a legislator at Suffolk County, and in the year 2000, I sponsored legislation to limit the CO2 emission from our power plants here. And I became very interested in the cap-and-trade. And a few years ago, I read an article in The Economist - talking about how far ahead the European countries are in this marketplace, recently, the United States. How much of a game of catch-up will we be playing here in the United States, entering this marketplace? Mr. CHAMEIDES: Well, the catch-up is going to be on emissions, I mean, where the Europeans are making progress. The other thing that I would talk about in terms of catch-up, which relates to what Representative Gordon was talking about just a few minutes ago, there has to - competitiveness, it's because the Europeans have this carbon market in place and they've been worrying about it. They're getting way ahead of us in terms of development of news industries, like wind energy, solarvoltaic energies, and those types of technologies. And that's really where the catch up is going to be. There's a low carbon economy coming. Ultimately, the United States is going to have to be part of that low carbon economy. And the longer it takes us to start dealing with this problem, the further we're going to get behind in developing these technologies, and if we wait long enough, we're going to be an importer of those technologies rather than an exporter. FLATOW: Vivienne, did you say you're a legislator in Albany? VIVIENNE: No, in Suffolk County, I'm a county legislator. FLATOW: Do you think that people like you, locally, are going to be out front in these things instead of waiting for the federal government to do something? VIVIENNE: Well, actually, my legislation was way out front within the year 2000. But unfortunately we do need a nationwide push in order to have a serious impact. But I think that in some ways because so many of us have been out front, we've helped to push the federal government to step up to the plate. But until somebody like Al Gore really came out and let the public know how important it is, we don't have the, you know, the media and the public awareness. So what Al Gore has done is really to not jumpstart - because it has started on grassroots - but he's really created a much wider platform of understanding and knowledge. Dr. CHAMEIDES: No argument there. What you said about it in terms of pushing the federal government is incredibly on the mark. And we need a federal policy. But it's really important to - for folks to know that in the Northeast we have the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which is capping greenhouse gas emissions from power plants in the Northeast and a trading system between the power plants. In California, they've capped the emissions. So the states are now way out in front of the federal government and they are forcing the federal government to do something. FLATOW: Thank you. . . VIVIENNE: Isn't that a shame? Dr. CHAMEIDES: Well, I think it's a shame but on the other hand it's great. The states are making it happen. FLATOW: Well, you may have - you may have diversified. We have every - if you look on the Internet, and just about every day there's another county or company installing wind turbines all over the country, which you're getting, it appears, is a decentralized system, you know, of energy. And maybe that's better for brownouts and blackouts eventually and things like that. Dr. CHAMEIDES: Well, I would agree that a decentralized system might be good for us to have, but absent a federal policy on climate, we're not going to get the kind of cuts in emissions we need to have. That's my belief. FLATOW: All right, Vivienne. Thanks and good luck to you. VIVIENNE: Thank you. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. FLATOW: You're welcome. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's go to - let's go down the block, go to Fred in Delaware, Ohio. Hi, Fred. FRED (Caller): Hi. Thanks, guys. Here's a question. I hope it's relevant. Instead of putting a band-aid on the whole situation, why don't we focus energies and finance and resources on actually creating new or perfecting new non-polluting energy - wind, sun, solar, geothermal, etc. , etc. ? FLATOW: Well, that's what Al Gore said, sure. Before Congress, he said let's put a cap, take the money and create alternative energy. Dr. CHAMEIDES: Well, the question is, clearly we need new technologies. Wind, solar - we need to implement those technologies as well. So the question is how best can you get those technologies developed and implemented? One approach is like the Manhattan Project approach. Let the government take a whole pot of money and throw it at some technology and hope it develops. There are a lot of problems with that. I don't know that anybody is smart enough to know which technology is going to be the best technology, and I wonder if everybody thinks that the folks in Washington had a big pot of money they would spend it in a rational way. Another way to do it is to let the marketplace figure out the best technologies. The amount of money in the marketplace is so much larger than the government has. If you do a cap-and-trade system, what happens is the marketplace is energized to develop those technologies because there's a profit to be made by making those technologies work. And that, in my mind, is the best way to get those technologies developed. There's no argument we need the technologies, but the question is how best to do it. FLATOW: We're talking about energy this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm talking with Bill Chameides, who is chief scientist at the Environmental Defense in New York. If we do adopt a cap-and-trade, on the other side of the planet, we have India, we have China, which doesn't have a cap-and-trade system. Can we have enough credits possible in the whole country to overcome the amount of pollution that they're going to be putting in to the air? Dr. CHAMEIDES: Good point. It's a global problem. We've got to have global cooperation. If all of the developed countries cut their emissions to zero, we still couldn't do what we need to do. So we've got to get all the countries involved. The question is how best to get those countries involved. In the final analysis, the United States is the larger emitter of greenhouse gases and historically the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from us is much larger than anybody else. So I think it's somewhat disingenuous of us to say we need to do something about this but we're not going to do anything until you guys do something. I think it's much more likely and rational for us to come up with a policy that we can live with and then go to the rest of the world and ask them to join us. And that's what a lot of people think we need to do. FLATOW: Chuck in Birmingham, Michigan. Hi. CHUCK (Caller): Hi. Thanks for putting me on. I had a question. I thought, you know, I've been thinking about the fact that you talk about having the people at the top do it, but what about the people at the bottom? What about us folks who drive our cars and what have you - what about a cap-and-trade system. . . FLATOW: Yeah. CHUCK: . . . so people could say, well, I'll trade you and you pay me some money. So I'll drive my car slower, or I'll buy a. . . FLATOW: Or I'll get a hybrid or something. Yeah. Exactly. CHUCK: . . . or I'll use less gas or in some way measure - I mean I imagine there'll be people out there inventing ways to reduce their emissions on their cars. FLATOW: Absolutely. Chuck, I'm on with you on this. Dr. CHAMEIDES: Well, it's a great idea. And the fact is in a cap-and-trade system everybody has the opportunity to figure out a clever way to lower their emissions, going beyond what they have - normally have to do, and they can try to sell it. So if you guys - suppose a whole bunch of you can figure out some clever way to lower emissions; you can bundle all of that as a credit and go to a power company and say - if you can validate that it actually exists and register that as an offset. . . FLATOW: But that's where - well, that's where the federal government could step in and say if you drive, if you buy - you know, they already give you a credit for let's say a hybrid car; they say if you drive that X number of miles, you've eliminated X number of tons of emissions. Dr. CHAMEIDES: Well, without getting into the specifics. . . FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. CHAMEIDES: . . . of what would be a valid offset or not. FLATOW: Right. Dr. CHAMEIDES: Let's me just say that in principle, the great thing about a cap-and-trade system is that individuals now get to play in the marketplace. And if you've got a clever idea and you can agree, the regulators agree that it works, you can actually make money doing it. FLATOW: So you just have to be innovative. Dr. CHAMEIDES: Right. So you make money but you also help save the planet, incidentally. FLATOW: So it sounds like - almost like the stock market. You know, it's open society. You can cap, you can trade. . . Dr. CHAMEIDES: That's right. FLATOW: You can buy. You can sell. Dr. CHAMEIDES: What ends up happening is carbon becomes a commodity, just like anything else, just like selling a TV set. And if you can build a better TV set, you're going to make more money. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're going to stay on with Bill for a little bit longer. A lot of folks have stuff to say. It's an interesting topic. What would be the first - before - I've got about 30 seconds before the break, maybe it's unfair to ask you. Dr. CHAMEIDES: Now it's only 20 seconds. FLATOW: All right. Well, we'll just go to the break. We're going to come back and talk lots more about cap and trade, your ideas of how this might work. Maybe you've got something innovative you want to come up with that allows you as citizens - we'd all like to get in on this. This is a great idea if you could save money. Imagine coming - like turning your odometer backwards. Imagine money coming in your direction like you feed the grid if you have solar energy on your house; maybe we can get some money back for cap and trade. Stay with us. We're talking with Bill Chameides, chief scientist at Environmental Defense in New York. 1-800-989-8255. We'll be right back after this break. (Soundbite of music) You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Bill Chameides, who is chief scientist in Environmental Defense in New York, here talking about capping and trading of credits for carbon dioxide reductions. And a lot of our listeners have their thinking capping on today. . . Dr. CHAMEIDES: They certainly do. FLATOW: We certainly have some interesting questions. Let's go to them because they're better than me. Let's go to Scott in Sacramento. Hi, Scott. Dr. CHAMEIDES: Hello, Scott. SCOTT (Caller): Hello. FLATOW: Hi, there. SCOTT: Hi. My question was: Is there any significant opposition to the cap-and-trade system? Dr. CHAMEIDES: Well, I don't want to tell you about that, but I think that there's some folks who favor a - what we call a carbon tax. That you would simply place a tax on emissions rather than cap emissions and allow for trading. And my feeling about a tax is there are varieties of disadvantages, one of them being it's a political non-starter in Washington. But the problem with the tax is it doesn't guarantee what the emissions will be. There's no environmental certainty. And given the seriousness of the climate problem, I think the number one thing we need to know is that emissions are going to go down the amount we need to have them go down, so I would not favor tax for a variety of reasons, including that reason. SCOTT: Okay. Thank you for taking my question. Dr. CHAMEIDES: You're welcome. FLATOW: Let's stay in California and this time go to San Jose. Hi, Bill. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. BILL (Caller): Hi. Thank you for taking my call. My question is related to net metering through PG&E. I'm a photovoltaic generator. I have solar cells on my property and I generated about three times what I use in order to offset my carbon from car driving. And - but at the same time I get no benefit directly from PG&E for that. Basically they take the electricity and basically get the offsets without any value. If you want to drive - if this were to be driven down to the individual basis and there was a value in generating excess what you use on your own property, it would be a huge windfall for the California - in California the legislature doesn't allow PG&E or doesn't require PG&E to pay in excess if they receive free electricity from generators. So if you were to reverse that, the state of California could very quickly be -have all the offsets you could imagine from individual generators, the small photovoltaic generators that generated - that could be generating in excess. Additionally, that would significantly improve the financial recovery rate or return rate on photovoltaic, bringing down the effective cost of photovoltaics for the individual generator, for a - even for a business generator, commercial generator. Dr. CHAMEIDES: So what you're saying is basically when you send electricity back to the grid, you're not getting paid for it. FLATOW: Your meter doesn't turn background. BILL: The meter turns background and I get a credit but it means nothing. Dr. CHAMEIDES: Well, it means. . . BILL: It means there's no financial benefit. There's no benefit. Dr. CHAMEIDES: No, you're getting a benefit because you're paying less for your electricity. I think that the way you established that, it depends on -ultimately for an offset to work, someone has to own the credit and the regulatory system has to decide that. And there are some advantages to having the power company own the credit. There are some advantages to having the individual own the credit. And that's something that can be discussed. But I agree with you that the way you want to set up the incentives is to give people the right kind of market and monetary signal to encourage them to lower their emissions. CONAN: Thanks for calling, Bill. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Columbus. Mason in Columbus. Hi, Mason. MASON (Caller): Yes. I'm calling - we're talking about CO2 as a warming gas but actually it was left off of Gore's graph, but the water dwarfs CO2 as a warming gas. And also, if you look at the science behind it, actually this, our contribution in CO2 is miniscule compared to the volcanoes, animal metabolism, rotting plants and the amount that's released from the ocean when it's warmed by the sun. Dr. CHAMEIDES: Well, sure, let me just go through that. The science on this stuff has been established long, long time ago. Let me take the second one first. There are natural sources of carbon dioxide and there are human sources of carbon dioxide like burning fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide has increased by about 35 percent over the last 100-plus years. And the question is, where does that extra carbon dioxide come from? And we have a signature for that carbon dioxide which relates to carbon isotopes. It's like a fingerprint. And it tells us to a scientific certainty that extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has come from burning fossil fuels primarily. So it doesn't come from volcanoes. It doesn't come from the ocean. There are natural cycles that are turning carbon dioxide over in the atmosphere but they're not changing the concentration. The question is, where is the increase coming from, and the increase, which is what we care about, which is causing global warming, is coming from burning fossil fuels from human activities. Now the other question has to do with water vapor. Water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. The concentration of water vapor is determined by the temperature. The warmer the temperature, the more water vapor there is in the atmosphere. Emissions of water vapor from human activities has no impact whatsoever on water vapor concentrations, but there is a perverse cycle in the atmosphere. We put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It warms the atmosphere. We have more water vapor in the atmosphere, which warms the atmosphere even more, which leads to more water vapor and more warming. The only way we can control that process is to lower or eliminate out CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning, for example. So the fact that water vapor is an important greenhouse gas does not change the fact that our emissions of carbon dioxide are causing the warming. FLATOW: Okay, Mason, thanks for calling. MASON: But what about the impact of the sun, which to me is - I don't see how we can take that out of the equation, which seems to be dropped out of this equation, and it's a very complicated, but it's the magnetism - if you watch sun spots and correlate that with - it correlates much better with. . . Mr. CHAMEIDES: Let me - what's your name again? MASON: Mason. Mr. CHAMEIDES: Mason, good point. Let me just say that we as scientists have been working on this problem for decades, and we have used observations to sort of try to understand and eliminate every possible cause of this warming besides greenhouse gas emissions. In the case of the sun, for example, very likely, changes in the sun or changes in sun spots have caused the climate to change. We have monitored, for example, the solar output for the last 20-plus years from satellites. The solar output simply has not changed, net change, over the last 20 years. It does not - it could not have caused the warming. We have looked a sun-spot changes and we know that that change could not have caused global warming. There has not been a consistent change in sun-spot number. So all of these hypotheses that you've put forward are interesting hypotheses, but you know, we scientists have actually thought about this for a long time, we've thought about these hypotheses. And I'm hear to talk about the solutions to global warming because as a scientist, I've spent 30 years worrying about it, and I've eliminated those hypotheses. FLATOW: Well, Bill, I want to thank you for going through that with us and taking time to be with us today. Bill Chameides. Mr. CHAMEIDES: Thank you so much. It was a great pleasure. Bye-bye. FLATOW: Chief scientist at Environmental Defense in New York, talking with us about global warming.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  Up next: when it comes to global warming and our role in causing it, the science is - the science is pretty much settled. What's up for debate now is, what do we do about it? If the goal is to curb the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases we're pumping into the atmosphere, that conventional wisdom always - how do we stop that - conventional wisdom has been to suggest a cap on carbon emissions, limit how much carbon can be spewed out of tailpipes and smokestack. Straight cap on, but there is an alternative called carbon trading.  Joining us now to make the case for carbon trading is the chief scientist for environmental defense. He has co-authored a paper in this week's Science magazine that says a cap-and-trade system is the only way to guarantee a drop in CO2 levels by a target date. Our number: 1-800-989-8255, if you like to join in the discussion.  Bill Chameides is the chief scientist at Environmental Defense in New York. He joins us here in our SCIENCE FRIDAY studios. Welcome to the program.  Mr. BILL CHAMEIDES (Chief Scientist, Environmental Defense, New York): Hi, Ira, thanks for having me.  FLATOW: Please, do a better job than I've been explaining what do you mean by the cap and trade.  Mr. CHAMEIDES: Okay.  FLATOW: Then why it's better.  Mr. CHAMEIDES: The most important part of what we're talking about is the cap part. Actually, in Congress, as the representative was talking about, there are lots of bills that they're considering. And some of them, I would characterize as pretender bills and some of them are real bills. The real bills mandate a decrease in emissions over time. They apply a cap. So the first part is cap.  The next question is, if you go in and have a cap, what's the most effective, what's the most efficient way of limiting costs and getting the reductions as quickly as possible? And experience has shown quite often that the way to do that is let the marketplace figure it out. And the way you harness the power of the marketplace is by allowing a commodity to be traded. In this case, you would trade carbon emissions across emitters and people who can save emissions and that's what - that's the trade part. That's the carbon trading part.  FLATOW: So, only to just see if I can tweak(ph) - tease(ph) this out a little bit. If I make cleans(ph), if I - in fact, really - let's say, I'm a power plant and I put clean, carbon-free emissions, I could have credits for those that I can now swap, right, with someone who might not be so clean and sell them for money?  Mr. CHAMEIDES: That's right. Think about it as two power plants. They both have the same cap. One power plant - your power plant is really smart. And if - you figure out a way to lower your emissions even below - further than below your cap, I'm not so smart, I'm going to have to give you money to make up that difference. So we reward innovation.  FLATOW: Now how do you know that this will work better than mandatory - just caps system?  Mr. CHAMEIDES: Well, I think the only way to do a cap system is allow for trading. The reason it works better is because it gives rewards to people to go beyond the limit. Suppose we're - again, we're two power plants. And you have your allowance and I have my allowance. If we can't trade, all I want to do in my power plant, all you're going to do in your power plant is get to the allowance. You're not going to do anything more than that. On the other hand, if you know, you can make money by coming up with a new technology that's going to get your further down the road, you're going to do it. I'm going to try to do it, too. Everybody's going to try to it and you're going to spark innovation.  FLATOW: Now, this is something because the earth doesn't care where the CO2 is coming form.  Mr. CHAMEIDES: That's absolutely right.  FLATOW: The earth could do it any - you could trade international.  Mr. CHAMEIDES: That's right. You can trade internationally. For example, a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the world are coming from burning tropical rainforests. Power plants could pay tropical rainforest countries to slow the rate of deforestation, save that precious resource and get relatively cheap benefits in terms of, in terms of lowering their emissions and everybody wins.  FLATOW: I have a question for it, a challenge to this system.  Mr. CHAMEIDES: Okay.  FLATOW: Because I think it's an interesting idea. A significant amount of greenhouse gases in the form of methane come from cattle. And the, I think research show that the worse off the cattle are, the more methane they actually put. Healthy cattle don't put out as much methane. Could you do that with farmers? Also, with cap-and-trade. . .  Mr. CHAMEIDES: You could. In fact, if you have what we call carbon offsets, where you allow for people to figure out ways of lowering emissions even though they don't have enough part of the emission scenario, they don't have allowances. They can sell those as credits. So for example, if I'm a hog farmer, and I know the waste - that you might not want to think about exactly what that is. . .  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. CHAMEIDES: . . . but the manure  gives off methane. I can figure out a way to capture that methane, use that as a credit and sell it to a power plant to make up for their emissions. So there's all sorts of opportunities for people to figure out ways to prevent emissions from natural systems, to enhance the uptake of greenhouse gases in natural systems like farms and forests and use those as offsets to sell to emitters.  FLATOW: In order to do a cap-and-trade system that's binding, how big a hurdle is it? Do you think that Congress is going to, you know, they're not thinking. You heard the congressmen when I brought it up. He said that's an option. Well, is it something that's on their radar screen or they just either all cap or no cap?  Mr. CHAMEIDES: Well, this is definitely on their radar screen. There are several bills in Washington that are - have been proposed and are being considered, and a number of those have in them a cap, a real cap on emissions that allow for carbon trading, different limitations on that carbon trading. And I think it remains to be seen what comes out.  From my point of view, the question is not whether we're going to have climate legislation in the United States; I think we're clearly going to. Whether that legislation is going to be meaningful. And meaningful legislation will have a real cap on emissions that requires a decrease in emissions over time and that will have the flexibility that we need to allow for carbon trading. And there are some bills that do that now.  FLATOW: Let's talk about the track record that cap-and-trade has. It's had a pretty good track record with acid rain. It worked with acid rain. . .  Mr. CHAMEIDES: Sure. When we had. . .  FLATOW: . . . did it not?  Mr. CHAMEIDES: We had a cap-and-trade system put in place with the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments for acid rain that involved a cap on sulfur oxide emissions over time and trading among power plants. At the time it was put in place, there was a lot of criticism - it wasn't going to work, it will be too expensive. We met the targets ahead of time, at about one-third the cost. And because we had that trading, there were all sorts of incentives for power plants to figure out cheap ways of lowering their sulfur oxide emissions, and it turned out to be much less expensive than had been originally predicted.  We also did trading, some limited trading in lowering CFC emissions for the stratospheric ozone depletion process problem, and there was some trading in lowering lead in gasoline as well. So we've had some experience with it each time we've done this work quite well.  FLATOW: Let's go to the phones - 1-800-989-8255. Phil in Frederick, Maryland. Hi, Phil.  PHIL (Caller): Yeah, hi. I guess my question as a homeowner is or a taxpayer is, I'm assuming all these corporations that are going to be doing these caps-and-trades, country to country or whatever, but how are the rest of us going to understand, actually, this cap-and-trade is leading to a valid result. . .  Mr. CHAMEIDES: Did we lose Phil?  PHIL: . . . records of all cap and trade, if that makes any sense. And also, are taxpayers or corporations rather getting sort of a subsidy from this?  Mr. CHAMEIDES: Okay, let me try to answer those questions sequentially. Hello, Phil, incidentally. The way you would apply the cap is just upstream, a high upstream in the process as possible so we wouldn't be applying the cap to individuals. We would be applying the cap to power plants to or build manufacturers, to refineries and so forth.  The way you make sure it's actually making a difference, it turns out that for most of the greenhouse gas emissions, which is carbon dioxide, it's a no-brainer. How much gasoline you use, how much coal you use, how much natural gas you use immediately tells us how much CO2 gets into the atmosphere because we know the carbon content of those fuels. So if we simply monitor how much fuel is being used, if we can demonstrate that those fuel numbers are going down, we know we're making a difference.  And typically, in a cap-and-trade system, the government plays a fairly light role - it applies the cap and allows the marketplace to do most of the work, but a very, very important role for the government is enforcement. The government has to make sure that the companies that have the allowances that they'd have the caps meet those caps. And we've done this is the past, for example, the sulfur oxide emissions and it's worked, worked quite well.  Your second question, which, excuse me for a second, what was the second question?  FLATOW: I think he's gone, so we're. . .  Mr. CHAMEIDES: He's gone. Did you remember what's the second question?  FLATOW: No, no. I think your answer is. . .  Mr. CHAMEIDES: Okay. Basically, it was.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Lots of questions. Let's to go Vivian in Suffolk County, Long Island. Hi, Vivian.  VIVIAN (Caller): Hi, how are you doing?  FLATOW: Hi, how are you? Go ahead.  Mr. CHAMEIDES: Hi, Vivian.  VIVIAN: This is a terrific show. I always listen to you. I'm a legislator at Suffolk County, and in the year 2000, I sponsored legislation to limit the CO2 emission from our power plants here. And I became very interested in the cap-and-trade. And a few years ago, I read an article in The Economist - talking about how far ahead the European countries are in this marketplace, recently, the United States. How much of a game of catch-up will we be playing here in the United States, entering this marketplace?  Mr. CHAMEIDES: Well, the catch-up is going to be on emissions, I mean, where the Europeans are making progress. The other thing that I would talk about in terms of catch-up, which relates to what Representative Gordon was talking about just a few minutes ago, there has to - competitiveness, it's because the Europeans have this carbon market in place and they've been worrying about it. They're getting way ahead of us in terms of development of news industries, like wind energy, solarvoltaic energies, and those types of technologies. And that's really where the catch up is going to be. There's a low carbon economy coming. Ultimately, the United States is going to have to be part of that low carbon economy. And the longer it takes us to start dealing with this problem, the further we're going to get behind in developing these technologies, and if we wait long enough, we're going to be an importer of those technologies rather than an exporter.  FLATOW: Vivienne, did you say you're a legislator in Albany?  VIVIENNE: No, in Suffolk County, I'm a county legislator.  FLATOW: Do you think that people like you, locally, are going to be out front in these things instead of waiting for the federal government to do something?  VIVIENNE: Well, actually, my legislation was way out front within the year 2000. But unfortunately we do need a nationwide push in order to have a serious impact.  But I think that in some ways because so many of us have been out front, we've helped to push the federal government to step up to the plate. But until somebody like Al Gore really came out and let the public know how important it is, we don't have the, you know, the media and the public awareness.  So what Al Gore has done is really to not jumpstart - because it has started on grassroots - but he's really created a much wider platform of understanding and knowledge.  Dr. CHAMEIDES: No argument there. What you said about it in terms of pushing the federal government is incredibly on the mark. And we need a federal policy. But it's really important to - for folks to know that in the Northeast we have the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which is capping greenhouse gas emissions from power plants in the Northeast and a trading system between the power plants.  In California, they've capped the emissions. So the states are now way out in front of the federal government and they are forcing the federal government to do something.  FLATOW: Thank you. . .  VIVIENNE: Isn't that a shame?  Dr. CHAMEIDES: Well, I think it's a shame but on the other hand it's great. The states are making it happen.  FLATOW: Well, you may have - you may have diversified. We have every - if you look on the Internet, and just about every day there's another county or company installing wind turbines all over the country, which you're getting, it appears, is a decentralized system, you know, of energy. And maybe that's better for brownouts and blackouts eventually and things like that.  Dr. CHAMEIDES: Well, I would agree that a decentralized system might be good for us to have, but absent a federal policy on climate, we're not going to get the kind of cuts in emissions we need to have. That's my belief.  FLATOW: All right, Vivienne. Thanks and good luck to you.  VIVIENNE: Thank you. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.  FLATOW: You're welcome. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's go to - let's go down the block, go to Fred in Delaware, Ohio. Hi, Fred.  FRED (Caller): Hi. Thanks, guys. Here's a question. I hope it's relevant. Instead of putting a band-aid on the whole situation, why don't we focus energies and finance and resources on actually creating new or perfecting new non-polluting energy - wind, sun, solar, geothermal, etc. , etc. ?  FLATOW: Well, that's what Al Gore said, sure. Before Congress, he said let's put a cap, take the money and create alternative energy.  Dr. CHAMEIDES: Well, the question is, clearly we need new technologies. Wind, solar - we need to implement those technologies as well. So the question is how best can you get those technologies developed and implemented? One approach is like the Manhattan Project approach. Let the government take a whole pot of money and throw it at some technology and hope it develops.  There are a lot of problems with that. I don't know that anybody is smart enough to know which technology is going to be the best technology, and I wonder if everybody thinks that the folks in Washington had a big pot of money they would spend it in a rational way.  Another way to do it is to let the marketplace figure out the best technologies. The amount of money in the marketplace is so much larger than the government has. If you do a cap-and-trade system, what happens is the marketplace is energized to develop those technologies because there's a profit to be made by making those technologies work.  And that, in my mind, is the best way to get those technologies developed. There's no argument we need the technologies, but the question is how best to do it.  FLATOW: We're talking about energy this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm talking with Bill Chameides, who is chief scientist at the Environmental Defense in New York.  If we do adopt a cap-and-trade, on the other side of the planet, we have India, we have China, which doesn't have a cap-and-trade system. Can we have enough credits possible in the whole country to overcome the amount of pollution that they're going to be putting in to the air?  Dr. CHAMEIDES: Good point. It's a global problem. We've got to have global cooperation. If all of the developed countries cut their emissions to zero, we still couldn't do what we need to do. So we've got to get all the countries involved.  The question is how best to get those countries involved. In the final analysis, the United States is the larger emitter of greenhouse gases and historically the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from us is much larger than anybody else.  So I think it's somewhat disingenuous of us to say we need to do something about this but we're not going to do anything until you guys do something. I think it's much more likely and rational for us to come up with a policy that we can live with and then go to the rest of the world and ask them to join us. And that's what a lot of people think we need to do.  FLATOW: Chuck in Birmingham, Michigan. Hi.  CHUCK (Caller): Hi. Thanks for putting me on. I had a question. I thought, you know, I've been thinking about the fact that you talk about having the people at the top do it, but what about the people at the bottom? What about us folks who drive our cars and what have you - what about a cap-and-trade system. . .  FLATOW: Yeah.  CHUCK: . . . so people could say, well, I'll trade you and you pay me some money. So I'll drive my car slower, or I'll buy a. . .  FLATOW: Or I'll get a hybrid or something. Yeah. Exactly.  CHUCK: . . . or I'll use less gas or in some way measure - I mean I imagine there'll be people out there inventing ways to reduce their emissions on their cars.  FLATOW: Absolutely. Chuck, I'm on with you on this.  Dr. CHAMEIDES: Well, it's a great idea. And the fact is in a cap-and-trade system everybody has the opportunity to figure out a clever way to lower their emissions, going beyond what they have - normally have to do, and they can try to sell it. So if you guys - suppose a whole bunch of you can figure out some clever way to lower emissions; you can bundle all of that as a credit and go to a power company and say - if you can validate that it actually exists and register that as an offset. . .  FLATOW: But that's where - well, that's where the federal government could step in and say if you drive, if you buy - you know, they already give you a credit for let's say a hybrid car; they say if you drive that X number of miles, you've eliminated X number of tons of emissions.  Dr. CHAMEIDES: Well, without getting into the specifics. . .  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. CHAMEIDES: . . . of what would be a valid offset or not.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. CHAMEIDES: Let's me just say that in principle, the great thing about a cap-and-trade system is that individuals now get to play in the marketplace. And if you've got a clever idea and you can agree, the regulators agree that it works, you can actually make money doing it.  FLATOW: So you just have to be innovative.  Dr. CHAMEIDES: Right. So you make money but you also help save the planet, incidentally.  FLATOW: So it sounds like - almost like the stock market. You know, it's open society. You can cap, you can trade. . .  Dr. CHAMEIDES: That's right.  FLATOW: You can buy. You can sell.  Dr. CHAMEIDES: What ends up happening is carbon becomes a commodity, just like anything else, just like selling a TV set. And if you can build a better TV set, you're going to make more money.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're going to stay on with Bill for a little bit longer. A lot of folks have stuff to say. It's an interesting topic. What would be the first - before - I've got about 30 seconds before the break, maybe it's unfair to ask you.  Dr. CHAMEIDES: Now it's only 20 seconds.  FLATOW: All right. Well, we'll just go to the break. We're going to come back and talk lots more about cap and trade, your ideas of how this might work. Maybe you've got something innovative you want to come up with that allows you as citizens - we'd all like to get in on this.  This is a great idea if you could save money. Imagine coming - like turning your odometer backwards. Imagine money coming in your direction like you feed the grid if you have solar energy on your house; maybe we can get some money back for cap and trade.  Stay with us. We're talking with Bill Chameides, chief scientist at Environmental Defense in New York. 1-800-989-8255. We'll be right back after this break.  (Soundbite of music)  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY.  I'm Ira Flatow talking with Bill Chameides, who is chief scientist in Environmental Defense in New York, here talking about capping and trading of credits for carbon dioxide reductions. And a lot of our listeners have their thinking capping on today. . .  Dr. CHAMEIDES: They certainly do.  FLATOW: We certainly have some interesting questions. Let's go to them because they're better than me. Let's go to Scott in Sacramento. Hi, Scott.  Dr. CHAMEIDES: Hello, Scott.  SCOTT (Caller): Hello.  FLATOW: Hi, there.  SCOTT: Hi. My question was: Is there any significant opposition to the cap-and-trade system?  Dr. CHAMEIDES: Well, I don't want to tell you about that, but I think that there's some folks who favor a - what we call a carbon tax. That you would simply place a tax on emissions rather than cap emissions and allow for trading. And my feeling about a tax is there are varieties of disadvantages, one of them being it's a political non-starter in Washington.  But the problem with the tax is it doesn't guarantee what the emissions will be. There's no environmental certainty. And given the seriousness of the climate problem, I think the number one thing we need to know is that emissions are going to go down the amount we need to have them go down, so I would not favor tax for a variety of reasons, including that reason.  SCOTT: Okay. Thank you for taking my question.  Dr. CHAMEIDES: You're welcome.  FLATOW: Let's stay in California and this time go to San Jose. Hi, Bill. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  BILL (Caller): Hi. Thank you for taking my call. My question is related to net metering through PG&E. I'm a photovoltaic generator. I have solar cells on my property and I generated about three times what I use in order to offset my carbon from car driving. And - but at the same time I get no benefit directly from PG&E for that. Basically they take the electricity and basically get the offsets without any value.  If you want to drive - if this were to be driven down to the individual basis and there was a value in generating excess what you use on your own property, it would be a huge windfall for the California - in California the legislature doesn't allow PG&E or doesn't require PG&E to pay in excess if they receive free electricity from generators.  So if you were to reverse that, the state of California could very quickly be -have all the offsets you could imagine from individual generators, the small photovoltaic generators that generated - that could be generating in excess. Additionally, that would significantly improve the financial recovery rate or return rate on photovoltaic, bringing down the effective cost of photovoltaics for the individual generator, for a - even for a business generator, commercial generator.  Dr. CHAMEIDES: So what you're saying is basically when you send electricity back to the grid, you're not getting paid for it.  FLATOW: Your meter doesn't turn background.  BILL: The meter turns background and I get a credit but it means nothing.  Dr. CHAMEIDES: Well, it means. . .  BILL: It means there's no financial benefit. There's no benefit.  Dr. CHAMEIDES: No, you're getting a benefit because you're paying less for your electricity. I think that the way you established that, it depends on -ultimately for an offset to work, someone has to own the credit and the regulatory system has to decide that. And there are some advantages to having the power company own the credit. There are some advantages to having the individual own the credit. And that's something that can be discussed. But I agree with you that the way you want to set up the incentives is to give people the right kind of market and monetary signal to encourage them to lower their emissions.  CONAN: Thanks for calling, Bill. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Columbus. Mason in Columbus. Hi, Mason.  MASON (Caller): Yes. I'm calling - we're talking about CO2 as a warming gas but actually it was left off of Gore's graph, but the water dwarfs CO2 as a warming gas. And also, if you look at the science behind it, actually this, our contribution in CO2 is miniscule compared to the volcanoes, animal metabolism, rotting plants and the amount that's released from the ocean when it's warmed by the sun.  Dr. CHAMEIDES: Well, sure, let me just go through that. The science on this stuff has been established long, long time ago. Let me take the second one first. There are natural sources of carbon dioxide and there are human sources of carbon dioxide like burning fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide has increased by about 35 percent over the last 100-plus years. And the question is, where does that extra carbon dioxide come from? And we have a signature for that carbon dioxide which relates to carbon isotopes. It's like a fingerprint. And it tells us to a scientific certainty that extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has come from burning fossil fuels primarily. So it doesn't come from volcanoes. It doesn't come from the ocean. There are natural cycles that are turning carbon dioxide over in the atmosphere but they're not changing the concentration.  The question is, where is the increase coming from, and the increase, which is what we care about, which is causing global warming, is coming from burning fossil fuels from human activities.  Now the other question has to do with water vapor. Water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. The concentration of water vapor is determined by the temperature. The warmer the temperature, the more water vapor there is in the atmosphere. Emissions of water vapor from human activities has no impact whatsoever on water vapor concentrations, but there is a perverse cycle in the atmosphere.  We put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It warms the atmosphere. We have more water vapor in the atmosphere, which warms the atmosphere even more, which leads to more water vapor and more warming. The only way we can control that process is to lower or eliminate out CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning, for example.  So the fact that water vapor is an important greenhouse gas does not change the fact that our emissions of carbon dioxide are causing the warming.  FLATOW: Okay, Mason, thanks for calling.  MASON: But what about the impact of the sun, which to me is - I don't see how we can take that out of the equation, which seems to be dropped out of this equation, and it's a very complicated, but it's the magnetism - if you watch sun spots and correlate that with - it correlates much better with. . .  Mr. CHAMEIDES: Let me - what's your name again?  MASON: Mason.  Mr. CHAMEIDES: Mason, good point. Let me just say that we as scientists have been working on this problem for decades, and we have used observations to sort of try to understand and eliminate every possible cause of this warming besides greenhouse gas emissions.  In the case of the sun, for example, very likely, changes in the sun or changes in sun spots have caused the climate to change. We have monitored, for example, the solar output for the last 20-plus years from satellites. The solar output simply has not changed, net change, over the last 20 years. It does not - it could not have caused the warming.  We have looked a sun-spot changes and we know that that change could not have caused global warming. There has not been a consistent change in sun-spot number. So all of these hypotheses that you've put forward are interesting hypotheses, but you know, we scientists have actually thought about this for a long time, we've thought about these hypotheses. And I'm hear to talk about the solutions to global warming because as a scientist, I've spent 30 years worrying about it, and I've eliminated those hypotheses.  FLATOW: Well, Bill, I want to thank you for going through that with us and taking time to be with us today. Bill Chameides.  Mr. CHAMEIDES: Thank you so much. It was a great pleasure. Bye-bye.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Many people have questions about the best treatment for heart disease following the publication of a study earlier this week that questioned whether many people who've had heart surgery actually needed it. Every year, about a million heart patients in this country undergo a procedure called angioplasty, where a doctor inflates a small balloon to clear a blocked artery and inserts a tiny mesh tube called a stent to keep it open. The study of more than 2,000 patients with non-emergency problems found that outcomes were just as good with drugs and a healthy lifestyle. If you have questions about this, our number is 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. E-mail is talk@npr. org. And joining us now to answer them is Dr. Steven Nissen. He's the chairman of the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. He's with us today from member station WCPN in Cleveland, Ohio. Nice to have you on the program today. Dr. STEVEN NISSEN (President, American College of Cardiology): It's a pleasure, Neal. CONAN: And how big a deal is this study? Dr. NISSEN: Well, it's a very important study. The study involved - it was called COURAGE, which is an apropos name, and the study involved 2,300 patients with coronary blockages. And they had to have stable chest pain and they had several episodes a week at least of pain. Everybody in the study received the best medical treatment, drugs to lower cholesterol and blood pressure, and lifestyle counseling. Half of them received a stent, one or more stents, and the other half received only the medical treatment and the lifestyle counseling. They were followed for 4. 6 years on average and the outcome that was measured was the risk of death or having a heart attack. In fact, at the end of those period of time, at 4. 6 years, there were about the same number of patients in both groups that had died or had a heart attack. Perhaps even more surprising, at one year, three years and five years nearly as many patients receiving medicines alone were free of chest pain compared to those that had actually received a stent. So that the benefits of the stent were somewhat modest. CONAN: And that's what some of the surgeons say, look, we don't - first of all, let me point out to ask you, this was not about emergency people, people who are currently having heart attacks. You know, in those cases, angioplasty and stents are called for? Dr. NISSEN: It's extremely important to understand that. If people have chest pains, sudden and onset and severe, then you need to get to hospital emergency room, preferably by ambulance. And most of the time, they're going to end up going directly to a heart catheterization laboratory often for a stent to be placed. We do not want this study to dissuade patients from getting the kind of prompt treatment you need when you have urgent chest pain. CONAN: So this is for people with what is called stable heart disease. And again that's - but some surgeons that I read in the news stories said wait a minute, we used these operations. They're better at relieving chest pain, angina. Dr. NISSEN: Well, let me give you the figures. At the end of one year, 66 percent of the patients that received a stent were completely free of chest pain, but 58 percent of the patients that received medical therapy were also free of chest pain. And so we gained about eight percentage points of freedom from chest pain overall with the placement of a stent, which is a fairly complicated procedure. I think the take-home message from this is that it's okay to start with medical therapy, with drugs and lifestyle changes. And more than half of those patients by the end of a year are going to be completely free of chest pain and they will never need, at least not in a short term, to have a stent placed. And on the other hand, if people have a lot more difficulty, if the pain interferes with their lifestyle, then they can have a stent placed at any time. Delaying placing a stent doesn't put them in any added risk of dying or having a heart attack. CONAN: Let's get some listeners on with their questions. If you'd like to join us, 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. E-mail is talk@npr. org. Again, our guest is Dr. Steve Nissen, and we'll begin with Saul, Saul with us from San Antonio. SAUL (Caller): Hi. CONAN: Hi, Saul, you're on the air. SAUL: Thank you. I think it's a fascinating study, and it gives us a lot of insight. Being a critical-care internist for many, many years, I have a little bit of a problem, and the problem is getting patients to comply with lifestyle changes, and if we're going to have a choice between the stent and lifestyle changes, which we have a great deal of trouble putting together, how do we justify only going with lifestyle changes? CONAN: And lifestyle changes, just briefly, diet and exercise. SAUL: Diet, exercise and weight reduction, control of diabetes, elimination of smoking. There are a whole bunch of things that go with lifestyle changes. CONAN: Doctor\u2026 SAUL: It's a pretty impossible problem in the general population. CONAN: Dr. Nissen? Dr. STEVE NISSEN: Well, it's not impossible, but it is difficult. SAUL: Pretty impossible. Dr. NISSEN: And I would say that it's important to understand how this study was done. Both groups of patients got the best counseling they could be provided with and the best medical therapy, so they were getting really the equal treatment. It means compliance was very likely very similar in the two groups. And so then the question was, given the current circumstances with how patients comply with medical therapy, was there an added benefit of placing a stent, and there was an added benefit. There was somewhat less chest pain, but it was a modest benefit, and a lot of people that just got the medicines and lifestyle changes, regardless of their compliance, were free of pain at the end of one year, three years and five years. CONAN: Thanks very much - Saul, I'm sorry? SAUL: It's impressive, but I still put out the caveat that unless we have a motivated group of patients, we're going to have long-term problems in getting the type of statistical significance that we're talking about in the study. CONAN: Saul, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it. SAUL: You're welcome. CONAN: Let's go now to Lois, and Lois is with us from Traverse City in Michigan. LOIS (Caller): Yes, hello. CONAN: Hi. LOIS: My husband, a few years ago, was having actually discomfort, not acute pain, discomfort when we were walking, and more in his back, upper back and neck, you know? And anyway, finally the doctor said go ahead, have a stress test, and we have a very strong and well reputation here of a heart center area here in Traverse City, Michigan. Anyway, that showed there is - they decided that he needed an angiogram to check out, and he did have blockage with what do you call it, the lower left ventricle? It's been a while since I read the reports. But the thing that was most distressing on this was that when the doctor talked to him after this - before he had this, before he went ahead with this, was the way the doctor came on, frankly, was like a used-car salesman, and because my husband likes to play tennis and be active, the doctor just kind of went blurry on any medication or any other procedure which I tried to raise, because he said I can't promise you, you know, like with tennis, that kind of thing, active, with medicine, you know, you have a better chance with the stent, etc. CONAN: So he was selling the angioplasty and a stent? LOIS: Yes, and not only that, then he had the same kind of problem Vice President Cheney did, had to go back in. I ended up, because I'd learned a long time ago with my own problems, to do a lot of medical research myself, particularly after living in Ann Arbor. He had an acute rheumatoid arthritis attack, which I tracked down to the I. V. heparin as a possibility, which is a rare occurrence. But anyway, here's the thing. I've always gotten copies of reports for years. CONAN: Well, let me go back to the question about\u2026 LOIS: Wait, wait, there's one important thing here to say to you. There was no evidence in any of other stress test until after the procedure of any actual, what do you call it - myocardial - anyway, a heart attack, until afterwards. And we knew that was kind of a risk. He will not go back for a stress test. I started him out with - he was diabetic at the time, he still is, with going back on slow exercise and everything. He's 80, let's see -CONAN: I'm sorry, Lois, we can't get the entire medical history, nor can Dr. Nissen diagnose on the radio. But getting back to the point, I think there is a concern among some people that doctors were too quick to adopt the angioplasty and stent procedure before waiting for studies like this one. Dr. NISSEN: Well, your listener of course makes a very good point, and that's why this study is so important, is it tells us that patients have choices. This is really about patient choices, and I think we can now say to patients like this gentleman, look, if you want to give a trial of medical treatment with drugs and lifestyle changes, there's a better than 50/50 chance you're going to become pain-free, and you can avoid having a stent procedure with some potential complications down the road. If, however, your lifestyle, playing tennis and other things, if you just can't get there with medicines, we can always go back and put the stent in, and we haven't put you in harm's way by delaying and giving medicine a chance to work. So it's a very important choice now that we can offer patients. CONAN: Here's an e-mail we got from Dermot in Boston. As a health professional, it's upsetting to me that angioplasty, stenting, PTCA, PCI, etc. , is referred to as cardiac surgery in this and other programs. It's certainly not surgery. These procedures are performed by cardiologists, not cardiac surgeons, with is an entirely different specialty, requiring a different training and different board certification. Cardiac surgery would be coronary, artery, bypass, grafting, valve replacement, etc. , all of which most often require opening the patient's chest. I and many other health-care professionals listening would much enjoy this disambiguation announced on the air. I guess those of us who are mere civilians think you take a knife and you cut me open, that's surgery. Dr. NISSEN: Okay, let me tell you that your listener is absolutely right. In fact, at the top of the hour you described me as a cardiac surgeon, which I'm not. CONAN: I apologize for that. Dr. NISSEN: And I am a cardiologist, and what the listener is pointing out is that there are two branches of heart-disease treatment: cardiac surgeons, who perform operations where they open the chest and they sew in bypass grafts and so on; and then cardiologists like myself, where we do medical treatment, and some cardiologists, called interventional cardiologists, perform angioplasties and stents, which do not involve opening the chest. They're actually done through a little catheter, a little tube, put in from the groin. And so there you have it. I've explained it on National Public Radio, what's the difference between a cardiologist and a cardiac surgeon. CONAN: Thank you very much for that. We're talking with Dr. Steve Nissen, chairman of Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And let's see if we can get another caller on the line, and this is Rakesh(ph), Rakesh with us from Chicago. RAKESH (Caller): Hello, how are you? CONAN: Very well, thank you. RAKESH: Well, it's good to talk do you, Dr. Nissen. Dr. NISSEN: My pleasure. RAKESH: I'm just a little unhappy that this study had to be done at this stage. This study should have been done before the cardiologists authorized angioplasty so much. We should have had this information before offering this treatment to all the patients. The other problem I have is - well, there are two other things. One, that the study had to be done in V. A. hospitals and in Canada, probably because the cardiologists were unwilling to accrue patients. And the third problem is that I see very little improvement in the medical therapy since the (unintelligible) study came out 30 years ago, you know, where we were seeing 70, 80 percent survival in patients treated medically. So to me that seems a serious indictment of cardiology. Dr. NISSEN: Well, I actually don't see it that way, and let me see if I can explain to your listeners. Stents were introduced in 1994. This study was planned and designed somewhere around 1998 or 1999. Remember, these people had to be enrolled in the study and then followed for five years or more. It takes time to do research like this, and I know we'd like to have instant answers, but we can't do that. We have to study things over longer periods of time. Knowing what happens in nine months or a year isn't necessarily the same as what happens in five years. I think the folks that did this study did a terrific job. They got it up and running pretty soon after stents became commonplace, and they've gotten us an answer that is very, very helpful. I did want to mention one other thing that was brought up, and that is what about medical therapy? Why did we see the result that we saw? And it is interesting that medical therapy - I don't agree with your listener - has improved dramatically. Our drugs to lower cholesterol are much more effective. Our drugs to lower blood pressure, our blood thinners are better. And so I think the reason we're seeing this result is we've got good treatments for patients. Stents are good treatment, medicine's good treatment, and if we use each wisely, reserving the stents for those that need them, and giving very good medical therapy to others, then we're going to get the best outcome for the most number of people. So I think this is an exciting result for patients because it does, in fact, give us options. CONAN: Here's an e-mail question from Samantha in Grass Valley, California. It's my understanding that in the past heart-disease research almost exclusively involved men. Were there equal numbers of men and women in this study? Dr. NISSEN: Well, that's a great question. Being a study that was done largely in the VA hospital system, this study is dominated by men, and it is a huge problem. We need more studies dedicated to women. We know that coronary heart disease in women is different. Fortunately, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute has been working very hard on a variety of initiatives to get more studies done in women, and I wish we had more women in this study as well. One thing that hasn't come up yet that I thought perhaps we ought to at least talk about a little bit is what about bypass surgery? You know, there are three options, not two: medicines, stenting and bypass surgery. And it's important to understand that bypass surgery has been shown in certain patient populations to reduce the risk of heart attack and death. And so I think you may see a little bit of a tilt now back to doing more bypass operations. So as we learn more, we find out sometimes that our older therapies have some significant advantages, and I think things are going to come a little bit more back into balance now that we have a study like Courage. CONAN: And finally, we just have a few seconds left, but I hope you can answer Tom in Ann Arbor's e-mail question. Wouldn't delaying a stent procedure carry a potential risk that it would be needed later when a patient is older and surgery more dangerous? And again, I guess we've just been told it's not surgery. Dr. NISSEN: It isn't surgery, and in fact there is a little bit of increase in risk of a stent as you get older, but that risk doesn't go up very steeply. And so one of the principles of medicine, in Latin, is primum non nocere, which means above all do no harm. And so any time you can avoid a procedure that might have some risks, it's good medical practice to avoid it. What we're saying here is give medicine a chance in most patients, many patients with stable symptoms. You can always do a stent later if they need it. CONAN: Dr. Nissen, thanks very much for your time. We appreciate it. Dr. NISSEN: My pleasure. CONAN: Steven Nissen is chairman of the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. He joined us today from our member station in Cleveland, WCPN. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  NEAL CONAN, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  Many people have questions about the best treatment for heart disease following the publication of a study earlier this week that questioned whether many people who've had heart surgery actually needed it. Every year, about a million heart patients in this country undergo a procedure called angioplasty, where a doctor inflates a small balloon to clear a blocked artery and inserts a tiny mesh tube called a stent to keep it open.  The study of more than 2,000 patients with non-emergency problems found that outcomes were just as good with drugs and a healthy lifestyle. If you have questions about this, our number is 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. E-mail is talk@npr. org. And joining us now to answer them is Dr. Steven Nissen. He's the chairman of the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. He's with us today from member station WCPN in Cleveland, Ohio. Nice to have you on the program today.  Dr. STEVEN NISSEN (President, American College of Cardiology): It's a pleasure, Neal.  CONAN: And how big a deal is this study?  Dr. NISSEN: Well, it's a very important study. The study involved - it was called COURAGE, which is an apropos name, and the study involved 2,300 patients with coronary blockages. And they had to have stable chest pain and they had several episodes a week at least of pain. Everybody in the study received the best medical treatment, drugs to lower cholesterol and blood pressure, and lifestyle counseling. Half of them received a stent, one or more stents, and the other half received only the medical treatment and the lifestyle counseling.  They were followed for 4. 6 years on average and the outcome that was measured was the risk of death or having a heart attack. In fact, at the end of those period of time, at 4. 6 years, there were about the same number of patients in both groups that had died or had a heart attack. Perhaps even more surprising, at one year, three years and five years nearly as many patients receiving medicines alone were free of chest pain compared to those that had actually received a stent. So that the benefits of the stent were somewhat modest.  CONAN: And that's what some of the surgeons say, look, we don't - first of all, let me point out to ask you, this was not about emergency people, people who are currently having heart attacks. You know, in those cases, angioplasty and stents are called for?  Dr. NISSEN: It's extremely important to understand that. If people have chest pains, sudden and onset and severe, then you need to get to hospital emergency room, preferably by ambulance. And most of the time, they're going to end up going directly to a heart catheterization laboratory often for a stent to be placed. We do not want this study to dissuade patients from getting the kind of prompt treatment you need when you have urgent chest pain.  CONAN: So this is for people with what is called stable heart disease. And again that's - but some surgeons that I read in the news stories said wait a minute, we used these operations. They're better at relieving chest pain, angina.  Dr. NISSEN: Well, let me give you the figures. At the end of one year, 66 percent of the patients that received a stent were completely free of chest pain, but 58 percent of the patients that received medical therapy were also free of chest pain. And so we gained about eight percentage points of freedom from chest pain overall with the placement of a stent, which is a fairly complicated procedure.  I think the take-home message from this is that it's okay to start with medical therapy, with drugs and lifestyle changes. And more than half of those patients by the end of a year are going to be completely free of chest pain and they will never need, at least not in a short term, to have a stent placed. And on the other hand, if people have a lot more difficulty, if the pain interferes with their lifestyle, then they can have a stent placed at any time. Delaying placing a stent doesn't put them in any added risk of dying or having a heart attack.  CONAN: Let's get some listeners on with their questions. If you'd like to join us, 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. E-mail is talk@npr. org. Again, our guest is Dr. Steve Nissen, and we'll begin with Saul, Saul with us from San Antonio.  SAUL (Caller): Hi.  CONAN: Hi, Saul, you're on the air.  SAUL: Thank you. I think it's a fascinating study, and it gives us a lot of insight. Being a critical-care internist for many, many years, I have a little bit of a problem, and the problem is getting patients to comply with lifestyle changes, and if we're going to have a choice between the stent and lifestyle changes, which we have a great deal of trouble putting together, how do we justify only going with lifestyle changes?  CONAN: And lifestyle changes, just briefly, diet and exercise.  SAUL: Diet, exercise and weight reduction, control of diabetes, elimination of smoking. There are a whole bunch of things that go with lifestyle changes.  CONAN: Doctor\u2026  SAUL: It's a pretty impossible problem in the general population.  CONAN: Dr. Nissen?  Dr. STEVE NISSEN: Well, it's not impossible, but it is difficult.  SAUL: Pretty impossible.  Dr. NISSEN: And I would say that it's important to understand how this study was done. Both groups of patients got the best counseling they could be provided with and the best medical therapy, so they were getting really the equal treatment. It means compliance was very likely very similar in the two groups. And so then the question was, given the current circumstances with how patients comply with medical therapy, was there an added benefit of placing a stent, and there was an added benefit.  There was somewhat less chest pain, but it was a modest benefit, and a lot of people that just got the medicines and lifestyle changes, regardless of their compliance, were free of pain at the end of one year, three years and five years.  CONAN: Thanks very much - Saul, I'm sorry?  SAUL: It's impressive, but I still put out the caveat that unless we have a motivated group of patients, we're going to have long-term problems in getting the type of statistical significance that we're talking about in the study.  CONAN: Saul, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it.  SAUL: You're welcome.  CONAN: Let's go now to Lois, and Lois is with us from Traverse City in Michigan.  LOIS (Caller): Yes, hello.  CONAN: Hi.  LOIS: My husband, a few years ago, was having actually discomfort, not acute pain, discomfort when we were walking, and more in his back, upper back and neck, you know? And anyway, finally the doctor said go ahead, have a stress test, and we have a very strong and well reputation here of a heart center area here in Traverse City, Michigan.  Anyway, that showed there is - they decided that he needed an angiogram to check out, and he did have blockage with what do you call it, the lower left ventricle? It's been a while since I read the reports.  But the thing that was most distressing on this was that when the doctor talked to him after this - before he had this, before he went ahead with this, was the way the doctor came on, frankly, was like a used-car salesman, and because my husband likes to play tennis and be active, the doctor just kind of went blurry on any medication or any other procedure which I tried to raise, because he said I can't promise you, you know, like with tennis, that kind of thing, active, with medicine, you know, you have a better chance with the stent, etc.  CONAN: So he was selling the angioplasty and a stent?

I'm Robert Siegel. This spring, many farmers, beekeepers and scientists are worried. This time of year, as trees are blossoming, farmers hire beekeepers to move their hives from orchard to field to pollinate the flowers. But this spring, bee colonies across North America are disappearing and no one really knows why. Some farmers are worried their crops won't get pollinated and they won't have fruits and vegetables to sell this summer. NPR's Andrea Seabrook reports that farmers joined beekeepers and scientists on Capitol Hill today to voice their concerns. ANDREA SEABROOK: Far away from orchards and fields, a man-made beehive sits on the wooden dais of this congressional hearing room. It's a small white box with frames that hang in it like folders in a hanging file. Each frame holds a wax comb. Commercial beekeeper Gene Brandy(ph) pulls out a frame to show the congressmen. Mr. GENE BRANDY (Commercial Beekeeper): Actually, this would be a brood comb. . . Unidentified Man: What's a brood comb? Mr. BRANDY: This would be the type of honeycomb that the queen bee would lay the eggs in. Unidentified Man: Okay. Mr. BRANDY: And the eggs hatch into little larva, and they pupate. And after 21 days, a baby bee hatches out. Unidentified Man: Right. Mr. BRANDY: Our honeycomb. . . SEABROOK: Brandy is showing this to North Carolina Democrat Bob Etheridge and California Democrat Dennis Cardoza, the chairman of this agriculture subcommittee. Five beekeepers and farmers from all over the country sit in front of the committee, and each one has a story like this one, from David Ellison(ph) of Ortonville, Montana. Ellison just took a census of each of his roughly 2,000 bee colonies. Mr. DAVID ELLISON (Beekeeper): You'd open the hive, there was honey in the hive, frames of honey, there was no bees at all. And there was pollen in there, maybe a little bit of patch or brood that the bees just up and said well, we're out of here. There's some wrong with it. We're gone. Professor MAY BERENBAUM (Etymology, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign): The really mystifying thing is that there are no bodies. That's what's really puzzling. There are no dead bees, there are just - bees are gone. SEABROOK: This is May Berenbaum, the head of etymology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Berenbaum says the scientific community is scrambling to figure out what's going on here. So far, there are lots of ideas. Could be mites or other parasites, a virus or a new stress of some kind. Many blame pesticides. Beekeeper Jim Done(ph) of Hamlin, New York, does. He lost more than half his bees this winter. That's thousands of colonies and hundreds of thousands of dollars. Done blames a pesticide called GAUCHO because it's known to cause disorientation in insects. Mr. JIM DONE (Beekeeper): And that would lead me to believe that these bees are flying off and just are not able to come back to those hives to find where they belong, and bees are social insects and they die on their own. SEABROOK: And there's more adding to the problems of commercial bees, for example, as scientist Berenbaum puts it. . . Prof. BERENBAUM: Bees are living in 19th century housing, comparable to dairy barns without electricity and running water. SEABROOK: Remember that little white beehive sitting up on the dais? That was invented by a Philadelphia minister in the mid-19th century, says Berenbaum, and it's still the standard. It may compound the problem because it forces bees to live so packed together. Her calls for increased federal funding for honeybee research were echoed loudly by the beekeepers here today. And all the scientists and farmers tried to drive home one thing for these congressmen: the size of this problem. It's not just the honey industry we're talking about here, though it is getting hit hard too. It's practically the whole of American agriculture. Think about what you had for breakfast this morning - cereal? Fruit? A bagel? Most orchards, fields of grain and vegetable crops are pollinated by honeybees. Even the milk you pour in your cereal comes from cows that eat grain. If honeybee populations continue to disappear in such huge numbers, today's witnesses said, it could have a dramatic effect on crop yields and ultimately the nation's food supply.

Five beekeepers and farmers from all over the country sit in front of the committee, and each one has a story like this one, from David Ellison(ph) of Ortonville, Montana. Ellison just took a census of each of his roughly 2,000 bee colonies.  Mr. DAVID ELLISON (Beekeeper): You'd open the hive, there was honey in the hive, frames of honey, there was no bees at all. And there was pollen in there, maybe a little bit of patch or brood that the bees just up and said well, we're out of here. There's some wrong with it. We're gone.  Professor MAY BERENBAUM (Etymology, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign): The really mystifying thing is that there are no bodies. That's what's really puzzling. There are no dead bees, there are just - bees are gone.  SEABROOK: This is May Berenbaum, the head of etymology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Berenbaum says the scientific community is scrambling to figure out what's going on here. So far, there are lots of ideas. Could be mites or other parasites, a virus or a new stress of some kind. Many blame pesticides. Beekeeper Jim Done(ph) of Hamlin, New York, does. He lost more than half his bees this winter. That's thousands of colonies and hundreds of thousands of dollars. Done blames a pesticide called GAUCHO because it's known to cause disorientation in insects.  Mr. JIM DONE (Beekeeper): And that would lead me to believe that these bees are flying off and just are not able to come back to those hives to find where they belong, and bees are social insects and they die on their own.  SEABROOK: And there's more adding to the problems of commercial bees, for example, as scientist Berenbaum puts it. . .  Prof. BERENBAUM: Bees are living in 19th century housing, comparable to dairy barns without electricity and running water.  SEABROOK: Remember that little white beehive sitting up on the dais? That was invented by a Philadelphia minister in the mid-19th century, says Berenbaum, and it's still the standard. It may compound the problem because it forces bees to live so packed together.  Her calls for increased federal funding for honeybee research were echoed loudly by the beekeepers here today. And all the scientists and farmers tried to drive home one thing for these congressmen: the size of this problem. It's not just the honey industry we're talking about here, though it is getting hit hard too. It's practically the whole of American agriculture.  Think about what you had for breakfast this morning - cereal? Fruit? A bagel? Most orchards, fields of grain and vegetable crops are pollinated by honeybees. Even the milk you pour in your cereal comes from cows that eat grain. If honeybee populations continue to disappear in such huge numbers, today's witnesses said, it could have a dramatic effect on crop yields and ultimately the nation's food supply.

It's more than just unremitting sadness. To be classified as depressed, patients also have to have several other symptoms. For example, a change in appetite, trouble concentrating, or problems making decisions. There's a bereavement exclusion for people who otherwise meet the definition but have just lost a loved one since they may just be responding normally to a loss. Now several mental health experts are suggesting that people who have just gone through other life problems, such as losing a job, should also not be categorized as depressed if it looks like their symptoms will be temporary. Joining us is psychiatrist Dr. Michael First of Columbia University. He's the editor of the major handbook for psychiatrists, \"The DSM-IV. \" He's also co-author of a new study of depression. Dr. First, thanks for being with us. Dr. MICHAEL FIRST (Psychiatry, Columbia University) Thank you for having me. NORRIS: Let's begin by talking about this survey of people with depression. What did you see in terms of looking at people who had experienced a stressful event as opposed to people who are, say, clinically depressed? Dr. FIRST: Well, the way the study was done, it was actually done in a community sample. It was a reanalysis of a study done in the early 1990s called \"The National Co-Morbidity Study. \" And we took the opportunity of the study to examine a question which has been plaguing the DSM for a number of years: Should the bereavement exclusion extend to other types of losses? For some people a very messy divorce or loss of a job suddenly, those can be just as traumatic as the loss of a loved one. NORRIS: And when you say temporary, what do you mean by that? Two months, three months, six months, a year? Dr. FIRST: Well, the rule we used was is that the depression had to last less than two months and be relatively mild. For instance, it would not include symptoms such as suicidal ideation or severe slowing down in the way you talk. So it's a mild version of depression that occurred following a loss such as divorce and other things like that. NORRIS: So, based on your findings, how many people do you think are currently diagnosed with depression but are really just suffering a normal reaction to a big loss? Dr. FIRST: Well, the study didn't conclude for sure since we have no gold standard for what clinical depression actually is. But we were able to demonstrate is the 25 percent of people who were diagnosed with major depressive disorder in the study looked just like the people who we would consider have normal grief. So it really raises questions about whether or not these individuals should be considered normal in the same way someone who has normal grief would be considered normal. NORRIS: And beyond the questions about diagnosis, are there also questions about treatment? Dr. FIRST: Well, certainly when a clinician makes a decision about whether to use psychotherapy or medication or some combination, the severity of the symptoms play an important role. And certainly if someone is felt to have a normal reaction to the loss of a loved one or a stressful situation, probably the clinician would err on the side of being less aggressive with respect to treatment. Now it's always up to the patient, I mean there are studies that actually show that any depressant medication when given to people with so-called normal grief can have some relief of symptoms. So I would conclude from the study that individuals with normal sadness might not benefit for medication. But they certainly shouldn't be put in the same bucket as people with regular clinical depression. NORRIS: What is the harm or the danger if that happens, so if they are as you say, put in the same bucket? Dr. FIRST: There's a couple of issues. One is that medications have side effects. And when someone is suffering from depression, they have to weigh the benefits of the medication against the side effects. And so it might give you more pause to put up with the potential of severe side effects if in fact you're really treating a normal depression. And I guess another possible implication is the issue of stigma. Someone is labeled as having clinical depression when in fact it's really just normal sadness, then it might make that person feel like there's something wrong with them that may not be actually the case. NORRIS: Are there implications here not just for those who treat people with depression but for those who live with them and experience this along with them who might advice people to seek help if they think they're actually going through a depression? Dr. FIRST: One of the big implications of the study is the issue of screening. Right now, there is a big push to do very quick screening tools to try to identify people with depression. And what those screening tools generally do is they just focus on the count of symptoms. And I think the study indicates that's just focusing on symptoms without looking at whether or not it's related to a difficult life event may end up labeling people as having depression who might not actually need treatments. So, I think this might give one pause to just simply handing out those kinds of screening tools without taking more care to make sure that the context in which the symptoms have developed are considered.

Joining us now from our bureau in New York City is Phil Klein, co-owner of Whiskers Holistic Pet Care in New York, an expert in the field of homemade pet cuisine, and Phil, nice to have you on the program today. Mr. PHIL KLEIN (Co-owner, Whiskers Holistic Pet Care; Expert in Homemade Pet Food): Thank you very much for inviting us. CONAN: And what is holistic pet care? How does it work? Mr. KLEIN: Well, it is just about the opposite of everything you've heard learned, read or were told by a traditional veterinarian. When we deal with an animal, we try to see the entire scope of the animal as well as the individual problem that may exist or present, and we look at the physical, the emotional, the metabolic, the nutritional, all the aspects that we can and correct them that way. CONAN: And I assume this pet food recall has probably been pretty good for business. Mr. KLEIN: Well yes it has, but we're not real happy about it. We've been doing this for 18 years or so, and we've been screaming this scream, and I have the image of what's-his-name, the screamer, you know, with the hands alongside the head. CONAN: Oh, Edvard Munch's \"The Scream,\" yes. Mr. KLEIN: Thank you, yes, I appreciate that. Thank you. And we've been screaming about this for lo these many years and swimming upstream like the salmon, but it takes tragedy to produce consciousness, unfortunately. CONAN: Yeah, obviously this has been a terrible situation for a lot of pet owners, but I guess there's a certain impulse to say - see, we told you. Mr. KLEIN: There is that, but the professional in me tries to restrain that very tightly. CONAN: So when you're talking about making pet food for your pet, what do you make, typically? Mr. KLEIN: Okay, here's a recipe. As a matter of fact, as we speak, my chef is currently walloping the pots subsequent to having cooked 50 pounds of turkey, 18 heads of cauliflower and broccoli, and maybe a bunch of two or carrots shredded in. CONAN: That seems like an awful lot of vegetable. Mr. KLEIN: It is. We're looking at about 20 to 30 percent vegetable. We try and keep the carb percentage very low, like in the five percentile, and mostly good quality protein. CONAN: And where do you get the turkey, for example? Mr. KLEIN: Well, I'll be happy to - wait a minute, I'll pull out my wallet and we'll give you the exact location. They're wonderful people. I drive pretty much 90 miles roundtrip to go to Raleigh's Poultry Farm(ph) in King's Park, New York, where I get all my organic ingredients, and I got this - let me see. I was just there the day before yesterday, no I'm sorry, April 3, and on April 3, well you see, this is for production level. For individuals, nobody's going to do this. CONAN: And that may be a little too far to drive for our listeners in California, for example. Mr. KLEIN: I agree, but you do have resources. You can go to a local stand-alone butcher shop, if you have any in your neighborhood, because I find that they produce and must present a much higher quality than the junk that's hidden under a little cardboard pan in a supermarket. CONAN: Yet we're always told to feed our pets pet food. How come? Mr. KLEIN: Well, let me ask you a question. I'm sure that you're very, very aware, and I'm sure this enlightened audience is very aware of the Egyptian hieroglyphs on the pyramids in which are depicted dogs and cats of that era. Okay? So we know that dogs and cats are at least 3,500 years old and have not changed materially in basic format since then, correct? Okay, who cooked kibble for dogs for the pharaoh? CONAN: I didn't see any checkerboard patterns on any of the obelisks. Mr. KLEIN: Okay, my next thing is - our paradigm truly - at Whiskers Holistic Pet Care, our paradigm is how did the dog or cat live in the wild 150 years ago, very specifically in that timeframe. That was before we screwed up our soil so badly so that the nutrients in the ingredients that the dogs and the cats ate in the wild were much more dense than they are, currently. Be that as it may, if you go into those woods, you find me the trees in which live the Keebler elves cooking kibble, or find me a can opener hanging from a bush. CONAN: The Keebler elves cooked up pecan sandies. We're not going to get on their bad side. They're all right. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. KLEIN: No, no, no, they're good - I love them, too, but they don't make dog food. CONAN: No they don't. Mr. KLEIN: And it is not an appropriate nutritional stream to put into an animal whose basic system design is predicated on high volumes of meat with very low volumes of carbohydrate. CONAN: Well, let's just say that we're talking with Phil Klein, co-owner of Whisker's Holistic Pet Care in New York City, and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And let's see if we can get some listeners in on the conversation. Let's go first to George, George with us from Salt Lake City. Hi. GEORGE (Caller): Thank you. I've gone off of this. We had actually gone with our dog for probably about a year - I had a couple dogs at the time - where we were doing what they called the raw diet or BARF. It doesn't sound very attractive when you call it BARF, but\u2026 CONAN: No, certainly, but it's not to be appetizing to me. GEORGE: You take, you know, raw products, ground-up egg shells and all kinds of vegetables, nutrients, raw chicken with the bone, grind them up with a grinder, and you create their diet, and I try to do it for three or four ahead of the time and freeze them, but it gets so labor intensive. CONAN: Yeah. GEORGE: I will say with what he's talking about and with the raw diet, what goes in comes out, and there's a lot less waste in the yard, and the waste goes away faster, but\u2026 Mr. KLEIN: And it doesn't smell as bad. Excuse me for interrupting, but tell the truth. It doesn't smell as bad, does it? GEORGE: No, no, no. Mr. KLEIN: Not at all. GEORGE: It disappears faster. It goes from what you see to a white powder almost within three or four days. CONAN: But let me follow up on that labor-intensive part. Phil Klein, a lot of people really don't - it's hard enough to find time in their day to cook for their children, much less for their pets. Mr. KLEIN: I completely understand that. There are - at present, we represent 15 or 18 manufacturers of raw food diets that are drag and drop, as it were, plug and play. They come in little nuggets. GEORGE: I tried those, too. Those are very expensive, also, and the (unintelligible) on that, they're hard to find, so\u2026 Mr. KLEIN: Let me give you what I've come to very all these years and sir, George is it? GEORGE: Yes. Mr. KLEIN: You may want to consider this one. I think that I've come to a split that really takes into consideration the vast majority of things that will occur in the life of an animal-owning home, which is - and I apologize for the word own, I mean an animal-caring home - which is 50 percent raw, 45 percent can, five percent dry. I know that may be shocking, but there are good-quality canned foods out these despite this most recent hoorah. GEORGE: That was what I was going to make. We have found a couple quality cans out there that I actually went yesterday and picked up a month's supply, $83 for my one dog. But I talked to the lady that owned the store. I said I'll bet you people that were laughing at me and some of the others that were buying this expensive dog food are probably\u2026 CONAN: Not laughing any more. George, thanks very much for the call, and good luck with it. GEORGE: Thank you. CONAN: We just have a minute or so left, but Phil Klein, if people wanted to find out more information about this, where might they go? Mr. KLEIN: They can call us at 1-800-WHISKERS, W-H-I-S-K-E-R-S, or they can go online to the Web site at 1800whiskers. com, and if you have an immediate need, you can call us. The phone number is 212-979-2532, or 1-800-WHISKERS is the fast, easy way to do it and no cost, and we'll be happy to chat with you and devise something specific for your animal. CONAN: And just - well, thanks very much for that, and I'm sure you'll be getting a few calls in the next couple of hours. Mr. KLEIN: Well, I certainly hope we can help folks out there. That's what we've been doing, and that's our mission. CONAN: All right, we'll put those numbers up on our Web site again, on our blog at npr. org. /blogofthenation.

Those are very expensive, also, and the (unintelligible) on that, they're hard to find, so\u2026  Mr. KLEIN: Let me give you what I've come to very all these years and sir, George is it?  GEORGE: Yes.  Mr. KLEIN: You may want to consider this one. I think that I've come to a split that really takes into consideration the vast majority of things that will occur in the life of an animal-owning home, which is - and I apologize for the word own, I mean an animal-caring home - which is 50 percent raw, 45 percent can, five percent dry. I know that may be shocking, but there are good-quality canned foods out these despite this most recent hoorah.  GEORGE: That was what I was going to make. We have found a couple quality cans out there that I actually went yesterday and picked up a month's supply, $83 for my one dog. But I talked to the lady that owned the store. I said I'll bet you people that were laughing at me and some of the others that were buying this expensive dog food are probably\u2026  CONAN: Not laughing any more. George, thanks very much for the call, and good luck with it.  GEORGE: Thank you.  CONAN: We just have a minute or so left, but Phil Klein, if people wanted to find out more information about this, where might they go?  Mr. KLEIN: They can call us at 1-800-WHISKERS, W-H-I-S-K-E-R-S, or they can go online to the Web site at 1800whiskers. com, and if you have an immediate need, you can call us. The phone number is 212-979-2532, or 1-800-WHISKERS is the fast, easy way to do it and no cost, and we'll be happy to chat with you and devise something specific for your animal.  CONAN: And just - well, thanks very much for that, and I'm sure you'll be getting a few calls in the next couple of hours.  Mr. KLEIN: Well, I certainly hope we can help folks out there. That's what we've been doing, and that's our mission.  CONAN: All right, we'll put those numbers up on our Web site again, on our blog at npr. org. /blogofthenation. Phil Klein, thanks very much for being with us.  Mr. KLEIN: Thank you very much.  CONAN: Phil Klein is co-owner of Whiskers in New York City, and he joined us from our bureau in New York City.

I'm Alex Chadwick. We're doomed, dear listeners, but you knew that. Everyone is going to die someday. The question is what if you knew the day? That's becoming increasingly possible because of developments in genetic science. Ron Bailey writes about this is Reason magazine, where he's science correspondent. Ron Bailey, welcome to DAY TO DAY. Mr. RONALD BAILEY (Science Correspondent, Reason Magazine): Delighted to be with you. CHADWICK: You say that more than half of us are going to die of heart disease or cancer, we already know that from actuarial tables, but that genetic testing can narrow our life expectancy down quite a bit, can really tell us a lot more. What do you mean? Mr. BAILEY: Well basically, what we're going to be able to find out in the future is how our genes are going to affect our longevity. Already, of course, there are some genetic tests out there that do tell people what sorts of diseases they're likely to get, but in the future what's going to happen is the genetic scientists are going to be able to come up with suites of genes called haplotypes that either have health-promoting or health-harming affects. And you can imagine at some point, say 10 years in the future, you go in to your doctor, he gives you a test, and it screens all your genes and says well, fortunately you have a haplotype that says that you won't get deep-vein thrombosis, but you unfortunately have the haplotype that says you're going to have kidney cancer or diabetes, and from that we can calculate that you have this many years left to live. CHADWICK: We already have genetic markers that say you are more likely to develop, you know, Disease X, maybe three times more likely or two times more likely, but it doesn't say it's going to happen. You sound as though doctors are going to be saying it will happen. Mr. BAILEY: Well yes, it won't be that precise, but it'll get a lot closer than the current averages that we have in life expectancy. Again, the idea here is that you're going to screen all your genes for various haplotypes, and then you would sum up the probabilities of all those genes interacting to come up with a much closer figure to when it is that you're likely to die. CHADWICK: You know, your article in Reason reviews what we know and then goes on to a conclusion that is an editorial conclusion of your own, which is it's good to actually know this information. If you knew the exact moment when you were going to die, this would be good for you to know. Now how is that? Mr. BAILEY: For me, personally, it would be quite good, and I think that most people, it would be good for them, because it would help focus your mind on what it is you want to accomplish over the time that you have left. For example, if you were to discover that you were going to die of some horrible disease in your 40s or something, when you were in your 20s, you might decide, well, I really don't need to go to law school or get that MBA or spend 10 years getting a Ph. D. in molecular biology. Maybe I'll, you know, chuck it all and become a Caribbean sailing captain for the time I have left. Knowing this kind of information is not all about just treating diseases or figuring out what therapies you should be taking access to. It's about arranging what the remainder of your life is, and unfortunately, physicians very often, I find, think that you shouldn't have this information because maybe there's nothing they can do for you or the treatments are not very good. But again, this kind of information will help you decide what to do with the time that you have left. CHADWICK: But isn't a better life philosophy to simply do what you feel is correct for yourself every day and don't worry about that deadline? I mean really, you could get hit by a bus tomorrow, so if you're supposed to be a sailing captain or you're supposed to be a molecular geneticist, pursue what your heart desires. Mr. BAILEY: Of course you should pursue what your heart desires, but with more information, you'll be able, I suspect, to figure out more closely what it is that your heart really desires. CHADWICK: You conclude this article by saying well, here's my date. I figured this all out, and you note that you've gone through a lot of tests. It's September 4, 2027. I think this is something you wrote in as a stunt, but maybe you think actually you can add up all the data that you have and come to a good date for yourself. Mr. BAILEY: No, I have to confess that what I do is there's a Web site called the death clock that you can go to. It's a stunt, basically. All it asks you is a birth date and a couple of other little questions, and it says this is it. I actually hope that that's not it because my actuarial tables give me at least another five years beyond that. CHADWICK: They do? So you should probably survive until 2032, thereabouts. Mr. BAILEY: Thereabouts. That's what - I'm actually hoping to do better than that because I - as I made clear in the article, I take advantage of modern medicine as much as possible to be able to figure out what might be going wrong with me so I can prevent it before it happens. CHADWICK: How old are you now? May I ask? Mr. BAILEY: I am 53 years old. CHADWICK: Fifty-three, so you expect to get into, you know late 70s, anyway. Mr. BAILEY: Well, that would be what the actuarial tables already predict for someone my age. CHADWICK: Let me get back to the philosophy questions that are here. Suppose you knew that your actual date was going to be 2020, sometime in 2020, it was going to be years earlier than you hoped for. You're living the life that you presumably want to live now. Would that make any difference? I mean, would you stop writing about science? Would you stop being a journalist? Would you\u2026? Mr. BAILEY: No, but several book projects that I have in the back of my mind would come forward, and I would start working on those more, and also I would probably take a lot more trips because one of the great joys of life for me is to travel the world, and so I would probably make sure that I did more of that in that period of time than I would otherwise be doing. So no, I wouldn't change my career. I love my career, but I would in fact speed up some things that am now putting more or less on the back burner. CHADWICK: Don't you know some people who have considered this question say no, you shouldn't go look for these genetic markers that may be in yourself if there's a certainty that they might mean your end earlier than you would like because having that knowledge isn't going to help you. Mr. BAILEY:  Well, they're wrong. It would help me. It would change the shape of my life. The one way to think about it is is that you already think you're on a certain trajectory. If it turns out the trajectory is wrong, then you will change the trajectory and get to certain goals sooner than you might otherwise have done so. Again, it may not work for everybody, but the main thing for me is that I do not want to be denied access to that information should it become available. Other people's mileage may vary.

Humans are roughly the same size. That's true of most species. There's not a huge difference between the biggest and the smallest. One exception is the dog. There are very big dogs and teeny, tiny dogs. Scientists have been taking canine cheek swabs to find out why. Their report appears today in the journal Science. NPR's David Kestenbaum reports. DAVID KESTENBAUM: Domestic dogs are the offspring of the offspring of the offspring thousands of years ago of gray wolves. But while there are lots of kinds of wolves, they're all, ballpark, the same size. So why are dogs different? What's the largest dog you've ever seen? Mr. NATHAN SUTTER (Geneticist, National Institutes of Health): An Irish wolfhound named Merlin who won at Westminster. He's enormous. He's a size of a horse. KESTENBAUM: This is Nathan Sutter, a geneticist at the National Institutes of Health. And the smallest dog you've ever seen? Mr. SUTTER: Frenchie might take the cake, a Chihuahua that we photographed last Sunday. She's two pounds as an adult, and she's not going to get any bigger. KESTENBAUM: Merlin is some 80 times heavier than little Frenchie, relatively speaking, like a human being 50 feet tall. To find out how the dog genome generates such large and small animals, Sutter and other researchers studied the Portuguese water dog. Ms. ELAINE OSTRANDER (Researcher, National Institutes of Health): They were actually used by the fishermen to send messages between boats. KESTENBAUM: Elaine Ostrander runs the genetics lab at the NIH that did some of the analysis. Ms. OSTRANDER: They would herd the fish into the nets. They could retrieve fish or articles from the water, and they were also used to guard the fishing boats, and they could be used to help in bring in the nets. KESTENBAUM: There are big ones and small ones. Most dogs bred for competition these days have to fall into narrow size ranges. But the rules for Portuguese water dogs happen to be looser. The researchers analyzed Portuguese water dog DNA and found a single gene, what Ostrander calls a master regulator, that seems to account for a big part of the size difference. Small Portuguese water dogs had one version; larger Portuguese water dogs, different versions. But, you know, maybe that was just the Portuguese water dog. So for two years, the researchers went to dog shows - anywhere there were dogs, really - to collect dog DNA. Owners were very helpful, said things like: test my dog, my dog wants to be part of your study. The researchers took blood samples from Chihuahuas, Pekingese, Mastiffs, Great Danes, lots of blood samples and cheek swabs. Dogs happy to offer a cheek swab? Ms. OSTRANDER: You know what, they didn't care. Especially if they were going to get a treat or there was a tennis ball in our other hand. KESTENBAUM: The results came in, and just as with the Portuguese water dogs, the small breeds. . . (Soundbite of yelping dog) KESTENBAUM: had one variant of the gene. Big dogs. . . (Soundbite of growling dog) KESTENBAUM: Had different variants. Ostrander says it's surprising that a single gene plays such a prominent role in so many dogs. Ms. OSTRANDER: Because when you look at the different dog breeds, and you look at their histories and they've come from all over the world and they've been bred to do such different things, I mean, there's herding dogs and there's draft dogs, and there's hunting dogs and there's sight hounds, and there's scent hounds and there's these tiny little companion dogs, and there's racing dogs and there's these great, big, huge dogs. It just seemed to us that the story had to be more complex. KESTENBAUM: But it wasn't. So you have to wonder why and when did these variants evolve. You can see why big dogs might thrive, but what evolutionary force made it beneficial to be tiny? One possibility is that evolutionary force was us. There's no evidence that wolves had the genetic variant for smallness. So maybe when humans started to domesticate dogs a bit of DNA didn't get copied right. And a small dog appeared in a litter, we kept it, protected it, bred it, maybe we thought it was cute, or more likely useful. Mr. PAUL JONES (Waltham Pet Center): We really, really don't know. There's lots of theories. KESTENBAUM: This is Paul Jones from the Waltham Pet Center in England who worked on the project. Mr. JONES: I think it was just a very, very lucky event. And it was probably lucky for man as well, because when you think about humans when they actually first started farming barley, wheat, and everything like that, they actually started gathering those food stores together. As you probably know, you need to protect those food stores from mice and from rats. And the ideal dog to do that is a small terrier-like dog. KESTENBAUM: Why couldn't we have big dogs protecting our food? Mr. JONES: We could have big dogs protecting our food, but they're not quite as good ratters. KESTENBAUM: Jones hopes the study of dog genomes may lead to healthier pets. Dog may be man's best friend, but there's the sad truth that man can live 80 years, dogs, maybe 15.

NPR's Joe Palca. Joe, good morning. JOE PALCA: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: I think you've got the hardest job on the program this morning, explaining what these people are talking about. Can I start with a really basic question? Just remind us, what is a stem cell line? PALCA: Well, that's a good question, actually. Let's start talking about embryonic stem cell lines, since that's what the fiery part of the debate is all about. So an embryonic stem cell line is when you take a human embryo that's being created in a laboratory - using in vitro fertilization, typically - and you remove some cells from it at a very early stage, making it no longer capable of turning into a baby because you've now essentially destroyed it for those purposes; but you can take these cells from the embryo and get them to start growing. And they grow and they grow and they grow, and they become a colony of what's called embryonic stem cells. And they can keep making more copies of themselves and more copies and more copies, and that becomes a line of cells. And what you can do with that is you can essentially grow them forever. And the beauty part that scientists say is that you can then, by giving them certain signals, get them to turn into any cell type in the body. So if you want them to become a nerve cell, you give them a certain set of chemicals and they become nerve cells. That's the theory, anyway. And it's those cells that you've derived from these embryonic stem cells that might be used for treating diseases. INSKEEP: So we know what a stem cell line is or an embryonic stem cell line is. We know why people are interested in them - scientists and doctors and many other people. What is wrong with the embryonic stem cell lines that are already available for research? Because President Bush did allow some at the time that he restricted federal funding. PALCA: Yes, that's the interesting part. President Bush said - when he took office, he put the whole plans for the federal government to fund the embryonic stem cell research on hold; he said, I want to think about this. But on August 9th, he said okay, I'm going to let funds be available for embryonic stem cell lines that were created before August 9th, 2001, which was the day he made his decision. And so the reason that those cell lines are thought to be inadequate is, basically, it was only three years after the first reports of being able to do this at all. And, you know, like anything, the first attempts at doing it tend to be a little clunky. And so the cells, the first cells were grown with chemicals and various products along with them that made sense at the time because nobody knew really how to do it. But now, it's thought that they were done improperly and that it would make more sense to derive these in a different way. And so that's basically why the science has moved on even though the federal funding hasn't expanded. INSKEEP: Now let's talk about alternatives here, try to understand them, anyway. Opponents of embryonic stem cell research who say that their religious beliefs, or other beliefs, lead them to say that this is a taking of the human life have promoted the use of adult stem cells for research. Are there real possibilities there? PALCA: Oh, absolutely. I mean, they are 100 percent right. The only successful stem cell therapies that are currently in existence have been using adults themselves. These are bone stem cells that are derived from bone marrow. And I'm sure people heard of bone marrow transplants for curing various blood cancers and other blood diseases. So yes, there is a tremendous amount of promise and potential for studying the so-called adult cells. The difference between these adult cells and the embryonic stem cells is that the adult cells are typically more limited, so that the cells you get from the bone marrow typically can only make more blood cells. And if you have a skin stem cell, that can only make more skin cells, although there are some fluctuation around that that maybe they are more potent. But the point is that embryonic stem cells can make any cells. So if you're having trouble finding a brain stem cell, for example, which people have a hard time finding - they're not very easy to get your hands on -if you have already embryonic stem cells, you could make brain cells. That's the difference. INSKEEP: Basic explanation of what they are arguing about in Congress from NPR's Joe Palca. And Joe, before you go, one other quick question: Is this whole debate in Congress becoming less relevant because states like California are going ahead in spending billions of dollars of their own on this research? PALCA: Well, you know, in a sense I suppose it is because that is a large chunk of change for research that California and New York and Connecticut and New Jersey and Massachusetts, I mean, a lot states are getting involved. But I think the problem is that you don't want to organize a national campaign, a research campaign with every state doing its own thing so that California may be copying what's going on in New Jersey and it may be just a mess. And so it's easier to have central coordination. INSKEEP: Joe, thanks very much. PALCA: You're welcome. INSKEEP: Very clear. NPR science correspondent Joe Palca.  STEVE INSKEEP, host:  Let's try to explain some of the science behind the politics of stem cells, or rather turn to someone who can explain the science behind the politics. NPR's Joe Palca.  Joe, good morning.  JOE PALCA: Good morning, Steve.  INSKEEP: I think you've got the hardest job on the program this morning, explaining what these people are talking about. Can I start with a really basic question? Just remind us, what is a stem cell line?  PALCA: Well, that's a good question, actually. Let's start talking about embryonic stem cell lines, since that's what the fiery part of the debate is all about.  So an embryonic stem cell line is when you take a human embryo that's being created in a laboratory - using in vitro fertilization, typically - and you remove some cells from it at a very early stage, making it no longer capable of turning into a baby because you've now essentially destroyed it for those purposes; but you can take these cells from the embryo and get them to start growing. And they grow and they grow and they grow, and they become a colony of what's called embryonic stem cells. And they can keep making more copies of themselves and more copies and more copies, and that becomes a line of cells. And what you can do with that is you can essentially grow them forever.  And the beauty part that scientists say is that you can then, by giving them certain signals, get them to turn into any cell type in the body. So if you want them to become a nerve cell, you give them a certain set of chemicals and they become nerve cells. That's the theory, anyway. And it's those cells that you've derived from these embryonic stem cells that might be used for treating diseases.  INSKEEP: So we know what a stem cell line is or an embryonic stem cell line is. We know why people are interested in them - scientists and doctors and many other people. What is wrong with the embryonic stem cell lines that are already available for research? Because President Bush did allow some at the time that he restricted federal funding.  PALCA: Yes, that's the interesting part.

I'm Ira Flatow. This hour we're going to be talking about science on the stage and talking about two very different plays, but sort of connected by a theme about monkeys. And first we're going to talk about The Ensemble Studio Theatre's presentation of a new play called \"Serendib. \" Let me just tell you a little bit about The Ensemble Studio Theatre. They present their First Light Festival, and it's a festival all about science and scientists, and the centerpiece this year is this play called \"Serendib,\" not Serendip with a P on the end; \"Serendib. \" But they're connectible. We'll get into that a little bit later. And it's a comedy based on the playwright's experience working with a team of primatologists observing monkeys in the wild. And when this happened, he came back and said, gee, I should write a play about this. Let me introduce the playwright, David Zellnik. Mr. DAVID ZELLNIK (Playwright, \"Serendib\"): Hi, there. FLATOW: Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Mr. ZELLNIK: Thank you. FLATOW: And with him is Dr. Don Melnick, because he's important. When playwrights write plays and they do them about science, you want to have somebody to look at the science of the play and say, gee, is that close to home? Does that have anything to do with what goes on in the real world? And someone who really knows about that is Dr. Don Melnick. He's the Thomas Hunt Morgan professor of conservation biology at Columbia University. He and his wife, primatologist Mary Pearl, were science advisors to Mr. Zellnik and \"Serendib. \" Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Dr. DON MELNICK (Columbia University): Thank you. FLATOW: Tell us about this play, David. Mr. ZELLNIK: OK. FLATOW: How did you stumble on the idea? Mr. ZELLNIK: It's serendipitous indeed. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ZELLNIK: I - a few years ago, in 2004, I had a little extra time, and I had a little extra money, and I wanted an adventure. And a friend suggested I log-on to EarthWatch. org and see what kind of studies they had people participating in. Basically you pay an amount of money and you get to work with scientists or conservationists. And so I chose Sri Lanka. It's always fascinated me, and the civil war was in a ceasefire then. And I've always been fascinated by monkeys, so I got to indulge my sort of Jane Goodall fantasies. FLATOW: And what they were doing there? What were you observing? Mr. ZELLNIK: They are - Dr. Wolfgang Dittus and his team has been observing Toque Macaques in Polonnaruwa, which is an ancient capital of Sri Lanka, for - it's about 40 years now, I think. Dr. MELNICK: Yeah, next year it'll be 40 years. FLATOW: It'll be 40 years. Mr. ZELLNIK: And they track 20 to 30 troops of Toque Macaques in the site, and you know, tell their stories and track, you know, if they're expanding their territory or what the genealogies of the monkeys are and. . . FLATOW: Well, what made you decide to write a play about what was going on there and. . . Mr. ZELLNIK: Well, a few things. I was overwhelmed with the place. It's a really magical place. There's all these overlapping layers of wonderment there. They're historical ruins and there's the sense of history there, and then there is the science study and the scientists observing monkeys, and then there are these monkeys living very much in their wild state there, which is different than how the monkeys in the cities of Sri Lanka live, and it was just magnificent. FLATOW: And you chose to concentrate on a couple of different themes in the play. Mr. ZELLNIK: Mm-hmm. FLATOW: One theme was how the scientists almost - they make a monkey out of the scientists. Scientists actually start behaving like the monkeys they're observing. Mr. ZELLNIK: Well, I'm definitely hoping that instead of a one-to-one ratio between scientists and monkeys, there's a sort of creative tension of how much are the monkeys and the scientists alike. I do have the monkeys played by the scientists, using puppets, and each scientist plays the monkey that is perhaps closest to him or herself in status within a troop. But there's definitely differences, and there's many ways humans are like monkeys, and many ways we're not. And so by having one actor play both, I'm hoping to maybe explore and open up questions about how much we are alike and we're not. FLATOW: And you also talk about the friction within science between scientists and critical of each other's work. Mr. ZELLNIK: I definitely have observed that. There's - the site is sort of cut off from the rest of the city, this monkey camp, so it's definitely sort of a hothouse of conflict and discussion, and it's really exciting to be in the presence of that. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. You bring up a very important issue about whether these scientists who are observing the monkeys are actually doing real science or not. You bring in a Russian competitor to the science who's observing. Mr. ZELLNIK: Right. FLATOW: And he says this is not laboratory stuff. You can't make any real conclusions just by watching monkeys. Mr. ZELLNIK: Well, I do think there is a question of how soft the science is with long-term observation. It's not repeatable. The data is all filtered through a human writing down what he or she sees. And I think the world is a much richer place for the observational science of the past few generations -the Jane Goodalls and the Dian Fosseys - but it definitely is very anecdotal. It's a lot about specific animals you see and how you interpret what they've done or how they're behaving FLATOW: Mm-hmm, Dr. Melnick, what do you think of the play, I mean in terms of accuracy, and what was your role exactly ensuring that it was close\u2026 Dr. MELNICK: It's actually - giving another example of serendipity, I had actually worked in Polonnaruwa 20 years before David arrived there, and I worked there on a number of occasions in the 1980s. It's an extraordinary place from a scientific point of view, because it is by far the longest-running continuous observational study of primates. It'll be 40 years next year. It's an extraordinary accomplishment to be able to run a project like that for 40 years. The one thing I would possibly take exception what David is saying is that, yes, it is a question of your doing individual observations of each animal, but when you spread it out over 40 years and over 30 groups and you individually identify every single monkey, and you're collecting data on many of them from the day they were born until the day they died, you have a collection - you might say it's anecdotes, but a lot of people say statistic is - statistics are just a very large collection of anecdotes. You have such an enormous data set that you can begin to see patterns in that data set. It begins to approach what you would get in a very carefully controlled laboratory study, because one of the advantages of a laboratory study is the immensity of the data you can collect, but - and you could not really do that on most primates because they live a long time. But in this case, if you run a study for 40 years, you can begin to collect that kind of data and begin to see patterns. Now, to me the interesting - obviously the interesting tension there is one scientist, or set of scientists, who believes that, you know, much of what happens in terms of dominance arch and who's dominant and who is not is contextual, it's sort of nature, it's the environment you're in and the interactions you have, and another coming in and saying, no, you know, basically giving a presentation of the biological determinist point of view: no, there are genes in there, and that animal would have become dominant no matter what, in what environment. So there is this tension between that. But I think what David pointed out is really true. All science is done by people, and so it doesn't matter what science you're engaged in, you're going to bring a certain level of bias to what you're doing. It doesn't matter whether it's laboratory science or field science, just the questions you're asking are going to somewhat reflect that bias. But the other interesting part about field research is if you think about it, it's a disparate group of people who are suddenly put into a very small, confined space, and who are interacting with each other almost on a 24-hour basis. . . FLATOW: Right. Dr. MELNICK: . . . for month after month after month. FLATOW: And it's like a - and you say, the part of the play, it's a reality program. You bring in some TV producers who turn their research - the laboratory to a reality show. . . Mr. ZELLNIK: But yeah. . . FLATOW: . . . create the social, sexual tension that goes on there. Mr. ZELLNIK: It's interesting, because I found myself, when I was there watching both the scientists and the monkeys, so I sort of wanted to have the observers be observed. And through the documentary filmmakers who come to make a documentary about the monkeys, we get some of those themes into the play. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Reading through my notes, scribbled in the dark, it's a great play. I really enjoyed it. Mr. ZELLNIK: Thank you. FLATOW: I congratulate you. I have a quote from the play that says, if I can read my handwriting: Hot people and cool animals; that's what people like. And that's what you gave them. Mr. ZELLNIK: Well, yeah, it's cute animals, not cool animals. FLATOW: I'm sorry. Mr. ZELLNIK: It's similar. Yeah, those are - that's a rather cynical point of view from the documentary filmmaker, but I think the environmental movement has been very canny about using cute and cool animals as their sort of spokes-animals to help save the ones that maybe aren't so cute to us. FLATOW: And you made that point in the play that - one of the characters say, we need this to preserve these animals. If we don't get the public attention from the documentary we can make about the hot people and the cute animals, you're not going to get your funding or the public attention. Mr. ZELLNIK: I met a scientist there in Sri Lanka who very impassioned - a very impassioned woman - who said that scientists now can't afford to do what Dr. Dittus did 40 years ago because she said the natural world's on fire, which is a line that now is in the play. She said we all have to become activists now, we have to fight to save these species, we can't just have the luxury of sitting in the woods and watching them. And so whether that's true or not, that's definitely a point of view that threads its way through the play. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Yes, go ahead. Dr. MELNICK: I was just going to say that, again, on that theme of serendipity, that it - I had spent about 15 years of my career doing basic science research, doing basic genetic work on various species. It was actually on my way to the Polonnaruwa site that I had an experience that really transformed what I was doing and really I begin to apply my science to conservation. So it's very much so, when David used the words in one of his characters that the world is on fire, how could we just focus on just what these animals are doing instead of the larger context. We were traveling into the Polonnaruwa site on a road, and we were going down this road, and all of a sudden I - an elephant came out from this dry forest that exists in that area and just began browsing along the side - we stopped our jeep. We were bringing provisions in for months, and we stopped our jeep, we were just sitting there watching it. It was a beautiful thing to do. And these elephants are known to do - people who've watched elephants - they can just fade off into the brush almost before your eyes. And this elephant eventually did that and faded, and then we went into the - up to the camp, we worked for about three months, and we were on our way back to get more provisions, to the capital, and came to the area, and the whole area was gone. It had all been cut, burned, gone, all animals gone. And at that moment I thought, you know, I can't do this anymore. I can't just do my basic science research. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. MELNICK: There has to be an applied part of this that's dealing with habitat preservation and species preservation. Otherwise all I'm doing is bearing witness to the end. I'm not really making a contribution and not really - in some ways, all I'm doing is taking from nature for my own career, but not putting anything back in. FLATOW: Did you feel, when you were writing this play, that you had to make a statement like that, like he is saying? Or were you more interested in just a theatrical. . . Mr. ZELLNIK: I was interested - I am deeply committed to what he's talking about, but I don't think that was really my impulse in writing the play. I wanted to show people my love of these animals and the experience I had, which was to be so overwhelmed by their individuality and their soulfulness and their fierceness and their dignity as animals and sort of be true to that. . . FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. ZELLNIK: . . . and potentially make people fall in love with the animals, but on a deeper level to explore (unintelligible). FLATOW: We're going to take a short break, come back, talk lots more about the play \"Serendib. \" We'll talk about why the B's at the end a little bit with playwright David Zellnik, also with Don Melnick who was the science advisor on the play, and your calls. Our number: 1-800-989-8255. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this break. (Soundbite of music) I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking today, this hour, about \"Serendib,\" a new play by David Zellnik, who is a playwright, and you'll have until, what, April 27th, David? Mr. ZELLNIK: Twenty-second. FLATOW: Twenty-second, to catch it at The Ensemble Studio Theatre here in New York. And just in full disclosure, the Sloan Foundation has funded these plays, right? Mr. ZELLNIK: Yeah, they've been collaborating with Ensemble Studio Theatre for, I believe, nine years now, to help produce new plays about science and the intersection of science and technology and the wider world. FLATOW: They also fund SCIENCE FRIDAY, so we're grateful to them. Don Melnick is also involved in the play. He and his wife, Mary Pearl, were science advisors for \"Serendib. \" Let me take care of what I said before the break. Why you spell it \"Serendib\". . . Mr. ZELLNIK: It's interesting. . . FLATOW: . . . instead of Serendip. Mr. ZELLNIK: I'm not sure. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ZELLNIK: I saw both versions. It's a 12th century, 11th, 12th century Arabic word for Sri Lanka. FLATOW: Oh, it is. Mr. ZELLNIK: And I've seen it with both a B and a P, and it came to our language, really, through a story about these princes of Serendib who encountered so many happy accidents that the word became serendipity in our language. FLATOW: Mm-hmm, Don, what about the portrayal of the scientists. They get into fights with each other, you know, they question each other. Dr. MELNICK: Yeah, I think it. . . FLATOW: More realistic than you see in the movies. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. MELNICK: Yeah, and I think that's one of the great services that David's play provides to science in that, you know, rather than the sort of crazy, wild-eyed, Christopher Lloyd-type wacky scientist that you see come in. . . FLATOW: Central casting, the wacky guy. Dr. MELNICK: . . . and you see it repeatedly in movies coming out of Hollywood - what he does is he portrays scientists as people. They have likes, they have dislikes, some are sympathetic, some are less sympathetic. Some, you know, are extremely aggressive, others are much less so. Because scientists are, in essence, they are just people, and they have all the attributes that you find in people. And I think it's a tremendous disservice to science to somehow portray them as some sort of separate group, very nerdy. I think the cast and the people in there and the portrayal of scientists was anything but nerdy. Mr. ZELLNIK: Yeah, it's a young, sexy cast. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: It is very sexy, very - and a lot of sexual tension running through the play. Mr. ZELLNIK: Sure, and part of what fascinates me about - especially the scientists I met in Polonnaruwa is how much they love the animals and how much that. . . FLATOW: Yes. Mr. ZELLNIK: . . . that love shows through their work, so they're anything but crazy, nerdy science geeks. FLATOW: But that is one of the themes of the play, the disbelieving scientist who doesn't believe you can tell when an animal's happy. There's no objective way to measure the happiness or a love of an animal. Mr. ZELLNIK: Right, there's definitely a taboo in science, I think, of sort of projecting human emotions or thought - human thoughts - onto animals. But as I was observing the monkeys, and it seemed the other scientists, it becomes very narcissistic, I think, to pretend that monkeys and humans are not very closely related and don't have several overlapping sympathies. FLATOW: Now this is not your first play, but. . . Mr. ZELLNIK: No. FLATOW: . . . is it the first one about - with a science theme in it? . . . Mr. ZELLNIK: It is. FLATOW: . . . And did you have to think about crafting it differently if you're dealing with science? Mr. ZELLNIK: Well, I had to make sure that the science was true. . . (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ZELLNIK: . . . and that it would be compelling for a scientist who watches it, so I definitely had to do a lot of research and learn a language of speaking that is not really intuitive for me. But this play is the oddest one for me in that I went to Sri Lanka knowing I wanted to write a play set there, without knowing remotely what the play would be like. And it's been a long journey in figuring out how to put monkeys on a stage. FLATOW: And those - I was going to say those Muppets. They're not Muppets. They're not like any puppets I've seen before. They are truly unique. Mr. ZELLNIK: Yeah, I love Muppets, but we wanted to give them more dignity and more fierceness, and Emily DeCola, who created the puppets and directed the scenes, did a wonderful job of capturing these small but incredibly vibrant animals. FLATOW: And the actors were able to channel their emotions through to the puppets there. Mr. ZELLNIK: Yeah, the director, Carlos Armesto, he added an extra week of rehearsal onto the production so that we could just have a puppet workshop, because none of the actors had been trained as puppeteers, and yet the characters they played were so. . . FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. ZELLNIK: . . . the puppet work was so vital to the characters they played. FLATOW: Hi, let's go to Leslie, in West Bloomfield, Michigan. Hi, Leslie. LESLIE (Caller): Hi, how you doing? FLATOW: Hi, there. LESLIE: I guess I want to talk about one of the statements you made earlier. I have a - my brother-in-law is a scientist. He's a physicist. And quite honestly the last word I would use to describe him is hot. (Soundbite of laughter) LESLIE: It seems - no. FLATOW: I hope he's not listening. LESLIE: I doubt it. He's very much a physics geek. But a lot of scientists I know are not hot, and it seems that we like our science today delivered with a dose of sex. A lot - I have a five-year-old daughter, and we watch the, you know, the children's nature programs, and sometimes I - you know, nature on TV and things like that. And it seems to me that they look for, like, you know, someone who's really sexy or has a lot of sex appeal, you know, the, oh, gosh, gee, me, sexy-type look? And it seems that scientists are presented as kind of sexy. And quite honestly, like I said, most of the ones I know aren't. FLATOW: You're hanging around in the wrong places, I think. (Soundbite of laughter) LESLIE: Oh, I guess academia is not the place to find the scientists. FLATOW: Let me go - well, let me get a reaction from the playwright. David, did - was that purposely written in that way to make them. . . Mr. ZELLNIK: Well, I mean. . . FLATOW: . . . it seems they are very sexy and hot in the play. Mr. ZELLNIK: There's definitely sexy scientists, and I'll stand by that. FLATOW: I mean, and you know. . . LESLIE: Oh, I'm sure there are. . . Mr. ZELLNIK: Yeah, I mean - but. . . LESLIE: . . . It's just that I don't know them. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: You know, there are contests, you know. (Soundbite of laughter) LESLIE: (unintelligible) Mr. ZELLNIK: Well, I mean, there's something about a small world like this that brings out the sexuality of, you know, any small - you know, any small group of people shut off from everyone else is going to - especially if they're observing monkeys during mating season, there's going to be a lot of sex on the brain. FLATOW: Well, thanks for calling. Well, check out Neil deGrasse Tyson was voted, you know, in 2000, the sexiest scientist, I think, by. . . LESLIE: Who? FLATOW: Neil deGrasse Tyson of the Hayden Planetarium, the astronomer there. LESLIE: Well, I always had a thing for the Crocodile Hunter, so, you know. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. MELNICK: Oh. LESLIE: OK, bye. FLATOW: All right, have a good weekend. Thanks for calling 1-800-989-8255. What's the life of a play like this? It's playing to a limited audience in New York. Can it have a life outside of, you know, a really cultural town like New York City. Mr. ZELLNIK: I think it can. Definitely one of the projects after it finishes its run here is to have the EST/Sloan Foundation help with incentive grants to finance regional productions around the country. And I think in any city or town there's - there are people who will be drawn to this play or be interested in this play. I think all humans - most humans are really interested in monkeys, and so there's just a natural sympathy you see, a recognition you see when you see a monkey. FLATOW: Mm-hmm, so you think you'll be taking it on the road, or any plans to take it - or you're looking for funding for it. Mr. ZELLNIK: There's no plans right now. We would be thrilled to transfer to New York, and we would be thrilled to have a nonprofit, regional house express interest in producing a new version of their own, of it. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. MELNICK: I even suggested to David that he might consider taking it to Sri Lanka and having it performed there. Mr. ZELLNIK: I would certainly love that. FLATOW: Well, why not take it across the pond, as they say, even to Europe or places like that? Mr. ZELLNIK: Well, we should talk to the Sloan Foundation. . . (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ZELLNIK: . . . the EST and see if we can make that happen. FLATOW: Well, we have heard of plays that are very successful in Europe, science-related plays, having a little bit, you know, trouble over here, but getting treated royally over in Europe, so good luck to you. Mr. ZELLNIK: Thank you. FLATOW: It's - I highly recommend it as long as you can see it. It's still in New York here. Mr. ZELLNIK: Ah, yeah, it's running through the 22nd, and if you want tickets, you can log into theatermania. com. FLATOW: Good luck to you. Mr. ZELLNIK: Thank you. FLATOW: Thank you both for joining us. Dr. MELNICK: Thank you. FLATOW: David Zellnik, who is a playwright, \"Serendibity,\" and Dr. Don Melnick, who is a Thomas Hunt Morgan professor of conservation biology at Columbia University. Thanks, have a good weekend. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: Up now we're going to switch gears and talk about another play. \"Inherit the Wind\" - it's not the play we're going to talk about. We're just going to mention it in passing, that it is playing on Broadway once again. It was last here in 1955. I should say it started in 1955, first seen, a drama about the Scopes trial, which of course was the science of evolution was on trial. It wasn't so controversial back then as it is now in the year 2000-plus, where we've seen all kinds of trials about trials going on, but it is certainly relevant now here and interesting that it's playing in New York. Well, the L. A. Theatre Works, which is a radio and theater nonprofit organization in Los Angeles, has found that one of their plays, \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial,\" a new play that's making the rounds in the Northeast here, can actually help start the discussion again. Playwright Peter Goodchild used the actual transcripts of the Scopes trial to fashion the play, and I'm going to give you a little bit of taste of the play here in a couple of cuts we have. Here's what William Jennings Bryan, the prosecutor, who's played by Ed Asner, had to - what he really said in the trial as opposed to what you might have seen in \"Inherit the Wind. \" (Soundbite of play, \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial\") Mr. ED ASNER (Actor): (As William Jennings Bryan): They think of life as a mystery that nobody can explain, not one word about God at the back of it. They want you to let them commence there and ask no questions. They do not explain the great riddle of the universe. They do not deal with the problems of life. They do not teach the great science of how to live. FLATOW: And that was Ed Asner playing - or saying the words of William Jennings Bryan in this new play. And here is his opponent, Clarence Darrow, played by Mike Farrell. This is what he really answered. Mr. MIKE FARRELL (Actor): (As Clarence Darrow) If today you can take a thing like evolution and make it a crime to teach it in a public school, tomorrow you can make it a crime to teach in the private schools. And the next day in the hustings or in the church. The next session you may ban books and newspapers. You can do the one. You can do the other. And after a while your honor it as the setting a man against man and creed against creed until with flying banners and beating drums we are marching backward to the 16th century when bigots lighted fagots to burn the men who dared to bring any intelligence and enlightenment and learning to the human mind. FLATOW: And that is all from, \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial. \" It's touring the Northeast right now. And you can catch it at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia from April 18 to 22. And three people who are bringing \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial\" to you and to the classroom are here with us to talk about it. You know actor Ed Asner from the \"Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" his own programs and his many other appearances on TVs and film. He's a founding member of the Los Angeles - the LA Theatre Works. He joins us today from Williams College where he is playing William Jennings Bryan, the anti-evolutionist and the voice you heard in that cut. Ed, thank you for being with us today. Mr. ASNER: One monkey to another. FLATOW: Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Peter Goodchild is a playwright who adapted the Scopes Trial transcripts for the stage in \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial. \" And he's also an award-winning television producer who is former head of both the science division and the features and drama division at the BBC. And he joins us from the studios of the BBC in Exeter, England. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Mr. PETER GOODCHILD (Playwright, \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial\"): My pleasure. FLATOW: You're welcome. Susan Albert Loewenstein - Loewenberg is a founder and producing director of the L. A. Theatre Works - sorry, Susan - and \"The Great Tennessee\u2026 Ms. SUSAN ALBERT LOEWENBERG (Producing Director, \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial\"): It's all right, Ira. FLATOW: \u2026Monkey Trial. \" Susan Loewenberg joins us today from our studios at NPR West in Culver City. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Ms. LOEWENBERG: Thank you. FLATOW: Tell us, Susan, how this play got legs, so to speak. Ms. LOEWENBERG: How it got legs. Yes. Well we actually originally produced it with the BBC in 1991. And we were approached around 2003 by someone who said you ought to tour your radio show around the country. We do have a radio show called, \"The Plays the Thing,\" which is on public radio. And you should take one of your plays around. And I think people will like to see that. So we had to choose a play that we had already done. And we have a program where we give 1,500 high school teachers in 600 cities all over America plays that we've recorded that are relevant to the high school curriculum. And we had just done a survey about usage. And believe it or not \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial\" was the most utilized recording, beating out \"The Crucible\" and \"Julius Caesar\" and \"The Grapes of Wrath. \" FLATOW: Wow. Ms. LOEWENBERG: So we thought, a ha, there's something here. And when we were setting the tour for 2005 and '06. And the man who was booking us around the country at colleges and universities said, it'll be about three weeks. Well the response was so overwhelming that we ended up going out for almost 11 weeks in '05/'06. And now we are remounting because there are more requests for it. So we're doing three more weeks. And Ed has played Bryan for virtually all of it. So he gets\u2026 FLATOW: Hm-hmm. Ms. LOEWENBERG: \u2026he gets a medal. FLATOW: Well let me ask you what - let me just remind everybody that I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Do you have trouble being compared - or your performance stacking up - people stack up your performance with what they've seen in the movie, \"Inherit the Wind? \" Mr. ASNER: No. I think it's a - I love our version far more. It's a much level playing field. And you get to see a far greater circumference - if you'll forgive the expression - of Bryan than you do in \"Inherit the Wind. \" Other than silence, he's too often played as the goat, the fool. The eloquence of the man, the phenomenal history of the man, is nowhere near apparent, other than the awe given to him in \"Inherit the Wind. \" But here we - I think we very well cover the breadth of the man. And he was a titan in American history. FLATOW: Hm-hmm. So it's actually the - this is a case where truth is stranger and meatier, as an actor, than fiction. Mr. ASNER: I think so. More intriguing certainly. FLATOW: Yeah. Peter Goodchild? Mr. GOODCHILD: Yes. FLATOW: What - what motivates you to continue to work on this play? Mr. GOODCHILD: Well it's a fascinating subject. And I think what Ed has said is absolutely right. I mean I came to the original play when I was a student. And I came to it as the film. And I thought it was wonderful. And then when I - sort of 10, 15 years later when I was within the BBC, I wondered whether there was anything one could do with it that wasn't eclipsed by that play. And of course once you start actually researching it you do realize, as Ed was saying, that there are all these other dimensions. And it was interesting you actually picked at the beginning the quote from Bryan which is that wonderful one - oh wait, which is really about what is missing because of - or he thought was missing because of materialistic, scientific thinking which is that the scientists think of life as a mystery that nobody can explain. That kind of thinking got missed out completely from the - and Bryan, the figure in \"Inherit the Wind,\" is just an old dogmatist. And yet there was this whole other dimension. The problems that society was having after the first world war where people were - students were - they did a survey which actually showed that students were going into universities believing, and coming out not believing. And particularly biology students. And this kind of thing and the general social disturbances after that were really worrying people. And the fundamentalist reaction was, of course, to shut down as best they could the kind of material thinking that science generated. And this is what we get into. What happened with \"Inherit the Wind\" was it was a response to McCarthyism. It dealt with freedom of speech more or less entirely. And it was an iconographic play. I mean it actually has colored the way that everybody actually thinks of that trial. But I think what we've done is to go right back to the origins and find they're much more interesting and intriguing arguments that went on at the time and I think have given it another color. FLATOW: Hm-hmm. We're going to have to take a short break. We're talking with Ed Asner, veteran actor and activist and founding member of the L. A. Theatre Works in Los Angeles, Peter Goodchild, author of \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial,\" - sorry, not the author because there was - he's the adapter, let's call him - and Susan Albert Loewenberg who is producer and director. And she's the producing director of the L. A. Theatre Works. We'll take a break, come back and take your calls about the Scopes Trial, evolution, and the issues that are relevant now. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this break. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of news) (Soundbite of music) You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial\" with Ed Asner, veteran actor and performer who is a founding member of the L. A. Theatre Works in Los Angeles who's playing William Jennings Bryan in \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial,\" Peter Goodchild, who adapted the text and turned it into a play, and Susan Loewenberg, producing director of the L. A. Theatre Works. Our number 1-800-989-8255. Ed, I'm struck by what we talked about earlier about greater depth in this play about William Jennings Bryan. And does he come across as a sympathetic figure to you? Mr. ASNER: Well I - with the material I have that Peter has provided - that the transcript has provided - I certainly want to strike those chords that will elicit as much sympathy as you can. But you also have to realize that in this country I think the majority of people of our population - as opposed to I think the rest of the western world - believe in creationism. And so you can't - you can't present enough of the Scopes Trial, \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial, or \"Inherit the Wind\" as a means of education because we are - in terms of our populous - I think way behind the rest of the world in acknowledging Darwinism and acknowledging evolution. And before I finish I just want to tell you it's an honor to be on your program. I think you're smashing. FLATOW: You listen to SCIENCE FRIDAY? Well thank you. It's an honor to be honored by you. Thank you. Do you feel like - do you find, Ed, people coming out rooting for you, the character, you know, because you're playing - because as you say most people do believe as your character believes. Mr. ASNER: I would say they root for me but they understand and they ache as I could possibly ache. I'm just finishing this phenomenal book called \"David and Solomon\" about the manufacturing of the Davidic myth throughout the centuries. And it's a phenomenal and wonderful lineage and history to believe in, as is all faith and religion. But we've got to compartmentalize. We've got to - we've got to see what truth is so it doesn't come up and hit us in the face. And then we can lean back and rely on our faith. FLATOW: Hm-hmm. It - Susan, you were mentioning before how popular this play is in schools\u2026 Ms. LOEWENBERG: Hmm. FLATOW: \u2026with teachers. Is it a way to help science teachers teach evolution? Ms. LOEWENBERG: Absolutely. In fact I think one of the things that we have discovered - not we but on the basis of polls has been discovered - is that teachers are not teaching evolution because they are afraid of the controversy. I was just reading an article from The New York Times where a young teacher is quoted - a teacher from Alabama - she says, \"she confided that she simply ignored evolution because she knew she'd get in trouble with the principal. If word got out that she was teaching it she told me\" - this is - \"other teachers were doing the same thing. \" And you hear report upon report about the shocking number of teachers who will not teach evolution because they're afraid of it. FLATOW: Hm-hmm. Ms. LOEWENBERG: And so I think that's one of the reasons our CD has been so popular. It's been a way for teachers to teach it. FLATOW: Hm-hmm. Ms. LOEWENBERG: And also we have a study guide. You can, you know, download a study guide without charge from the Web site that goes along with that recording. And I think it's really helpful. FLATOW: Hm-hmm. Peter, you wrote the play first back in 1991, if I'm correct, as a radio play series for BBC, right? Mr. GOODCHILD: Yes. FLATOW: Is it basically the same as your first draft of it back then? Mr. GOODCHILD: It is - it is essentially the same. I mean there's a lot of the - particularly the big cross examination that Bryan/Darrow cross examination which I think is very much the same as it was. But it's interesting that working on it again and going back to the roots of research and so on and so forth, I think it's fair to say that this version is much more sympathetic to Bryan and the attitudes that he takes. And the way - we took very much a line back in 1991 that, you know, he was really a bit of a buffer. I mean there is a difference in the way that we actually did it then and did it - and do it now. FLATOW: Hm-hmm. Ms. LOEWENBERG: We've tried to be more even handed. I think we realize\u2026 Mr. GOODCHILD: I think that's it. Yes. Ms. LOEWENBERG: \u2026yeah. I think when we looked at it - there's a wonderful line from Mencken, when he's commenting on the trial in 1925 in talking about the people of Dayton. He says they were unanimously hot for Genesis. Well I think that in 1991, in our version, we were unanimously hot for evolution. And we realized when we were taking this show around the country, if we really wanted to engage people of all persuasions, we had to be more even-handed. So we took out a lot of what we thought was pretty didactic or preachy and just let the facts speak for themselves. And I think that we really improved the script in that way and opened it up so that people would actually talk about it and have a conversation about it. FLATOW: I have - sorry. Mr. ASNER: (unintelligible) we played in Green Bay, Wisconsin, a matinee for kids, mostly private schooled and home-schooled. So there were a lot of religious within the crowd. At the end of it, we had a Q and A. And finally, out of frustration, one of the actors at the Q and A finally said, well - this is after seeing our opus - he said, how many of you believe the world was created in six days? And at least two-thirds of those kids raised their hands. FLATOW: Do you believe you've changed anybody's mind, Ed, when you do this play? Mr. ASNER: If we do anything but make them less sure, that will be a victory for me. Ms. LOEWENBERG: Right. FLATOW: Interesting. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to the phones. Let's go to Richard in Dayton, Tennessee. Hi, Richard. RICHARD (Caller): Hello. FLATOW: Hi there. RICHARD: I actually live in Dayton, Tennessee, where the trial, of course, took place in 1925, and I've been listening with great interest to the discussion today. We have every summer, corresponding to the dates of the trial, a Scopes Festival in town, and they perform a play in the very courtroom that was written also from the actual court transcripts. So I just thought I would mention that and listening with interest to the discussion. FLATOW: Well thank you. Don't go away - don't go anywhere, Richard. I want to ask you a couple of questions. And the townsfolk show great interest in the play? RICHARD: Oh people come from lots of places, all around to see it. It runs for several days during the summer months and July. Ms. LOEWENBERG: Richard, your librarian, who is the great-grandniece of Ben McKenzie, one of the trial's lawyer. We contacted her and she was great. She actually gave us some of her personal family photos\u2026 RICHARD: Oh, great. Ms. LOEWENBERG: Of the trial. RICHARD: I know her well. Ms. LOEWENBERG: Yeah. RICHARD: And I also know a lady in town, she now lives in the nursing home. But she actually attended the trial. FLATOW: Hmm. Mr. GOODCHILD: And I think I actually - we give Dayton a much better press than \"Inherit the Wind. \" It was a very sort of looming town in \"Inherit The Wind. \" We show that you were extremely hospitable to both sides. FLATOW: Ed Asner, would you like to bring this play to a larger audience? Mr. ASNER: Oh, yeah. I think the worthwhileness of it, the sparks that strikes the quest for more information, the quest for truth that it strikes is very important for our citizenry, people as a whole. And I think this country needs it badly. FLATOW: Do you feel like you've - I hear from you, you have invested your own emotional capital into this play. Mr. ASNER: Well it is a problem. It is a problem to assuage the people of faith into accepting evolution and Darwinism. And we must deal with it gently. We must take them gently. We must coerce them gently. So it can't be baldly done, as it has been done by scientists, I guess, in most of the world. This has to be a different approach in this country. FLATOW: Let me ask you, Susan, are there any plans to take this, you know, into a larger, you know, set than, you know, the small towns you're playing in Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, New England? Ms. LOEWENBERG: We would love to do probably a week of performances in New York, and we probably will do that. But when you say in small towns, I mean, one of the interesting things when you travel this country - and we have traveled everywhere in this country - is there are spectacular performing arts centers, some of the most beautiful performing arts centers I've ever seen to rival Lincoln Center all over this country in various small towns. And incredibly interesting audiences, so, you know, we've gone everywhere from Fayetteville, Arkansas, to Lincoln, Nebraska, which is the home of Bryan and we're treated to dinner in his home, which they maintain as a museum. We've been to, you know, Green Bay, Wisconsin. We've been to Florida. We've been to Missouri. We've been to every corner of this country. And I think that's really the best thing we can do with this play. I think what I'd like to do is keep touring it. FLATOW: Yeah. Do you face any opposition in any of the towns? Ms. LOEWENBERG: Well, you know, we were asked to go in the middle of the Dover trial, the famous trial that took place last year, where the school board actually was challenged by a group of citizens for introducing intelligent design into the classroom. We were called in the middle of our tour by Dover, saying, do you have one day? Could do the play? And we had one day. We were on our way from New York to the University of Maryland. And we stopped in Dover and did the play. And that was the one place where there were some minor protests. I think there were people dressed in monkey suits in the parking lot. But it wasn't a very serious protest. FLATOW: Ed, do you look for people to come out, who you would like to -confront is a bad word - but get up close and personal with? Mr. ASNER: Well, I'm not a scientist, so I can't show them the rings in the rock or a tree to demonstrate to demonstrate to them what carbon testing really means. They've got their faith, and it's burned into their heart and souls so there's no way I'm going to convince them that my way is the way of light. But I would be glad to get the books and read it to them. FLATOW: Let's go to Angus in Fridley, Minnesota. Hi, Angus. ANGUS (Caller): Yes, good afternoon. FLATOW: Hi there. ANGUS: Thanks for taking the call. I've worked most of my adult life in theater - just to let you know I'm not exactly talking through my hat - and I love it. Storytelling is one of the best means of creating consensus, if you will. And I think we do it a disservice by creating to castes by saying we the enlightened and oh so patronizing are trying to bring you foolish religious type people along on this road of light and truth. Well, excuse me, I think there may be one or two more truths in this universe than we are aware of at this moment. I believe that, you know, in evolution, I believe it - and that's kind of a silly statement, isn't it? It has been proved to my satisfaction that evolution is a logical means by which we came to be. There may be others, it may be a more complex mix. I think a new myth would be helped along, in terms of storytelling myth, if they took out some of the - if they rewrote this play so it wasn't quite so divisive making it an us and a they camp. FLATOW: Okay, let me get a reaction while we remind everybody that this TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow with Ed Asner, Peter Goodchild, and Susan Loewenberg. Any reaction? Peter? Ms. LOEWENBERG: I don't - I didn't quite understand the question because - what do you mean by rewrite the play? This is just the trial transcripts. ANGUS: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talking about the play. Ms. LOEWENBERG: You were talking about \"Inherit the Wind,\" right? ANGUS: Yes. Ms. LOEWENBERG: Yeah, okay. FLATOW: Okay, thanks for calling. But he did make a point about the\u2026 Mr. ASNER: Go back to sleep. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. GOODCHILD: Well, actually, I think\u2026 FLATOW: Peter. Mr. GOODCHILD: \u2026it's what I would say is that there are wonderful speeches in the thing with - particularly by Dudley Malone, who was a supporter of Darrow's. He's one of the defense. In which he said, you know, just treat the bible as one thing, treat science as another. Keep from compartmentalized. Though in other words, in the text there isn't this divisiveness, there is an argument which - very, very well made in which they're talking about, saying look, don't think that you can introduce it into a science schoolroom, but you go with the books that give you comfort and so on. You do what you will in terms of your religious belief. The two do not have to every overlap. And he, Malone, was actually a practicing Catholic. I think he felt very strongly that the two could coexist. Mr. ASNER: Even the pope has recently - yesterday or the day before - came out in terms of belief in evolution, et cetera. Ms. LOEWENBERG: I think an interesting fact of this trial, by the way, is this is the first trial that was ever broadcast on the radio, and the whole country was glued to their radios sets. And so when Bryan and Darrow and Malone were making their speeches, they were not just talking to the thousand people crowded into that incredibly beautiful courthouse in Dayton, Tennessee, but they were speaking to the whole country. And when you look at the speeches, they were incredible feats of oratory. I mean the eloquence of those men as they argued the case, it was stunning. And everybody in the country was listening. FLATOW: And did they play to that audience? Ms. LOEWENBERG: And they played to that audience, and there were 200 journalists descended on this tiny town. And they were people from all over the world. So the trial really set the stage for the fate of evolution over the next 80 years. And after the trial, as you probably know, I mean, Bryan died five days after the trail ended. He had a stroke and died. So that even though in the cross-examination, I don't know if people - it actually - what actually happened is, you know, he did take the stand. I mean Darrow very cleverly lured him onto the stand, knowing what an egotist he was, and began questioning him about the bible. And of course everyone in America heard him being ridiculed. But when he died five days later, everybody kind of forgot about it, they were so consumed with the death of this American hero. FLATOW: Well, Susan, we've run out of time, but can you give us a quick rundown of where the play will be seen and where you can see it. Ms. LOEWENBERG: Yes. Ed and company are in Williamstown right now. They will then be going on to Connecticut College in New London and the performing art centers in Great Barrington and in Concord, Massachusetts. They'll be at Penn, University of Pennsylvania, for six performances, April 18th to 22nd. And you can go on our Web site, latw. org, and find out everything you want to know about the tour. FLATOW: Thank you very much, Susan Loewenberg, producer and director of L. A. Theater Works; Peter Goodchild, author of the \"Great Tennessee Monkey Trial. \" Ed, thank you for the kind words about SCIENCE FRIDAY, and good luck to in the play. Mr. ASNER: Thank you very much, Ira. Ms. LOEWENBERG: Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: Take care. And we've run out of time. You can surf over to our Web site at sciencefriday. com, and if you missed anything that we talked about there, you could find it over there. Have a great weekend. We'll see you next week. I'm Ira Flatow in New York.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  This hour we're going to be talking about science on the stage and talking about two very different plays, but sort of connected by a theme about monkeys. And first we're going to talk about The Ensemble Studio Theatre's presentation of a new play called \"Serendib. \" Let me just tell you a little bit about The Ensemble Studio Theatre. They present their First Light Festival, and it's a festival all about science and scientists, and the centerpiece this year is this play called \"Serendib,\" not Serendip with a P on the end; \"Serendib. \" But they're connectible. We'll get into that a little bit later. And it's a comedy based on the playwright's experience working with a team of primatologists observing monkeys in the wild. And when this happened, he came back and said, gee, I should write a play about this.  Let me introduce the playwright, David Zellnik.  Mr. DAVID ZELLNIK (Playwright, \"Serendib\"): Hi, there.  FLATOW: Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Mr. ZELLNIK: Thank you.  FLATOW: And with him is Dr. Don Melnick, because he's important. When playwrights write plays and they do them about science, you want to have somebody to look at the science of the play and say, gee, is that close to home? Does that have anything to do with what goes on in the real world? And someone who really knows about that is Dr. Don Melnick. He's the Thomas Hunt Morgan professor of conservation biology at Columbia University. He and his wife, primatologist Mary Pearl, were science advisors to Mr. Zellnik and \"Serendib. \" Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Dr. DON MELNICK (Columbia University): Thank you.  FLATOW: Tell us about this play, David.  Mr. ZELLNIK: OK.  FLATOW: How did you stumble on the idea?  Mr. ZELLNIK: It's serendipitous indeed.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ZELLNIK: I - a few years ago, in 2004, I had a little extra time, and I had a little extra money, and I wanted an adventure. And a friend suggested I log-on to EarthWatch. org and see what kind of studies they had people participating in. Basically you pay an amount of money and you get to work with scientists or conservationists. And so I chose Sri Lanka. It's always fascinated me, and the civil war was in a ceasefire then. And I've always been fascinated by monkeys, so I got to indulge my sort of Jane Goodall fantasies.  FLATOW: And what they were doing there? What were you observing?  Mr. ZELLNIK: They are - Dr. Wolfgang Dittus and his team has been observing Toque Macaques in Polonnaruwa, which is an ancient capital of Sri Lanka, for - it's about 40 years now, I think.  Dr. MELNICK: Yeah, next year it'll be 40 years.  FLATOW: It'll be 40 years.  Mr. ZELLNIK: And they track 20 to 30 troops of Toque Macaques in the site, and you know, tell their stories and track, you know, if they're expanding their territory or what the genealogies of the monkeys are and. . .  FLATOW: Well, what made you decide to write a play about what was going on there and. . .  Mr. ZELLNIK: Well, a few things. I was overwhelmed with the place. It's a really magical place. There's all these overlapping layers of wonderment there. They're historical ruins and there's the sense of history there, and then there is the science study and the scientists observing monkeys, and then there are these monkeys living very much in their wild state there, which is different than how the monkeys in the cities of Sri Lanka live, and it was just magnificent.  FLATOW: And you chose to concentrate on a couple of different themes in the play.  Mr. ZELLNIK: Mm-hmm.  FLATOW: One theme was how the scientists almost - they make a monkey out of the scientists. Scientists actually start behaving like the monkeys they're observing.  Mr. ZELLNIK: Well, I'm definitely hoping that instead of a one-to-one ratio between scientists and monkeys, there's a sort of creative tension of how much are the monkeys and the scientists alike. I do have the monkeys played by the scientists, using puppets, and each scientist plays the monkey that is perhaps closest to him or herself in status within a troop. But there's definitely differences, and there's many ways humans are like monkeys, and many ways we're not. And so by having one actor play both, I'm hoping to maybe explore and open up questions about how much we are alike and we're not.  FLATOW: And you also talk about the friction within science between scientists and critical of each other's work.  Mr. ZELLNIK: I definitely have observed that. There's - the site is sort of cut off from the rest of the city, this monkey camp, so it's definitely sort of a hothouse of conflict and discussion, and it's really exciting to be in the presence of that.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. You bring up a very important issue about whether these scientists who are observing the monkeys are actually doing real science or not. You bring in a Russian competitor to the science who's observing.  Mr. ZELLNIK: Right.  FLATOW: And he says this is not laboratory stuff. You can't make any real conclusions just by watching monkeys.  Mr. ZELLNIK: Well, I do think there is a question of how soft the science is with long-term observation. It's not repeatable. The data is all filtered through a human writing down what he or she sees. And I think the world is a much richer place for the observational science of the past few generations -the Jane Goodalls and the Dian Fosseys - but it definitely is very anecdotal. It's a lot about specific animals you see and how you interpret what they've done or how they're behaving  FLATOW: Mm-hmm, Dr. Melnick, what do you think of the play, I mean in terms of accuracy, and what was your role exactly ensuring that it was close\u2026  Dr. MELNICK: It's actually - giving another example of serendipity, I had actually worked in Polonnaruwa 20 years before David arrived there, and I worked there on a number of occasions in the 1980s. It's an extraordinary place from a scientific point of view, because it is by far the longest-running continuous observational study of primates. It'll be 40 years next year. It's an extraordinary accomplishment to be able to run a project like that for 40 years.  The one thing I would possibly take exception what David is saying is that, yes, it is a question of your doing individual observations of each animal, but when you spread it out over 40 years and over 30 groups and you individually identify every single monkey, and you're collecting data on many of them from the day they were born until the day they died, you have a collection - you might say it's anecdotes, but a lot of people say statistic is - statistics are just a very large collection of anecdotes. You have such an enormous data set that you can begin to see patterns in that data set.  It begins to approach what you would get in a very carefully controlled laboratory study, because one of the advantages of a laboratory study is the immensity of the data you can collect, but - and you could not really do that on most primates because they live a long time. But in this case, if you run a study for 40 years, you can begin to collect that kind of data and begin to see patterns.  Now, to me the interesting - obviously the interesting tension there is one scientist, or set of scientists, who believes that, you know, much of what happens in terms of dominance arch and who's dominant and who is not is contextual, it's sort of nature, it's the environment you're in and the interactions you have, and another coming in and saying, no, you know, basically giving a presentation of the biological determinist point of view: no, there are genes in there, and that animal would have become dominant no matter what, in what environment. So there is this tension between that.  But I think what David pointed out is really true. All science is done by people, and so it doesn't matter what science you're engaged in, you're going to bring a certain level of bias to what you're doing. It doesn't matter whether it's laboratory science or field science, just the questions you're asking are going to somewhat reflect that bias. But the other interesting part about field research is if you think about it, it's a disparate group of people who are suddenly put into a very small, confined space, and who are interacting with each other almost on a 24-hour basis. . .  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. MELNICK: . . . for month after month after month.  FLATOW: And it's like a - and you say, the part of the play, it's a reality program. You bring in some TV producers who turn their research - the laboratory to a reality show. . .  Mr. ZELLNIK: But yeah. . .  FLATOW: . . . create the social, sexual tension that goes on there.  Mr. ZELLNIK: It's interesting, because I found myself, when I was there watching both the scientists and the monkeys, so I sort of wanted to have the observers be observed. And through the documentary filmmakers who come to make a documentary about the monkeys, we get some of those themes into the play.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Reading through my notes, scribbled in the dark, it's a great play. I really enjoyed it.  Mr. ZELLNIK: Thank you.  FLATOW: I congratulate you. I have a quote from the play that says, if I can read my handwriting: Hot people and cool animals; that's what people like. And that's what you gave them.  Mr. ZELLNIK: Well, yeah, it's cute animals, not cool animals.  FLATOW: I'm sorry.  Mr. ZELLNIK: It's similar. Yeah, those are - that's a rather cynical point of view from the documentary filmmaker, but I think the environmental movement has been very canny about using cute and cool animals as their sort of spokes-animals to help save the ones that maybe aren't so cute to us.  FLATOW: And you made that point in the play that - one of the characters say, we need this to preserve these animals. If we don't get the public attention from the documentary we can make about the hot people and the cute animals, you're not going to get your funding or the public attention.  Mr. ZELLNIK: I met a scientist there in Sri Lanka who very impassioned - a very impassioned woman - who said that scientists now can't afford to do what Dr. Dittus did 40 years ago because she said the natural world's on fire, which is a line that now is in the play. She said we all have to become activists now, we have to fight to save these species, we can't just have the luxury of sitting in the woods and watching them. And so whether that's true or not, that's definitely a point of view that threads its way through the play.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Yes, go ahead.  Dr. MELNICK: I was just going to say that, again, on that theme of serendipity, that it - I had spent about 15 years of my career doing basic science research, doing basic genetic work on various species. It was actually on my way to the Polonnaruwa site that I had an experience that really transformed what I was doing and really I begin to apply my science to conservation. So it's very much so, when David used the words in one of his characters that the world is on fire, how could we just focus on just what these animals are doing instead of the larger context.  We were traveling into the Polonnaruwa site on a road, and we were going down this road, and all of a sudden I - an elephant came out from this dry forest that exists in that area and just began browsing along the side - we stopped our jeep. We were bringing provisions in for months, and we stopped our jeep, we were just sitting there watching it. It was a beautiful thing to do. And these elephants are known to do - people who've watched elephants - they can just fade off into the brush almost before your eyes. And this elephant eventually did that and faded, and then we went into the - up to the camp, we worked for about three months, and we were on our way back to get more provisions, to the capital, and came to the area, and the whole area was gone. It had all been cut, burned, gone, all animals gone. And at that moment I thought, you know, I can't do this anymore. I can't just do my basic science research.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. MELNICK: There has to be an applied part of this that's dealing with habitat preservation and species preservation. Otherwise all I'm doing is bearing witness to the end. I'm not really making a contribution and not really - in some ways, all I'm doing is taking from nature for my own career, but not putting anything back in.  FLATOW: Did you feel, when you were writing this play, that you had to make a statement like that, like he is saying? Or were you more interested in just a theatrical. . .  Mr. ZELLNIK: I was interested - I am deeply committed to what he's talking about, but I don't think that was really my impulse in writing the play. I wanted to show people my love of these animals and the experience I had, which was to be so overwhelmed by their individuality and their soulfulness and their fierceness and their dignity as animals and sort of be true to that. . .  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Mr. ZELLNIK: . . . and potentially make people fall in love with the animals, but on a deeper level to explore (unintelligible).  FLATOW: We're going to take a short break, come back, talk lots more about the play \"Serendib. \" We'll talk about why the B's at the end a little bit with playwright David Zellnik, also with Don Melnick who was the science advisor on the play, and your calls. Our number: 1-800-989-8255. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this break.  (Soundbite of music)  I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking today, this hour, about \"Serendib,\" a new play by David Zellnik, who is a playwright, and you'll have until, what, April 27th, David?  Mr. ZELLNIK: Twenty-second.  FLATOW: Twenty-second, to catch it at The Ensemble Studio Theatre here in New York. And just in full disclosure, the Sloan Foundation has funded these plays, right?  Mr. ZELLNIK: Yeah, they've been collaborating with Ensemble Studio Theatre for, I believe, nine years now, to help produce new plays about science and the intersection of science and technology and the wider world.  FLATOW: They also fund SCIENCE FRIDAY, so we're grateful to them. Don Melnick is also involved in the play. He and his wife, Mary Pearl, were science advisors for \"Serendib. \" Let me take care of what I said before the break. Why you spell it \"Serendib\". . .  Mr. ZELLNIK: It's interesting. . .  FLATOW: . . . instead of Serendip.  Mr. ZELLNIK: I'm not sure.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ZELLNIK: I saw both versions. It's a 12th century, 11th, 12th century Arabic word for Sri Lanka.  FLATOW: Oh, it is.  Mr. ZELLNIK: And I've seen it with both a B and a P, and it came to our language, really, through a story about these princes of Serendib who encountered so many happy accidents that the word became serendipity in our language.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm, Don, what about the portrayal of the scientists. They get into fights with each other, you know, they question each other.  Dr. MELNICK: Yeah, I think it. . .  FLATOW: More realistic than you see in the movies.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. MELNICK: Yeah, and I think that's one of the great services that David's play provides to science in that, you know, rather than the sort of crazy, wild-eyed, Christopher Lloyd-type wacky scientist that you see come in. . .  FLATOW: Central casting, the wacky guy.  Dr. MELNICK: . . . and you see it repeatedly in movies coming out of Hollywood - what he does is he portrays scientists as people. They have likes, they have dislikes, some are sympathetic, some are less sympathetic. Some, you know, are extremely aggressive, others are much less so. Because scientists are, in essence, they are just people, and they have all the attributes that you find in people. And I think it's a tremendous disservice to science to somehow portray them as some sort of separate group, very nerdy. I think the cast and the people in there and the portrayal of scientists was anything but nerdy.  Mr. ZELLNIK: Yeah, it's a young, sexy cast.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: It is very sexy, very - and a lot of sexual tension running through the play.  Mr. ZELLNIK: Sure, and part of what fascinates me about - especially the scientists I met in Polonnaruwa is how much they love the animals and how much that. . .  FLATOW: Yes.  Mr. ZELLNIK: . . . that love shows through their work, so they're anything but crazy, nerdy science geeks.  FLATOW: But that is one of the themes of the play, the disbelieving scientist who doesn't believe you can tell when an animal's happy. There's no objective way to measure the happiness or a love of an animal.  Mr. ZELLNIK: Right, there's definitely a taboo in science, I think, of sort of projecting human emotions or thought - human thoughts - onto animals. But as I was observing the monkeys, and it seemed the other scientists, it becomes very narcissistic, I think, to pretend that monkeys and humans are not very closely related and don't have several overlapping sympathies.  FLATOW: Now this is not your first play, but. . .  Mr. ZELLNIK: No.  FLATOW: . . . is it the first one about - with a science theme in it? . . .  Mr. ZELLNIK: It is.  FLATOW: . . . And did you have to think about crafting it differently if you're dealing with science?  Mr. ZELLNIK: Well, I had to make sure that the science was true. . .  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ZELLNIK: . . . and that it would be compelling for a scientist who watches it, so I definitely had to do a lot of research and learn a language of speaking that is not really intuitive for me. But this play is the oddest one for me in that I went to Sri Lanka knowing I wanted to write a play set there, without knowing remotely what the play would be like. And it's been a long journey in figuring out how to put monkeys on a stage.  FLATOW: And those - I was going to say those Muppets. They're not Muppets. They're not like any puppets I've seen before. They are truly unique.  Mr. ZELLNIK: Yeah, I love Muppets, but we wanted to give them more dignity and more fierceness, and Emily DeCola, who created the puppets and directed the scenes, did a wonderful job of capturing these small but incredibly vibrant animals.  FLATOW: And the actors were able to channel their emotions through to the puppets there.  Mr. ZELLNIK: Yeah, the director, Carlos Armesto, he added an extra week of rehearsal onto the production so that we could just have a puppet workshop, because none of the actors had been trained as puppeteers, and yet the characters they played were so. . .  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Mr. ZELLNIK: . . . the puppet work was so vital to the characters they played.  FLATOW: Hi, let's go to Leslie, in West Bloomfield, Michigan. Hi, Leslie.  LESLIE (Caller): Hi, how you doing?  FLATOW: Hi, there.  LESLIE: I guess I want to talk about one of the statements you made earlier. I have a - my brother-in-law is a scientist. He's a physicist. And quite honestly the last word I would use to describe him is hot.  (Soundbite of laughter)  LESLIE: It seems - no.  FLATOW: I hope he's not listening.  LESLIE: I doubt it. He's very much a physics geek. But a lot of scientists I know are not hot, and it seems that we like our science today delivered with a dose of sex. A lot - I have a five-year-old daughter, and we watch the, you know, the children's nature programs, and sometimes I - you know, nature on TV and things like that. And it seems to me that they look for, like, you know, someone who's really sexy or has a lot of sex appeal, you know, the, oh, gosh, gee, me, sexy-type look? And it seems that scientists are presented as kind of sexy. And quite honestly, like I said, most of the ones I know aren't.  FLATOW: You're hanging around in the wrong places, I think.  (Soundbite of laughter)  LESLIE: Oh, I guess academia is not the place to find the scientists.  FLATOW: Let me go - well, let me get a reaction from the playwright. David, did - was that purposely written in that way to make them. . .  Mr. ZELLNIK: Well, I mean. . .  FLATOW: . . . it seems they are very sexy and hot in the play.  Mr. ZELLNIK: There's definitely sexy scientists, and I'll stand by that.  FLATOW: I mean, and you know. . .  LESLIE: Oh, I'm sure there are. . .  Mr. ZELLNIK: Yeah, I mean - but. . .  LESLIE: . . . It's just that I don't know them.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: You know, there are contests, you know.  (Soundbite of laughter)  LESLIE: (unintelligible)  Mr. ZELLNIK: Well, I mean, there's something about a small world like this that brings out the sexuality of, you know, any small - you know, any small group of people shut off from everyone else is going to - especially if they're observing monkeys during mating season, there's going to be a lot of sex on the brain.  FLATOW: Well, thanks for calling. Well, check out Neil deGrasse Tyson was voted, you know, in 2000, the sexiest scientist, I think, by. . .  LESLIE: Who?  FLATOW: Neil deGrasse Tyson of the Hayden Planetarium, the astronomer there.  LESLIE: Well, I always had a thing for the Crocodile Hunter, so, you know.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. MELNICK: Oh.  LESLIE: OK, bye.  FLATOW: All right, have a good weekend. Thanks for calling 1-800-989-8255. What's the life of a play like this? It's playing to a limited audience in New York. Can it have a life outside of, you know, a really cultural town like New York City.  Mr. ZELLNIK: I think it can. Definitely one of the projects after it finishes its run here is to have the EST/Sloan Foundation help with incentive grants to finance regional productions around the country. And I think in any city or town there's - there are people who will be drawn to this play or be interested in this play. I think all humans - most humans are really interested in monkeys, and so there's just a natural sympathy you see, a recognition you see when you see a monkey.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm, so you think you'll be taking it on the road, or any plans to take it - or you're looking for funding for it.  Mr. ZELLNIK: There's no plans right now. We would be thrilled to transfer to New York, and we would be thrilled to have a nonprofit, regional house express interest in producing a new version of their own, of it.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. MELNICK: I even suggested to David that he might consider taking it to Sri Lanka and having it performed there.  Mr. ZELLNIK: I would certainly love that.  FLATOW: Well, why not take it across the pond, as they say, even to Europe or places like that?  Mr. ZELLNIK: Well, we should talk to the Sloan Foundation. . .  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ZELLNIK: . . . the EST and see if we can make that happen.  FLATOW: Well, we have heard of plays that are very successful in Europe, science-related plays, having a little bit, you know, trouble over here, but getting treated royally over in Europe, so good luck to you.  Mr. ZELLNIK: Thank you.  FLATOW: It's - I highly recommend it as long as you can see it. It's still in New York here.  Mr. ZELLNIK: Ah, yeah, it's running through the 22nd, and if you want tickets, you can log into theatermania. com.  FLATOW: Good luck to you.  Mr. ZELLNIK: Thank you.  FLATOW: Thank you both for joining us.  Dr. MELNICK: Thank you.  FLATOW: David Zellnik, who is a playwright, \"Serendibity,\" and Dr. Don Melnick, who is a Thomas Hunt Morgan professor of conservation biology at Columbia University. Thanks, have a good weekend.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: Up now we're going to switch gears and talk about another play. \"Inherit the Wind\" - it's not the play we're going to talk about. We're just going to mention it in passing, that it is playing on Broadway once again. It was last here in 1955. I should say it started in 1955, first seen, a drama about the Scopes trial, which of course was the science of evolution was on trial. It wasn't so controversial back then as it is now in the year 2000-plus, where we've seen all kinds of trials about trials going on, but it is certainly relevant now here and interesting that it's playing in New York.  Well, the L. A. Theatre Works, which is a radio and theater nonprofit organization in Los Angeles, has found that one of their plays, \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial,\" a new play that's making the rounds in the Northeast here, can actually help start the discussion again. Playwright Peter Goodchild used the actual transcripts of the Scopes trial to fashion the play, and I'm going to give you a little bit of taste of the play here in a couple of cuts we have. Here's what William Jennings Bryan, the prosecutor, who's played by Ed Asner, had to - what he really said in the trial as opposed to what you might have seen in \"Inherit the Wind. \"  (Soundbite of play, \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial\")  Mr. ED ASNER (Actor): (As William Jennings Bryan): They think of life as a mystery that nobody can explain, not one word about God at the back of it. They want you to let them commence there and ask no questions. They do not explain the great riddle of the universe. They do not deal with the problems of life. They do not teach the great science of how to live.  FLATOW: And that was Ed Asner playing - or saying the words of William Jennings Bryan in this new play. And here is his opponent, Clarence Darrow, played by Mike Farrell. This is what he really answered.  Mr. MIKE FARRELL (Actor): (As Clarence Darrow) If today you can take a thing like evolution and make it a crime to teach it in a public school, tomorrow you can make it a crime to teach in the private schools. And the next day in the hustings or in the church.  The next session you may ban books and newspapers. You can do the one. You can do the other. And after a while your honor it as the setting a man against man and creed against creed until with flying banners and beating drums we are marching backward to the 16th century when bigots lighted fagots to burn the men who dared to bring any intelligence and enlightenment and learning to the human mind.  FLATOW: And that is all from, \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial. \" It's touring the Northeast right now. And you can catch it at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia from April 18 to 22.  And three people who are bringing \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial\" to you and to the classroom are here with us to talk about it. You know actor Ed Asner from the \"Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" his own programs and his many other appearances on TVs and film.  He's a founding member of the Los Angeles - the LA Theatre Works. He joins us today from Williams College where he is playing William Jennings Bryan, the anti-evolutionist and the voice you heard in that cut.  Ed, thank you for being with us today.  Mr. ASNER: One monkey to another.  FLATOW: Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Peter Goodchild is a playwright who adapted the Scopes Trial transcripts for the stage in \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial. \" And he's also an award-winning television producer who is former head of both the science division and the features and drama division at the BBC.  And he joins us from the studios of the BBC in Exeter, England. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Mr. PETER GOODCHILD (Playwright, \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial\"): My pleasure.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Susan Albert Loewenstein - Loewenberg is a founder and producing director of the L. A. Theatre Works - sorry, Susan - and \"The Great Tennessee\u2026  Ms. SUSAN ALBERT LOEWENBERG (Producing Director, \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial\"): It's all right, Ira.  FLATOW: \u2026Monkey Trial. \" Susan Loewenberg joins us today from our studios at NPR West in Culver City. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Ms. LOEWENBERG: Thank you.  FLATOW: Tell us, Susan, how this play got legs, so to speak.  Ms. LOEWENBERG: How it got legs. Yes. Well we actually originally produced it with the BBC in 1991. And we were approached around 2003 by someone who said you ought to tour your radio show around the country.  We do have a radio show called, \"The Plays the Thing,\" which is on public radio. And you should take one of your plays around. And I think people will like to see that.  So we had to choose a play that we had already done. And we have a program where we give 1,500 high school teachers in 600 cities all over America plays that we've recorded that are relevant to the high school curriculum.  And we had just done a survey about usage. And believe it or not \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial\" was the most utilized recording, beating out \"The Crucible\" and \"Julius Caesar\" and \"The Grapes of Wrath. \"  FLATOW: Wow.  Ms. LOEWENBERG: So we thought, a ha, there's something here. And when we were setting the tour for 2005 and '06. And the man who was booking us around the country at colleges and universities said, it'll be about three weeks.  Well the response was so overwhelming that we ended up going out for almost 11 weeks in '05/'06. And now we are remounting because there are more requests for it. So we're doing three more weeks.  And Ed has played Bryan for virtually all of it. So he gets\u2026  FLATOW: Hm-hmm.  Ms. LOEWENBERG: \u2026he gets a medal.  FLATOW: Well let me ask you what - let me just remind everybody that I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  Do you have trouble being compared - or your performance stacking up - people stack up your performance with what they've seen in the movie, \"Inherit the Wind? \"  Mr. ASNER: No. I think it's a - I love our version far more. It's a much level playing field. And you get to see a far greater circumference - if you'll forgive the expression - of Bryan than you do in \"Inherit the Wind. \"  Other than silence, he's too often played as the goat, the fool. The eloquence of the man, the phenomenal history of the man, is nowhere near apparent, other than the awe given to him in \"Inherit the Wind. \"  But here we - I think we very well cover the breadth of the man. And he was a titan in American history.  FLATOW: Hm-hmm. So it's actually the - this is a case where truth is stranger and meatier, as an actor, than fiction.  Mr. ASNER: I think so. More intriguing certainly.  FLATOW: Yeah. Peter Goodchild?  Mr. GOODCHILD: Yes.  FLATOW: What - what motivates you to continue to work on this play?  Mr. GOODCHILD: Well it's a fascinating subject. And I think what Ed has said is absolutely right. I mean I came to the original play when I was a student. And I came to it as the film. And I thought it was wonderful.  And then when I - sort of 10, 15 years later when I was within the BBC, I wondered whether there was anything one could do with it that wasn't eclipsed by that play.  And of course once you start actually researching it you do realize, as Ed was saying, that there are all these other dimensions. And it was interesting you actually picked at the beginning the quote from Bryan which is that wonderful one - oh wait, which is really about what is missing because of - or he thought was missing because of materialistic, scientific thinking which is that the scientists think of life as a mystery that nobody can explain.  That kind of thinking got missed out completely from the - and Bryan, the figure in \"Inherit the Wind,\" is just an old dogmatist. And yet there was this whole other dimension. The problems that society was having after the first world war where people were - students were - they did a survey which actually showed that students were going into universities believing, and coming out not believing. And particularly biology students.  And this kind of thing and the general social disturbances after that were really worrying people. And the fundamentalist reaction was, of course, to shut down as best they could the kind of material thinking that science generated.  And this is what we get into. What happened with \"Inherit the Wind\" was it was a response to McCarthyism. It dealt with freedom of speech more or less entirely.  And it was an iconographic play. I mean it actually has colored the way that everybody actually thinks of that trial. But I think what we've done is to go right back to the origins and find they're much more interesting and intriguing arguments that went on at the time and I think have given it another color.  FLATOW: Hm-hmm. We're going to have to take a short break. We're talking with Ed Asner, veteran actor and activist and founding member of the L. A. Theatre Works in Los Angeles, Peter Goodchild, author of \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial,\" - sorry, not the author because there was - he's the adapter, let's call him - and Susan Albert Loewenberg who is producer and director. And she's the producing director of the L. A. Theatre Works.  We'll take a break, come back and take your calls about the Scopes Trial, evolution, and the issues that are relevant now. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this break.  I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of news)  (Soundbite of music)  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial\" with Ed Asner, veteran actor and performer who is a founding member of the L. A. Theatre Works in Los Angeles who's playing William Jennings Bryan in \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial,\" Peter Goodchild, who adapted the text and turned it into a play, and Susan Loewenberg, producing director of the L. A. Theatre Works.  Our number 1-800-989-8255. Ed, I'm struck by what we talked about earlier about greater depth in this play about William Jennings Bryan. And does he come across as a sympathetic figure to you?  Mr. ASNER: Well I - with the material I have that Peter has provided - that the transcript has provided - I certainly want to strike those chords that will elicit as much sympathy as you can.  But you also have to realize that in this country I think the majority of people of our population - as opposed to I think the rest of the western world - believe in creationism.  And so you can't - you can't present enough of the Scopes Trial, \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial, or \"Inherit the Wind\" as a means of education because we are - in terms of our populous - I think way behind the rest of the world in acknowledging Darwinism and acknowledging evolution.  And before I finish I just want to tell you it's an honor to be on your program. I think you're smashing.  FLATOW: You listen to SCIENCE FRIDAY? Well thank you. It's an honor to be honored by you.  Thank you. Do you feel like - do you find, Ed, people coming out rooting for you, the character, you know, because you're playing - because as you say most people do believe as your character believes.  Mr. ASNER: I would say they root for me but they understand and they ache as I could possibly ache.  I'm just finishing this phenomenal book called \"David and Solomon\" about the manufacturing of the Davidic myth throughout the centuries. And it's a phenomenal and wonderful lineage and history to believe in, as is all faith and religion.  But we've got to compartmentalize. We've got to - we've got to see what truth is so it doesn't come up and hit us in the face. And then we can lean back and rely on our faith.  FLATOW: Hm-hmm. It - Susan, you were mentioning before how popular this play is in schools\u2026  Ms. LOEWENBERG: Hmm.  FLATOW: \u2026with teachers. Is it a way to help science teachers teach evolution?  Ms. LOEWENBERG: Absolutely. In fact I think one of the things that we have discovered - not we but on the basis of polls has been discovered - is that teachers are not teaching evolution because they are afraid of the controversy.  I was just reading an article from The New York Times where a young teacher is quoted - a teacher from Alabama - she says, \"she confided that she simply ignored evolution because she knew she'd get in trouble with the principal. If word got out that she was teaching it she told me\" - this is - \"other teachers were doing the same thing. \"  And you hear report upon report about the shocking number of teachers who will not teach evolution because they're afraid of it.  FLATOW: Hm-hmm.  Ms. LOEWENBERG: And so I think that's one of the reasons our CD has been so popular. It's been a way for teachers to teach it.  FLATOW: Hm-hmm.  Ms. LOEWENBERG: And also we have a study guide. You can, you know, download a study guide without charge from the Web site that goes along with that recording. And I think it's really helpful.  FLATOW: Hm-hmm. Peter, you wrote the play first back in 1991, if I'm correct, as a radio play series for BBC, right?  Mr. GOODCHILD: Yes.  FLATOW: Is it basically the same as your first draft of it back then?  Mr. GOODCHILD: It is - it is essentially the same. I mean there's a lot of the - particularly the big cross examination that Bryan/Darrow cross examination which I think is very much the same as it was.  But it's interesting that working on it again and going back to the roots of research and so on and so forth, I think it's fair to say that this version is much more sympathetic to Bryan and the attitudes that he takes.  And the way - we took very much a line back in 1991 that, you know, he was really a bit of a buffer. I mean there is a difference in the way that we actually did it then and did it - and do it now.  FLATOW: Hm-hmm.  Ms. LOEWENBERG: We've tried to be more even handed. I think we realize\u2026  Mr. GOODCHILD: I think that's it. Yes.  Ms. LOEWENBERG: \u2026yeah. I think when we looked at it - there's a wonderful line from Mencken, when he's commenting on the trial in 1925 in talking about the people of Dayton. He says they were unanimously hot for Genesis.  Well I think that in 1991, in our version, we were unanimously hot for evolution. And we realized when we were taking this show around the country, if we really wanted to engage people of all persuasions, we had to be more even-handed.  So we took out a lot of what we thought was pretty didactic or preachy and just let the facts speak for themselves. And I think that we really improved the script in that way and opened it up so that people would actually talk about it and have a conversation about it.  FLATOW: I have - sorry.  Mr. ASNER: (unintelligible) we played in Green Bay, Wisconsin, a matinee for kids, mostly private schooled and home-schooled. So there were a lot of religious within the crowd. At the end of it, we had a Q and A. And finally, out of frustration, one of the actors at the Q and A finally said, well - this is after seeing our opus - he said, how many of you believe the world was created in six days? And at least two-thirds of those kids raised their hands.  FLATOW: Do you believe you've changed anybody's mind, Ed, when you do this play?  Mr. ASNER: If we do anything but make them less sure, that will be a victory for me.  Ms. LOEWENBERG: Right.  FLATOW: Interesting. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to the phones. Let's go to Richard in Dayton, Tennessee. Hi, Richard.  RICHARD (Caller): Hello.  FLATOW: Hi there.  RICHARD: I actually live in Dayton, Tennessee, where the trial, of course, took place in 1925, and I've been listening with great interest to the discussion today. We have every summer, corresponding to the dates of the trial, a Scopes Festival in town, and they perform a play in the very courtroom that was written also from the actual court transcripts.  So I just thought I would mention that and listening with interest to the discussion.  FLATOW: Well thank you. Don't go away - don't go anywhere, Richard. I want to ask you a couple of questions. And the townsfolk show great interest in the play?  RICHARD: Oh people come from lots of places, all around to see it. It runs for several days during the summer months and July.  Ms. LOEWENBERG: Richard, your librarian, who is the great-grandniece of Ben McKenzie, one of the trial's lawyer. We contacted her and she was great. She actually gave us some of her personal family photos\u2026  RICHARD: Oh, great.  Ms. LOEWENBERG: Of the trial.  RICHARD: I know her well.  Ms. LOEWENBERG: Yeah.  RICHARD: And I also know a lady in town, she now lives in the nursing home. But she actually attended the trial.  FLATOW: Hmm.  Mr. GOODCHILD: And I think I actually - we give Dayton a much better press than \"Inherit the Wind. \" It was a very sort of looming town in \"Inherit The Wind. \" We show that you were extremely hospitable to both sides.  FLATOW: Ed Asner, would you like to bring this play to a larger audience?  Mr. ASNER: Oh, yeah. I think the worthwhileness of it, the sparks that strikes the quest for more information, the quest for truth that it strikes is very important for our citizenry, people as a whole. And I think this country needs it badly.  FLATOW: Do you feel like you've - I hear from you, you have invested your own emotional capital into this play.  Mr. ASNER: Well it is a problem. It is a problem to assuage the people of faith into accepting evolution and Darwinism. And we must deal with it gently. We must take them gently. We must coerce them gently. So it can't be baldly done, as it has been done by scientists, I guess, in most of the world. This has to be a different approach in this country.  FLATOW: Let me ask you, Susan, are there any plans to take this, you know, into a larger, you know, set than, you know, the small towns you're playing in Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, New England?  Ms. LOEWENBERG: We would love to do probably a week of performances in New York, and we probably will do that. But when you say in small towns, I mean, one of the interesting things when you travel this country - and we have traveled everywhere in this country - is there are spectacular performing arts centers, some of the most beautiful performing arts centers I've ever seen to rival Lincoln Center all over this country in various small towns.  And incredibly interesting audiences, so, you know, we've gone everywhere from Fayetteville, Arkansas, to Lincoln, Nebraska, which is the home of Bryan and we're treated to dinner in his home, which they maintain as a museum. We've been to, you know, Green Bay, Wisconsin. We've been to Florida. We've been to Missouri. We've been to every corner of this country. And I think that's really the best thing we can do with this play. I think what I'd like to do is keep touring it.  FLATOW: Yeah. Do you face any opposition in any of the towns?  Ms. LOEWENBERG: Well, you know, we were asked to go in the middle of the Dover trial, the famous trial that took place last year, where the school board actually was challenged by a group of citizens for introducing intelligent design into the classroom. We were called in the middle of our tour by Dover, saying, do you have one day? Could do the play? And we had one day.  We were on our way from New York to the University of Maryland. And we stopped in Dover and did the play. And that was the one place where there were some minor protests. I think there were people dressed in monkey suits in the parking lot. But it wasn't a very serious protest.  FLATOW: Ed, do you look for people to come out, who you would like to -confront is a bad word - but get up close and personal with?  Mr. ASNER: Well, I'm not a scientist, so I can't show them the rings in the rock or a tree to demonstrate to demonstrate to them what carbon testing really means. They've got their faith, and it's burned into their heart and souls so there's no way I'm going to convince them that my way is the way of light. But I would be glad to get the books and read it to them.  FLATOW: Let's go to Angus in Fridley, Minnesota. Hi, Angus.  ANGUS (Caller): Yes, good afternoon.  FLATOW: Hi there.  ANGUS: Thanks for taking the call. I've worked most of my adult life in theater - just to let you know I'm not exactly talking through my hat - and I love it. Storytelling is one of the best means of creating consensus, if you will. And I think we do it a disservice by creating to castes by saying we the enlightened and oh so patronizing are trying to bring you foolish religious type people along on this road of light and truth.  Well, excuse me, I think there may be one or two more truths in this universe than we are aware of at this moment. I believe that, you know, in evolution, I believe it - and that's kind of a silly statement, isn't it? It has been proved to my satisfaction that evolution is a logical means by which we came to be. There may be others, it may be a more complex mix. I think a new myth would be helped along, in terms of storytelling myth, if they took out some of the - if they rewrote this play so it wasn't quite so divisive making it an us and a they camp.  FLATOW: Okay, let me get a reaction while we remind everybody that this TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow with Ed Asner, Peter Goodchild, and Susan Loewenberg. Any reaction? Peter?  Ms. LOEWENBERG: I don't - I didn't quite understand the question because - what do you mean by rewrite the play? This is just the trial transcripts.  ANGUS: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talking about the play.  Ms. LOEWENBERG: You were talking about \"Inherit the Wind,\" right?  ANGUS: Yes.  Ms. LOEWENBERG: Yeah, okay.  FLATOW: Okay, thanks for calling. But he did make a point about the\u2026  Mr. ASNER: Go back to sleep.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. GOODCHILD: Well, actually, I think\u2026  FLATOW: Peter.  Mr. GOODCHILD: \u2026it's what I would say is that there are wonderful speeches in the thing with - particularly by Dudley Malone, who was a supporter of Darrow's. He's one of the defense. In which he said, you know, just treat the bible as one thing, treat science as another. Keep from compartmentalized. Though in other words, in the text there isn't this divisiveness, there is an argument which - very, very well made in which they're talking about, saying look, don't think that you can introduce it into a science schoolroom, but you go with the books that give you comfort and so on. You do what you will in terms of your religious belief. The two do not have to every overlap. And he, Malone, was actually a practicing Catholic. I think he felt very strongly that the two could coexist.  Mr. ASNER: Even the pope has recently - yesterday or the day before - came out in terms of belief in evolution, et cetera.  Ms. LOEWENBERG: I think an interesting fact of this trial, by the way, is this is the first trial that was ever broadcast on the radio, and the whole country was glued to their radios sets. And so when Bryan and Darrow and Malone were making their speeches, they were not just talking to the thousand people crowded into that incredibly beautiful courthouse in Dayton, Tennessee, but they were speaking to the whole country. And when you look at the speeches, they were incredible feats of oratory. I mean the eloquence of those men as they argued the case, it was stunning. And everybody in the country was listening.  FLATOW: And did they play to that audience?  Ms. LOEWENBERG: And they played to that audience, and there were 200 journalists descended on this tiny town. And they were people from all over the world. So the trial really set the stage for the fate of evolution over the next 80 years. And after the trial, as you probably know, I mean, Bryan died five days after the trail ended. He had a stroke and died. So that even though in the cross-examination, I don't know if people - it actually - what actually happened is, you know, he did take the stand. I mean Darrow very cleverly lured him onto the stand, knowing what an egotist he was, and began questioning him about the bible. And of course everyone in America heard him being ridiculed.  But when he died five days later, everybody kind of forgot about it, they were so consumed with the death of this American hero.  FLATOW: Well, Susan, we've run out of time, but can you give us a quick rundown of where the play will be seen and where you can see it.  Ms. LOEWENBERG: Yes. Ed and company are in Williamstown right now. They will then be going on to Connecticut College in New London and the performing art centers in Great Barrington and in Concord, Massachusetts. They'll be at Penn, University of Pennsylvania, for six performances, April 18th to 22nd. And you can go on our Web site, latw. org, and find out everything you want to know about the tour.  FLATOW: Thank you very much, Susan Loewenberg, producer and director of L. A. Theater Works; Peter Goodchild, author of the \"Great Tennessee Monkey Trial. \" Ed, thank you for the kind words about SCIENCE FRIDAY, and good luck to in the play.  Mr. ASNER: Thank you very much, Ira.  Ms. LOEWENBERG: Thank you, Ira.  FLATOW: Take care. And we've run out of time. You can surf over to our Web site at sciencefriday. com, and if you missed anything that we talked about there, you could find it over there.  Have a great weekend. We'll see you next week. I'm Ira Flatow in New York. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2007 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Madeleine Brand. ALEX CHADWICK, host: I'm Alex Chadwick. Abortion opponents are applauding yesterday's Supreme Court decision supporting a ban on the procedure that they call partial-birth abortion; the medical term is intact dilation and extraction. But what about the doctors who perform these procedures? BRAND: Earlier, I spoke with Dr. Karen Lifford. She's a practicing OB/GYN who is also the medical director of Planned Parenthood in Massachusetts. Planned Parenthood was part of the suit that the Supreme Court ruled on yesterday. Some 90 percent of abortions are performed before 12 weeks in the first trimester. The banned procedure is done after 12 weeks, and it involves removing a fetus intact from the uterus. I asked Dr. Lifford how often she personally performs that procedure. Dr. KAREN LIFFORD (Medical Director, Planned Parenthood): It's really not a matter of how often any particular procedure on medicine is used. It's having a range of options that we all need to practice medicine safely and to offer our patients what's best for their health. BRAND: Justice Anthony Kennedy in his majority decision yesterday said there was, quote, \"medical uncertainty\" over whether the procedure was ever necessary for the sake of the woman's health. What do you think of that? Dr. LIFFORD: I think that that's disregarding. Experts in our field, as well as leading medical organizations, agree that this procedure is sometimes necessary and that this option should not be taken away from physicians. BRAND: What is the alternative? So what will a woman receive now in the second trimester if she wants to terminate a pregnancy? Dr. LIFFORD: The fallback is a D&E, a dilation and extraction, which is widely used across the country. But I think that this does not allow medicine to evolve to practices that may be safer. BRAND: So the difference between the two procedures are that, in one instance, the fetus is extracted whole, if you will, and the other not? Dr. LIFFORD: And the other difference is how much instrumentation is required, and that's why it felt that this banned procedure might be safer. BRAND: What happens if a woman miscarries past the 12th week and does not expel the fetus on her own, does she have the D&E? Dr. LIFFORD: This law does not apply to fetuses that are not living. So the restrictions on someone who has miscarried and the fetus is dead it doesn't apply to. However, many miscarriages involve labor that starts prior to when the fetus can survive outside a woman, and it would apply in those circumstances. BRAND: So I'm just trying to get a sense, you know, for a woman who, you know, needs or wants to terminate a pregnancy in the second trimester. When she comes into your office, what would she now face and what restrictions would she now be under? Dr. LIFFORD: Well, I think what women need to know is that abortion, including second trimester abortion, is still legal in the United States. Planned Parenthood and other providers have always followed the law. We will always continue to follow the law. And we will provide our patients with the options that are available. But we will be restricted now, and this restriction is based on politicians rather than physicians. Medicine has always moved forward and changed according to physician's best judgment. This is really precedent-setting that politicians are making medical decisions. BRAND: Does it also reflect the success in the tactics of the anti-abortion movement to shift the focus away from talking about the women's health to talking about the fetus? Dr. LIFFORD: I think this is a major setback for women's health. There are more than 30 years of precedent that abortion bans cannot - must include protections for the women's health. This is the first time we've seen a ban upheld where we're willing to disregard the health of women.

KAY COX: Quite a bit, Alex. Because people have - they work full time and they leave their one dog home alone, and dogs are pack animals so they want to be with a group. CHADWICK: When this story crossed on the wires a little earlier today, I confess that several of us thought it was kind of funny. COX: It is, unless you come home and he's bloody and soaking wet with sweat and panic, and that often happens when you've got your dog in a crate and you've locked him up in there for the day while you went to work. And if you think about it, if you were locked up in a small crate all day long with nothing to do you'd go crazy, too. So that's what separation anxiety is. To me, have your dog have a job. And if you train him not to destroy the stuff in your house. CHADWICK: Yeah. COX: And if you allow that dog some freedom. Give him room to roam around a little bit. Let him be able to see outside. Give him a job to do. Even if the job is taking his toys and putting them all on one side of the house and then moving them to the other side of the house, and watching the house for you. CHADWICK: How do you explain to the dog that this is his occupation for the day? COX: Because you make such a big deal out of what a good boy he's been when he does it when you're home. You do this on weekends, and if you get a new dog, you probably should take some vacation time. CHADWICK: An editor on our program said that he already had a kind of a treatment for separation anxiety in his dog. When he leaves the house in the morning, he gives the dog a treat so the dog, you know, doesn't mind seeing him go that much. COX: That's right. Give him a treat and leave calmly and quietly. Another thing is, all of the pet stores have these educational toys that you can put treats inside of them and they have to work them out through a puzzle sort of thing. CHADWICK: Uh-huh. COX: Leave a talk shows--NPR's really a good one to have on because they hear human voices. CHADWICK: Ms. Cox, are you saying that it would be a good way to treat your dog for separation anxiety - leave DAY TO DAY running pretty much all the time? COX: Yeah. I'm serious. Because it gives them a human voice, and most of the time it is not an angry voice. It is a voice of calmness and intelligence. You don't want a crazy show on that is going to make them think that they have to, you know, get out or do something.

It is reasonable to assume that some of those particles, some debris - drifted to Earth. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ALEX COHEN, Host: A dark day for the Man of Steel and potentially great news for Lex Luthor, geologists say they're discovered a rock in Serbia that has a similar chemical composition to kryptonite. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SUPERMAN\")HACKMAN: (As Lex Luther) That's kryptonite, Superman, a little souvenir from the old hometown. I spared no expense to make you feel right at home. COHEN: Yes, that's right, kryptonite, the fictional chemical compound that renders Superman powerless. Joining us now is Chris Stanley. He's a mineralogist at London's Natural History Museum. Welcome. CHRIS STANLEY: Hi there. COHEN: If you could please, tell us a little bit about what exactly it is that you've found. If I recall, the kryptonite of Superman lore is usually green and in a crystal form. Is that similar to what you're discovered? STANLEY: No, not at all. The new mineral that is actually called Jadarite because we can't call it kryptonite because it doesn't contain any krypton, is a sodium lithium boron silicate hydroxide. So it's similar in composition to what has been called kryptonite in \"Superman Returns,\" but it's certainly different in appearance. It's not green. It's white, and it's powdery, and actually it's pretty boring. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)COHEN: Wait, wait, now you said that you can't call it kryptonite because it doesn't contain any krypton. STANLEY: That's right. COHEN: Is krypton an actual thing? STANLEY: Krypton is a natural element, yes. It is a real chemical element. COHEN: And remind me, the name that you are going to call this rock that you've discovered is. . . ? STANLEY: It's Jadarite after the place where it was found in Serbia. COHEN: Although it sounds like it could be something straight out of the Superman films. STANLEY: Oh, it does. Yeah. COHEN: So what exactly about this kryptonite-like substance is kryptonite-like? STANLEY: It's the chemistry, really. It's the fact that - when I did a Google search on the chemistry, sodium lithium boron silicate hydroxide, and out popped kryptonite. Well, in \"Superman Returns,\" an additional piece of kryptonite is found in a rock fragment, and the scientific name for the rock was displayed on its case as sodium lithium boron silicate hydroxide with fluorine. COHEN: If we might venture for a moment out of the world of Superman and into the real world, is there any practical application for what's been discovered in Serbia? STANLEY: Yes. Lithium and boron are very important elements, and lithium is important in batteries and in the pharmaceutical industry for instance. Boron has also high-tech applications, is used in borosilicate glasses and other applications. COHEN: Chris Stanley is a mineralogist at London's Natural History Museum. Thank you so much. STANLEY: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SUPERMAN\") GENE HACKMAN: (As Lex Luthor) Fragments from the planet Krypton exploded and went into outer space. It is reasonable to assume that some of those particles, some debris - drifted to Earth. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ALEX COHEN, Host:  A dark day for the Man of Steel and potentially great news for Lex Luthor, geologists say they're discovered a rock in Serbia that has a similar chemical composition to kryptonite. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SUPERMAN\") HACKMAN: (As Lex Luther) That's kryptonite, Superman, a little souvenir from the old hometown. I spared no expense to make you feel right at home. COHEN: Yes, that's right, kryptonite, the fictional chemical compound that renders Superman powerless. Joining us now is Chris Stanley. He's a mineralogist at London's Natural History Museum. Welcome. CHRIS STANLEY: Hi there. COHEN: If you could please, tell us a little bit about what exactly it is that you've found. If I recall, the kryptonite of Superman lore is usually green and in a crystal form. Is that similar to what you're discovered? STANLEY: No, not at all. The new mineral that is actually called Jadarite because we can't call it kryptonite because it doesn't contain any krypton, is a sodium lithium boron silicate hydroxide. So it's similar in composition to what has been called kryptonite in \"Superman Returns,\" but it's certainly different in appearance. It's not green. It's white, and it's powdery, and actually it's pretty boring. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) COHEN: Wait, wait, now you said that you can't call it kryptonite because it doesn't contain any krypton. STANLEY: That's right. COHEN: Is krypton an actual thing? STANLEY: Krypton is a natural element, yes. It is a real chemical element. COHEN: And remind me, the name that you are going to call this rock that you've discovered is. . . ? STANLEY: It's Jadarite after the place where it was found in Serbia. COHEN: Although it sounds like it could be something straight out of the Superman films. STANLEY: Oh, it does. Yeah. COHEN: So what exactly about this kryptonite-like substance is kryptonite-like?

The resident bonobos there recently acquired two new neighbors when the Iowa Department of Natural Resources donated a pair of trumpeter swans to the trust. Thus far, the swans remain nameless, but not for long. Bonobos are a highly intelligent ape species that resembles chimpanzees, so Karyl Swartz, a cognitive scientist at the institute, is asking them to name their new feathered friends. I spoke with Ms. Swartz recently about the two sibling bonobos, a male and a female, who have been charged with naming the swans. Dr. KARYL SWARTZ (Cognitive Scientist, Great Ape Trust of Iowa): Kanzi is a 26-year-old male. Panbanisha is his sister. She's 21 now, and I think Panbanisha has a little bit bigger vocabulary, but Kanzi is much more responsive and reactive and uses his own vocalizations. Panbanisha is much more considered in her responses. ELLIOTT: She's a little more thoughtful. Dr. SWARTZ: She is, and so I would say that he's more vocal than she is, but that doesn't mean that he's more adept at language. I think they're both very, very skilled. ELLIOTT: But you don't have a conversation with them like I'm a having a conversation with you. How do you communicate with them? Dr. SWARTZ: Well, we do have a conversation. We can understand the general nature of their vocalizations. They gesture, and we certainly can read their gestures, and they can read ours. They have a lexigram vocabulary. ELLIOTT: What exactly is a lexigram? Dr. SWARTZ: A lexigram is an abstract symbol or an abstract design. There are a variety of words on their lexigrams, so we can point to the lexigrams. We also use spoken English as we point, and they point to the lexigrams in response to us or to request something from us. So it is a back-and-forth interaction; it's just not limited to words. ELLIOTT: How do you know that the bonobo is taking that to a different level, that it is an actual linguistic skill? Dr. SWARTZ: Well, we can make observations first, and I think if you observe your dog and say the word \"walk,\" that's when the ears go up and the excitement occurs, but the rest of the sentence may not be processed. The bonobos are much more sensitive to a large number of words. They can put words together in unique ways. An example would be, \"Kanzi, can you put the pine needles into the refrigerator? \" And he would pick up pine needles from among a large number of objects, take them over, open the refrigerator, and put them in. That's a big concept. ELLIOTT: Now, are you going to give them certain choices, certain names to choose from? Dr. SWARTZ: That seems like a reasonable approach, is to give them a list of names that, from our interactions with them, we think might be appropriate for the swans. Maybe they would want to name them - name one of them White, because they are white. Maybe they would want to name them something like Big, because they're big. But also, there are certain things in their environment that they are interested in, and right now, one of the bonobo staff is reading \"Harry Potter\" to them. So we all, kind of, think that one of the birds might be named Harry Potter. ELLIOTT: Karyl Swartz is a cognitive scientist at the Great Ape Trust in Des Moines, Iowa. Thank you for talking with us.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. This is the time of year when wildlife biologists around the country perform a controversial task. They destroy the eggs of a bird so beautiful, it is celebrated in fairy tales. The bird is the European mute swan. Biologists say the swans threaten native birds, but that isn't deterring some animal rights activists. As NPR's John Nielsen reports, they are fighting to save the swans. JOHN NIELSEN: Mute swans are big and elegant looking and white as snow, but they're not really mute. In fact, when they're angry, they can be downright loud. (Soundbite of machinery) Mr. JONATHAN McKNIGHT (Associate Wildlife Director, Maryland Department of Natural Resources): Do you see the way the wings are held up? NIELSEN: Yeah. Mr. McKNIGHT: That's the beginning of his aggressive display. He's letting us know that he's not happy with us here. He's making himself big. NIELSEN: Jonathan McKnight is a swan expert with the State of Maryland. He's just led me to a mute swan nest in a reedy wetland near the Chesapeake Bay, where an angry male swan looks like he's about to try and chase us away. (Soundbite of water splashing) Mr. McKNIGHT: Oh, charge(ph). (Soundbite of water splashing) NIELSEN: Fifty years ago, there were no wild mute swans in this part of the Chesapeake Bay, according to McKnight, but there were people in the area who imported swans from Europe because they like the way they looked. Mr. McKNIGHT: All of Maryland's swans started out as lawn ornaments in an estate over on the eastern shore. NIELSEN: Then, in 1962, five swans got loose from that estate and started breeding in the wild. By the year 2000, there were 4,000 mute swans, and the population was doubling every four years. McKnight says these foreign swans started chasing native water birds off crucial breeding grounds. He learned how aggressive those swans can be by watching them respond to robotic decoys of native birds. Mr. McKNIGHT: They would fly down and attack them and eventually tore the head off one of the decoys. NIELSEN: Those tests helped convince state officials that the mute swans would have to go. And so they started shooting adult mute swans. They also started sending biologists like Jonathan McKnight out to addle or kill the big green eggs mute swans lay in nests like this one. Mr. McKNIGHT: So we've got seven eggs, and I'm going to squirm them down with a liberal coat of corn oil. (Soundbite of squirming) NIELSEN: The oil keeps the eggs from breathing, killing them but leaving them intact. McKnight says the adult swans will sit on these dead eggs for months until it's too late to lay more. Mr. McKNIGHT: If you stomp on the eggs, the swans will very quickly lay again. NIELSEN: These eradication programs have reduced the number of mute swans in Maryland from 4,000 to about 1,500. Mainstream environmental groups say they approve, but animal rights activists are furious. Ms. TERESA CUMMINGS (Head, Poplar Spring Wildlife Center): It's a horrible thing. I can't see how anybody could call that humane. NIELSEN: Terry Cummings runs the nonprofit Poplar Spring Wildlife Sanctuary in Poolesville, Maryland. She shelters injured and abused animals, including some lucky turkeys. (Soundbite of turkeys crowing) Ms. CUMMINGS: This big one is Victor(ph). He was found on Thanksgiving Day walking down a sidewalk. NIELSEN: Then, there's Amanda(ph), a female mute swan brought here to recover from a bad case of lead poisoning. Cummings thinks the State of Maryland has made a scapegoat out of Amanda and other mute swans, blaming them for environmental problems that are really caused by humans. Ms. CUMMINGS: You know, there's things that we can change about what we're doing that should absolutely happen first rather than killing animals to solve the problem. NIELSEN: In Maryland and other states, Cummings and her colleagues have sued to stop the mute swan killing programs, but so far, they've only slowed them down. (Soundbite of water splashing) NIELSEN: Jonathan McKnight, the biologist, says it's not an easy thing to kill a bird as beautiful as the mute swan. Mr. McKNIGHT: This is a battle between the hearts and minds of Marylanders, and, you know, it's one of those things where you need to get your mind, your knowledge and our science about the Chesapeake Bay to override the part of your heart that says this bird is so beautiful it can't possibly be bad. (Soundbite of water splashing) NIELSEN: McKnight will be out on the field oiling eggs for a few more weeks. He expects to keep hunting down nests until the wild swans have all but disappeared.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Sick and tired of petty office politics? That claustrophobic cubicle getting you down, looking for a new and unconventional career path? Well, there's a world of opportunity and easy money in pharmaceutical trials. In a recent article for \"Wired\" magazine, Josh McHugh wrote about the growing subculture of what he calls drug test cowboys - human guinea pigs who volunteer to participate in clinical trials for a price. For some, it's a quick and easy way to pay off a college debt, for others a way to tie themselves over between jobs, and a few have managed to turn it into a career. The perks include flexible hours and relatively little responsibility. The downside? Uncomfortable and potentially dangerous side effects, and, well, you know, these are experiments. If you've ever been a human lab rat, call and tell us what it was, how much you got paid, whether it was worth it. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. Email: talk@npr. org. And you can also join the conversation on our blog, npr. org/blogofthenation. Later on in the program, why the FCC should stay out of the debate over violence on television. But first, \"Drug Test Cowboys\". Josh McHugh is a contributing editor to \"Wired\" magazine and the author of the article \"Drug Test Cowboys\". He joins us now from the studios of KQED, our member station in San Francisco. Nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION. Mr. JOSH McHUGH (Contributing Editor, \"Wired\" Magazine): Thanks for having me on. CONAN: And you interviewed some of these human guinea pigs. What did they say when you asked them why they did it? Mr. McHUGH: They had a variety of reasons. I think one of the deepest reasons for all of them is that it's a pretty original way to make a living, that they're sort of giving the bird to the system - that they all have a very subversive kind of vibe to them. CONAN: Well, you cite a famous incident from Britain where people got seriously ill in one of these studies just last year. This can be dangerous. Mr. McHUGH: It can indeed. Yeah, the guys in the U. K. really had a bad time of it. There were, I guess, eight subjects - six of them got this compound called TGN1412, and two of them got placebos. And the six who got the compound basically endured a terrible, terrible organ damage when the compound turned their T cells against them. CONAN: And presumably, when you sign up for one of these things, one of the things you do when you say I'll accept money for this is sign a waiver saying you don't have too many rights if things go wrong. Mr. McHUGH: That's true. It's interesting they're - I think they're starting some legal proceedings against the company that ran the testing in the U. K. case. So we'll see how that shakes out. But yeah, it's very clear in most cases exactly what is - what's going to happen during the experiment, the only thing that's not crystal clear is the results. . . CONAN: Yup. Mr. McHUGH: . . . of the effects. CONAN: Well, a lot of these tests are to see whether these things are safe or not. And sometimes they're not. And I assume the riskier it is, the more intrusive the kinds of tests you have to endure, the more money you can make. Mr. McHUGH: That's right. A few of the guys I talked to mentioned that in some European countries, the controls are a little less stringent than what the FDA requires here, and that the result is that the money's better. CONAN: And how much money can somebody make? Mr. McHUGH: Well, the folks that I talked to talked about making $10,000 for a three-week, in-patient study. Those aren't very common. And that's part of the skill of the making a living being a professional guinea pig, is finding those high-paying studies and getting into them. CONAN: And making sure you can qualify for them, because for one thing, this was fascinating: you can't be too fit. Mr. McHUGH: Well, in my case, for sure, what they were looking for was - the study that I did, they were looking for someone with an average American diet and that an average or below average level of fitness. And it was a shock to me at that time, but I qualified easily in both of those categories. CONAN: And your particular test was - the one trial, you were - it was the Paleolithic diet? Mr. McHUGH: That's right. CONAN: And so you were eating what? A lot of raw food? Mr. McHUGH: I was. I was eating nothing - no processed foods, no salt, and no dairy. So I was eating vegetables, fruits and meat all day, everyday for 17 days in row. CONAN: No salt, no sugar, nothing like that? Mr. McHUGH: That's right. I mean, only what was already in the foods, you know, whatever salt is in, you know, pork and chicken from their diets, and then sugar from the fruit. That was it. CONAN: Well, I could see how this might give you a desperate urge for a little Tabasco sauce, but other than that, it doesn't sound too terrible. Mr. McHUGH: Well, it doesn't. The hard thing about it was really the monotony and also the lugging around an immense amount of food. Because the average American diet is so densely packed with calories, you don't have to eat all that much to get a ton of calories. So when you go back the Paleolithic menu, you actually need a lot of food to make up the normal caloric intake. CONAN: So you lost weight, you reported. Your cholesterol levels looked terrific afterwards. Mr. McHUGH: That's right. There was - it was ringing success, the diet was, and yeah. And I only found out after the test that going into it, my insulin resistance was at a level that they called pre-diabetic. So - and then when I was finished with the test, it was sort of in a very acceptable range. So it worked. CONAN: Now, our guest is John - Josh McHugh, a contributing editor, \"Wired\" magazine, author of the article \"Drug Test Cowboys. \" If you'd like to join us 800-989-8255 - 800-989-TALK. Email: talk@npr. org. And you can also check out our blog: npr. org/blogofthenation. Let's get a caller on the line. This is Margot - Margot with us from Fort Myers in Florida. Hi. MARGOT (Caller): Hi. So glad to be on. I did a birth control test for about six months on a pill that was on the market, but the patent was up. So they reformulated it, and they had to redo all the tests. So it was - I felt very safe in it because it was already something that was on the market. I got free medical care for six months, and this with relationship to the pill. And $75 when I'm done, which is next week. CONAN: Which is next week. And the testing for this, what - did they come by and take blood every once in a while or something? MARGOT: Well, you know, what they did was I just fill out a diary everyday to say, you know, how my body was reacting to the pill. If things were - you know, just how things were, and I would call the nurse if I felt there was a problem. They also gave me lots of free pregnancy tests to keep at home in case I was afraid that maybe the pill wasn't working. So that's $40 a packet. . . (Soundbite of laughter) MARGOT: . . . that I'm saving, and just have those stashed away. So yeah. It wasn't - certainly not something that I could make a career with, but it was a positive thing, you now, for the last six months. Saved a little bit of money. And after next week, I'll have a little bit more in my pocket. And no harm, no foul. CONAN: Thanks very much. MARGOT: Yeah. CONAN: I was interested - Josh McHugh, you write in your piece that researchers need 10 million human test subjects every year. Mr. McHUGH: That's right. There are a lot of drugs in development. And, you know, every pharmaceutical company is cranking through as many new compounds as they can trying to beat everybody else to the market with the next Viagra or -and hopefully not the next Vioxx. CONAN: Yeah. Joining us now is Robert Helms. He's the editor and principal author of the zine Guinea Pig Zero. He's participated in his share of clinical trials over the years. He's with us by phone from Philadelphia. Nice to have you on the program today. Mr. ROBERT HELMS (Author, \"Guinea Pig Zero\"): Hello, Neal. CONAN: And. . . Mr. HELMS: Glad to be here. CONAN: Oh, good. You're not on the phone. You're in a studio. Where are you? Mr. HELMS: Yes. At RTI in Philadelphia. CONAN: Okay. The radio station there in Philadelphia. Nice to talk to you. And Josh McHugh was saying earlier on that there's sort of a subversive streak in a lot of the people who do this. Would you agree with that? Mr. HELMS: Yes, I would. Well, it's viewed as an occupation, as a job, not as some kind of altruistic activity for humanity, especially in my case. I can't afford health care so whatever benefits the humanity, I'm going to be at the back of the line when - if I ever need it. But yes, there's a - I'd say there's several of streak. CONAN: How did you get into that line of work? Mr. HELMS: Well, I left a good-paying job as a union organizer and a lot of my friends in West Philadelphia had been doing these things for quite a while, for years, and were - in some cases were living only on that income. And so I just got together a list of phone numbers from them and they told me what to say and what not to say. And I was in very good health. And so, you know, I really did qualify and all that. So I just went and tried it out. CONAN: And I understand from Josh McHugh's article in Wired magazine that you were among the people who really was instrumental in getting better pay for a lot of these people. Mr. HELMS: Well, I did a lot of things. I wrote report cards on research units from the guinea pig's perspective in the early issues, and most of the issues of the scene. And some of these got quite a bit of attention. In fact, got sued by a hospital chain in Philadelphia once. You know, it started to get a lot of media coverage, sometimes on a national level in the late '90s. So the complaints I was making were getting, you know, a lot of circulation and were being talked about by, you know, all the (unintelligible). CONAN: But he writes that basically in one trial you sort of organized everybody. You got a position. . . Mr. HELMS: That's right. CONAN: . . . demanded more money and said we're all going to walk out unless you give us some more money. Mr. HELMS: Well, we didn't put it quite that bluntly. But we made noise, sort of like on the side so that the nurses were overhearing us talking about walking out. This is at the other end of my time doing guinea pig work. This is the second from the last study I did. We complained and I wrote up a petition and we just made noises about leaving before the end of the study to get into a better paying study that pays us fairly. And the nurses had, you know, a period of time when they were negotiating with the drug manufacturer, which is where the money comes from. And so finally they. . . CONAN: They saw the light. Mr. HELMS: . . . they gave in. And they gave us some $800 pay increase each. CONAN: And pretty substantial. Mr. HELMS: Yes. We thought so. CONAN: We're talking with Josh McHugh of Wired magazine and Robert Helm, editor and principal author of the zine Guinea Pig Zero. If you'd like to join the conversation, 800-989-8255. I'm Neal Conan. We'll be back after the break. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. A little bit later in the program, we'll hear an argument that the FCC should stay out of the debate over violence on TV. But right now we're talking about drug test cowboys. These are healthy people who serve as human lab rats and get paid for it, often as a one-shot, but sometimes as a temporary job. And for some people it's a career. Josh McHugh wrote the article \"Drug Test Cowboys\" for the current issue of Wired magazine. He's still with us from KQAD in San Francisco. Also with us, Robert Helms, editor and principal author of the zine Guinea Pig Zero. He's with us from WRTI in Philadelphia. And if you've been a human guinea pig, give us a call, 800-989-8255. 800-989-TALK. Email is talk@npr. org. Let's get a caller on the line. This is Carrie. Carrie with us on the line from Boise, Iowa. Boise, excuse me, that's gotta be Idaho. Yes. Ms. CARRIE (Caller): Hi. I used to conduct clinical trials for about 10 years here in Boise, and I did women's trials. And a lot of the women I saw were elderly women who didn't have health insurance and who were not going to get any kind of routine medical cost or care if they weren't in these trials. And I had a lot of women who would go, as we called them, rolling from trial to trial because it was how they got their medical coverage. CONAN: Hmm. And how did they deal? I mean this is not an easy thing to do sometimes. CARRIE: It's not. Because you really do have to lay a lot of your personal life for some of this trials out, and some them require a major psychological component. And you have to be pretty honest and there's a lot of invasive testing and - excuse me - may not mean it necessarily pay a lot, but they get a lot of free medical attention. And a lot of women like the attention because in clinical trials you see people, you see your coordinators so much more often. They like seeing that one-on-one attention more frequently. CONAN: Robert Helms, the free medical care, I guess that's part of the attraction. Mr. HELMS: No. It sometimes does occur that, you know, a good number of times like a person will discover that they have an illness because they have the screening. Or - I remember a girl who found out she had leukemia by screening for a study, and now she's dead. But I don't think that it should be considered medical care. I think it should be a small consideration in the big picture, because it's already not fair that the person doesn't have medical care that they can afford. Good medical care that they can afford. So if you say that it's compensation to get some free medical care when you're, well, if you're talking about someone like me, you're healthy in the first place. But it's really - I consider free medical care as, you know, as an advertisement of part of the benefits of doing the study is kind of a curveball. . . CONAN: Okay. Mr. HELMS: . . . in my personal opinion and in many people's opinion, because it's just - the subject is doing the company a service. It's not the other way around. CARRIE: Okay. CONAN: Yeah. Okay. I wonder, Josh McHugh, did other people mention this when you talk to them? Mr. McHUGH: Yeah. A couple of the guys sort of pointed it out. I don't think it was the primary reason for that particular career choice. But you know, one fellow that I wrote about in Florida, you know, he said that he had worked other jobs. He'd been a contractor and, you know, hit his thumb with the hammer and seen guys get electrocuted. And he said, you know, if anything goes wrong with me while I'm on this job, I'll definitely get medical attention. CONAN: All right. Carrie, thanks very much for the call. CARRIE: Thank you so much. CONAN: So long. Let's see if we can talk now with Susan. And Susan with us from Denver, Colorado. SUSAN (Caller): Yes. I was in a drug - I'm in a drug trial for botox equivalent. I'm seeing one of the leading dermatologists in Denver. And in my original examination they discovered I had facial skin cancer. CONAN: Hmm. So in this case the screening turned out to be to your benefit. SUSAN: Yes. And I'm getting free treatment of the lines on my forehead with a drug that's been used in 60 other countries. CONAN: So you feel pretty secure about it? SUSAN: Yeah. CONAN: Josh. . . SUSAN: Very good doctor. CONAN: Yeah. Thanks very much. Good luck with it. SUSAN: All right. Thank you. CONAN: And Josh McHugh, one of the fascinating things about your article was the amount of preparation that these people go to, going online to find out what studies are available, what they need to qualify for it, how long these substances that they're going to be using will be in their system, so they know how long before they can get into the next clinical trial. Mr. McHUGH: Right. Yeah. That's one of the things that Bob Helms mentioned to me when we first talked, is the half-life of the compounds that are being tested is a really significant piece of data for professional guinea pigs to have. CONAN: And I wonder, Bob Helms - Bob Helm. . . Mr. HELMS: Yes? CONAN: . . . there's preparation that you need to go to for a trial. Mr. HELM: Well, you have to be free of drugs. Usually you can't smoke. You can't be a smoker. And you can't even take vitamins. But you also have to understand that you're competing with other people for the same slot in the same drug study. So you have to not start going into every little detail of -every little fine point of your real medical history. You have to just go there and be a healthy person. CONAN: I see. Mr. HELM: And so if you go in to say, you know, my aunt just came down with a cancer and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you're just giving them work that they don't need to know and they don't really want to know, unless you tell them. Then it's their job to deal with the information. And also, you should - one thing that came up in the article, and Josh, I love the article, it's very fine. But the thing about the poppy seeds. . . CONAN: Ah, poppy seed bagels. Yeah. Mr. HELMS: I've been, I've been, I used to believe in it for years and I used to talk about all the time, but. . . CONAN: That it would show up as opiates. Mr. HELMS: You'd have to drink like a pint glass of poppy seeds and an hour later be tasted and it would come up a trace amount. It's not like a heroin reading. CONAN: And now, Robert Helms, I understand that you're not retired from active participation in clinical trials. Mr. HELMS: Right. I turned 46 and then I was out of the 18 to 45 range, which is usually what they need. CONAN: So you're no longer in the desirable demographic. Mr. HELMS: Right. And I tried to get into a few in France after that. And my French wasn't good enough, so they played it by the book and didn't let me in. CONAN: Robert Helms, thanks very much for being with us today. Thanks for your time. Mr. HELMS: Thank you, sir. CONAN: Robert Helms, editor and principal author of the zine Guinea Pig Zero. He joined us today from WRTI in Philadelphia. Obviously there are ethical implications to human testing. To talk more about that we've called on Arthur Caplan, chair of Medical Ethics at the University of Pennsylvania, author of the book Smart Mice, Not So Smart People. He's with us today from our bureau in Chicago. Nice to have you on the program today. Mr. ARTHUR CAPLAN (University of Pennsylvania): Hey, how are you, Neal? CONAN: There is obviously a board set up that screens. What are the procedures you have to go through before you start testing stuff on human beings? Mr. CAPLAN: Well, basically research involves sometimes medicines, sometimes not. When it's going to be a drug or a device you start with animals, and then there's a group of people that are going to get that medicine first. That's going to be a safety study. So the first group of humans know that it's been tested on animals, but that doesn't always tell them that it's safe. And so you're going to try it in human beings - that first group probably 20 or 30 people. And they're going to try and see how much of a dose you can tolerate. Then the next step is to see if you can figure out what dose actually has some biological effect. That's phase two. Phase three is testing the thing that has the biological effect in a lot of people. And phase four is Vioxx, that's when it's actually prescribed but you're still supposed to report the side effects back. So most of what we're talking about here today for medicines is people in phase one, the safety studies. But Neal, you can also do studies if you have pesticides or bleach or perfume or underarm deodorants. Somebody's gotta stick that on their skin and see whether it causes a problem. Those are simply safety studies. They have nothing to do with coming up with a drug or a medicine. And that goes on too. There's a lot of human testing that people get paid for for that. And occasionally there's a study where the researchers just wants to understand how the human body functions. Let's say I want to know how long I can keep somebody awake and have them performing tasks, or I want to see whether three people can get along in a small space because I'm trying to figure out how to get people to Mars. Those are what we call challenge studies. They're not aimed at a drug. They're not aimed to the device. They're kind of aimed to understanding how human beings function. And there's some hilarious anecdotes that come out of the paid world of sleep deprivation studies, which I've been in myself, as a matter of fact. CONAN: Well, let me ask you about that in a minute, but I did want to say, obviously there's the example of the infamous Tuskegee incident, the syphilis study years ago. Then there's also been controversy over testing of prisoners, which used to be done as well, where there was, you know, voluntary cooperation - was it really voluntary or not? All of these, the practices - the ethical practices there are today have benefited from these sometimes disastrous mistakes of the past? Mr. CAPLAN: They have. Routinely, in the 1940s, 50s, people would have said experimentation is risky, a nasty business, and something that you do on people in institutions or prisoners, or people who you thought were inferior, like African-American people at the time. You really exploited people with disabilities, people - on grounds of race. What shifted is today, we think of research as relatively safe. Very few people are injured in research or harmed. It's a tiny number of people. And for many diseases, you don't have to twist anybody's arm to get into research. They're lining up if they have Parkinsonism or depression or disseminated cancer. They want to be in research. So the protections that have evolved from Tuskegee, from the prison experiments, from the Nazi concentration camp experiments are basically three things. First, you have to give informed consent, and so everybody gets a form that says here's the risk. Here's the benefits. Here's what we're doing. Secondly, it has to be approved by a board called an institutional review board to make sure that the research protocol was reasonable, and to make sure that the information that the subject gets is honest. In the Tuskegee study, everybody gave consent, they just lied to them and said they were giving them treatment. The third thing is to make sure that any conflicts of interest that the researcher has are disclosed. So if I'm signing you up to be in the study and I'm paying you, but I get paid a hundred dollars a head every person I have recruited into the study, in theory, I'm supposed to I'm supposed to disclose that, although I'll tell you, Neal, it doesn't always happen. CONAN: I bet not. Also, you've advocate - you're one of the people who advocate that if doctors are going to get doctor experiments on human beings, they ought to do it on themselves as well. Dr. CAPLAN: I do. I think that obviously, certain types of research you can't do it yourself. If you are trying to study skin cancer and don't have it, the doctor can't do anything about that. CONAN: Right. Dr. CAPLAN: But if you're going to say, you know, I think this is a relatively mild safety study, and the substance can be put on your skin, I think you should put in on your own skin first. There's been a long history in medicine of doing the first experiment on yourself. I, you know what a heart catheterization is, where we sort of wind a wire up into your heart to take a look at what's going on in there, it comes up through a artery in your leg. The first person who did that did it on himself - Werner Forssmann (unintelligible). (Soundbite of laughter) CONAN: They've also named a famous hospital for Walter Reed. Mr. CAPLAN: That's right. And so yellow fever experiments - many, many experiments traditionally were done first with the at least the research are being able to say, look. This isn't so dangerous. It isn't so nasty. I've done it, I can tell you about it. Now what's happened in recent times, as we've gone to this more market-driven business of researches, the researchers don't worry about it. They figure the people are getting paid, and literally, they don't care as much. CONAN: We're talking with Arthur Caplan, director of University of Pennsylvania's studies for Bioethics and Josh McHugh, a contributor to \"Wired\" magazine about \"Drug Test Cowboys. \" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And let's get another caller on the line. This is Paul - Paul with us from Appleton, Wisconsin. PAUL(Caller): Hi. CONAN: Hi. PAUL: Thanks for having me, I love NPR. CONAN: Thank you. PAUL: I love doing drug studies. I've been doing them full time for two years now. CONAN: For two years. PAUL: For two years. CONAN: And how many studies have you participated in? PAUL: I guess I should have thought of that while I was on hold. I would say 15, 20. CONAN: Fifteen to 20, and you get typically paid how much? PAUL: What's funny is when I was listening, I remembered that the first study I ever did was $75 for some nasal spray study where I had to do the diary and call in. Then I found out about the big thousand dollar ones. And so most of the studies that I do are 2,000 to - I guess the biggest one I ever did was 11,000. CONAN: Wow. Josh McHugh, you - it's right that some people might make 40,000 to $50,000 thousand a year on doing this, which is, you know, not all that much more than a barista makes. Nevertheless, there are some benefits. Mr. McHUGH: Benefits - how do you mean? CONAN: Well, that, A, you don't have to work very hard. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. McHUGH: Well, that is a huge benefit. I mean, you know, the study I did was small potatoes from a money point of view because it was pretty much guaranteed to be at least not harmful and possibly, as it was in the end, beneficial. But, yeah, the nice thing about it is that you get this feeling of sort of being taken care of. You know, the nurses and the researchers in my study were all, you know, very professional and just - and very nice. And you're sort of almost being waited on hand on foot. And yeah, I mean, you have a lot of free time. And you know, some guys use the free time to do research on other clinical studies that are coming up to - you know, to visit next and do these trainings for him. CONAN: Paul, how much longer are going be doing this? PAUL: Until I am forced to do something otherwise - I guess, until, you know, until something changes in my life. I love doing studies, I feel healthiest when I'm in them. I love to travel. I love the free time. I met my lovely in girlfriend Kamela(ph), who I love very much - little Kamela - in a drug study. So I guess until we get married and decide to have a family, I'm going to be doing them for the next couple of years. CONAN: Paul, good luck. PAUL: And I do have one thing to bring up about, you know, from doing studies from the inside. A lot of places, if you tell them that you have side effects, they'll drop you from the study and only pay you a pro-rated amount. And so I've seen a ton of people who do this on a regular basis conceal and not tell the study people your side effects in fear that they're going to get kicked out and get a lesser dollar amount. So I think that's one problem with the industry. But other than that, I haven't really had hardly any side effects, and none of them serious. So I think it's good business. CONAN: All right, Paul. Thanks very much. PAUL: Thank you. CONAN: And good luck to you. Here's an email from Jules, via the blog. I perform clinical trial compliance. I work at Duke University, and most well-designed trials contain provisional language. They would disallow a guinea pig from participating in too many trials. This prevents conflicts of drug interaction and hopefully keeps the trial real. And, I guess, Arthur Caplan, that's one of the safety factors that people have to take into account. Dr. CAPLAN: Well, let me cast a little pall over this line of work in the following ways. If you're getting paid a lot of money - as the caller pointed out - people often don't report side effects. That is a problem of paying more and more cash. They're trying to figure out, is the drug safe? Is a product going to cause itchy skin or an allergic reaction? And if you're in there getting ten grand and you want to keep getting it and that's your line of work, then you just don't bring up the fact that you felt nauseous four nights in a row. So that is a problem with these studies. I also know that there are people who definitely multiply enroll in studies. CONAN: Josh writes about them, yeah. Dr. CAPLAN: Yeah. And that's a problem, because you're supposed to, if you will, have no drug interaction. But if the money's good and you want to go shopping, there are definitely people who lie and just sign up for more than one. CONAN: Josh McHugh's article \"Drug Test Cowboys,\" is in the current issue of \"Wired\" magazine. Josh, thanks very much. Mr. McHUGH: Thanks for having me on, Neal. CONAN: And also, thanks to Arthur Caplan, director of the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Bioethics. Dr. CAPLAN: Thank you. CONAN: When we come back, should the FCC be involved in legislating violence on TV? This is NPR News.  NEAL CONAN, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  Sick and tired of petty office politics? That claustrophobic cubicle getting you down, looking for a new and unconventional career path? Well, there's a world of opportunity and easy money in pharmaceutical trials.  In a recent article for \"Wired\" magazine, Josh McHugh wrote about the growing subculture of what he calls drug test cowboys - human guinea pigs who volunteer to participate in clinical trials for a price. For some, it's a quick and easy way to pay off a college debt, for others a way to tie themselves over between jobs, and a few have managed to turn it into a career. The perks include flexible hours and relatively little responsibility. The downside? Uncomfortable and potentially dangerous side effects, and, well, you know, these are experiments.  If you've ever been a human lab rat, call and tell us what it was, how much you got paid, whether it was worth it. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. Email: talk@npr. org. And you can also join the conversation on our blog, npr. org/blogofthenation.  Later on in the program, why the FCC should stay out of the debate over violence on television. But first, \"Drug Test Cowboys\". Josh McHugh is a contributing editor to \"Wired\" magazine and the author of the article \"Drug Test Cowboys\". He joins us now from the studios of KQED, our member station in San Francisco.  Nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION.  Mr. JOSH McHUGH (Contributing Editor, \"Wired\" Magazine): Thanks for having me on.  CONAN: And you interviewed some of these human guinea pigs. What did they say when you asked them why they did it?  Mr. McHUGH: They had a variety of reasons. I think one of the deepest reasons for all of them is that it's a pretty original way to make a living, that they're sort of giving the bird to the system - that they all have a very subversive kind of vibe to them.  CONAN: Well, you cite a famous incident from Britain where people got seriously ill in one of these studies just last year. This can be dangerous.  Mr. McHUGH: It can indeed. Yeah, the guys in the U. K. really had a bad time of it. There were, I guess, eight subjects - six of them got this compound called TGN1412, and two of them got placebos. And the six who got the compound basically endured a terrible, terrible organ damage when the compound turned their T cells against them.  CONAN: And presumably, when you sign up for one of these things, one of the things you do when you say I'll accept money for this is sign a waiver saying you don't have too many rights if things go wrong.  Mr. McHUGH: That's true. It's interesting they're - I think they're starting some legal proceedings against the company that ran the testing in the U. K. case. So we'll see how that shakes out. But yeah, it's very clear in most cases exactly what is - what's going to happen during the experiment, the only thing that's not crystal clear is the results. . .  CONAN: Yup.  Mr. McHUGH: . . . of the effects.  CONAN: Well, a lot of these tests are to see whether these things are safe or not. And sometimes they're not. And I assume the riskier it is, the more intrusive the kinds of tests you have to endure, the more money you can make.  Mr. McHUGH: That's right. A few of the guys I talked to mentioned that in some European countries, the controls are a little less stringent than what the FDA requires here, and that the result is that the money's better.  CONAN: And how much money can somebody make?  Mr. McHUGH: Well, the folks that I talked to talked about making $10,000 for a three-week, in-patient study. Those aren't very common. And that's part of the skill of the making a living being a professional guinea pig, is finding those high-paying studies and getting into them.  CONAN: And making sure you can qualify for them, because for one thing, this was fascinating: you can't be too fit.  Mr. McHUGH: Well, in my case, for sure, what they were looking for was - the study that I did, they were looking for someone with an average American diet and that an average or below average level of fitness. And it was a shock to me at that time, but I qualified easily in both of those categories.  CONAN: And your particular test was - the one trial, you were - it was the Paleolithic diet?  Mr. McHUGH: That's right.  CONAN: And so you were eating what? A lot of raw food?  Mr. McHUGH: I was. I was eating nothing - no processed foods, no salt, and no dairy. So I was eating vegetables, fruits and meat all day, everyday for 17 days in row.  CONAN: No salt, no sugar, nothing like that?  Mr. McHUGH: That's right. I mean, only what was already in the foods, you know, whatever salt is in, you know, pork and chicken from their diets, and then sugar from the fruit. That was it.  CONAN: Well, I could see how this might give you a desperate urge for a little Tabasco sauce, but other than that, it doesn't sound too terrible.  Mr. McHUGH: Well, it doesn't. The hard thing about it was really the monotony and also the lugging around an immense amount of food. Because the average American diet is so densely packed with calories, you don't have to eat all that much to get a ton of calories. So when you go back the Paleolithic menu, you actually need a lot of food to make up the normal caloric intake.  CONAN: So you lost weight, you reported. Your cholesterol levels looked terrific afterwards.  Mr. McHUGH: That's right. There was - it was ringing success, the diet was, and yeah. And I only found out after the test that going into it, my insulin resistance was at a level that they called pre-diabetic. So - and then when I was finished with the test, it was sort of in a very acceptable range. So it worked.  CONAN: Now, our guest is John - Josh McHugh, a contributing editor, \"Wired\" magazine, author of the article \"Drug Test Cowboys. \" If you'd like to join us 800-989-8255 - 800-989-TALK. Email: talk@npr. org. And you can also check out our blog: npr. org/blogofthenation.  Let's get a caller on the line. This is Margot - Margot with us from Fort Myers in Florida. Hi.  MARGOT (Caller): Hi. So glad to be on. I did a birth control test for about six months on a pill that was on the market, but the patent was up. So they reformulated it, and they had to redo all the tests. So it was - I felt very safe in it because it was already something that was on the market. I got free medical care for six months, and this with relationship to the pill. And $75 when I'm done, which is next week.  CONAN: Which is next week. And the testing for this, what - did they come by and take blood every once in a while or something?  MARGOT: Well, you know, what they did was I just fill out a diary everyday to say, you know, how my body was reacting to the pill. If things were - you know, just how things were, and I would call the nurse if I felt there was a problem. They also gave me lots of free pregnancy tests to keep at home in case I was afraid that maybe the pill wasn't working. So that's $40 a packet. . .  (Soundbite of laughter)  MARGOT: . . . that I'm saving, and just have those stashed away. So yeah. It wasn't - certainly not something that I could make a career with, but it was a positive thing, you now, for the last six months. Saved a little bit of money. And after next week, I'll have a little bit more in my pocket. And no harm, no foul.  CONAN: Thanks very much.  MARGOT: Yeah.  CONAN: I was interested - Josh McHugh, you write in your piece that researchers need 10 million human test subjects every year.  Mr. McHUGH: That's right. There are a lot of drugs in development. And, you know, every pharmaceutical company is cranking through as many new compounds as they can trying to beat everybody else to the market with the next Viagra or -and hopefully not the next Vioxx.  CONAN: Yeah. Joining us now is Robert Helms. He's the editor and principal author of the zine Guinea Pig Zero. He's participated in his share of clinical trials over the years. He's with us by phone from Philadelphia.  Nice to have you on the program today.  Mr. ROBERT HELMS (Author, \"Guinea Pig Zero\"): Hello, Neal.  CONAN: And. . .  Mr. HELMS: Glad to be here.  CONAN: Oh, good. You're not on the phone. You're in a studio. Where are you?  Mr. HELMS: Yes. At RTI in Philadelphia.  CONAN: Okay. The radio station there in Philadelphia. Nice to talk to you. And Josh McHugh was saying earlier on that there's sort of a subversive streak in a lot of the people who do this. Would you agree with that?  Mr. HELMS: Yes, I would. Well, it's viewed as an occupation, as a job, not as some kind of altruistic activity for humanity, especially in my case. I can't afford health care so whatever benefits the humanity, I'm going to be at the back of the line when - if I ever need it. But yes, there's a - I'd say there's several of streak.  CONAN: How did you get into that line of work?  Mr. HELMS: Well, I left a good-paying job as a union organizer and a lot of my friends in West Philadelphia had been doing these things for quite a while, for years, and were - in some cases were living only on that income. And so I just got together a list of phone numbers from them and they told me what to say and what not to say. And I was in very good health. And so, you know, I really did qualify and all that. So I just went and tried it out.  CONAN: And I understand from Josh McHugh's article in Wired magazine that you were among the people who really was instrumental in getting better pay for a lot of these people.  Mr. HELMS: Well, I did a lot of things. I wrote report cards on research units from the guinea pig's perspective in the early issues, and most of the issues of the scene. And some of these got quite a bit of attention. In fact, got sued by a hospital chain in Philadelphia once. You know, it started to get a lot of media coverage, sometimes on a national level in the late '90s. So the complaints I was making were getting, you know, a lot of circulation and were being talked about by, you know, all the (unintelligible).  CONAN: But he writes that basically in one trial you sort of organized everybody. You got a position. . .  Mr. HELMS: That's right.  CONAN: . . . demanded more money and said we're all going to walk out unless you give us some more money.  Mr. HELMS: Well, we didn't put it quite that bluntly. But we made noise, sort of like on the side so that the nurses were overhearing us talking about walking out. This is at the other end of my time doing guinea pig work. This is the second from the last study I did. We complained and I wrote up a petition and we just made noises about leaving before the end of the study to get into a better paying study that pays us fairly. And the nurses had, you know, a period of time when they were negotiating with the drug manufacturer, which is where the money comes from. And so finally they. . .  CONAN: They saw the light.  Mr. HELMS: . . . they gave in. And they gave us some $800 pay increase each.  CONAN: And pretty substantial.  Mr. HELMS: Yes. We thought so.  CONAN: We're talking with Josh McHugh of Wired magazine and Robert Helm, editor and principal author of the zine Guinea Pig Zero. If you'd like to join the conversation, 800-989-8255. I'm Neal Conan. We'll be back after the break. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  A little bit later in the program, we'll hear an argument that the FCC should stay out of the debate over violence on TV. But right now we're talking about drug test cowboys. These are healthy people who serve as human lab rats and get paid for it, often as a one-shot, but sometimes as a temporary job. And for some people it's a career.  Josh McHugh wrote the article \"Drug Test Cowboys\" for the current issue of Wired magazine. He's still with us from KQAD in San Francisco. Also with us, Robert Helms, editor and principal author of the zine Guinea Pig Zero. He's with us from WRTI in Philadelphia.  And if you've been a human guinea pig, give us a call, 800-989-8255. 800-989-TALK. Email is talk@npr. org. Let's get a caller on the line. This is Carrie. Carrie with us on the line from Boise, Iowa. Boise, excuse me, that's gotta be Idaho. Yes.  Ms. CARRIE (Caller): Hi. I used to conduct clinical trials for about 10 years here in Boise, and I did women's trials. And a lot of the women I saw were elderly women who didn't have health insurance and who were not going to get any kind of routine medical cost or care if they weren't in these trials. And I had a lot of women who would go, as we called them, rolling from trial to trial because it was how they got their medical coverage.  CONAN: Hmm. And how did they deal? I mean this is not an easy thing to do sometimes.  CARRIE: It's not. Because you really do have to lay a lot of your personal life for some of this trials out, and some them require a major psychological component. And you have to be pretty honest and there's a lot of invasive testing and - excuse me - may not mean it necessarily pay a lot, but they get a lot of free medical attention. And a lot of women like the attention because in clinical trials you see people, you see your coordinators so much more often. They like seeing that one-on-one attention more frequently.  CONAN: Robert Helms, the free medical care, I guess that's part of the attraction.  Mr. HELMS: No. It sometimes does occur that, you know, a good number of times like a person will discover that they have an illness because they have the screening. Or - I remember a girl who found out she had leukemia by screening for a study, and now she's dead. But I don't think that it should be considered medical care. I think it should be a small consideration in the big picture, because it's already not fair that the person doesn't have medical care that they can afford. Good medical care that they can afford.  So if you say that it's compensation to get some free medical care when you're, well, if you're talking about someone like me, you're healthy in the first place. But it's really - I consider free medical care as, you know, as an advertisement of part of the benefits of doing the study is kind of a curveball. . .  CONAN: Okay.  Mr. HELMS: . . . in my personal opinion and in many people's opinion, because it's just - the subject is doing the company a service. It's not the other way around.  CARRIE: Okay.  CONAN: Yeah. Okay. I wonder, Josh McHugh, did other people mention this when you talk to them?  Mr. McHUGH: Yeah. A couple of the guys sort of pointed it out. I don't think it was the primary reason for that particular career choice. But you know, one fellow that I wrote about in Florida, you know, he said that he had worked other jobs. He'd been a contractor and, you know, hit his thumb with the hammer and seen guys get electrocuted. And he said, you know, if anything goes wrong with me while I'm on this job, I'll definitely get medical attention.  CONAN: All right. Carrie, thanks very much for the call.  CARRIE: Thank you so much.  CONAN: So long. Let's see if we can talk now with Susan. And Susan with us from Denver, Colorado.  SUSAN (Caller): Yes. I was in a drug - I'm in a drug trial for botox equivalent. I'm seeing one of the leading dermatologists in Denver. And in my original examination they discovered I had facial skin cancer.  CONAN: Hmm. So in this case the screening turned out to be to your benefit.  SUSAN: Yes. And I'm getting free treatment of the lines on my forehead with a drug that's been used in 60 other countries.  CONAN: So you feel pretty secure about it?  SUSAN: Yeah.  CONAN: Josh. . .  SUSAN: Very good doctor.  CONAN: Yeah. Thanks very much. Good luck with it.  SUSAN: All right. Thank you.  CONAN: And Josh McHugh, one of the fascinating things about your article was the amount of preparation that these people go to, going online to find out what studies are available, what they need to qualify for it, how long these substances that they're going to be using will be in their system, so they know how long before they can get into the next clinical trial.  Mr. McHUGH: Right. Yeah. That's one of the things that Bob Helms mentioned to me when we first talked, is the half-life of the compounds that are being tested is a really significant piece of data for professional guinea pigs to have.  CONAN: And I wonder, Bob Helms - Bob Helm. . .  Mr. HELMS: Yes?  CONAN: . . . there's preparation that you need to go to for a trial.  Mr. HELM: Well, you have to be free of drugs. Usually you can't smoke. You can't be a smoker. And you can't even take vitamins. But you also have to understand that you're competing with other people for the same slot in the same drug study. So you have to not start going into every little detail of -every little fine point of your real medical history. You have to just go there and be a healthy person.  CONAN: I see.  Mr. HELM: And so if you go in to say, you know, my aunt just came down with a cancer and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you're just giving them work that they don't need to know and they don't really want to know, unless you tell them. Then it's their job to deal with the information. And also, you should - one thing that came up in the article, and Josh, I love the article, it's very fine. But the thing about the poppy seeds. . .  CONAN: Ah, poppy seed bagels. Yeah.  Mr. HELMS: I've been, I've been, I used to believe in it for years and I used to talk about all the time, but. . .  CONAN: That it would show up as opiates.  Mr. HELMS: You'd have to drink like a pint glass of poppy seeds and an hour later be tasted and it would come up a trace amount. It's not like a heroin reading.  CONAN: And now, Robert Helms, I understand that you're not retired from active participation in clinical trials.  Mr. HELMS: Right. I turned 46 and then I was out of the 18 to 45 range, which is usually what they need.  CONAN: So you're no longer in the desirable demographic.  Mr. HELMS: Right. And I tried to get into a few in France after that. And my French wasn't good enough, so they played it by the book and didn't let me in.  CONAN: Robert Helms, thanks very much for being with us today. Thanks for your time.  Mr. HELMS: Thank you, sir.  CONAN: Robert Helms, editor and principal author of the zine Guinea Pig Zero. He joined us today from WRTI in Philadelphia.  Obviously there are ethical implications to human testing. To talk more about that we've called on Arthur Caplan, chair of Medical Ethics at the University of Pennsylvania, author of the book Smart Mice, Not So Smart People. He's with us today from our bureau in Chicago.  Nice to have you on the program today.  Mr. ARTHUR CAPLAN (University of Pennsylvania): Hey, how are you, Neal?  CONAN: There is obviously a board set up that screens. What are the procedures you have to go through before you start testing stuff on human beings?  Mr. CAPLAN: Well, basically research involves sometimes medicines, sometimes not. When it's going to be a drug or a device you start with animals, and then there's a group of people that are going to get that medicine first. That's going to be a safety study. So the first group of humans know that it's been tested on animals, but that doesn't always tell them that it's safe. And so you're going to try it in human beings - that first group probably 20 or 30 people. And they're going to try and see how much of a dose you can tolerate. Then the next step is to see if you can figure out what dose actually has some biological effect. That's phase two.  Phase three is testing the thing that has the biological effect in a lot of people. And phase four is Vioxx, that's when it's actually prescribed but you're still supposed to report the side effects back. So most of what we're talking about here today for medicines is people in phase one, the safety studies.  But Neal, you can also do studies if you have pesticides or bleach or perfume or underarm deodorants. Somebody's gotta stick that on their skin and see whether it causes a problem. Those are simply safety studies. They have nothing to do with coming up with a drug or a medicine. And that goes on too. There's a lot of human testing that people get paid for for that. And occasionally there's a study where the researchers just wants to understand how the human body functions.  Let's say I want to know how long I can keep somebody awake and have them performing tasks, or I want to see whether three people can get along in a small space because I'm trying to figure out how to get people to Mars. Those are what we call challenge studies. They're not aimed at a drug. They're not aimed to the device. They're kind of aimed to understanding how human beings function. And there's some hilarious anecdotes that come out of the paid world of sleep deprivation studies, which I've been in myself, as a matter of fact.  CONAN: Well, let me ask you about that in a minute, but I did want to say, obviously there's the example of the infamous Tuskegee incident, the syphilis study years ago. Then there's also been controversy over testing of prisoners, which used to be done as well, where there was, you know, voluntary cooperation - was it really voluntary or not? All of these, the practices - the ethical practices there are today have benefited from these sometimes disastrous mistakes of the past?  Mr. CAPLAN: They have. Routinely, in the 1940s, 50s, people would have said experimentation is risky, a nasty business, and something that you do on people in institutions or prisoners, or people who you thought were inferior, like African-American people at the time. You really exploited people with disabilities, people - on grounds of race.  What shifted is today, we think of research as relatively safe. Very few people are injured in research or harmed. It's a tiny number of people. And for many diseases, you don't have to twist anybody's arm to get into research. They're lining up if they have Parkinsonism or depression or disseminated cancer. They want to be in research.  So the protections that have evolved from Tuskegee, from the prison experiments, from the Nazi concentration camp experiments are basically three things. First, you have to give informed consent, and so everybody gets a form that says here's the risk. Here's the benefits. Here's what we're doing.  Secondly, it has to be approved by a board called an institutional review board to make sure that the research protocol was reasonable, and to make sure that the information that the subject gets is honest. In the Tuskegee study, everybody gave consent, they just lied to them and said they were giving them treatment.  The third thing is to make sure that any conflicts of interest that the researcher has are disclosed. So if I'm signing you up to be in the study and I'm paying you, but I get paid a hundred dollars a head every person I have recruited into the study, in theory, I'm supposed to I'm supposed to disclose that, although I'll tell you, Neal, it doesn't always happen.  CONAN: I bet not. Also, you've advocate - you're one of the people who advocate that if doctors are going to get doctor experiments on human beings, they ought to do it on themselves as well.  Dr. CAPLAN: I do. I think that obviously, certain types of research you can't do it yourself. If you are trying to study skin cancer and don't have it, the doctor can't do anything about that.  CONAN: Right.  Dr. CAPLAN: But if you're going to say, you know, I think this is a relatively mild safety study, and the substance can be put on your skin, I think you should put in on your own skin first. There's been a long history in medicine of doing the first experiment on yourself. I, you know what a heart catheterization is, where we sort of wind a wire up into your heart to take a look at what's going on in there, it comes up through a artery in your leg. The first person who did that did it on himself - Werner Forssmann (unintelligible).  (Soundbite of laughter)  CONAN: They've also named a famous hospital for Walter Reed.  Mr. CAPLAN: That's right. And so yellow fever experiments - many, many experiments traditionally were done first with the at least the research are being able to say, look. This isn't so dangerous. It isn't so nasty. I've done it, I can tell you about it. Now what's happened in recent times, as we've gone to this more market-driven business of researches, the researchers don't worry about it. They figure the people are getting paid, and literally, they don't care as much.  CONAN: We're talking with Arthur Caplan, director of University of Pennsylvania's studies for Bioethics and Josh McHugh, a contributor to \"Wired\" magazine about \"Drug Test Cowboys. \" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  And let's get another caller on the line. This is Paul - Paul with us from Appleton, Wisconsin.  PAUL(Caller): Hi.  CONAN: Hi.  PAUL: Thanks for having me, I love NPR.  CONAN: Thank you.  PAUL: I love doing drug studies. I've been doing them full time for two years now.  CONAN: For two years.  PAUL: For two years.  CONAN: And how many studies have you participated in?  PAUL: I guess I should have thought of that while I was on hold. I would say 15, 20.  CONAN: Fifteen to 20, and you get typically paid how much?  PAUL: What's funny is when I was listening, I remembered that the first study I ever did was $75 for some nasal spray study where I had to do the diary and call in. Then I found out about the big thousand dollar ones. And so most of the studies that I do are 2,000 to - I guess the biggest one I ever did was 11,000.  CONAN: Wow. Josh McHugh, you - it's right that some people might make 40,000 to $50,000 thousand a year on doing this, which is, you know, not all that much more than a barista makes. Nevertheless, there are some benefits.  Mr. McHUGH: Benefits - how do you mean?  CONAN: Well, that, A, you don't have to work very hard.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. McHUGH: Well, that is a huge benefit. I mean, you know, the study I did was small potatoes from a money point of view because it was pretty much guaranteed to be at least not harmful and possibly, as it was in the end, beneficial. But, yeah, the nice thing about it is that you get this feeling of sort of being taken care of. You know, the nurses and the researchers in my study were all, you know, very professional and just - and very nice. And you're sort of almost being waited on hand on foot.  And yeah, I mean, you have a lot of free time. And you know, some guys use the free time to do research on other clinical studies that are coming up to - you know, to visit next and do these trainings for him.  CONAN: Paul, how much longer are going be doing this?  PAUL: Until I am forced to do something otherwise - I guess, until, you know, until something changes in my life. I love doing studies, I feel healthiest when I'm in them. I love to travel. I love the free time. I met my lovely in girlfriend Kamela(ph), who I love very much - little Kamela - in a drug study. So I guess until we get married and decide to have a family, I'm going to be doing them for the next couple of years.  CONAN: Paul, good luck.  PAUL: And I do have one thing to bring up about, you know, from doing studies from the inside. A lot of places, if you tell them that you have side effects, they'll drop you from the study and only pay you a pro-rated amount. And so I've seen a ton of people who do this on a regular basis conceal and not tell the study people your side effects in fear that they're going to get kicked out and get a lesser dollar amount. So I think that's one problem with the industry. But other than that, I haven't really had hardly any side effects, and none of them serious. So I think it's good business.  CONAN: All right, Paul. Thanks very much.  PAUL: Thank you.  CONAN: And good luck to you. Here's an email from Jules, via the blog. I perform clinical trial compliance. I work at Duke University, and most well-designed trials contain provisional language. They would disallow a guinea pig from participating in too many trials. This prevents conflicts of drug interaction and hopefully keeps the trial real. And, I guess, Arthur Caplan, that's one of the safety factors that people have to take into account.  Dr. CAPLAN: Well, let me cast a little pall over this line of work in the following ways. If you're getting paid a lot of money - as the caller pointed out - people often don't report side effects. That is a problem of paying more and more cash.  They're trying to figure out, is the drug safe? Is a product going to cause itchy skin or an allergic reaction? And if you're in there getting ten grand and you want to keep getting it and that's your line of work, then you just don't bring up the fact that you felt nauseous four nights in a row. So that is a problem with these studies. I also know that there are people who definitely multiply enroll in studies.  CONAN: Josh writes about them, yeah.  Dr. CAPLAN: Yeah. And that's a problem, because you're supposed to, if you will, have no drug interaction. But if the money's good and you want to go shopping, there are definitely people who lie and just sign up for more than one.  CONAN: Josh McHugh's article \"Drug Test Cowboys,\" is in the current issue of \"Wired\" magazine. Josh, thanks very much.  Mr. McHUGH: Thanks for having me on, Neal.  CONAN: And also, thanks to Arthur Caplan, director of the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Bioethics.  Dr. CAPLAN: Thank you.

Here is your big chance to make a quick buck.  Houston, Texas is looking for a few good cockroaches, a thousand of them to be exact. Houston's Natural Science Museum is offering 25 cents for every live healthy roach that the public brings in.  ALEX COHEN, host: I spoke with the museum's entomology curator Nancy Greig about why she's inviting in so many creatures most people would rather avoid. Ms. NANCY GREIG (Curator of Entomology, Houston Museum of Natural Science): The idea is to teach people that cockroaches are important recyclers and we can't live without them. But we're capitalizing on a roach that's very common here in Houston, the American cockroach, which is the big thing, the big water bug we call them, or (unintelligible) down here. BRAND: Yeah. Ms. GREIG: And they actually live outside more often than they live in. But when they come in, you know, they catch your attention. BRAND: They certainly do. And you know, I used to live in New York and they sure caught my attention. And I think they caught a lot of New Yorker's attention, but not in a good way. Ms. GREIG: Not in a good way. Well, you know, cockroaches have a really unfortunate reputation. And I - one, we're trying to kind of clear that up with in this exhibit. They're really important recyclers. You know, there's 4,000 species in the world and only 12 of them ever interact with humans who come in our house. So they're our competitors and I suppose that's why they're not liked so much. Some of them have learned to live with us and eat our food, but they're not particularly dirty. People think they're associated with filth, but actually they're as clean as your house. If you have, you know, a relatively clean house, then your cockroaches will be clean too. BRAND: Boy, well. . . Ms. GREIG: They clean - they actually clean themselves quite a bit. They're like little cats that chew on their feet and their antennae and they're quite fastidious. And we hope people will learn to appreciate them, if not like them, at least realize that they do have a role in the grand scheme of things. BRAND: Well, you make them sound almost cute. Ms. GREIG: Well, some of there are. In fact, one of our displays in association with this exhibit is learn more about some cool cockroaches, and we hade some photographs, it's a little interactive, and you'll see some pictures and there's a green one called the Cuban cockroach. There's one from the Amazon that's gorgeous. It's a rusty red with a yellow band. You would never know it's a cockroach. So they're not all the brown sort of sordid looking things. BRAND: So even you. Even you. You're calling them sordid. Ms. GREIG: Well, yes. I'm sorry, but that's their reputation. I'm - we're trying to - I take it back. BRAND: Okay. Well, let me ask you why you're asking for the public to bring in these roaches. Can't you find your own, maybe in the museums, the restaurants? Ms. GREIG: Well, we - no, not in the restaurants, please. I have seen them in some of our drains. I will admit that. Well, we need a lot of them and we're very busy. And it just seemed easier - actually, this whole thing started when I sent out a message to just the museum staff. I said bring us your tired, your poor, your huddled cockroaches. We need cockroaches and offer - I said people will never bring them in unless we offer a bounty. So we offered 25 cents. And then our marketing people sent us a press release and it's received a lot of attention.  BRAND: Do you have any recommendations for the best techniques for capturing a cockroach? Ms. GREIG: For catching them? Well, you want to go a place where you know they are, so hopefully that won't be in your kitchen. I think the fastest way is to catch them by hand but most people don't want to do that, so you can make a trap. And the easiest way is take a jar and put something on the outside like a piece of pantyhose so they can climb up, but then they'll fall in and they can't get out and put some sort of bait, you know, dog food or beer or something that roaches might like to eat in the interior, and just set it in a place where they're - especially a dark place, where they're likely to come. That's one way. Like I said, I recommend grabbing them by hand but you really need two people, one to hold the jar and one to grab, because they're really fast. BRAND: Brave, two brave people. Ms. GREIG: By the time you catch a few - they don't bite. They don't sting. You know, there's nothing harmful about them, so they won't hurt you certainly. We wouldn't ask you to go catch wasps in the same way. BRAND: Okay. Well, Nancy Greig, entomology curator for the Houston Museum of Natural Science, thank you for joining us. Ms. GREIG: You're very welcome. Thank you. Catch a roach for us. BRAND: Ughh, or not. DAY TO DAY continues.  MADELEINE BRAND, host:  Listen up, New Yorkers.

I'm Ira Flatow. This hour, we're going to be talking about health care reform. And after many years of not much happening on health care reform, with the new Congress, things are beginning to free up just a little bit. And our first story this hour illustrates part of that. Consider this scenario. Scientists announced last week, they did - they announced last week the discovery of a gene that increases the risk of heart disease in certain people. Now, fast forward to the future when they have created a simple genetic test that would tell whether or not a person has that variant. Now, you're in the future and your doctor is thinking that you might be at risk, so he or she recommends that test for you. Should you take it? Would you take it? Think about it. You might be fearful of taking the test because you're worried that your insurance company could deny you coverage or a potential boss might not want to hire you if the results of that test become public. Well, a bill that passed in the House last month by a vote of 420 to three - a bill passed 420 to three - addresses those issues. It would protect people from discrimination based on genetic information. And if it becomes law, it could go a long way towards making genetic testing, as it becomes more commonplace, a routine part of medical care. It might take out some of the fear from that. Joining me now to talk about that bill, the genetic information non-discrimination act of 2007, or GINA for short, is Karen Pollitz, research professor and project director at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute in Washington, D. C. You might pronounce it as GINA, if you care. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Professor KAREN POLLITZ (Project Director, Health Policy Institute, Georgetown University): Thank you very much. FLATOW: Now, let's talk about this. How come all of a sudden we've got a vote of 420 to three, which is obviously both parties, passing a bill like this? We couldn't get something like this through Congress before. Prof. POLLITZ: Well, it is a pretty big vote. And, in fact, this bill has - it's been sitting around in Congress for a long time. It was first introduced back in 1995. Congresswoman Louise Slaughter from New York put in the genetic non-discrimination act. And Congress has looked at it for a long time, and has even taken some action on it back in 2005. Two years ago, this bill or a version of this bill passed the Senate by a vote of 98 to nothing. And two years before that, it passed the Senate by 95 to nothing, so\u2026 FLATOW: Wow. Prof. POLLITZ: When it is acted upon, it seems to get very broad bipartisan support. But it's never made it all the way through the Congress. And hopefully this year will be different. FLATOW: And the president has indicated he will what? Prof. POLLITZ: He has indicated he would sign the bill. FLATOW: Wow. From nothing to everything in almost no time. Prof. POLLITZ: Well, but we're not there yet. And as I mentioned in the past, in two previous congresses, this bill went through on the other side of the Capitol, through the Senate, by an overwhelming vote, and then just stalled in the House. And no action was taken. And now, it started on the House side, and we're waiting on the Senate to act. It has been moved through the key committee that needs to consider it, Senator Kennedy's Health Committee. And it passed by a large vote in that committee as well. But apparently, one senator has a hold on the bill. And under Senate rules, you can anonymously bottle up a bill, so that it can't come to the floor. And that's what's happening currently. Everyone's waiting to see if that can be vacated, and the bill can move through. So hopefully this is the year. FLATOW: So some senator is holding it up anonymously on the Senate side. Prof. POLLITZ: Yes. And the opposition to this bill has tended to be that way over the years. You know, for all that this has been pending for 12 years now, there's really never been sort of a strong group who would stand up and say, you know, Oh, we favor discrimination based on genetic information. So the opposition has mostly been kind of quiet and behind the scenes. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So we if find out who that senator is and hold him - he or she - up to the scrutiny of daylight. Prof. POLLITZ: That would probably be a good thing. FLATOW: That would be a good - let's talk - we talked around the bill. Tell us what exactly it would protect you from. Prof. POLLITZ: Sure. Well, the bill has two parts, two titles. The first part would prohibit health insurance companies from using the results of genetic tests to deny coverage, or raising your insurance premiums, or excluding covered benefits by declaring your genetic test information a pre-existing condition. And then the second title would prohibit employers from discriminating against their employees based on their genetic information. FLATOW: Is there a penalty with this if you don't follow that? Prof. POLLITZ: Oh, yes. Indeed. The insurance title would be enforced by federal law. The federal government would have the ability to assess fines against insurers and employer-sponsored health plans for violations of this act. And state could also continue to enforce their genetic non-discrimination laws. And state penalties often are more significant up to, and including, pulling the license of the insurance company so they can't do business. FLATOW: There are states that already have - yes. Prof. POLLITZ: Many states, yes. More than 40 states now make it illegal to discriminate based on genetic information and health insurance. So this would create that protection nationwide. FLATOW: Do you have evidence that people are choosing not to be tested because they are afraid of this information being used against them? Prof. POLLITZ: There is evidence. Francis Collins, who's the director of the National Human Genome Research Institute at NIH, has testified that as many as a third of the patients who are invited to participate in research trials that involve genetic testing have declined because they're afraid that the information might be used against them in discriminatory ways. And he's testified that that hurts all of us because scientists believe that eventually genetic research will unlock the secrets to treating and curing, and even preventing many health, serious health conditions the way you described at the beginning. So by taking discrimination off the table, it is hoped that the pace of research and that these kinds of discoveries can be advanced. FLATOW: How do we protect, and what is in the bill that might protect somebody from an employer - a potential employer or somebody already on the job who wants to use this against them? Prof. POLLITZ: Well, the bill makes it very clear that employers cannot base decisions to hire, fire, how they pay, what benefits they give or any other working conditions on genetic information. So that would be flat-out illegal and violation of that would be the violation of - similar to other discrimination laws that are prohibited under our civil rights act. In addition, employers can't even ask you about your genetic information. So it would be illegal for employers to inquire about this, except for very kind of specific exceptions. For example, where workplace safety would require that people not be exposed, for example, to toxins if they are genetically more vulnerable and so forth. So employers can't discriminate against you, and they can't even ask for this information. And when they do happen to have it because, again, sometimes there is an important workplace safety reason for employers to have this, they need to keep the information in a separate place, securely locked up. They can't disclose it to anybody else, and they can't use it against you. FLATOW: Let's go to the phones to Paula(ph) in Reno, Nevada. Hi, Paula. PAULA (Resident, Nevada): Hi. How are you? FLATOW: Fine. Go ahead. PAULA: Good. I just wanted to comment about this whole thing. My brother passed away of Alpha-1 anti-trypsin, which is a genetic disease. And he has children were refusing to have them tested. We've had him tested privately but not, you know, recorded. So that's just one comment. FLATOW: So you're now happy to hear about this because these kids can be tested or they're not be fearful of it affecting their employment or their health coverage. PAULA: Very happy with it, yes. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. All right. Thanks for calling. PAULA: Thank you. FLATOW: See, already people are talking about it. Prof. POLLITZ: Well, it is important. It is incredibly important. There was actually testimony at one of the hearings that I participated in where it was discussed that a mother who had that very same condition, alpha-1 antitrypsin, had trouble getting her children health insurance because they carried these - this same kind of genetic mutation. They didn't have the condition, but because they were carriers, a health insurance company refused to sell them health insurance. So this - it is a very real fear, this fear of discrimination, and very important for the Congress to act quickly to take that off the table. FLATOW: Well, let's talk a bit about privacy. Is there anything in this bill that guarantees the privacy of the genetic information? Prof. POLLITZ: It is mostly a nondiscrimination bill. So it's not a privacy bill per se, although there are some privacy provisions. In health insurance, currently, genetic information is treated like all other personal health information, and it is subject to the privacy protections under HIPA, those HIPA forms that you fill out in your doctor's waiting rooms. Those protections currently apply to genetic information and would continue to. So in health insurance context, when your information gets used in paying health insurance claims, there are protections and there are penalties including even up to criminal penalties for violating those. Importantly, the HIPA privacy protections don't apply to employers, and something that GINA did was apply confidentiality standards for employers when they do have access to your information. So as I mentioned, when they have it, they need to keep it in a separate place. They need to keep it locked up securely. They can't mix it in with the other employment information that they have about you. And there are penalties if they disclose that information inappropriately or give it to anybody else. FLATOW: Let's go to Robin(ph) in Reno. Hi, Robin. ROBIN (Caller): Thanks for taking my call. I'm a genetics professional, and the information that I've gotten through my professional organization - I won't mention any names here, but it's a Republican senator from Oklahoma that has put a hold on the bill this year, and we are very - we in the genetics community are very distressed because, as your guest said, this bill has been pending for over 10 years now, trying to get through Congress. And now, to have this hold on it is very distressing. So I just wanted to share that information. FLATOW: Okay. You're not - no names though, you say it's a Republican senator from Oklahoma. We're not - can't verify that. So it's a rumor up to this point. ROBIN: That's the information I've gotten from my professional organization. FLATOW: All right. Thanks for calling. ROBIN: Thank you. FLATOW: Karen, I - we're going to - we're going to keep you while we cover the rest of the hour and talk about health care issues for the rest of the hour. So we'll talk more about this issue because Karen Pollitz is going to stay with us. We're going to talk about other health care issues, about health care in general. What is the state of medical health care, of insurance health care -insurance? How can we do - what can we do to change it? Maybe this new Congress will have some new ideas. We're hearing big business is already saying, you know, we need some guidelines so, you know, we're paying a lot of money for health care coverage. What about moving it out of our domain or making sure everybody is covered so we're all on the same playing field? Stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break.

BROOKS: (As Marlin) Clearly, you're not ready and you're not coming back until you are. SEABROOK: It turns out that real live clownfish also talk to each other, although their conversations probably have less emotional baggage. For over 70 years, scientists have listened to clownfish make strange sounds. Now, they think they know how the fish do it. NPR's Nell Boyce explains. NELL BOYCE: If you were a clownfish and you went and threatened a neighbor's territory, here's what you'd hear him say. (SOUNDBITE OF CLOWNFISH COMMUNICATING)MICHAEL FINE: It sounds kind of like, bump(ph), bump, bump, bump, bump, bump. That's about the best I can do. I'm better at imitating toadfish. BOYCE: Michael Fine is a biologist at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. He's part of a team that recently looked into how clownfish make their chirps and pops. The researchers used high-speed videos and X-rays to peer inside to the noisy fish. As the fish opened and raised their mouths in a certain way, special ligaments on the jaw snapped the mouth shut. Fine says the teeth bang together. FINE: It's not like grinding teeth. I mean it's a quick collision. BOYCE: And the impact seems to reverberate through the jaw. The study is described in the Journal of Science. Fine says clownfish aren't the only fish that talk. A lot of species send out warnings or love songs. Some vibrate their swim bladders; others send out burbles of air. FINE: There are even names associated with it - like croaker, sea robins, drums. BOYCE: Those are species that are easy for people to hear. But Fine says the voices of other fish are more mysterious. FINE: There are groups of fishes that we really don't have any idea how they make their sounds. BOYCE: He says clownfish and their clacking teeth can now be taken off that list. Nell Boyce, NPR News.

(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"FINDING NEMO\") ALBERT BROOKS: (As Marlin) You know you can't swim well. ALEXANDER GOULD: (As Nemo) I can swim fine, dad, okay? BROOKS: (As Marlin) No. It's not okay. GOULD: (As Nemo) Just because you're scared of the ocean. . . BROOKS: (As Marlin) Clearly, you're not ready and you're not coming back until you are. SEABROOK: It turns out that real live clownfish also talk to each other, although their conversations probably have less emotional baggage. For over 70 years, scientists have listened to clownfish make strange sounds. Now, they think they know how the fish do it. NPR's Nell Boyce explains. NELL BOYCE: If you were a clownfish and you went and threatened a neighbor's territory, here's what you'd hear him say. (SOUNDBITE OF CLOWNFISH COMMUNICATING) MICHAEL FINE: It sounds kind of like, bump(ph), bump, bump, bump, bump, bump. That's about the best I can do. I'm better at imitating toadfish. BOYCE: Michael Fine is a biologist at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. He's part of a team that recently looked into how clownfish make their chirps and pops. The researchers used high-speed videos and X-rays to peer inside to the noisy fish. As the fish opened and raised their mouths in a certain way, special ligaments on the jaw snapped the mouth shut. Fine says the teeth bang together. FINE: It's not like grinding teeth. I mean it's a quick collision. BOYCE: And the impact seems to reverberate through the jaw. The study is described in the Journal of Science. Fine says clownfish aren't the only fish that talk. A lot of species send out warnings or love songs. Some vibrate their swim bladders; others send out burbles of air. FINE: There are even names associated with it - like croaker, sea robins, drums. BOYCE: Those are species that are easy for people to hear. But Fine says the voices of other fish are more mysterious. FINE: There are groups of fishes that we really don't have any idea how they make their sounds. BOYCE: He says clownfish and their clacking teeth can now be taken off that list.

I'm Ira Flatow. The governor of Texas, Rick Perry, has backed off his plan to make it mandatory for girls in Texas to get vaccinated with Gardasil. That's the new vaccine that's meant to protect against four strains of HPV or human papillomavirus. Some types of HPV are known to cause cervical cancer, and there is evidence that the vaccine can prevent some infections and reduce cervical cancer rates. But recent reports on the vaccine's effectiveness have been confusing, and not everyone thinks vaccinating girls and young women is a good idea. Just this month, the New England Journal of Medicine recommended a cautious approach to vaccinating. Joining me now to help us sift through the issues is James Colgrove, author of \"State of Immunity: The Politics of Vaccination in Twentieth-Century America. \" He is assistant professor of sociomedical sciences at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. Welcome back to Science Friday, Dr. Colgrove. Dr. JAMES COLGROVE (Author, \"State of Immunity: The Politics of Vaccination in Twentieth-Century America\"; Sociomedical Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University):  Thank you. FLATOW: It's confusion again. Dr. COLGROVE: It's been a very busy couple of months since we spoke last, something new in the news almost every day. FLATOW: Why not put this in perspective for, bring us up to date? Dr. COLGROVE:: Well, the vaccine was licensed last June and caused a lot of excitement, appeared to be very promising. It showed very strong efficacy against two of the most dangerous strains of HPV, which are responsible for most cases of cervical cancer. And there was immediately a lot of legislative activity to make the vaccine mandatory for girls before they entered middle school. The rationale for that was that the vaccine is most effective when given before a girl becomes sexually active. HPV, this virus is very prevalent, and a woman's chances of becoming infected with it increased dramatically with each new sexual partner, and so the benefit that she's going to get from the vaccine decreases dramatically. So this was the rationale - that you wanted to make sure the girls got it before they became sexually active. The idea that you would give such a vaccine caused a lot of consternation among religious conservatives who believed - I think without evidence - that doing - that giving this vaccine would increase sexual risk-taking, would encourage girls to become promiscuous. So the idea of passing these laws became very controversial. FLATOW: We had a story last month from the Wall Street Journal that said Gardosil has been dogged about how effective it really is. Was that - now, a little three-fifths that said, gee, no, it's not working like we thought it would. Dr. COLGROVE: Well it's been clear all along that the vaccine is really effective against these two strains before a woman becomes infected with them. There are two strains in particular that are especially dangerous, type 16 and 18. The - we have some new data now that give a clearer picture of that. And when you give the vaccine to a woman before she is infected with either of the strains, the vaccine is extremely effective, it's 98 percent, something very close to a hundred percent. But when you look at the entire pool of women including women who already have been infected with these two strains, the efficacy overall is only about 44 percent, and that number is really a lot more pertinent to the kinds of real-life situations in which the vaccine will be given because when you take a vaccine and you give it to the general public, you're going to be giving it to young women who have not been infected with the strains but also who have been infected because as I said, HPV is an extremely prevalent virus. FLATOW: Part of the confusion is also over how young girls should be vaccinated, and there doesn't seem to be - according to the reports you read -as much data about young girls as there is about girls 15 year old. Dr. COLGROVE: Right. Most of the studies have involved older young women. I think the median age in one of the trials was about 20. I mean, it's interesting that, you know, there is this question about how young, but then there are also questions about how - up to what older age the vaccine should be given because of this issue that the older a woman gets, the more likely she is to already be infected with one of these strains, and so the vaccine won't do her much good. So for example, last year, the CDC recommended that the vaccine be given to girls from 11 to 26, knowing that the older, the upper age bracket might not get much benefit from it. The American Cancer Society, on the other hand, looked at the same data and recommended the vaccine only for girls from 11 to 18 - and not for girls 19 to 26. And they said, look we just - based on this data, we just don't think that young women 19 through 26 are going to derive any benefit from this, because it's so likely that they are already infected with one of the strains. And in fact, this new data suggests that that's probably an appropriate recommendation. FLATOW: According to the article in the - we're going back to the New England Journal of Medicine, where they point out that two strains as you did, 16 and 18, account for the lion's share of oncogenesis. That leaves the other strains possibly, right? Dr. COLGROVE: Right. FLATOW: To take over, maybe. Dr. COLGROVE: Right. There is the suggestion that if you block the activity of the two strains, then other strains will enter, and it's not really known what's the contribution of these other strains to the incidence of cervical cancer. FLATOW: So the states now are left to wrestle with this state by state. Dr. COLGROVE: Right. There is a tremendous amount of activity, legislative activity, around the country. Twenty-four states have some kind of legislation pending to make the vaccine mandatory for entry to middle school. There's also - I should mention - a lot of other kinds of legislation having to do with the financing of the vaccine. This is a very expensive vaccine that costs about $360 for a full course of three doses. And there are real questions about how parents will pay for it. Many private insurers don't cover it yet at least. So some of this legislation at the state level has to do with things like laws that would require private insurers to cover the vaccine, laws that would allocate state funds to help pay for the vaccine. But the most controversial legislation has been these laws pertaining to making it mandatory. And, you know, around the beginning of the year, there seemed to be a lot of momentum in favor of these laws. That momentum has really slowed, I think, as more people have raised questions about various aspects, about the timing of it, about the role of Merck, who was lobbying very aggressively for the passage of these laws. I think Merck really shot themselves in the foot, in a way, by being so aggressive and creating - it really was a conflict of interest, and certainly it looked bad for them. So Texas was the first the state. The legislature has now overwritten it. Currently, only one state, Virginia, has made the vaccine mandatory for middle school entry. The law includes an opt-out provision that makes it very easy for any parent who objects to exempt their daughter from the recommendation. It's - you know, I don't - it's dangerous to speculate, but I would guess that we probably won't be seeing most of this legislation go anywhere. FLATOW: There's also a new study that links HPV with oral cancers now. Tell us about that. Dr. COLGROVE: Well, HPV has been linked to a wide variety of health problems, various kinds of intergenital cancers - genital warts, anal cancers and penile cancers in men as well. So there's just a lot that is still not known about exactly what will be the public health impact of this vaccine. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Let's see if we can get a phone call or two. Tom in Minneapolis, hi Tom. TOM (Caller): Hi. Glad to be on. I'd like to point out that decision-making, when you're looking at public policy is very different than decision making for an individual. And the reason I bring this up is that for a young woman who's already sexually active, say, in her early 20s, it might make sense that - if there's a chance of benefit from being vaccinated, it might make sense to go ahead and pursue that, whereas at the public policy level, you know, the benefit, you know, might not be as clear for recommending that, that whole age group be vaccinated. And I think that's an important distinction for individuals who are hearing this show and trying to decide what to do. FLATOW: Jim? Mr. COLGROVE: Right. I think the caller raises a very good point. The decision-making with any vaccination program is a very complicated calculus of risks and benefits. And that calculus is not the same for an individual as it is for a population. So, you know, you might make a recommendation for a certain age group. That doesn't necessarily mean that every single person in that age group will want to follow that recommendation. FLATOW: So you're left again with a caution, with a little red flag up. And you have to decide for yourself, for your family. Mr. COLGROVE: Right. I think - and, you know, this is an obstacle that public health officials confront all the time. It's how to proceed in the face of scientific uncertainty. I mean, answers in science are rarely as clear-cut as you would like them to be. You know, I think that's why there was a lot of people in the public health community who, in general, are very supportive of vaccines and supportive of vaccine mandates for diseases like measles and polio, are saying that it's really too early to be mandating HPV because there are simply too many unanswered questions about it. And the fear is that by moving forward very aggressive, they were undermining public trust and really risking a backlash against the broader immunization system that, you know, that keeps childhood diseases under control. You have to maintain the trust of the public or you've lost everything in public health. FLATOW: Well is it - do we need more time to see if it's effective or time to decide what the pros and cons are? Mr. COLGROVE: I think both of those things. I mean, studies will be ongoing for many years. Then - and we'll see in the coming months and years additional information about how effective it is, what's the duration of the protection, are there any additional side effects that we haven't seen so far? FLATOW: What about men? What about vaccinating men? Mr. COLGROVE: Exactly. Exactly. Should the vaccine be given to boys and men. Merck is looking at its - Merck has safety data on young men but they don't -they haven't yet released their efficacy data. They're looking at that now and are expected to release it soon. So if and when that happens, that will be yet another policy question that we'll have to look at. FLATOW: And what if you don't need three booster shots? Mr. COLGROVE: Right. Exactly. One thing to consider, since it is so expensive and also since, you know, the more shots you have to go back for, the less likely it is that you're going to complete the entire series. If, in fact, you can get an effective dose of immunity from two shots, then, obviously, that would be greatly preferable to having to take three shots. FLATOW: You know, it's one of these things that we can't give you a yes or no answer. Mr. COLGROVE: It's unfortunate. People, I think, look to their public health leaders to provide these kinds of answer. And unfortunately, they're rarely available. FLATOW: James Colgrove, thank you. Mr. COLGROVE: Thank you.

I'm Debbie Elliott. If you can sit on a park bench or stroll through the woods and identify what's a mammal, what's a flowering tree, or what's an insect, you have Carl Linnaeus to thank, and maybe your science teachers as well. Linnaeus would have turned 300 years old this Wednesday. The Swedish botanist was the father of modern taxonomy. He named and classified about 12,000 plants and animals, and he invented the basic framework of the system biologists still use today to classify all of life. This week, Linnaeus' fans plan some 1,600 birthday bashes across the world, from New South Wales to his native Sweden. NPR producer Addie Goss explains why all of the fuss. ADDIE GOSS: It's an exciting week to be Swedish. There will be black tie dinners and Linnaeus cream cakes. The Japanese emperor is even coming in for a visit. Andres Bjorck is the governor of Uppsala, where Carl Linnaeus lived for 50 years. Governor ANDRES BJORCK (Uppsala, Sweden): The whole city will be absolutely crowded next week especially on Wednesday with festivals, singers, and so on, and so on. So the whole city will be more or less boiling of joy. GOSS: For a 300-year-old guy, Linnaeus still has a big influence. For one, he developed our system for naming organisms, the binomial system - two words -like homo sapiens. He grouped these organisms: birds by their beaks, insects by their wings. And then he ranked the groups: class, order, genus, species. Even today, high school students are learning the mnemonics for these ranks. The ranking system has more or less survived 300 years. Its structure is still sound, but just like a 300-year-old house, it's required some renovation. To see why, I visited Kevin de Queiroz. Mr. KEVIN DE QUEIROZ (Curator/Zoologist, National Museum of Natural History): Where is the light? GOSS: De Queiroz is a zoologist for the Smithsonian here in Washington. He curates the reptiles and amphibian collection in the basement of the museum of Natural History, and it's huge. Every time you turn on the light I see another mile of reptiles. Mr. DE QUEIROZ: This is probably the largest collection of amphibians and reptiles in the world. GOSS: Five hundred and sixty thousand jars. Each holds a different species or reptile or amphibian floating in alcohol. Mr. DE QUEIROZ: So as we're walking down this hall, we have the lizards on your left. . . GOSS: The scientists who organized this collection grouped the animals by morphology: the structure of their tongues, the shape of their skulls, whether or not their jaws come apart. Mr. DE QUEIROZ: But now, we get to the end here, and now we've got a, sort of, mixture of weird snakes and lizard-like things that we don't really know where they fit in. GOSS: De Queiroz calls this the mystery aisle; the lizards and snakes on these shelves are just too weird to be sorted by their scales and skulls. Mr. DE QUEIROZ: Here are the Amphisbaenia. GOSS: De Queiroz pulls a jar out off the top shelf, opens it up, and tugs at this long thing. Mr. DE QUEIROZ: And you can see sometimes the way they were folded doesn't exactly fit well into the - yeah, so you might see why they call that worm a lizard. GOSS: It's like a giant, bloated earthworm with scales. Today is a big day for the Amphisbaenians. Until recently, no one knew where they fit on the reptilian tree of life. But now, scientists have a new tool. They look at the species' DNA. It turns out that Amphisbaenians share a lot of DNA with some pretty, typical-looking lizards with feet that live in the U. S. and Europe. Mr. DE QUEIROZ: Well, so now, now that we have a better idea about who they're related to, we should probably rearrange the collection so that they're close to the things that they're closely related to. GOSS: In cases like this, DNA analysis is shaking up the tree of life, moving creatures from one branch to another. Other times, DNA studies help create new branches altogether. Linnaeus grouped all of life into four different ranks. Now, De Queiroz says, scientists use dozens. Mr. DE QUEIROZ: As we've discovered more and more about how things are related to each other, seven ranks just weren't enough to deal with it. So now, you know, we have super-orders, sub-families, super-families, tribes. GOSS: It turns out life is even more complicated than Linnaeus thought. But, De Queiroz says, Linnaeus got one thing perfectly right. He looked around him and saw that there is order in nature. And Darwin agreed with him a hundred years later. If he hadn't, we might not be celebrating Linnaeus today. Addie Goss, NPR News, Washington.  DEBBIE ELLIOTT, host:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Debbie Elliott.  If you can sit on a park bench or stroll through the woods and identify what's a mammal, what's a flowering tree, or what's an insect, you have Carl Linnaeus to thank, and maybe your science teachers as well. Linnaeus would have turned 300 years old this Wednesday.  The Swedish botanist was the father of modern taxonomy. He named and classified about 12,000 plants and animals, and he invented the basic framework of the system biologists still use today to classify all of life. This week, Linnaeus' fans plan some 1,600 birthday bashes across the world, from New South Wales to his native Sweden.  NPR producer Addie Goss explains why all of the fuss.  ADDIE GOSS: It's an exciting week to be Swedish. There will be black tie dinners and Linnaeus cream cakes. The Japanese emperor is even coming in for a visit. Andres Bjorck is the governor of Uppsala, where Carl Linnaeus lived for 50 years.  Governor ANDRES BJORCK (Uppsala, Sweden): The whole city will be absolutely crowded next week especially on Wednesday with festivals, singers, and so on, and so on. So the whole city will be more or less boiling of joy.  GOSS: For a 300-year-old guy, Linnaeus still has a big influence. For one, he developed our system for naming organisms, the binomial system - two words -like homo sapiens. He grouped these organisms: birds by their beaks, insects by their wings. And then he ranked the groups: class, order, genus, species. Even today, high school students are learning the mnemonics for these ranks.  The ranking system has more or less survived 300 years. Its structure is still sound, but just like a 300-year-old house, it's required some renovation. To see why, I visited Kevin de Queiroz.  Mr. KEVIN DE QUEIROZ (Curator/Zoologist, National Museum of Natural History): Where is the light?  GOSS: De Queiroz is a zoologist for the Smithsonian here in Washington. He curates the reptiles and amphibian collection in the basement of the museum of Natural History, and it's huge.  Every time you turn on the light I see another mile of reptiles.  Mr. DE QUEIROZ: This is probably the largest collection of amphibians and reptiles in the world.  GOSS: Five hundred and sixty thousand jars. Each holds a different species or reptile or amphibian floating in alcohol.  Mr. DE QUEIROZ: So as we're walking down this hall, we have the lizards on your left. . .  GOSS: The scientists who organized this collection grouped the animals by morphology: the structure of their tongues, the shape of their skulls, whether or not their jaws come apart.  Mr. DE QUEIROZ: But now, we get to the end here, and now we've got a, sort of, mixture of weird snakes and lizard-like things that we don't really know where they fit in.  GOSS: De Queiroz calls this the mystery aisle; the lizards and snakes on these shelves are just too weird to be sorted by their scales and skulls.  Mr. DE QUEIROZ: Here are the Amphisbaenia.  GOSS: De Queiroz pulls a jar out off the top shelf, opens it up, and tugs at this long thing.  Mr. DE QUEIROZ: And you can see sometimes the way they were folded doesn't exactly fit well into the - yeah, so you might see why they call that worm a lizard.  GOSS: It's like a giant, bloated earthworm with scales. Today is a big day for the Amphisbaenians. Until recently, no one knew where they fit on the reptilian tree of life. But now, scientists have a new tool. They look at the species' DNA. It turns out that Amphisbaenians share a lot of DNA with some pretty, typical-looking lizards with feet that live in the U. S. and Europe.  Mr. DE QUEIROZ: Well, so now, now that we have a better idea about who they're related to, we should probably rearrange the collection so that they're close to the things that they're closely related to.  GOSS: In cases like this, DNA analysis is shaking up the tree of life, moving creatures from one branch to another. Other times, DNA studies help create new branches altogether. Linnaeus grouped all of life into four different ranks. Now, De Queiroz says, scientists use dozens.  Mr. DE QUEIROZ: As we've discovered more and more about how things are related to each other, seven ranks just weren't enough to deal with it. So now, you know, we have super-orders, sub-families, super-families, tribes.  GOSS: It turns out life is even more complicated than Linnaeus thought.

I'm Alex Cohen. MADELEINE BRAND, host: I'm Madeleine Brand. In a few minutes, a look at two opposite approaches in dealing with sex offenders. COHEN: But first, last fall, 49-year-old Spencer Johansen found out that he has Alzheimer's disease. Despite the diagnosis, Johansen has decided to continue working, and he recently went public with that decision. Spencer Johansen is the chief of police in Lexington, Illinois. And he joins us now. Welcome to the program, Chief Johansen. Chief SPENCER JOHANSEN (Lexington Police Department, Lexington, Illinois): Thanks for having me. COHEN: When did you first suspect you might have Alzheimer's? Chief JOHANSEN: Several years ago, I started noticing just some lapses in my memory. And I noticed later toward evening on my speech - I was having a hard time maybe finding words that I was looking for. It wasn't until probably last year that it started getting my attention a little bit more, and my family's. And we had a history over to my mom's side of family, so that's what led me to get testing done. COHEN: You are the chief of police. That's a job that comes with tremendous responsibility. You carry a gun. Did you have any concerns about safety as you continue to work? Chief JOHANSEN: No. I am, you know, I knew when I went public with this that there would be some concerns, and those were justified concerns by several people and I understand their concerns. But I also think that if you understand this disease and the stages that it goes through, I think the stereotype of Alzheimer's patients is that, you know, an elderly person in a nursing home. And that's not the case. I mean there are people with their early symptoms, the early onset of it, they can still do what they do. And I understand my position is a little bit different than anybody else's, but it's one of those decisions that, along with the doctors, my family and I just decided that, you know, the best thing for me to do is just keep working. COHEN: It seems like you've surrounded yourself with people who will be keeping an eye out for you and your ability to make certain decisions, certain judgment calls. Is there a certain point where you think you might be best served not to be carrying a weapon? Chief JOHANSEN: I think down the road, yes. And I'm prepared for that. I think, you know, eventually when I talk to my doctors and they say, you know, we think that you ought to be taking these measures, I think I will accept that. As far as me knowing personally, I think I would. I think I would know when I don't feel comfortable with it. And I realize that there's going to be those who say, well, you know, with the Alzheimer's, will I be able to make that determination myself. And I go back to watching my family members. I mean, I think one thing with me is that the first thing - when I went to the doctor with this - number one, I went to the doctor with it and told him, you know, I think there's something going on. I think I need to be checked. So I was aware enough to go get evaluated at first. And I believe with my knowledge of this and my knowledge of law enforcement I'll know when it's time to relinquish my weapon and my position. COHEN: Is there any part of your job that you think might have to change or need to change as you live with this disease? Chief JOHANSEN: Well, something that I started doing several years ago, and I don't know that it's related to this, but I mean I take more notes in what I did. I rely on my appointment book quite a bit more. And I write the stuff down, which is good in law enforcement anyway that I keep accurate notes. But as far as my day-to-day routine, I don't see any right away. I mean, I think I know what's going to happen. I know what I'm going to have to do down the road, and I'll be prepared for that when it comes. COHEN: You're only 49 years old. I read that approximately 500,000 Americans between the ages of 30 and 60 years old are diagnosed with Alzheimer's. What's it like get that diagnosis at such an early age? Chief JOHANSEN: Well, it's hard to explain. It was an up and down rollercoaster for a while. I think the hardest thing was probably telling my kids and then my mother, who lost a sister and two brothers to this. One thing, you know, when I first found this out, I'll admit I sat around and I felt sorry for myself for a while. And then I decided that, you know, I can best serve this by going public with it and joining with the Alzheimer's Association to bring a greater awareness to this. So I think as long as I've got that to fall back on, you know, my early retirement plan, I was going to retire when I was 55 and go to a barber school. And I don't think that's going to pan out now. But my message that I would like to get across is that it's not an immediate death sentence, you know. There's still a life out there and I intend to live it right up until the end. I mean, I'm going to continue to speak out for this and hopefully keep serving my community, not maybe in the law enforcement capacity but maybe with the Alzheimer's Association.

That's right. What was once a practice favored by a small group of brave souls has become a lot more mainstream. Today there plenty of women with small holes in one or both of their breasts, so how does piercing affect a woman's ability to breastfeed? To find out, we're checking with Dr. Sydney Spiesel. He's a professor at Yale Medical School, and he writes for the online magazine Slate. Welcome back to the program, Sid. Dr. SYDNEY SPIESEL (Professor, Yale Medical School): Thanks, Alex. Nice to be here. COHEN: So Sid, have you heard from any of your patients directly who have had pierced nipples? How did it work out with breastfeeding? Dr. SPIESEL: I've had some patients who had pierced nipples and who had problems with breastfeeding. Some of them had a hard time getting breastfeeding started. They had the sense that there was some problem with milk flow. But everybody has interesting cases. But the question actually hasn't been looked at in a kind of serious way. MONTAGNE: So there've been no official studies or research done on the topic? Dr. SPIESEL: No. There have just been a lot of reports of individual cases, or people will say there's a number that's bandied around. In the medical literature suggest that between 10 and 20 percent of women who have nipple piercing have some problem with it, which is often infection or inflammation, and one would expect that those infections and inflammation might well result in the kind of scarring that would plug up the milk ducts. But I'm not even sure where that 10 to 20 percent came from. COHEN: Okay, Syd. So maybe, you know, punk rock moms aren't a big enough group yet with their pierced nipples to constitute, you know, a valid basis for medical research. What does this say about research in general if it's, you know, an issue that might not affect everyone but is an issue that's out there? Dr. SPIESEL: Well, research in general, especially around problems that are not that common, is very hard to do, really. You know, a lot of times doctors depend on anecdotal reports - single cases, things that they've seen, interesting cases. But there's a kind of a skew, because when things go well and when things go smoothly, we don't get those reports at all. So it tends to skew the way we look at problems. So all we can do is guess, and the problem is, it's very easy for doctors to generalize based on a few cases that, you know, or something that seems reasonable. But it's not necessarily a good idea. COHEN: So Syd, even if there's not a whole lot of research out there on the topic, what advice would you give, let's say, if you had a patient who was thinking that at some point she wanted to breastfeed and she was either thinking about getting her nipples pierced or she had them pierced already - what advice would you give her? Dr. SPIESEL: Well, I'll give a couple pieces of advice. One is I'd say, gee, I don't know exactly but I've had a couple of patients who have told me they've had problems. On the other hand, the medical literature describes some patients who are said not to have had problems. I would say that there is some problems around people with pierced nipples actually nursing. One of them is that it's really important, most of the time, to get that jewelry out. It's hard to get a good - it's hard to imagine there'd be a good latch for a mother who still had the nipple jewelry in place. That's where the baby holds on to the nipple. And also, there might be danger of small parts of it being inhaled by the baby, which will be the last thing you'd want. And also if once that jewelry is removed, there's a strong probability that the hole is going to grow shut. Those are the things I think I would say. COHEN: That's opinion from Dr. Sydney Spiesel of Yale Medical School. You can read his medical examiner column at Slate. com. Thanks so much, Syd. Dr. SPIESEL: Thank you.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Lately, we've done a number of programs about living with cancer. Today, we're going to focus on cancer prevention and why so many Americans feel there's little or nothing they can do about that. A nationwide survey, published in this month's issue of Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention finds, well, a lot of confusion. Many people believe that almost everything causes cancer. More than a quarter believe there's not much we can do to prevent its onset. And more than 70 percent say there's so much conflicting information, they don't know what's right and what isn't. Later on in the program, if it's summer, there must be rock concert reunions. The Police and Genesis are just two of the bands touring this year. Will you pay to see your golden oldie rock band together again? And we'll check in with some fans watching the soccer match of the year. But first, cancer prevention - are you confused? What works? What doesn't? Our number is 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. Email is talk@npr. org. You can join the conversation on our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation. And we begin with Jeff Niederdeppe. He's a researcher at the University of Wisconsin and lead author of the study we're talking about. He joins us from the Sports Byline Studios in San Francisco. Nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION today. Dr. JEFF NIEDERDEPPE (Lead Researcher, University of Wisconsin): It's a pleasure to be here, Neal. CONAN: And you point out that in many respects, we know quite a lot about prevention. Why do you think so many people feel helpless? Dr. NIEDERDEPPE: Well, I think - we don't know for sure, but I think there are at least three things that may be going on here. First, cancer is a disease that's widely feared. And while a little bit of fear can help motivate people to act, too much fear can really cause people to throw up their hands and give up. So I think that might be one factor. Second, cancer is a very complex disease to communicate about. It actually refers to over 50 specific different diseases. Lung cancer is a different disease than is breast cancer, with different risk factors and different causes. So that can be confusing as well. And third, I think sometimes we get so caught up in the most recent news story that we forget that there are solid recommendations out there, particularly when it comes to avoiding smoking, exercising regularly and eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. CONAN: And those are things that are known to be successful. Yet, I think it was over a quarter of the people said - do you agree that there's little you can do to prevent the onset of cancer? And they said yes. Dr. NIEDERDEPPE: That's right. Twenty-seven percent agreed that there's not much people can do to lower their chances of getting cancer. So that really suggests there is pretty widespread confusion and helplessness out there. CONAN: And how does that break down? Did you further look into what kind of people were answering that question, what groups of people - demographics? Dr. NIEDERDEPPE: We did, and the most striking finding, I think, was with regards to education. People without a college degree felt a lot more confused, helpless and fatalistic than people who had graduated college - so really suggesting that there's an educational component here. CONAN: Mm-hmm. And what about differences in culture, race? Dr. NIEDERDEPPE: Well, it's interesting, Neal. Previous studies have looked at a different kind of fatalism, and that's the idea that if you get cancer, you're going to die from it. And the previous studies have really found that African-Americans and Hispanic and Latino populations were more likely to feel this way. When it comes to fatalism about cancer prevention, however, we found the opposite, in fact, that African-American and Hispanic Latino populations were less likely to think that everything causes cancer and that there's nothing they can do about it. CONAN: Hmm. Our number, if you'd like to join our conversation, is 800-989-8255, 800-989-talk. Email is talk@npr. org - our guest, Jeff Niederdeppe. And let's get Karen on the line. Karen's calling us from Tucson, Arizona. KAREN (Caller): Hello, Neal. Thank you for taking my call. CONAN: Sure. KAREN: I've been a cancer nurse, working with cancer patients and other cancer nurses for over 30 years now. And I've taught the Oncology Nursing Society's chemotherapy class to thousands of nurses around the country. And I've taught oncology content to undergraduate and graduate students. And I've always emphasized that 85 percent of the causes of cancer are controllable by our diet, exposure to sun, smoking, drinking, etc. And health care providers know this, and I'm wondering if you have any comments as to why the general population is not getting this information or feel so helpless. I think this is a real problem, because there is a very fatalistic attitude about this. But we need to keep in mind, too, that it's only been within the last 30 years or so that we actually can cure a lot of cancers that before were not curable. So we're only maybe one generation into being able to cure this, and that's where the old attitude may come from. And I'll take my answer off the air. Thank you so much. I enjoy your program. CONAN: Thanks, Karen. Appreciate that. Dr. NIEDERDEPPE: Well, Karen, I think it's a good point. And I think I really like to emphasize the role that doctors and nurses can play here. It's really striking how influential just a simple question of the doctor or nurse asking a patient if they smoke, advising them to quit and helping them to find treatment can have in terms of promoting somebody to try to quit smoking. So I think doctors and nurses can ask every person who comes in if they smoke. And if so, help them get into treatment. If they're overweight, they can ask about their diet and exercise patterns. You know, the doctor is going to not only know about the state of the science about these things, but they also know the patient's medical history and are, I think, a very important component here of helping to give clear, simple messages about what people can do about it. CONAN: Mm-hmm. And one of the things that I found interesting was the last survey that examined these beliefs about cancer was back in 1986. This seems pretty significant. Why wait so long between surveys? Dr. NIEDERDEPPE: Well, there have been surveys in sort of smaller geographic locations, so people have done surveys in California, and among simply specific populations - women only in rural areas, for instance. But I think there's a renewed interest - particularly with the explosion of information that's available on the Internet and, you know, a number of channels that are available to people in the media - to really understand where people are getting this information and how they're making sense of it. So the National Cancer Institute has been focusing on this a lot in the last few years, and I think we'll see a lot more attention to this issue moving forward. CONAN: Let's see if we can get Mike on the line. And Mike is with us from Michigan. MIKE (Caller): Hello. CONAN: Hi. MIKE: I'm calling regards to a study that was done by John Hopkins in the '90s, relating to broccoli sprouts and their anti-cancer properties, and then the subsequent FDA warning by consumer - or by to consumers not to consume these products, even though they are one of the most beneficial available on the market today. What are your views - what kind of thoughts have you got? CONAN: I guess this comes out of the category of confusing different kinds of studies. But Jeff, I'm not sure you're familiar with those particular studies. Dr. NIEDERDEPPE: I'm not, actually, but I know that today, if you look at the National Cancer Institute's specific recommendations and more or less any cancer group making recommendations here, one of the most important things that people can do is eat those fruits and vegetables. Five or more servings a day will help reduce your risk of cancer in the long term. So I would definitely encourage you to eat those Brussels sprouts and your greens moving forward. CONAN: All right, Mike. Good luck with that. MIKE: Thank you. CONAN: And let's get Kris on the line. And Kris is calling us from San Francisco. KRIS (Caller): Hello. CONAN: Hi. KRIS: Hi. This is first time I've called in. I'm a nurse - I'm an advanced practice nurse. I actually was an oncology and a hospice nurse before I became a breast cancer patient and went to metastatic a couple of years ago. And I, frankly, am a little angry at the comment by the nurse who - I've also taught nursing myself. And perhaps I'd heard her incorrectly about 85 percent of the cancer could possibly not be\u2026 CONAN: Could be prevented. KRIS: \u2026prevented if we did the things we should. I think that nurse who probably doesn't have cancer needs to go to the second floor at UCSF in the breast cancer center and talk to some of the women there, because I have been talking to them. I was a vegetarian. I walked every day. I worked every day. I never smoked or drank, and I have metastatic breast cancer. And most of the women that I've met over there and in the San Francisco area were very healthy people. So I guess what I want to get around is blaming the patient syndrome, which seems to come up quite a bit. And I've been, actually - you know, I witnessed some of it on the other side of the way here as a patient. And I'll take any of your comments off the air. Thank you. CONAN: All right, Kris. And good luck with it. KRIS: Thank you so much. CONAN: And, obviously, genetic disposition plays a large role, people think, in breast cancer in particular. Isn't that right, Jeff? Dr. NIEDERDEPPE: That's absolutely right. Certainly, family history and genes can put people at an increased risk of cancer. And I think in that circumstance, it's all the more important to really focus on the things that we know that we can do. So scientists estimate that about 30 percent of all cancer deaths are attributable to smoking. And from about 15 to 20 percent of cancer deaths are attributable to obesity. So the number that I've heard thrown around is about 50 percent - not 85, but there's certainly some uncertainty about what that specific number is. But we don't know everything, but I think we can focus on the things that we do know about not smoking, about eating fruits and vegetables and about exercising regularly. And, you know, you can't guarantee you're not going to get cancer, but you can put the odds in your favor. CONAN: Jeff Niederdeppe, thanks very much for being with us today. Thanks for your time. Dr. NIEDERDEPPE: Thanks. It's been a pleasure. CONAN: Jeff Niederdeppe, a researcher at the university of Wisconsin, lead author of the study we've talking about. He's been with us at the Sports Byline Studios in San Francisco. Cancer prevention information comes through various media: TV, pamphlets in the waiting room, and, of course, that rumor machine the Internet. Joining us now to talk about this glut of information is Michael Wolf, assistant professor of medicine, director of health literacy and learning at the Northwestern University. He is with us from member station WBEZ in Chicago. And, first of all, welcome. Nice to have you on the program today. Dr. MICHAEL WOLF (Professor of Medicine, Director of Health Literacy and Learning, Northwestern University): Thank you, Neal. CONAN: And what's the primary means that people get their information about cancer and cancer prevention? Dr. WOLF: Well, I mean, my first comment reading this article is that they're probably not getting a lot of information at all. People get a lot of information, all of it from prints - where they get through the newspapers or through reading the information off of the Internet, some multimedia tools. A lot of times, we're expecting information to come from our health care providers or physicians and patients. And a quick comment on what one of the callers mentioned about the blaming the patient, that there is this issue, that we do expect - you know, that there may be that issue, but we expect a lot to be coming from out providers. Most patients view their physician or their nurse as the - one of the most trusted sources of health information for them, and a lot of that may not be communicated right now. CONAN: Mm-hmm. Well, we're going to take a short break. So stay with us if you would, Michael Wolf. And if you'd like to join our conversation: 800-989-8255 -800-989-TALK. Email is talk@npr. org. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. We all know at least a few ways to help prevent cancer: stop smoking, slather on the sunscreen. This hour, we're sorting out some other claims from the dangers of cell phones to the wonders of broccoli. Our guest is Michael Wolf, assistant professor of medicine and director of the Health Literacy and Learning program at Northwestern University, and we welcome your questions about what works and what doesn't. 800-989-8255 - email: talk@npr. org. You can check out our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation. And Michael Wolf, I wanted to follow up about how people get their information and who gets the challenge of health literacy campaigns. I mean, it's easy to put a pamphlet in a doctor's office. It's not so easy to get that to the right people before they go to the doctor's office. Dr. WOLF: That's right. I think they're a lot of good points have been brought up, that - first off - there's a lot of information, a lot of different sources of information people can get from - it seems from this study, this issue of being - feeling somewhat kind of out of control and not being able to prevent cancer. Maybe that they're, one, being overwhelmed by a lot of information that's conflicting, and also that they're maybe not getting the right messages from the sources that should be communicating this information. We see a lot of different areas where we see health information that should have been communicated to patients not getting to that - not getting to the target. And therefore, if patients don't have the information, how can they act on it? CONAN: Mm-hmm. And there was one finding in the survey about people's confusion over - there are so many conflicting reports. And I guess the news media has to accept a certain degree of responsibility for that. Dr. WOLF: Yeah, possible. But, I mean, I think part of the issue is helping consumers of health care information do a better job of maybe navigating this information, and also having heath care providers, you know, work very closely with their patients to get their messages out. And also to be in line to kind of standardize this information also with public health campaigns. So everybody's coming from a united front and getting the right messages out to patients so they know in a very clear, explicit manner what you want patients to do, what they - what are these recommendations for cancer prevention? CONAN: Well, joining us now is Dr. Sharonne Hayes. She's a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota and a preventive cardiologist. She directs the Women's Heart Clinic, and she joins us from studios at the Mayo Clinic. Nice to have you on the program today. Dr. SHARONNE HAYES (Cardiologist, Mayo Clinic of Rochester, Minnesota) It's great to be here. CONAN: And Dr. Hayes, you're on the frontlines, talking to patients about preventive care. Many of the behaviors that prevent cancer can also help prevent heart disease. Do people listen to you? Dr. HAYES: They listen to me, and sometimes they hear what they want to hear. And many come to me with a lot of misconceptions that are similar to and addition to the things mentioned in the study - by the study author. People have a variety of reasons they aren't doing what we think they all should do. Perhaps they've tried and failed, and so this is a coping mechanism to say, well, there's no point. Some have tried, but tried and didn't have the tools to do it. You know, I had one patient, she said, well, I've heard that eating Chinese is really healthy and will help me lose 40 pounds. And she described her Chinese meal as being refried things and sweet and sour pork, because that was Chinese. CONAN: Right. You always have to worry when anything's refried, yes. Dr. HAYES: Yes. (Soundbite of laughter) CONAN: And I think all the studies came out showing that Chinese food was loaded with fat. It was just - it tastes good. But what makes a patient care about what they should or shouldn't do, when you're talking about motivation? Dr. HAYES: Well, I think motivation - sometimes we have to help the patients find the motivation. Perhaps they do have a fatalistic view, that they're going to get cancer because - or heart disease because many of their family members did. So, empowering them so that they can say, well, perhaps you can make some lifestyle changes or we can give you some medication that might help prevent this. Your genetics do not determine everything about you. Other time is, I don't have time for myself. I don't have time to lose weight, exercise, do these healthy behaviors. So then I might help try to find a motivation such as you're doing it for the family. If you eat healthy, you're a role model for your children. If you don't do these things, you may not be well enough to care for your family. I think each patient, you have to find what is going to be their motivation. And sometimes, they're very motivated, just don't have the information. CONAN: Let's see if we can get some more callers in on the line. Let's go now to - excuse me, Tracy - Tracy with us from Portland, Oregon. TRACY (Caller): Hi. Thanks for taking my call. CONAN: Sure. TRACY: Your first guest mentioned that college graduates tend to be more optimistic about their, you know, chances with cancer. And I'm wondering how much relates to possibly the ability for college graduates to have jobs that have access to better health care, or even just health insurance in general, if there's any correlation there or if the study followed that. CONAN: Well, our guest who did the study has left us. Michael Wolf, might you be able to help us on this? Dr. WOLF: If there's a correlation between whether or not there's an access issue in education attainment? Is that the question that's being asked? CONAN: Mm-hmm. Yeah, well, since the study found that people with college degrees were less likely to be fatalistic, might that reflect the fact that they're probably a little wealthier and probably have better access to health care? Dr. WOLF: Absolutely. I think we know that education is probably one of the strongest indicators of socio-economic status in the United States, so definitely, I think that it's probably picking up a lot of that. CONAN: I wonder, in your practice, Dr. Hayes, what do you find? Dr. HAYES: Well, I think there's also data that, in fact, those people have a right to be more optimistic, because we know that higher levels of education - actually, they have better outcomes with diagnoses of cancer or a diagnoses of heart disease. So, in some sense, it is probably a realistic optimism. I think\u2026 TRACY: (unintelligible) CONAN: I'm sorry. What did you say? TRACY: What is related to? I mean, I guess, you know, you said that they have more reason to be optimistic because they, you know, have better results, but what - why? CONAN: Why do they have better results? Yeah. Dr. HAYES: Well, it's very complicated, why the - and I appreciate my colleague also chiming in, but some of it is they have been exposed to often - and had the leisure time try to pursue healthier pursuits. If you are struggling to make ends meet, then the last thing that you're really going to be thinking about is going out for a 30-minute walk. Or perhaps you're going to be buying very calorie-dense foods that may not be healthy for you because that's what is available in the local bodega. So I think that education equals higher socio-economic, and there are a lot of benefits that come with that. Dr. WOLF: I can chime in just briefly, this is a very complex issue - and I appreciate the comments you made, my colleague at Mayo Clinic made - that there's a lot of issues as regards as regards to the - having the knowledge and skills to be able to engage in the self-care activities that you have to do for day-to-day health tasks and to know - and also manage those things that may be having to conflict with stressful environmental cues that you have to deal with. So how do you deal with that, and on top of having to deal with your daily activities, managing a couple jobs, etc. ? CONAN: Thanks for the call, Tracy. TRACY: Great. Thanks for taking my call. CONAN: Good question. Yeah. Let's go now to Mike - Mike is with us from Ithaca, New York. MIKE (Caller): Hi, there. Hi, Neal. CONAN: Hi. MIKE: Yeah, this is a - guess what I'm trying to say is going to be a continuation in response to Tracy's point and - or, not in response, but as the same idea. I mean, I'm in a marginalized group. I'm disabled and disfigured and was often in academia, while getting my degree, put in more marginalized labs and more marginalized parts of the dorm, where other people like foreigners who couldn't speak English well or other people disabilities were, and there was more conflict there. And people used chemicals from the lab and household kitchen chemicals as weapons. And I was hit by the crossfire when someone threw radioactive iodine at someone else. CONAN: Ah. MIKE: And all - I did everything for cancer prevention - the vegetarian diet. The whole bit. I got a cancer in 98. I wasn't expected - in the autumn, I wasn't expected to last till March. I worked very hard on trying to recover from it, and by April, I was completely clean. Around New Year's, I went into remission. But I had to work very hard at it, and there's still complications from it today. But people wonder, you know, why do you try to lead such a healthy lifestyle? It really didn't help you. And I said, yes, it really did. When I tell people that someone threw radioactive iodine at - one technician at another and I got the crossfire, people don't believe it really happened. So they're less likely to take my health advice on how they should prevent their own potential cancer seriously because I had it myself. But part of the problem is people do save kitchen chemicals and lab chemicals to use as weapons, some punky people who haven't been civilized properly or socialized properly is part of the problem as well. CONAN: Well, Mike, congratulations. I'm glad you're in remission. We appreciate that. And thanks very much for the call. MIKE: Thank you for the program, too. CONAN: And Dr. Hayes, I wanted to ask you about one thing that Mike said. You know, this feeling that some people have of, you know, well, something's going to get you. We're all going to die. It's, you know, that fatalistic part that really comes out in the study. Dr. HAYES: Well, I think we are all going to die of something, but I think most of us, we're likely - because of today's health care and others - to live a long time. And we - as they age - we want to live well right up to the end. And I think that treatment for cancer or treatment for heart disease or stroke or many of the diseases that a healthy lifestyle can either prevent or delay is very time consuming and painful and costly. And so if we can live well and these healthy behaviors can help keep you out of a nursing home. They can help prevent a hip fracture. Exercise can do a lot of things other than preventing heart disease or cancer. So I think that this - that's - when I'm sitting with a patient and talking to them who may say, oh, I've seen that Hollywood heart attack where somebody just clutches their chest and they die - that seems like a good way to go. And I try to point out, well, the risky behaviors that you're doing may cause some other things that aren't such a, quote, \"good way to go,\" and help them understand that they'll live better as well. CONAN: Let's get Robin on the line. Robin is calling us from Reno, Nevada. ROBIN (Caller): Hi, Neal. Thanks for taking my call. CONAN: Sure. ROBIN: I'm a genetic counselor. And I've had two patients who recently told me that their oncologist told them that we are all born with cancer cells. Now, I understand that cancer derives from a normal body cell, but it seems kind of a stretch to say that we're all born with cancer cells. CONAN: Wouldn't you say that's true, Dr. Hayes? Dr. HAYES: I think it would be a stretch. I'm not sure in what context those patients were told that, and again, I'm not a cancer specialist. CONAN: But I don't believe we're born - I'm not a cancer anything specialist. I certainly don't have an MD, and I don't even play one on the radio, but I don't think we're born with cancer cells. Dr. HAYES: We're not born with cancer cells, nor are we born, necessarily, with heart disease. But we can start developing it pretty early if we don't take care of ourselves. CONAN: But Robin, I guess people - what you're saying is people are really easily confused. ROBIN: Well, an additional thought here was - I think that the thought was that we're born - all born with cancer cells, and it's our immune systems - immune system dysfunction that allows those cancer cells to propagate into a detectable cancer. CONAN: Well, that's a new theory, and we could be hearing from the Nobel committee anytime now. (Soundbite of laughter) ROBIN: Thank you. CONAN: Thanks very much for the call, Robin. It's - the rumor mill - and Dr. Hayes, you must - ideas that are wilder than that. Dr. HAYES: Much wilder than that, and I think that the - patients get exhausted by the messages they see in the media. I mean, I can give a particular example, which isn't directly - but women and hormone replacement therapy, it changes on a day-to-day basis. And so at some point, patients become numb to the messages, and they do become fatalistic because they feel like it doesn't really matter what I do, because it's going to be wrong in a week. Somebody's going to - you know, what they tell me to do now is going to be wrong next week. CONAN: Coffee's good for me, coffee's bad for me. The hell with that, I'm going to have two cups. Dr. HAYES: That's right. Exactly. I'm going to do what I want to do. And I think the other thing that we struggle with is there has never been a study that showed smoking is good. There's never been study that showed exercise and physical activity is bad for you. But those messages that it's good for you get drowned out sometimes, and they're so simple and they're so unsexy that there isn't a lot of appeal. CONAN: Mm-hmm. Dr. HAYES: And so I think we have to keep repeating that, even if we physicians and the media start sounding like a broken record. CONAN: We're talking today with Sharonne Hayes, a doctor at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Also with us, Michael Wolf, assistant professor of medicine and director of Health Literacy and Learning Program at Northwestern University. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And here's an email question from Steve in Syracuse, New York. Where did cancer come from? Is it something that's always been a factor in life? Is it something we notice simply because we live longer and aren't dying of something else earlier in life? If not, is it something that is a factor in the environment of the post-industrial era, where out-gassing plastics and other factors are part of our daily lives? I wonder, Michael Wolf, if you had a thought about that. Prof. WOLF: Well, I mean I think I would direct that to my colleagues in the Robert Lurie Cancer Center or other oncologists or cancer researchers as far as the etiology of the disease. But, I mean, I think this is getting - a large part of just people not knowing - I mean, this is a great question. Just because people don't know what this is, they don't understand it very well even though they're getting some, I would say almost inundated by information about - you know, everybody knows that smoking can kill you, but - or it can - linked to many diseases, I think there's still an issue of kind of consolidating this information and asking how can we confuse patients less and give them a clear answer to what this is all about? CONAN: Let's go to Joanne. Joanne's with us from Portland. JULIANNE (Caller): Hi. CONAN: Hi. JOANNE: I'd like to ask one question and follow up on one statement. One statement that one of your experts made was that well-educated people may tend to be getting less cancer. Is that correct? CONAN: Is that what we were saying? JOANNE: I think so. There was a special (unintelligible) that education\u2026 Dr. HAYES: It's not necessarily that they get less cancer\u2026 CONAN: Hold on. We're trying to get an answer for you, Joanne. Go ahead. Dr. HAYES: It's not that they get less cancer, but they tend to have a better survival once they get cancer. And that may be due to a variety of things. JOANNE: Oh, okay. Health insurance. CONAN: Probably. Dr. HAYES: Perhaps health insurance, healthier behaviors, better access to care, and etc. JOANNE: Oh, okay. So I didn't hear that one right. And the other one was, you just briefly brought up the hormone replacement and the kind of messages that women are getting on - from the media. Doctors now and women are really - they have a kind of a knee-jerk response to the big estrogen study that was conducted a couple of years ago, and estrogen comes off sounding like toxic waste - estrogen replacement therapy. Nevertheless, that study, as far as I know, only evaluated patients taking just the, you know, the classic Prempro or Premarin kinds of drugs. It didn't evaluate any plant-based or compounded kinds of hormone replacement therapy, and I think that it skewed the discussion of estrogen replacement in such a way that now, probably many women are really afraid to touch it with a 10-foot pole, no matter how much they suffer. CONAN: Dr. Hayes? Dr. HAYES: Well, I can confirm Joanne is correct. There are many women who have decided, despite perhaps very miserable and life-affecting symptoms, that they won't because of fear of this. She's also correct that they looked at only two forms of hormone therapy, not a wide range. And also, the other issue with that study that's been publicized is the average age of the women in that study when they entered was age 63, which is older than most women who are using hormones. So there are a number of studies going on right now which are trying to look at those women who are most likely to take hormones right around menopause when they're having a lot of hot flashes, and we may see some benefits. So I think you're right, Joanne. I don't think we should throw out hormones as a potential treatment, but we don't have the data to say we should be using it to prevent disease, either. CONAN: Joanne, thanks very much for the call. Appreciate it. JOANNE: Thank you. CONAN: And I'm afraid we're going to have to leave it there. I guess we still have time to say stop smoking, go out and take a walk and eat your fruits and vegetables. So those are things that we know work. And the sunscreen, too, that works. Dr. Hayes, thanks so much for your time today. Dr. HAYES: Thank you very much. CONAN: Sharonne Hayes, cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where she directs the Women's Heart Clinic, and she's a preventive cardiologist. Also thanks to Michael Wolf, assistant professor of medicine and director of Health Literacy and Learning Program at the Northwestern University. Appreciate your time today. Prof. WOLF: Thank you. CONAN: When we come back, some notable rock reunions this summer. This is NPR News.  NEAL CONAN, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  Lately, we've done a number of programs about living with cancer. Today, we're going to focus on cancer prevention and why so many Americans feel there's little or nothing they can do about that.  A nationwide survey, published in this month's issue of Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention finds, well, a lot of confusion. Many people believe that almost everything causes cancer. More than a quarter believe there's not much we can do to prevent its onset. And more than 70 percent say there's so much conflicting information, they don't know what's right and what isn't.  Later on in the program, if it's summer, there must be rock concert reunions. The Police and Genesis are just two of the bands touring this year. Will you pay to see your golden oldie rock band together again? And we'll check in with some fans watching the soccer match of the year.  But first, cancer prevention - are you confused? What works? What doesn't? Our number is 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. Email is talk@npr. org. You can join the conversation on our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation. And we begin with Jeff Niederdeppe. He's a researcher at the University of Wisconsin and lead author of the study we're talking about. He joins us from the Sports Byline Studios in San Francisco. Nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION today.  Dr. JEFF NIEDERDEPPE (Lead Researcher, University of Wisconsin): It's a pleasure to be here, Neal.  CONAN: And you point out that in many respects, we know quite a lot about prevention. Why do you think so many people feel helpless?  Dr. NIEDERDEPPE: Well, I think - we don't know for sure, but I think there are at least three things that may be going on here. First, cancer is a disease that's widely feared. And while a little bit of fear can help motivate people to act, too much fear can really cause people to throw up their hands and give up. So I think that might be one factor.  Second, cancer is a very complex disease to communicate about. It actually refers to over 50 specific different diseases. Lung cancer is a different disease than is breast cancer, with different risk factors and different causes. So that can be confusing as well.  And third, I think sometimes we get so caught up in the most recent news story that we forget that there are solid recommendations out there, particularly when it comes to avoiding smoking, exercising regularly and eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables.  CONAN: And those are things that are known to be successful. Yet, I think it was over a quarter of the people said - do you agree that there's little you can do to prevent the onset of cancer? And they said yes.  Dr. NIEDERDEPPE: That's right. Twenty-seven percent agreed that there's not much people can do to lower their chances of getting cancer. So that really suggests there is pretty widespread confusion and helplessness out there.  CONAN: And how does that break down? Did you further look into what kind of people were answering that question, what groups of people - demographics?  Dr. NIEDERDEPPE: We did, and the most striking finding, I think, was with regards to education. People without a college degree felt a lot more confused, helpless and fatalistic than people who had graduated college - so really suggesting that there's an educational component here.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. And what about differences in culture, race?  Dr. NIEDERDEPPE: Well, it's interesting, Neal. Previous studies have looked at a different kind of fatalism, and that's the idea that if you get cancer, you're going to die from it. And the previous studies have really found that African-Americans and Hispanic and Latino populations were more likely to feel this way.  When it comes to fatalism about cancer prevention, however, we found the opposite, in fact, that African-American and Hispanic Latino populations were less likely to think that everything causes cancer and that there's nothing they can do about it.  CONAN: Hmm. Our number, if you'd like to join our conversation, is 800-989-8255, 800-989-talk. Email is talk@npr. org - our guest, Jeff Niederdeppe. And let's get Karen on the line. Karen's calling us from Tucson, Arizona.  KAREN (Caller): Hello, Neal. Thank you for taking my call.  CONAN: Sure.  KAREN: I've been a cancer nurse, working with cancer patients and other cancer nurses for over 30 years now. And I've taught the Oncology Nursing Society's chemotherapy class to thousands of nurses around the country. And I've taught oncology content to undergraduate and graduate students. And I've always emphasized that 85 percent of the causes of cancer are controllable by our diet, exposure to sun, smoking, drinking, etc. And health care providers know this, and I'm wondering if you have any comments as to why the general population is not getting this information or feel so helpless.  I think this is a real problem, because there is a very fatalistic attitude about this. But we need to keep in mind, too, that it's only been within the last 30 years or so that we actually can cure a lot of cancers that before were not curable. So we're only maybe one generation into being able to cure this, and that's where the old attitude may come from. And I'll take my answer off the air. Thank you so much. I enjoy your program.  CONAN: Thanks, Karen. Appreciate that.  Dr. NIEDERDEPPE: Well, Karen, I think it's a good point. And I think I really like to emphasize the role that doctors and nurses can play here. It's really striking how influential just a simple question of the doctor or nurse asking a patient if they smoke, advising them to quit and helping them to find treatment can have in terms of promoting somebody to try to quit smoking.  So I think doctors and nurses can ask every person who comes in if they smoke. And if so, help them get into treatment. If they're overweight, they can ask about their diet and exercise patterns. You know, the doctor is going to not only know about the state of the science about these things, but they also know the patient's medical history and are, I think, a very important component here of helping to give clear, simple messages about what people can do about it.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. And one of the things that I found interesting was the last survey that examined these beliefs about cancer was back in 1986. This seems pretty significant. Why wait so long between surveys?  Dr. NIEDERDEPPE: Well, there have been surveys in sort of smaller geographic locations, so people have done surveys in California, and among simply specific populations - women only in rural areas, for instance. But I think there's a renewed interest - particularly with the explosion of information that's available on the Internet and, you know, a number of channels that are available to people in the media - to really understand where people are getting this information and how they're making sense of it. So the National Cancer Institute has been focusing on this a lot in the last few years, and I think we'll see a lot more attention to this issue moving forward.  CONAN: Let's see if we can get Mike on the line. And Mike is with us from Michigan.  MIKE (Caller): Hello.  CONAN: Hi.  MIKE: I'm calling regards to a study that was done by John Hopkins in the '90s, relating to broccoli sprouts and their anti-cancer properties, and then the subsequent FDA warning by consumer - or by to consumers not to consume these products, even though they are one of the most beneficial available on the market today. What are your views - what kind of thoughts have you got?  CONAN: I guess this comes out of the category of confusing different kinds of studies. But Jeff, I'm not sure you're familiar with those particular studies.  Dr. NIEDERDEPPE: I'm not, actually, but I know that today, if you look at the National Cancer Institute's specific recommendations and more or less any cancer group making recommendations here, one of the most important things that people can do is eat those fruits and vegetables. Five or more servings a day will help reduce your risk of cancer in the long term. So I would definitely encourage you to eat those Brussels sprouts and your greens moving forward.  CONAN: All right, Mike. Good luck with that.  MIKE: Thank you.  CONAN: And let's get Kris on the line. And Kris is calling us from San Francisco.  KRIS (Caller): Hello.  CONAN: Hi.  KRIS: Hi. This is first time I've called in. I'm a nurse - I'm an advanced practice nurse. I actually was an oncology and a hospice nurse before I became a breast cancer patient and went to metastatic a couple of years ago. And I, frankly, am a little angry at the comment by the nurse who - I've also taught nursing myself. And perhaps I'd heard her incorrectly about 85 percent of the cancer could possibly not be\u2026  CONAN: Could be prevented.  KRIS: \u2026prevented if we did the things we should. I think that nurse who probably doesn't have cancer needs to go to the second floor at UCSF in the breast cancer center and talk to some of the women there, because I have been talking to them. I was a vegetarian. I walked every day. I worked every day. I never smoked or drank, and I have metastatic breast cancer. And most of the women that I've met over there and in the San Francisco area were very healthy people. So I guess what I want to get around is blaming the patient syndrome, which seems to come up quite a bit. And I've been, actually - you know, I witnessed some of it on the other side of the way here as a patient. And I'll take any of your comments off the air. Thank you.  CONAN: All right, Kris. And good luck with it.  KRIS: Thank you so much.  CONAN: And, obviously, genetic disposition plays a large role, people think, in breast cancer in particular. Isn't that right, Jeff?  Dr. NIEDERDEPPE: That's absolutely right. Certainly, family history and genes can put people at an increased risk of cancer. And I think in that circumstance, it's all the more important to really focus on the things that we know that we can do. So scientists estimate that about 30 percent of all cancer deaths are attributable to smoking. And from about 15 to 20 percent of cancer deaths are attributable to obesity. So the number that I've heard thrown around is about 50 percent - not 85, but there's certainly some uncertainty about what that specific number is. But we don't know everything, but I think we can focus on the things that we do know about not smoking, about eating fruits and vegetables and about exercising regularly. And, you know, you can't guarantee you're not going to get cancer, but you can put the odds in your favor.  CONAN: Jeff Niederdeppe, thanks very much for being with us today. Thanks for your time.  Dr. NIEDERDEPPE: Thanks. It's been a pleasure.  CONAN: Jeff Niederdeppe, a researcher at the university of Wisconsin, lead author of the study we've talking about. He's been with us at the Sports Byline Studios in San Francisco.  Cancer prevention information comes through various media: TV, pamphlets in the waiting room, and, of course, that rumor machine the Internet. Joining us now to talk about this glut of information is Michael Wolf, assistant professor of medicine, director of health literacy and learning at the Northwestern University. He is with us from member station WBEZ in Chicago. And, first of all, welcome. Nice to have you on the program today.  Dr. MICHAEL WOLF (Professor of Medicine, Director of Health Literacy and Learning, Northwestern University): Thank you, Neal.  CONAN: And what's the primary means that people get their information about cancer and cancer prevention?  Dr. WOLF: Well, I mean, my first comment reading this article is that they're probably not getting a lot of information at all. People get a lot of information, all of it from prints - where they get through the newspapers or through reading the information off of the Internet, some multimedia tools. A lot of times, we're expecting information to come from our health care providers or physicians and patients. And a quick comment on what one of the callers mentioned about the blaming the patient, that there is this issue, that we do expect - you know, that there may be that issue, but we expect a lot to be coming from out providers. Most patients view their physician or their nurse as the - one of the most trusted sources of health information for them, and a lot of that may not be communicated right now.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. Well, we're going to take a short break. So stay with us if you would, Michael Wolf. And if you'd like to join our conversation: 800-989-8255 -800-989-TALK. Email is talk@npr. org. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. We all know at least a few ways to help prevent cancer: stop smoking, slather on the sunscreen. This hour, we're sorting out some other claims from the dangers of cell phones to the wonders of broccoli. Our guest is Michael Wolf, assistant professor of medicine and director of the Health Literacy and Learning program at Northwestern University, and we welcome your questions about what works and what doesn't. 800-989-8255 - email: talk@npr. org. You can check out our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation. And Michael Wolf, I wanted to follow up about how people get their information and who gets the challenge of health literacy campaigns. I mean, it's easy to put a pamphlet in a doctor's office. It's not so easy to get that to the right people before they go to the doctor's office.  Dr. WOLF: That's right. I think they're a lot of good points have been brought up, that - first off - there's a lot of information, a lot of different sources of information people can get from - it seems from this study, this issue of being - feeling somewhat kind of out of control and not being able to prevent cancer. Maybe that they're, one, being overwhelmed by a lot of information that's conflicting, and also that they're maybe not getting the right messages from the sources that should be communicating this information. We see a lot of different areas where we see health information that should have been communicated to patients not getting to that - not getting to the target. And therefore, if patients don't have the information, how can they act on it?  CONAN: Mm-hmm. And there was one finding in the survey about people's confusion over - there are so many conflicting reports. And I guess the news media has to accept a certain degree of responsibility for that.  Dr. WOLF: Yeah, possible. But, I mean, I think part of the issue is helping consumers of health care information do a better job of maybe navigating this information, and also having heath care providers, you know, work very closely with their patients to get their messages out. And also to be in line to kind of standardize this information also with public health campaigns. So everybody's coming from a united front and getting the right messages out to patients so they know in a very clear, explicit manner what you want patients to do, what they - what are these recommendations for cancer prevention?  CONAN: Well, joining us now is Dr. Sharonne Hayes. She's a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota and a preventive cardiologist. She directs the Women's Heart Clinic, and she joins us from studios at the Mayo Clinic. Nice to have you on the program today.  Dr. SHARONNE HAYES (Cardiologist, Mayo Clinic of Rochester, Minnesota) It's great to be here.  CONAN: And Dr. Hayes, you're on the frontlines, talking to patients about preventive care. Many of the behaviors that prevent cancer can also help prevent heart disease. Do people listen to you?  Dr. HAYES: They listen to me, and sometimes they hear what they want to hear. And many come to me with a lot of misconceptions that are similar to and addition to the things mentioned in the study - by the study author. People have a variety of reasons they aren't doing what we think they all should do. Perhaps they've tried and failed, and so this is a coping mechanism to say, well, there's no point. Some have tried, but tried and didn't have the tools to do it. You know, I had one patient, she said, well, I've heard that eating Chinese is really healthy and will help me lose 40 pounds. And she described her Chinese meal as being refried things and sweet and sour pork, because that was Chinese.  CONAN: Right. You always have to worry when anything's refried, yes.  Dr. HAYES: Yes.  (Soundbite of laughter)  CONAN: And I think all the studies came out showing that Chinese food was loaded with fat. It was just - it tastes good. But what makes a patient care about what they should or shouldn't do, when you're talking about motivation?  Dr. HAYES: Well, I think motivation - sometimes we have to help the patients find the motivation. Perhaps they do have a fatalistic view, that they're going to get cancer because - or heart disease because many of their family members did. So, empowering them so that they can say, well, perhaps you can make some lifestyle changes or we can give you some medication that might help prevent this. Your genetics do not determine everything about you. Other time is, I don't have time for myself. I don't have time to lose weight, exercise, do these healthy behaviors. So then I might help try to find a motivation such as you're doing it for the family. If you eat healthy, you're a role model for your children. If you don't do these things, you may not be well enough to care for your family. I think each patient, you have to find what is going to be their motivation. And sometimes, they're very motivated, just don't have the information.  CONAN: Let's see if we can get some more callers in on the line. Let's go now to - excuse me, Tracy - Tracy with us from Portland, Oregon.  TRACY (Caller): Hi. Thanks for taking my call.  CONAN: Sure.  TRACY: Your first guest mentioned that college graduates tend to be more optimistic about their, you know, chances with cancer. And I'm wondering how much relates to possibly the ability for college graduates to have jobs that have access to better health care, or even just health insurance in general, if there's any correlation there or if the study followed that.  CONAN: Well, our guest who did the study has left us. Michael Wolf, might you be able to help us on this?  Dr. WOLF: If there's a correlation between whether or not there's an access issue in education attainment? Is that the question that's being asked?  CONAN: Mm-hmm. Yeah, well, since the study found that people with college degrees were less likely to be fatalistic, might that reflect the fact that they're probably a little wealthier and probably have better access to health care?  Dr. WOLF: Absolutely. I think we know that education is probably one of the strongest indicators of socio-economic status in the United States, so definitely, I think that it's probably picking up a lot of that.  CONAN: I wonder, in your practice, Dr. Hayes, what do you find?  Dr. HAYES: Well, I think there's also data that, in fact, those people have a right to be more optimistic, because we know that higher levels of education - actually, they have better outcomes with diagnoses of cancer or a diagnoses of heart disease. So, in some sense, it is probably a realistic optimism. I think\u2026  TRACY: (unintelligible)  CONAN: I'm sorry. What did you say?  TRACY: What is related to? I mean, I guess, you know, you said that they have more reason to be optimistic because they, you know, have better results, but what - why?  CONAN: Why do they have better results? Yeah.  Dr. HAYES: Well, it's very complicated, why the - and I appreciate my colleague also chiming in, but some of it is they have been exposed to often - and had the leisure time try to pursue healthier pursuits. If you are struggling to make ends meet, then the last thing that you're really going to be thinking about is going out for a 30-minute walk. Or perhaps you're going to be buying very calorie-dense foods that may not be healthy for you because that's what is available in the local bodega. So I think that education equals higher socio-economic, and there are a lot of benefits that come with that.  Dr. WOLF: I can chime in just briefly, this is a very complex issue - and I appreciate the comments you made, my colleague at Mayo Clinic made - that there's a lot of issues as regards as regards to the - having the knowledge and skills to be able to engage in the self-care activities that you have to do for day-to-day health tasks and to know - and also manage those things that may be having to conflict with stressful environmental cues that you have to deal with. So how do you deal with that, and on top of having to deal with your daily activities, managing a couple jobs, etc. ?  CONAN: Thanks for the call, Tracy.  TRACY: Great. Thanks for taking my call.  CONAN: Good question. Yeah. Let's go now to Mike - Mike is with us from Ithaca, New York.  MIKE (Caller): Hi, there. Hi, Neal.  CONAN: Hi.  MIKE: Yeah, this is a - guess what I'm trying to say is going to be a continuation in response to Tracy's point and - or, not in response, but as the same idea. I mean, I'm in a marginalized group. I'm disabled and disfigured and was often in academia, while getting my degree, put in more marginalized labs and more marginalized parts of the dorm, where other people like foreigners who couldn't speak English well or other people disabilities were, and there was more conflict there. And people used chemicals from the lab and household kitchen chemicals as weapons. And I was hit by the crossfire when someone threw radioactive iodine at someone else.  CONAN: Ah.  MIKE: And all - I did everything for cancer prevention - the vegetarian diet. The whole bit. I got a cancer in 98. I wasn't expected - in the autumn, I wasn't expected to last till March. I worked very hard on trying to recover from it, and by April, I was completely clean. Around New Year's, I went into remission.  But I had to work very hard at it, and there's still complications from it today. But people wonder, you know, why do you try to lead such a healthy lifestyle? It really didn't help you. And I said, yes, it really did. When I tell people that someone threw radioactive iodine at - one technician at another and I got the crossfire, people don't believe it really happened. So they're less likely to take my health advice on how they should prevent their own potential cancer seriously because I had it myself. But part of the problem is people do save kitchen chemicals and lab chemicals to use as weapons, some punky people who haven't been civilized properly or socialized properly is part of the problem as well.  CONAN: Well, Mike, congratulations. I'm glad you're in remission. We appreciate that. And thanks very much for the call.  MIKE: Thank you for the program, too.  CONAN: And Dr. Hayes, I wanted to ask you about one thing that Mike said. You know, this feeling that some people have of, you know, well, something's going to get you. We're all going to die. It's, you know, that fatalistic part that really comes out in the study.  Dr. HAYES: Well, I think we are all going to die of something, but I think most of us, we're likely - because of today's health care and others - to live a long time. And we - as they age - we want to live well right up to the end. And I think that treatment for cancer or treatment for heart disease or stroke or many of the diseases that a healthy lifestyle can either prevent or delay is very time consuming and painful and costly.  And so if we can live well and these healthy behaviors can help keep you out of a nursing home. They can help prevent a hip fracture. Exercise can do a lot of things other than preventing heart disease or cancer. So I think that this - that's - when I'm sitting with a patient and talking to them who may say, oh, I've seen that Hollywood heart attack where somebody just clutches their chest and they die - that seems like a good way to go. And I try to point out, well, the risky behaviors that you're doing may cause some other things that aren't such a, quote, \"good way to go,\" and help them understand that they'll live better as well.  CONAN: Let's get Robin on the line. Robin is calling us from Reno, Nevada.  ROBIN (Caller): Hi, Neal. Thanks for taking my call.  CONAN: Sure.  ROBIN: I'm a genetic counselor. And I've had two patients who recently told me that their oncologist told them that we are all born with cancer cells. Now, I understand that cancer derives from a normal body cell, but it seems kind of a stretch to say that we're all born with cancer cells.  CONAN: Wouldn't you say that's true, Dr. Hayes?  Dr. HAYES: I think it would be a stretch. I'm not sure in what context those patients were told that, and again, I'm not a cancer specialist.  CONAN: But I don't believe we're born - I'm not a cancer anything specialist. I certainly don't have an MD, and I don't even play one on the radio, but I don't think we're born with cancer cells.  Dr. HAYES: We're not born with cancer cells, nor are we born, necessarily, with heart disease. But we can start developing it pretty early if we don't take care of ourselves.  CONAN: But Robin, I guess people - what you're saying is people are really easily confused.  ROBIN: Well, an additional thought here was - I think that the thought was that we're born - all born with cancer cells, and it's our immune systems - immune system dysfunction that allows those cancer cells to propagate into a detectable cancer.  CONAN: Well, that's a new theory, and we could be hearing from the Nobel committee anytime now.  (Soundbite of laughter)  ROBIN: Thank you.  CONAN: Thanks very much for the call, Robin. It's - the rumor mill - and Dr. Hayes, you must - ideas that are wilder than that.  Dr. HAYES: Much wilder than that, and I think that the - patients get exhausted by the messages they see in the media. I mean, I can give a particular example, which isn't directly - but women and hormone replacement therapy, it changes on a day-to-day basis. And so at some point, patients become numb to the messages, and they do become fatalistic because they feel like it doesn't really matter what I do, because it's going to be wrong in a week. Somebody's going to - you know, what they tell me to do now is going to be wrong next week.  CONAN: Coffee's good for me, coffee's bad for me. The hell with that, I'm going to have two cups.  Dr. HAYES: That's right. Exactly. I'm going to do what I want to do. And I think the other thing that we struggle with is there has never been a study that showed smoking is good. There's never been study that showed exercise and physical activity is bad for you. But those messages that it's good for you get drowned out sometimes, and they're so simple and they're so unsexy that there isn't a lot of appeal.  CONAN: Mm-hmm.  Dr. HAYES: And so I think we have to keep repeating that, even if we physicians and the media start sounding like a broken record.  CONAN: We're talking today with Sharonne Hayes, a doctor at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Also with us, Michael Wolf, assistant professor of medicine and director of Health Literacy and Learning Program at Northwestern University. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  And here's an email question from Steve in Syracuse, New York. Where did cancer come from? Is it something that's always been a factor in life? Is it something we notice simply because we live longer and aren't dying of something else earlier in life? If not, is it something that is a factor in the environment of the post-industrial era, where out-gassing plastics and other factors are part of our daily lives?  I wonder, Michael Wolf, if you had a thought about that.  Prof. WOLF: Well, I mean I think I would direct that to my colleagues in the Robert Lurie Cancer Center or other oncologists or cancer researchers as far as the etiology of the disease. But, I mean, I think this is getting - a large part of just people not knowing - I mean, this is a great question. Just because people don't know what this is, they don't understand it very well even though they're getting some, I would say almost inundated by information about - you know, everybody knows that smoking can kill you, but - or it can - linked to many diseases, I think there's still an issue of kind of consolidating this information and asking how can we confuse patients less and give them a clear answer to what this is all about?  CONAN: Let's go to Joanne. Joanne's with us from Portland.  JULIANNE (Caller): Hi.  CONAN: Hi.  JOANNE: I'd like to ask one question and follow up on one statement. One statement that one of your experts made was that well-educated people may tend to be getting less cancer. Is that correct?  CONAN: Is that what we were saying?  JOANNE: I think so. There was a special (unintelligible) that education\u2026  Dr. HAYES: It's not necessarily that they get less cancer\u2026  CONAN: Hold on. We're trying to get an answer for you, Joanne. Go ahead.  Dr. HAYES: It's not that they get less cancer, but they tend to have a better survival once they get cancer. And that may be due to a variety of things.  JOANNE: Oh, okay. Health insurance.  CONAN: Probably.  Dr. HAYES: Perhaps health insurance, healthier behaviors, better access to care, and etc.  JOANNE: Oh, okay. So I didn't hear that one right. And the other one was, you just briefly brought up the hormone replacement and the kind of messages that women are getting on - from the media. Doctors now and women are really - they have a kind of a knee-jerk response to the big estrogen study that was conducted a couple of years ago, and estrogen comes off sounding like toxic waste - estrogen replacement therapy.  Nevertheless, that study, as far as I know, only evaluated patients taking just the, you know, the classic Prempro or Premarin kinds of drugs. It didn't evaluate any plant-based or compounded kinds of hormone replacement therapy, and I think that it skewed the discussion of estrogen replacement in such a way that now, probably many women are really afraid to touch it with a 10-foot pole, no matter how much they suffer.  CONAN: Dr. Hayes?  Dr. HAYES: Well, I can confirm Joanne is correct. There are many women who have decided, despite perhaps very miserable and life-affecting symptoms, that they won't because of fear of this. She's also correct that they looked at only two forms of hormone therapy, not a wide range. And also, the other issue with that study that's been publicized is the average age of the women in that study when they entered was age 63, which is older than most women who are using hormones. So there are a number of studies going on right now which are trying to look at those women who are most likely to take hormones right around menopause when they're having a lot of hot flashes, and we may see some benefits. So I think you're right, Joanne. I don't think we should throw out hormones as a potential treatment, but we don't have the data to say we should be using it to prevent disease, either.  CONAN: Joanne, thanks very much for the call. Appreciate it.  JOANNE: Thank you.  CONAN: And I'm afraid we're going to have to leave it there. I guess we still have time to say stop smoking, go out and take a walk and eat your fruits and vegetables. So those are things that we know work. And the sunscreen, too, that works.  Dr. Hayes, thanks so much for your time today.  Dr. HAYES: Thank you very much.  CONAN: Sharonne Hayes, cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where she directs the Women's Heart Clinic, and she's a preventive cardiologist. Also thanks to Michael Wolf, assistant professor of medicine and director of Health Literacy and Learning Program at the Northwestern University. Appreciate your time today.  Prof. WOLF: Thank you.

Well, there is one thing that hasn't change too much from a generation ago - menstruation. But now there's a pill called Lybrel and taking it stops a women's period entirely. It was approved by the FDA this week and already it's prompted all sorts of responses from women, which is why it might seem a little bit strange that we're about to check in with a guy about Lybrel. But this isn't just any guy. He's Will Saletan and he writes the Human Nature Column for the online magazine Slate. His column on Lybrel will appear on Slate. com and in the Washington Post this weekend. Will, welcome back to the program. Mr. WILL SALETAN (Writer, Slate): Hey, Alex. COHEN: First of all, can you go over how this new pill works? Mr. SALETAN: Yeah. A conventional birth control pill mimics pregnancy. It administers hormones that keep your body from ovulating, so you don't get pregnant. But the regular pill goes for about three weeks. And then you have a week off where you take these dummy pills that just let your hormone level go back down, so you have sort of a fake period. And what Lybrel does is it gets rid of that week off. You just take the same active pills all the way through, so you never have to menstruate. COHEN: It sounds kind of unnatural, stopping your cycle indefinitely. Mr. SALETAN: Yeah. The problem with this argument about menstruation being natural is there are like four or five levels of artificiality in what we think of is natural. First of all, menstruation, the regular monthly period, is not natural historically. You know, women used to be pregnant or breastfeeding, so for so much of the time, they weren't having periods. COHEN: So Lybrel was almost this natural phenomenon way back when, when women. . . Mr. SALETAN: Yes, there was natural menstrual suppression. And then we came in with the hormonal contraceptives, right? So you have a fake pregnancy, which is what a hormonal contraceptive induces in your body. Plus, we added that fourth week, so you could have what looks like a period but isn't really a period. And then we had the additional fakery of, you know, this argument that it wasn't safe for women to go without periods. Doctors were making this argument even as the female doctors themselves were taking the pills constantly, so that they didn't have to have periods. COHEN: So the FDA has approved Lybrel this week. I assume then it's safe to take? Mr. SALETAN: Yeah, the FDA concluded that Lybrel was no more dangerous. There is no evidence that it is any more dangerous to take the so-called continuous contraception than to do regular birth control pills and have that week off. COHEN: A lot of women really do not like having their period. It's painful. It could be debilitating, so you'd think that everybody would hop on the Lybrel wagon. No? Mr. SALETAN: Yeah, well, you know, there are some women for whom this is just a no-brainer. I mean, if you have severe physical symptoms, if you have cramps, migraines, nausea, and we all know somebody who's been through something like this, you just can't function. You know, of course, you know, those women just want to get rid of their periods. There are critics who point out that for, you know, a lot of women, menstruation is not as much a problem for them directly as for their boyfriends who don't like it when these women are moody, or for your boss, who doesn't like it when you have to miss a day at work over your period. And then the question is, are you taking the pill for yourself or are you taking it for that man in your life? COHEN: Will, if you don't mind my asking - how are the women in your life feeling about this pill? Mr. SALETAN: You know, I've talked to colleagues and friends and I've heard reactions on both sides of this. I've heard women who say this is just the greatest thing since sliced bread. I can't, you know, I can't wait to get rid of my period. It's just such a nuisance. It's just really bogs me down. And I've heard other women say this is horrifying, you know, they're taking away womanhood, they're making us just like men. As far as I'm concerned, this is an argument between women and you really have to have a womb to have any credibility in it. So I'm going to stay out that one. COHEN: Will Saletan's column on Lybrel appears on Slate. com and in the Washington Post this weekend. Thanks for joining us, Will. Mr. SALETAN: Thank you.

First of all, menstruation, the regular monthly period, is not natural historically.  You know, women used to be pregnant or breastfeeding, so for so much of the time, they weren't having periods.  COHEN: So Lybrel was almost this natural phenomenon way back when, when women. . .  Mr. SALETAN: Yes, there was natural menstrual suppression. And then we came in with the hormonal contraceptives, right? So you have a fake pregnancy, which is what a hormonal contraceptive induces in your body. Plus, we added that fourth week, so you could have what looks like a period but isn't really a period.  And then we had the additional fakery of, you know, this argument that it wasn't safe for women to go without periods. Doctors were making this argument even as the female doctors themselves were taking the pills constantly, so that they didn't have to have periods.  COHEN: So the FDA has approved Lybrel this week. I assume then it's safe to take?  Mr. SALETAN: Yeah, the FDA concluded that Lybrel was no more dangerous. There is no evidence that it is any more dangerous to take the so-called continuous contraception than to do regular birth control pills and have that week off.  COHEN: A lot of women really do not like having their period. It's painful. It could be debilitating, so you'd think that everybody would hop on the Lybrel wagon. No?  Mr. SALETAN: Yeah, well, you know, there are some women for whom this is just a no-brainer. I mean, if you have severe physical symptoms, if you have cramps, migraines, nausea, and we all know somebody who's been through something like this, you just can't function. You know, of course, you know, those women just want to get rid of their periods.  There are critics who point out that for, you know, a lot of women, menstruation is not as much a problem for them directly as for their boyfriends who don't like it when these women are moody, or for your boss, who doesn't like it when you have to miss a day at work over your period. And then the question is, are you taking the pill for yourself or are you taking it for that man in your life?  COHEN: Will, if you don't mind my asking - how are the women in your life feeling about this pill?  Mr. SALETAN: You know, I've talked to colleagues and friends and I've heard reactions on both sides of this. I've heard women who say this is just the greatest thing since sliced bread. I can't, you know, I can't wait to get rid of my period. It's just such a nuisance. It's just really bogs me down.  And I've heard other women say this is horrifying, you know, they're taking away womanhood, they're making us just like men. As far as I'm concerned, this is an argument between women and you really have to have a womb to have any credibility in it. So I'm going to stay out that one.  COHEN: Will Saletan's column on Lybrel appears on Slate. com and in the Washington Post this weekend. Thanks for joining us, Will.  Mr. SALETAN: Thank you.

I'm Ira Flatow. And now for something else, another scientific bit of research that sounds like a plot from a science fiction movie - tiny computers, so small that they can live inside a single cell in your body and monitor the health of the cell. We're talking about computers that can detect what - when the cell has gone bad. Let's say when the genes inside have switched on to make the cell diseased or cancerous, and the molecular machine then sends out the signal from and to the cell to warn us of these events and determine what - and maybe even determine what the problem is and fix it. It really does sound fantastic, but researchers announced this week that they are one step closer to engineering a biological computer. They report their advance in the current issue of Nature Biotechnology. And today, the lead scientist joins me to talk about this research. Kobi Benenson is a Bauer Fellow in the Center for Systems Biology at Harvard University. And he joins us today from his office. Welcome to the program. Mr. KOBI BENENSON (Bauer Fellow, Center for Systems Biology, Harvard University): Well, hello. Thank you so much for having me on the show. FLATOW: You're welcome. Now you say that each human cell has the ability to build its own biocomputers? Mr. BENENSON: Well, we have to program the cells to actually build these computers. That is, we sort of hitchhike on the cellular mechanisms and program them to do what we need. FLATOW: So they have the tools already in the cell to build the computer, and you give them the blueprint to how to do it. Mr. BENENSON: Exactly. We engineer genes, basically lots of genes. We insert these genes into the cells, and the cells then engage into their - what they normally do because they cannot tell the difference between the naturally occurring genes and the synthetic genes that we have built. So they just build all the active components that we have designed and these components start working on their own. FLATOW: So the cell is building, actually, its own active computer? Mr. BENENSON: Well, you could say that. Yes. FLATOW: And has logic like a computer does? Mr. BENENSON: Exactly, so the trick here was to actually design molecules that would interact in this logical way much like transistors operate in a silicon-based computer, and so we just - I think we did just that. We have come up with the design and was - implemented it in live cells. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's talk about the implications of this. You're able to take a cell, and you can instruct it by putting genetic information, something like its own genes in there, and to tell it how to make its computer inside the cell. And what can then - what can this computer then help the cell do? What can the cell learn from the computer? Mr. BENENSON: Well, the cell probably would not learn much, but we can learn -we as humans (unintelligible). And still, I have to emphasize that we are not there yet in terms of being able to actually tap into cellular signals and, for example, diagnose cells with diseases. But once this technology matures, we really want to be able to interact with a variety of problems, which are, you know, manifested on a molecular level inside a cell and convert the signals into some action, for example, fixing a cell or targeting it for destruction or just labeling it for some future treatment. FLATOW: So you've tried this in test tubes so far? Mr. BENENSON: So in fact, three years ago, me and my colleagues at the Weitzman Institute, we have developed a test tube prototype that actually did all these tasks. Currently, what we build in live cells is only this logic component, the molecular component that have the capability of making decisions inside cells. But for now, we still feed this molecular computer with its own molecular zeros and ones, while in the future implementations, the data will come from molecular sensors. So these molecular sensors that actually look for mutations or look for, you know, a gene, look for genes that are incorrectly expressed is something which - that we are still working on. FLATOW: So it would look for a gene that suddenly turns on, maybe, a cancer part of the cell, makes the cell cancerous, and your little detector would, in theory, be able to detect the change in that gene. Mr. BENENSON: Right. FLATOW: And does it signal to you that something bad is happening? Mr. BENENSON: Exactly. So, in fact, we need computers to do a more complicated stuff. Normally, a single molecule or a single indicator is not enough to make precise decisions. What we instead - we need multiple indicators. And we may have to run a certain decision procedure much like human doctors do when they analyze symptoms of a given - of a patient. So the computational - micro-computation, really, is needed to make the right decision based on all these multiple cellular signals. FLATOW: So it looks for a variety of signals - A or B, A and B - depending on what you're looking for. Mr. BENENSON: Right. It could be quite complex, actually. FLATOW: And then how does it make itself known that it's found something that you should look into? Mr. BENENSON: Well, ideally, because the cell constructs this computer, it is in a way a - no. It is an automata(ph) system cell(ph) that it can generate a response, that is, it can synthesize a specific molecule within the cell, and this molecule can do things, not necessarily requiring an outside intervention. However, of course, if we do not, we may not be that sure about how the system operates. We may use this molecular output to just label a cell so that a physician may afterwards analyze, look for this marker, and then do something else. FLATOW: So you'd see the marker, let's say. Let's say it lights up or something. Mr. BENENSON: Well, you could engineer a system to do that, right. FLATOW: Yeah. So if you go for your checkup and the doctor looks for these cells that might be lighting up if something is wrong, he knows how to look for that. Mr. BENENSON: Right. I mean, I could imagine, for example, if these damaged cells circulate in the blood stream and our biological computer were to tag these few cells that represent a problem, then just by looking at the blood sample under a microscope, a physician could identify those, you know, labeled cells and decide or tell that there is a problem. FLATOW: So you could detect something really at its early, early stages here? Mr. BENENSON: Well, we hope so. I mean, ideally, this technology is supposed to work on the level of individual cells. So even a single cell which has molecular problems, (unintelligible) could be identified using these tools. Of course, it is really - it is a big challenge to get it down to individual cells, to single cells in organs. FLATOW: Would this be sort of genetic engineering? Mr. BENENSON: Well, I would say of course. We're using tools of recombinant DNA and genetic engineering to build our system. They are composed of synthetic DNA, so we are not - we're really built on all the current technologies, synthetic biology and molecular computing, to engineer these systems. FLATOW: Would it be possible to even go a step further and have the cell repair itself? Mr. BENENSON: Well, it is a very interesting direction, but I'm afraid that just the level of biological knowledge may not be sufficient as of today to really fix the cells, because way too often, these molecular indicators are not the cause of the problem but the results. So we may detect these problematic signals without really understanding the cause of the problem. Now, to get down to the cause of the problem is a completely different issue, and this is really the subject of basic biological research. FLATOW: Right. Mr. BENENSON: But sure enough, once we really understand the mechanism of a disease and we know what we have to fix, our molecular outputs, our - that the computer generates can in fact go there and try and fix the problem. FLATOW: Pierre(ph) in Rockville, Maryland, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. PIERRE (Caller): Hi. Mr. BENENSON: Hello. PIERRE: I was very intrigued by this. Obviously, the use of these cells as molecular reporters for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes is very interesting. But there was the other use of these that I would be interested in seeing -hearing a little bit about which you alluded to, and that's can these cells -because they are being used as computational items where there may be simple rules or identifiable rules - can they be used to test some of the predictions that you would have in models of cellular automata or self-organizing systems like the kind of stuff that Wolfram or Kaufman have been talking about? Mr. BENENSON: Well, this is definitely an interesting idea. I would say\u2026 PIERRE: How would you do that? How would you use them to test that? Mr. BENENSON: Well, I would say you can - if once we can engineer cells that have a certain kind of non-natural and well-defined behavior, a sort of input-output behavior or computational behavior, then we may start thinking about integrating them into networks, into sort of artificial tissues. And you may start looking at how the simple rules of interactions lead to the emergence of the more and more complex phenomena on the level of the tissue or of the cell -assembly of cells. You know, in kind of our dreams, we may envision something like an artificial brain where our cells may function instead of neurons, but having all these, you know new properties. So yeah, I definitely agree that this is an interesting direction to pursue. FLATOW: In your paper, you talked about biocomputers that can work in human kidney cells in culture. Can you explain what you did there? Mr. BENENSON: Right. So a kidney - kidney cells are just a common lab system, a model system where people normally test hypotheses or systems, which are supposed to work in humans. There was no particular reason other than that for picking these cells, and - so practically, what we do, we grow these cells in Petri dishes, we provide them with nutrients, and these cells are also immortalized so they can divide indefinitely. We can just also follow their growth. And when we do our experiments, we take these cells on plates, we introduce our sets of genes that encode the computer, then we actually - we sort of follow how the computer works by looking at different fluorescent proteins that are generated, that are the result of the molecular computation. And then - so we can tell whether, you know, the computation went right or wrong. In a way, our experiments are just about debugging your system. It's very much like computer industry, what happens in the computer industry, where you run your programs under different conditions, and you want to make sure that the program gives you a correct answer every time. So we did just that, only in a very different setting. FLATOW: So your program's then sort of, like, bits of DNA? Mr. BENENSON: It's bits of DNA, bits of RNA, exactly. FLATOW: And so you tinker with the structure of the DNA and RNA until you get the result that you want in the cells? Mr. BENENSON: Right, and then we also test it under different - we know what to expect from our systems, and we want to make sure that the experimental results really are as expected. FLATOW: So you can genetically engineer the bits of DNA to make these crude little computers. How complex can you make the computer, theoretically? Mr. BENENSON: Yeah, this is a very interesting question. And so one could look inside, you know, in nature, look into cells. And in fact, cells already have their own quote, unquote, \"biological computers\" that process, for example, hormone signals or make sure that a cell divides correctly every so and so hours. So these natural systems are quite complex. They have up to, I would say, hundreds of components. Our systems currently have about on the order of (unintelligible) 10 different components. So it is a good question of whether we can get to a hundred components. However, it seems like many real-life problems, do not or may not require these very complex systems. Instead, you may be looking for just a few very characteristic disease indicators, and it will be good enough to make a decision. FLATOW: Talking with Kobi Benenson this hour at TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Talking about these computers. Have - are the computers are - the size of the DNA? I'm trying to get an idea for everyone to get an idea how small and tiny these little computers are. They're molecules. Mr. BENENSON: Well, that's why maybe to talk, really, about the size is not entirely appropriate, because they're not little black boxes that float around inside cells. FLATOW: Right. Mr. BENENSON: Other than that, we sort of - they float all over. Our components, which are proteins and RNAs, just float inside the whole volume of a cell, and they transfer information between each other just by basically bumping into each other. And each of these collisions is an act of information transfer. So, one could tell, you know, the size of the computer is pretty much like the size of a cell. And of course, the size of DNA molecule is small, it is known. A few nanometers or (unintelligible) nanometers, but this is really different, I would say, from a nanotextile technology, which envisions these tiny, tiny robots that are totally separate from their environment. FLATOW: Right. These are not little robots. These are little bits of instructions floating around? Mr. BENENSON: Again, these bits of instructions are all encoded in our molecules, which are generated from the DNA templates. FLATOW: Right. Mr. BENENSON: And some - indeed, some of them are instructions, yes. So\u2026 FLATOW: Just waiting for the right trigger to react. Mr. BENENSON: Right, exactly. FLATOW: They're prime, they're waiting and if they find something, they create a protein that tells you something has happened. Mr. BENENSON: Right. FLATOW: And then you can - you pick up the signals for that. How soon until you can scale this up - or is that someone else's job - to try it out in, you know, out of the dishes and into other things? Mr. BENENSON: Well, we feel it that is our job, and we are working on that. And maybe we're trying to - so I would say the next big challenge is to be able to read out all these disease-related indicators in a reliable fashion or maybe not tailgating within the same side of the system, something like five different signals and answer whether we can really integrate these five different signals to produce a reliable response in individual cells. And from that point, of course, we want - we would like to take it to some model organisms and test them there. FLATOW: Well, good luck to you. Mr. BENENSON: Okay, thank you so much. FLATOW: And thank you for taking time to be with us. We are going to follow this. This is quite interesting research. Mr. BENENSON: Thanks. FLATOW: Take care. Mr. BENENSON: Goodbye. FLATOW: Kobi Benenson is a Bauer fellow in the Center for Systems Biology at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We're going take a break, change gears - a whole lot of gears here, moving to forth - because it's hurricane season. June 1st is hurricane season, coming up. And we had a prediction last year. Remember, there was a prediction for a very heavy hurricane season? It didn't quite work out that way. We'll talk about why it didn't happen, what we might expect this year, and why this year might be a whole different ballgame. So stay with us. We will be right back after this short break. (Soundbite of music) I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.

Mr. BENENSON: Well, we feel it that is our job, and we are working on that. And maybe we're trying to - so I would say the next big challenge is to be able to read out all these disease-related indicators in a reliable fashion or maybe not tailgating within the same side of the system, something like five different signals and answer whether we can really integrate these five different signals to produce a reliable response in individual cells. And from that point, of course, we want - we would like to take it to some model organisms and test them there.  FLATOW: Well, good luck to you.  Mr. BENENSON: Okay, thank you so much.  FLATOW: And thank you for taking time to be with us. We are going to follow this. This is quite interesting research.  Mr. BENENSON: Thanks.  FLATOW: Take care.  Mr. BENENSON: Goodbye.  FLATOW: Kobi Benenson is a Bauer fellow in the Center for Systems Biology at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We're going take a break, change gears - a whole lot of gears here, moving to forth - because it's hurricane season. June 1st is hurricane season, coming up.  And we had a prediction last year. Remember, there was a prediction for a very heavy hurricane season? It didn't quite work out that way. We'll talk about why it didn't happen, what we might expect this year, and why this year might be a whole different ballgame.  So stay with us. We will be right back after this short break.

According to a new report, hemorrhagic septicemia virus or HSV has reached epidemic proportions in Lake Erie, in Lake Ontario, has begun to spread inland. Scientists think the virus is also responsible for a fish kill in Wisconsin's Lake Winnebago. The virus, which first showed up in the Great Lakes in 2005, isn't harmful to humans. But it's deadly for many species of fish, including the kind of fish men like to catch - your muskies, your catfish, smallmouth, largemouth bass, perch, and they are all being affected. From New York to Wisconsin, people are worried that the virus could cause massive fish kills, cost billions of dollars in lost fishing and tourism dollars. And my next guest is worried that there's not enough money being invested in research in fighting this fish virus. Joining me now to talk about it is James Casey, associate professor of virology at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca. Thanks for talking with us today. Dr. Casey, welcome. Dr. JAMES CASEY (Associate Professor of Virology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York): Thank you, Ira. It's nice to be here. FLATOW: How worried should we be? Dr. CASEY: Well, in - we should be worried at multiple levels. As you said, in terms of the economy, sport fishing represents a $4 billion-a-year industry just at the Great Lakes alone, and that will have a major impact. But as a biologist, I'm very much worried about the long-term effects to the ecosystem and the possibility that this virus will spread into aquaculture and affect other sources, food sources that we depend heavily on. FLATOW: Where did it come from? Dr. CASEY: Nobody knows. That's the million-dollar question. It appears that it's genetically very close to another North American marine isolate that exists in the salt water. But the limited amount of information that's coming forth doesn't really give us any indication of the progression of how this virus changed. It's genetically very close to the marine isolate. There's only 17 amino acid substitutions, to be specific, in the glycoprotein gene. That's very minor in terms of genetics, but it confers the ability of this virus to cause a devastating effect on freshwater fish. FLATOW: Put this in perspective for us. Certainly there are other kinds and other outbreaks of viruses. How does this compare with other ones that you've seen? Dr. CASEY: This, most certainly, is most significant mortality event ever to hit North America for fish viruses. It's been long known that this virus has a tremendous capability to cause epidemics and outbreaks in aquaculture facilities in the marine environment. And a similar sort of outbreak happened in - to the freshwater - happened in Europe in 1938 and had devastating effects to the aquaculture industry. Our watersheds are much larger than Europe, and our diversity of species is huge. And we now know that there are 23 species in the Great Lakes that are susceptible. So this virus is not specific to any one fish. It kills without regard, and it is spreading at an alarming rate. FLATOW: All right, we're going (unintelligible) and get into some questions from our audience - 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. We're going to get a short break and come back and discuss this outbreak of deadly fish virus with James Casey, associate professor of virology at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca, New York, and take your phone calls. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Maybe you've seen or been affected by it yourself. You live up there near the Great Lakes or wherever this virus has spread. Give us a call. Our number - 1-800-989-8255. Stay tuned. we'll be right back. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about HSV, a deadly fish virus spreading through the Great Lakes. My guest is James Casey, associate professor of virology at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. Our number - 1-800-989-8255. Dr. Casey, could it move out into other parts of the country? Dr. CASEY: It certainly can. We witnessed the spread of this agent, this virus, recently to Wisconsin. Michigan, Lake Michigan was clean as of last year. And surprisingly, the virus appeared in an inland waterway 60 miles in from the Great Lakes, suggesting that the transmission of this virus was unique and probably by baitfish or by human activity, not by shipping. So human activity -namely boaters, bait, fish, transport of fish or infected bait - is probably the reason that the virus got into that lake. If it's that simple to get into an area that's 500 miles from here, it's just as easy to keep going. FLATOW: And now we're in the fishing season. Dr. CASEY: Absolutely right. And a fish tournament was canceled in Winnebago -Lake Winnebago because of the outbreak and tried to prevent the spread of this. FLATOW: Now, we have people with their trailers trailing around, you know, around the country with their fishing boats, taking stuff around with them. Dr. CASEY: It's so easy to prevent the spread of this disease, and it's going to depend very heavily upon the recreational boater and the recreational fisher person - that is, don't transport fish or release fish to other waterways. Wash, dry and disinfect your bait wells and clean your boat, and you'll prevent the spread of this. It's that simple. FLATOW: Is it possible to develop a vaccine or something like it? Dr. CASEY: There's been numerous attempts to make vaccines. Some of them are effective and have been applied to the commercial aquaculture industry. But there is no vaccine for this virus, and it would be impractical if not impossible to apply this to wildlife. FLATOW: Is the federal government involved in fighting this, you know, like the U. S. Department of Agriculture, people like that? Dr. CASEY: Yeah, most certainly. And thanks for bringing that up. And that -funding is a real issue when it comes to this because the Department of Agriculture, of course, is very interested in preventing a disease in food sources, and that's aquaculture. And the - they can only be peripherally interested in funding wildlife diseases because of the threat to aquaculture. And so when we go down to wildlife, there's a scant number of agencies that can support this. Sea Grant is one of it - through NOAA - and the Great Lake Trust and the Great Lakes Protection Agency, but that's about it. And the amount of money that's available is not encouraging. So we fight for money, and we're using up most of these resources. We don't have an infrastructure to answer these outbreaks that - and if you look at it here, funding, the lowest is always wildlife, and then USDA, and then diseases that affect us as humans directly. FLATOW: So this sort of falls in a crack someplace? Dr. CASEY: Very much so. We continue to see outbreaks and decay of the Great Lakes, and we're not answering to these things. And so we have to get very serious about the environment. As most people are aware - with Al Gore's recent publications - that global warming is a very serious event, along with that comes environmental decay. And it's not too late to do something about it and to try to restore and maintain our wonderful heritage that we have in our waterways in the United States. FLATOW: Let's go to Daniel in Rice Lake, Wisconsin. Hi, welcome to Science Friday. DANIEL (Caller): Hello. In the Wisconsin news today, a brown trout found dead Lake Michigan tested positive. Will the fish develop immunity and populations rebound in time, or will some species be exterminated? Dr. CASEY: Daniel, that's incredibly difficult to answer, as you might imagine. With 23 different species all showing different susceptibility to disease, we don't know what's going to happen. We can predict that some species will be decimated. Whether fish develop an immunity that's long enough lasting to persist for the next year when the outbreaks happen is an unanswered question. It needs research. It needs funding to look at these things. (Soundbite of dial tone) Dr. CASEY: So I really can't answer that in a way that would be in a positive sense to you. We just have to wait to see what happens. FLATOW: Now, you know, when people hear about this deadly fish virus and they're catching it in fish that they eat all the time, how do you convince them that they're not being harmed by a virus they're eating in a fish? Dr. CASEY: Well, it's purely a numbers basis. Fortunately or unfortunately, this virus, if it does infect a given fish, generally, it will kill it very quickly. The few laboratory transmissions that have been done showed that the fish will die in six to seven days after being infected, so it doesn't persist. If the virus does persist in a - in fish, so called develop a carrier state where they could carry it to the next year, they're not showing any clinical signs - that is, no disease. And there's very little live virus in there. In fact, no one's been able to answer whether the virus is actually still in there. We know it is by epidemiology, but scientifically, we haven't been able to purify it. FLATOW: Uh-huh. Dr. CASEY: So, it's purely on numbers. There's no association. Fish viruses are so far evolutionarily distinct from us that there is very little indications that they are transmissible. And lastly, fish are generally growing at low temperatures in water. They're poikilotherms, that is, the temperature follows the water. Our temperature, of course, is 98. 6, and the virus can't grow at that temperature. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Laurie in Tucson. Hi, Laurie. LAURIE (Caller): Hi. FLATOW: Yeah, that's a long way from Lake Michigan. LAURIE: It is. I have - my parents live in Michigan. I live in Kalamazoo. And I just wanted to comment. I was thrilled to hear a story that I could relate to. My dad is a recreational fisher, and he fishes on Lake Michigan all the time. And he just, like, lives for the season opener and the lakes around there, and he's been bummed out. He's been calling me and telling me that he hasn't caught a thing. He spends, like, six hours on the water and gets nothing on the south end of Lake Michigan. So I just wanted to comment. . . FLATOW: Mm-hmm. LAURIE: . . . about that, so I don't know if it's, you know, spread or--I don't, this is something I could talk to him about. FLATOW: Dr. Casey? Dr. CASEY: Sure. I can answer that. And it comes down to surveillance. Laurie, we just don't know. Surveillance means that we have to send people out in the field do netting, measure the fish populations. There are very few people that do that - do it on a haphazard sort of way. Let me give you a quick story. The outbreak in goby that brought us to it was - were gobies that were harvested by two skin divers, scuba drivers, that bet each other a six-pack that they wouldn't go in the water in April. And they found the gobies swimming. That's not very rational in terms of surveillance. You have to be more systematic, go out and net and look at fish populations, and we're doing that. So unless you're really measuring the level of fish and the movement of fish in the lakes, we just have to shrug our shoulders and not know what's going on. FLATOW: Good luck. Thanks for calling. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Kendall in Accokeek, Maryland. Hi, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. KENDALL (Caller): Hi, thank you for helping me learn about this disease. I was wondering, how quickly is this spreading throughout the northern area and how could it reach Maryland? And if so, would it be affecting a lot of the fish in our area? Dr. CASEY: It's - again, Kendall, it's an open question. We know that it's spread to inland waters in New York. And now with the recent outbreaks in Michigan, we know it's on inland lakes. It is capable of moving, and it follows the fish and it follows the fisher people and the bait dealers, and it will follow infected fish that are transported. The interesting thing I can tell you is that we were the ones that discovered a viral, it's - sorry, Ira, it's viral hemorrhagic septicemia. VHSV. FLATOW: Oh, I keep calling it HSV. Dr. CASEY: We'll let this fly. FLATOW: I'm sorry, you're right. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Have - confusing it with herpes simplex. Dr. CASEY: Right, that's bad enough. And so, yeah, Kendall. It - we found it in bait minnows. And what was interesting is the bait minnows were apparently healthy. There were no clinical signs of disease, yet we found extremely high viral levels in bait minnows. So a visual inspection was not useful. We had to use a nucleic acid base test to do it. So innocently, you could be spreading this. The fishermen could spread this thinking that the fish are healthy or whatever. So it's an invisible disease that is hard to follow, and we have to change our behavior. A common saying in virology is all infectious diseases are behavioral, and this is behavior where we're transporting fish and innocently releasing minnows thinking we're feeding fish and helping the environment; you might be infecting them. So we have to change our behavior, clean our boats, be very careful about transporting fish. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's see if we can take another phone call here. In - Dudley in Olympia, Washington. Hi, Dudley. DUDLEY (Caller): Hi. FLATOW: Hi there. DUDLEY: I was wondering if it appears that this virus will affect anadromous fish like the salmon species Pacific Northwest. Dr. CASEY: Gee, we know we can get into salmon in the Great Lakes. The fear is the marine isolate of viral hemorrhagic septicemia is already having an impact on the salmon in the Northwest that have been studied heavily in the rivers out there. Whether this virus is more pathogenic or less pathogenic to those species could be determined experimentally. It just hasn't been done. FLATOW: Wow. So we were just at the beginning. We're at the tip of this iceberg. Dr. CASEY: Yeah. I think so. I hope we're in the middle of it right now, because the spread has been rather dramatic. I can tell you this spring - you can see, with all the press releases that we're seeing, numerous outbreaks both in new locations and in locations from previous years up near Rochester -Irondequoit Bay. We've seen an outbreak again in gobies. So that's. . . FLATOW: But what I'm saying - if you're saying if I heard you correctly that even marine fish are susceptible to this virus. . . Dr. CASEY: The marine fish - as I said earlier in the talk, the marine isolate of viral hemorrhagic septicemia is genetically very close, and that does have an impact. We don't know if the freshwater variant, the new genetic type that's killing the fish in the Great Lakes, could even go back and infect marine species. It hasn't been tested. So we don't know what the effect of that would be should this virus in the Great Lakes get out into the saltwater. FLATOW: Mark in Whitewater, Wisconsin. Hi, Mark. MARK (Caller): Hello. FLATOW: Hi there. Go ahead. MARK: I bought quite a large batch of tropical fish - oh, it must have been about a year ago - and a large number of them died, and I took some of them in and they described it as hemorrhagic septicemia. And, well, that's what they said. First question is, is it possible to be - released tropical fish into the local rivers and lakes, like goldfish and whatnot - can that cause the disease to spread? Second, I don't know if you've really described the symptoms of the disease yet. Maybe that's not what I had to start with. FLATOW: Well, we'll get into - those are two good questions. Let me remind everybody that I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Talking with James Casey. Dr. Casey? Dr. CASEY: Sure. Yeah. Certainly, the - you could spread diseases by releasing fish into a new environment, but hemorrhagic septicemia is a general term for a pathological condition that could be caused by bacterial infection, and that's more than likely what happened to your tropical fish. Until you bring it to a diagnostic facility where they do histology or PCR - these are very expensive procedures, by the way - you'll never know. So you have to take it to a bona fide fish pathology laboratory to diagnose it correctly. Dudley(ph), as an aside, this virus will infect zebra fish. That's one of our experimental models that we're working on. So we can purposely infect these fish in a laboratory environment under high containment so nothing is released and study pathogenesis. So it just shows that this virus is - we use the words completely promiscuous, and it will infect a wide variety of species. FLATOW: And the symptoms? Dr. CASEY: The symptoms are - as the name implies, hemorrhagic septicemia - the endothelial lining of blood vessels is attacked by the virus and breaks it down, so the blood leaks into the tissue and pools. When you see one of these fish, the gills are completely white, and the blood is all pooled into abdominal cavity and into the musculature. The kidneys and spleen are immediately infected and show a devastating effect to practically life(ph). And the fish suffocates. FLATOW: And to repeat - because we just have a couple of minutes left - the greatest - the battle, the large battle here, is in prevention, preventing it spreading. Dr. CASEY: If you look back at human epidemics before we - before the advent of vaccines or other therapies, our most effective strategy was containment, and it gets into really complex mathematical terms on epidemiology. But containment of - diagnosing and containing the spread - just imagine if we know that we have an outbreak or the virus is present in one location - simply limiting activity in that location for perhaps a month would prevent a spread to other places. FLATOW: Is there enough person power, manpower, to man the - you know, and get the word out and tell people and. . . Dr. CASEY: Well, that's us, and that's three other labs in the local environment to try to set up an extension where we can communicate how to prevent spreading this agent, innocently spreading it through boating activities. And we have numerous grants pending that we're trying to get funded so we can set up a continual monitoring system in the Great Lakes. FLATOW: But why would you need grants on this? Shouldn't there be, you know, somebody goes out - like the National Guard or somebody - and talks to people if this is an epidemic that's going on? You're going to wait for a grant to be funded. Dr. CASEY: We - we first diagnosed this a year ago, and we're just getting funding now. So fortunately, we had some funding that we could apply and (unintelligible) to spend, and so we now we have caught up, and we need more money to go on. So does everybody. So yes, most certainly, we shouldn't be waiting. And this will be something to call your congressman, a senator, and let them know that something can be done about this. State agencies have historically been very generous. A lot of that money has dried up in the past and through need to support other initiatives but now reestablishing a continual funding, monitoring centers, environmental centers to surveil(ph) would be critical. FLATOW: Dr. Casey, thank you very much. Dr. CASEY: Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: Good luck to you and your efforts. James Casey, associate professor of virology at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca, New York.

LAURIE: . . . about that, so I don't know if it's, you know, spread or--I don't, this is something I could talk to him about.  FLATOW: Dr. Casey?  Dr. CASEY: Sure. I can answer that. And it comes down to surveillance. Laurie, we just don't know. Surveillance means that we have to send people out in the field do netting, measure the fish populations. There are very few people that do that - do it on a haphazard sort of way.  Let me give you a quick story. The outbreak in goby that brought us to it was - were gobies that were harvested by two skin divers, scuba drivers, that bet each other a six-pack that they wouldn't go in the water in April. And they found the gobies swimming. That's not very rational in terms of surveillance. You have to be more systematic, go out and net and look at fish populations, and we're doing that. So unless you're really measuring the level of fish and the movement of fish in the lakes, we just have to shrug our shoulders and not know what's going on.  FLATOW: Good luck. Thanks for calling. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Kendall in Accokeek, Maryland. Hi, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  KENDALL (Caller): Hi, thank you for helping me learn about this disease. I was wondering, how quickly is this spreading throughout the northern area and how could it reach Maryland? And if so, would it be affecting a lot of the fish in our area?  Dr. CASEY: It's - again, Kendall, it's an open question. We know that it's spread to inland waters in New York. And now with the recent outbreaks in Michigan, we know it's on inland lakes. It is capable of moving, and it follows the fish and it follows the fisher people and the bait dealers, and it will follow infected fish that are transported. The interesting thing I can tell you is that we were the ones that discovered a viral, it's - sorry, Ira, it's viral hemorrhagic septicemia. VHSV.  FLATOW: Oh, I keep calling it HSV.  Dr. CASEY: We'll let this fly.  FLATOW: I'm sorry, you're right.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Have - confusing it with herpes simplex.  Dr. CASEY: Right, that's bad enough. And so, yeah, Kendall. It - we found it in bait minnows. And what was interesting is the bait minnows were apparently healthy. There were no clinical signs of disease, yet we found extremely high viral levels in bait minnows. So a visual inspection was not useful. We had to use a nucleic acid base test to do it. So innocently, you could be spreading this. The fishermen could spread this thinking that the fish are healthy or whatever.  So it's an invisible disease that is hard to follow, and we have to change our behavior. A common saying in virology is all infectious diseases are behavioral, and this is behavior where we're transporting fish and innocently releasing minnows thinking we're feeding fish and helping the environment; you might be infecting them. So we have to change our behavior, clean our boats, be very careful about transporting fish.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's see if we can take another phone call here. In - Dudley in Olympia, Washington. Hi, Dudley.  DUDLEY (Caller): Hi.  FLATOW: Hi there.  DUDLEY: I was wondering if it appears that this virus will affect anadromous fish like the salmon species Pacific Northwest.  Dr. CASEY: Gee, we know we can get into salmon in the Great Lakes. The fear is the marine isolate of viral hemorrhagic septicemia is already having an impact on the salmon in the Northwest that have been studied heavily in the rivers out there. Whether this virus is more pathogenic or less pathogenic to those species could be determined experimentally. It just hasn't been done.  FLATOW: Wow. So we were just at the beginning. We're at the tip of this iceberg.  Dr. CASEY: Yeah. I think so. I hope we're in the middle of it right now, because the spread has been rather dramatic. I can tell you this spring - you can see, with all the press releases that we're seeing, numerous outbreaks both in new locations and in locations from previous years up near Rochester -Irondequoit Bay. We've seen an outbreak again in gobies. So that's. . .  FLATOW: But what I'm saying - if you're saying if I heard you correctly that even marine fish are susceptible to this virus. . .  Dr. CASEY: The marine fish - as I said earlier in the talk, the marine isolate of viral hemorrhagic septicemia is genetically very close, and that does have an impact. We don't know if the freshwater variant, the new genetic type that's killing the fish in the Great Lakes, could even go back and infect marine species. It hasn't been tested. So we don't know what the effect of that would be should this virus in the Great Lakes get out into the saltwater.  FLATOW: Mark in Whitewater, Wisconsin. Hi, Mark.  MARK (Caller): Hello.  FLATOW: Hi there. Go ahead.  MARK: I bought quite a large batch of tropical fish - oh, it must have been about a year ago - and a large number of them died, and I took some of them in and they described it as hemorrhagic septicemia. And, well, that's what they said. First question is, is it possible to be - released tropical fish into the local rivers and lakes, like goldfish and whatnot - can that cause the disease to spread? Second, I don't know if you've really described the symptoms of the disease yet. Maybe that's not what I had to start with.  FLATOW: Well, we'll get into - those are two good questions. Let me remind everybody that I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Talking with James Casey. Dr. Casey?  Dr. CASEY: Sure. Yeah. Certainly, the - you could spread diseases by releasing fish into a new environment, but hemorrhagic septicemia is a general term for a pathological condition that could be caused by bacterial infection, and that's more than likely what happened to your tropical fish. Until you bring it to a diagnostic facility where they do histology or PCR - these are very expensive procedures, by the way - you'll never know. So you have to take it to a bona fide fish pathology laboratory to diagnose it correctly.  Dudley(ph), as an aside, this virus will infect zebra fish. That's one of our experimental models that we're working on. So we can purposely infect these fish in a laboratory environment under high containment so nothing is released and study pathogenesis. So it just shows that this virus is - we use the words completely promiscuous, and it will infect a wide variety of species.  FLATOW: And the symptoms?  Dr. CASEY: The symptoms are - as the name implies, hemorrhagic septicemia - the endothelial lining of blood vessels is attacked by the virus and breaks it down, so the blood leaks into the tissue and pools. When you see one of these fish, the gills are completely white, and the blood is all pooled into abdominal cavity and into the musculature. The kidneys and spleen are immediately infected and show a devastating effect to practically life(ph). And the fish suffocates.  FLATOW: And to repeat - because we just have a couple of minutes left - the greatest - the battle, the large battle here, is in prevention, preventing it spreading.  Dr. CASEY: If you look back at human epidemics before we - before the advent of vaccines or other therapies, our most effective strategy was containment, and it gets into really complex mathematical terms on epidemiology. But containment of - diagnosing and containing the spread - just imagine if we know that we have an outbreak or the virus is present in one location - simply limiting activity in that location for perhaps a month would prevent a spread to other places.  FLATOW: Is there enough person power, manpower, to man the - you know, and get the word out and tell people and. . .  Dr. CASEY: Well, that's us, and that's three other labs in the local environment to try to set up an extension where we can communicate how to prevent spreading this agent, innocently spreading it through boating activities. And we have numerous grants pending that we're trying to get funded so we can set up a continual monitoring system in the Great Lakes.  FLATOW: But why would you need grants on this? Shouldn't there be, you know, somebody goes out - like the National Guard or somebody - and talks to people if this is an epidemic that's going on? You're going to wait for a grant to be funded.  Dr. CASEY: We - we first diagnosed this a year ago, and we're just getting funding now. So fortunately, we had some funding that we could apply and (unintelligible) to spend, and so we now we have caught up, and we need more money to go on. So does everybody. So yes, most certainly, we shouldn't be waiting. And this will be something to call your congressman, a senator, and let them know that something can be done about this. State agencies have historically been very generous. A lot of that money has dried up in the past and through need to support other initiatives but now reestablishing a continual funding, monitoring centers, environmental centers to surveil(ph) would be critical.  FLATOW: Dr. Casey, thank you very much.  Dr. CASEY: Thank you, Ira.  FLATOW: Good luck to you and your efforts. James Casey, associate professor of virology at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca, New York. We'll take a break and come back and talk about how you can pick a song that's going to be a short hit - maybe. Stay with us. We'll be right back.  I'm Ira Flatow.

I'm Ira Flatow. A few years back, zookeepers at Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo discovered that one of their hammerhead sharks had given birth. Now, that's not unusual - except her tank had three females and no males. In fact, the female shark had not been exposed to males for at least three years. Now, hammerhead sharks can store sperm, and initially, researchers thought that one of the females had done just that - stored sperm inside her body and used it later to fertilize an egg. But a new report out this week tells a much different story. The baby shark was genetically identical to the mother. There was no male genetic contribution. It's the first such time that a birth - a parthenogenesis - has been documented in a hammerhead shark. Joining me now to talk more about it is my guest George Burgess, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research at Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Mr. GEORGE BURGESS (Director, Florida Program for Shark Research, Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida): It's good to be with you. FLATOW: How shocked were you or anybody else about it? Mr. BURGESS: Well, actually I'd known a little bit about this story in advance because the office reported on this in scientific meetings several years ago. So we were anticipating the publication of it. FLATOW: So this is a big story for shark researchers, then? Mr. BURGESS: It's a real interest in the sense that among the vertebrate groups, parthenogenesis or asexual reproduction has been documented in all but sharks and mammals. And so it wasn't wholly unexpected in sharks, being one of the more basal groups, but of course the implications are similar to - they were in other groups as well. FLATOW: Tell us about the ability, the talent of a shark to store sperm for so long. Mr. BURGESS: Well, storing sperm is something we've known about for some time in sharks, and many different groups of sharks are able to do this. Obviously, the advantage of that, from an evolutionary standpoint, is to take full advantage of your opportunity to reproduce whenever it comes to you. And of course, as a female, then she - in a way sort of has the choice for fertilization in - by storing sperm when the opportunity arises. We've known for many years that in aquaria - occasional females will give birth in aquaria where there are no males. And in many of these cases, sperm storage has either been found as the answer or hypothesized as the answer. FLATOW: So, do you hypothesize that this parthenogenesis, not needing the male, goes on regularly in the wild, not just once in the zoo? Mr. BURGESS: No, actually quite the opposite. At this point scientifically, all we have been able to document as a scientific community is parthenogenesis in the artificial situations of an aquarium. It has not been documented in the wild, and of course it begs the question, then, is there something about isolating these organisms in an artificial environment of an aquarium, thus contributing to the process? FLATOW: It would be much tougher to tell in the wild, would it not? Mr. BURGESS: Yes, it would. Of course, the way this was determined and ascertained is through genetic studies of the offspring to determine who the parents were. And in this case, the determination was only the mother. There have been genetic studies done and are continuing to be done on wild-caught(ph) animals, and a lot of groups are working on the genetics of individual broods, for instance. We know that in many - if not most - species, where a female gives birth to her pups, as they're called, it's quite common and pretty much the norm now that those are fathered by a series of fathers rather than a single parent. FLATOW: Right. Mr. BURGESS: So the question is, are we seeing this parthenogenesis in the aquarium simply because we're able to look at it more carefully, or is it simply a situation where the artificial isolation of females in aquaria is contributing to the situation? FLATOW: Do other - are other fish able to do this? Do other fish do this? Mr. BURGESS: Other fishes do. FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. BURGESS: And in fact, so do amphibians, reptiles, and birds, among the other vertebrate groups. FLATOW: We've even heard reports, I'm sure there's, you know - you can fill me in more on this - of fishes changing sex if they have to. Mr. BURGESS: Yes. In fact, that is the norm for certain species. For instance, groupers and other sea basses routinely change sex, some of the rasses(ph) and so on. But again, this is routine within those groups. FLATOW: Could this be unique to sharks, or could it have anything to do with how old they are in the history of evolution, how far back they go? Mr. BURGESS: I guess my thoughts on the matter are these - I think that it's very possible that this is a mechanism, an evolutionary mechanism, that's in place that is induced during situations when a female is basically shut out from contact with other males. In other words, under extreme situations where the female is not having an opportunity to mate, evolutionarily, it is given the shot, the opportunity, then, to parthenogenetically reproduce.  Of course, there's a risk and a real cost in doing so, and that cost is reduction of genetic diversity. You're only going to get one parent's worth of genes and genetic material. And so this, of course, is what leads to inbreeding, and from an evolutionary standpoint, it's not a positive step because there's less viability of the offspring. FLATOW: Now, I imagine that your aquarium or any aquarium can't really be that unique, you know, in having the females to with each other. Might you not expect to hear from other aquaria\u2026 Mr. BURGESS: Yes. FLATOW: \u2026to report on this? Mr. BURGESS: There have been other instances of, if you will, a virgin birth being reported in aquaria involving at least two other species. It really comes down to situations where aquaria are not including members of the opposite sex in their tanks together. And - but more importantly is, is this a strategy that is routinely employed in the real world or not? FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. BURGESS: And that's - the compelling question is, what was seen in this aquarium - is it occurring in the natural environment? Now we know that the species involved in this case, the bonnethead shark, the small hammerhead shark, is reproducing very nicely by traditional means of males and females throughout its range. And that species is in not particular danger from a conservation status in terms of being over-fished or killed out. If it was, however, and there were less opportunities of males and females to get together, then parthenogenesis might be a strategy that would then be invoked in the wild. FLATOW: Dr. Burgess, I want thank you for taking time to be with us. Mr. BURGESS: Glad to be with you. FLATOW: Good luck to you, have a happy holiday weekend. Mr. BURGESS: You do too.

I'm Ira Flatow. The 2007 hurricane season officially begins next week on June 1st, and you might be wondering: are we in for a relatively quiet season like we had last year or one like 2005, which brought the one-two punch of Katrina and Rita? And if you're a cynic, you might be asking: what's the use of predicting the hurricane season when last year's prediction was such a bust? Well, joining us now to give us his predictions for this season, tell us weather conditions are right for really severe storms and explain why hurricane prediction is not an exact science, is my guest, Gerry Bell, the lead seasonal hurricane forecaster for the NOAA Climate Prediction Center at the National Weather Service in Camp Springs, Maryland. Welcome back to the program, Dr. Bell. Dr. GERRY BELL (Hurricane Forecaster, NOAA Climate Prediction Center, National Weather Service): Oh, it's a pleasure. Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: Things getting busy for you now? Dr. BELL: Oh, very much so. Looks like we're going to have a very active season here. We're predicting 13 to 17 main storms, of which we expect seven to 10 to become hurricanes and three to five to become major hurricanes. FLATOW: May we know - you sat here about a year ago and you said almost the same thing. Dr. BELL: Yes, we did. There's a big difference this year. We - since this current active hurricane era began in 1995, there have only been three seasons that were not above normal; all were El Nino years. Last year, we had a rapidly developing El Nino during the summer months that was simply not predicted. And as a result, we fortunately got a reduction in the activity that we needed from these past several very heavy seasons. But this year, El Nino isn't in the cards at all. In fact, its counterpart, La Nina, is quite likely. And unfortunately, La Nina, in the presence of an active of hurricane era, is known to produce very high levels of hurricane activity. FLATOW: What does La Nina do to encourage or help hurricanes develop? Dr. BELL: La Nina acts to reduce the wind shear over the tropical Atlantic. The wind shear refers to how the winds change as you go up through the atmosphere. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. BELL:  It turns out hurricanes require that the wind shear be quite low, that the winds be relatively uniform as you go up through the atmosphere. La Nina produces that. Those - already the wind shear is going to lower because we're in this active hurricane era that's favoring reduced wind shear. So you've got a combination of climate factors that are acting together this year, whereas last year, like I said, unfortunately, the El Nino came up. El Nino increases the wind shear and it was able to at least bring the activity down into a near-normal range. But we don't expect that this year. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number if you want to talk about the hurricanes. We'll be answering your calls. Do you expect that people are going be taking it seriously this year? You know, maybe they said last year, hey, you know, you guys predicted this; it didn't happen. That's always the real danger, isn't? Dr. BELL: That is. The seasonal hurricane forecasts are normally highly confident forecasts. Last year was the first - last August was the first time we ever over-predicted the activity. And one year is different than the next. As I said, last year, we failed to predict El Nino. This year, El Nino is not in the cards, so it's a completely different physical situation. So there's no rational basis whatsoever for concluding that because the forecast was wrong last year, it will be wrong this year. Generally, what we found is since we begun these hurricane outlooks in 1998 that they're highly accurate and normally highly confident forecasts. FLATOW: Yeah. Give us some of the clues that make you think that it's going to be overly active this year. Dr. BELL: Well, there's three main factors. The first one is the wind and air pressure patterns that have been in place since 1995, and we know those support an active hurricane era. Even last year, although the activity was reduced, these same conditions were still in place. So last year was no indicator that this current active era has ended. In fact, this active era has not ended. These conditions - we've seen them before. We saw them in the 1950s and '60s when there was the previous active hurricane era. And we saw opposite conditions during the '70s, '80s and early '90s, which as you probably recall, was quite a below normal hurricane era. The second major factor is ongoing warmer Atlantic Ocean temperatures. They've been quite warm now since 2003. Ongoing warmer water is consistent with more activity. And the third one is the possibility of a La Nina episode. But even if La Nina doesn't develop, just the ongoing active era and the warmer water is sufficient to produce above normal season. The scary thing is that if La Nina does develop, that would increase the probabilities that the activity is going be at the upper end of our predicted range or possibly even higher. FLATOW: One of the other hurricane forecasts predicted that six or even seven hurricanes would strike the U. S. Coast. Can you really predict how many hurricanes are going to make it - make landfall? Dr. BELL: No. One societal(ph) belief that science is there to really make a specific prediction like that. For the climate conditions that are setting up now, historically, on average, two to four hurricanes have struck the United States. So it's certainly reasonable to expect two to four hurricane strikes this year. During these above normal seasons, both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast have equal probabilities of getting a hurricane, and that's - it's very high. So if the activity does pan out, we would - it would be reasonable to expect hurricane strikes on both coasts. But the precise number really depends on the weather patterns over the United States as the individual hurricanes are approaching, and that's just simply not predictable at these extended ranges. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. How have you guys at NOAA fared since Katrina? Have you had an increase in muscle power or funding or any other kind of lack that you might have had pre-Katrina? Dr. BELL: Well, I'm not really involved in the funding. I'm a research scientist and a hurricane forecaster. FLATOW: Are you getting everything you need? Dr. BELL: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely - we are more than, yeah, sufficiently funded to produce these forecasts. Anything I say I need, we get. So it's great, and it's consistent with - I mean, NOAA has been very involved with these seasonal hurricane outlooks since we began them back in 1998, and you could see from the press conference the other day, we had you know, people from cabinet level down to the head of FEMA, to the head of the Hurricane Center, to the head of NOAA, down to the forecasters. So these forecasts are taken very seriously by all levels of government because we all understand how important they are, and people need to understand this as well. They should be - these forecasts should be people's cue to say, hey, the hurricane season is coming; I need to start thinking about my preparedness plan. Because we see time and time again those that have prepared, if a hurricane strikes, they fare much better than those who have not. So this should be people's cue along the coastline start getting prepared. FLATOW: Get out the plywood, the spare water, an escape route, things like that. Dr. BELL: That's right, and other things. Just simply as having a logical plan written down so that in an emergency, you don't have to try and do panic thinking and think, oh, what do I do? Have it written down so that you can just read right off the list that you've developed, you know, over a period of time in a calm, you know, thoughtful fashion. FLATOW: Yeah, the week of a hurricane is not the time to buy those batteries for the flashlight. Dr. BELL: No, it is not. And there's things that - there's an incredible amount of information out there now. NOAA's Web site, the Hurricane Center, Weather Service, the Red Cross, FEMA - all have excellent sites on what things you can do to prepare not only as an individual, but if you are like a small business person or somebody like that, things that you can do now to start preparing. A very simple thing is to get your papers in order for - the deed to your house, your social security card, identifications. Those types are very important personal papers, so that if you do need to evacuate, you can just grab them and go. What we found during Hurricane Katrina was, you know, a lot of devastation and a lot of people no longer have identity. They no longer have proof of ownership of whatever it may be. FLATOW: Let's go to the phones. Let's go to Carlton(ph) in Charlotte, North Carolina. Hi, Carlton. CARLTON (Caller): Hi. How are you? Thanks for taking my call. I experienced Hurricane Katrina down - excuse me - Hurricane Hugo in Charleston, South Carolina back in 1989. And as I listened to recent reports, I wonder why they never really referenced that storm being one of the major modern times - one of the major storms that kind of really caused so much devastation. FLATOW: Gerry? Dr. BELL: Well, Hurricane Hugo was certainly a big storm, and we had tremendous flooding in the Carolinas as a result of Hugo. The state - in fact, I wound up briefing some congressmen down there about that - and even at that time was indicating that, you know, we're in an active hurricane era and that this is certainly, you know, typical of the things we can expect to see. I think Katrina was - Katrina is more recently on our minds because it's just, you know, the entire devastation of New Orleans. But Hugo, from a meteorological perspective, and I think from the response, is certainly not considered a small event. FLATOW: Thanks for calling, Carlton. CARLTON: Thank you. FLATOW: Have a good weekend. 1-800-989-8255, Marianne(ph) in Alexandria, Virginia. MARIANNE (Caller): Hi. FLATOW: Hi there. MARIANNE: Also, thanks for taking my call. The question that I have is, was the crazy hurricane season we had in 2005 due to La Nina, or was there something else that worked there? Dr. BELL: The record 2005 season was a combination of factors. The first one -again, the ongoing active era that sets up the overall wind and air pressure and ocean temperature patterns and therefore predisposes you to an above normal season, so that was the background conditions. We - the second thing was a La Nina-like - although we had weak La Nina conditions. The important thing was that La-Nina-like forcing was quite strong. And again, when you get that combination of La Nina in an active era, you get a lot of activity. A third factor was that Atlantic Ocean temperatures were record warm. That was contributing to the strength. And the fourth one was the pressure patterns over the Western Atlantic in Southeastern U. S. We had a big, very persistent, high-pressure ridge in the upper atmosphere during much of the season. And that, of course, favors low wind shear - and just again very favorable. So it was really a combination of four main factors that contributed to that record season. Fortunately, we haven't seen that combination very often, but we did get it in 2005. FLATOW: Thanks for calling, Marianne. MARIANNE: Thank you. FLATOW: Let's go to Fort Lauderdale. Kate(ph), hi. Welcome. KATE (Caller): Hi, nice to be with you, Ira. FLATOW: Thank you. KATE: Gerry, I was wondering. I'm - live here in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and I was listening to a show with the new director of the National Weather Service and his comments on NOAA and how the satellite - it needs much repair - that does a lot of the forecasting. And NOAA is planning on spending - I think it was $100 million - on your centennial celebration, and he was asking if they could, you know, pick those funds and really do the much-needed repairs on the satellite. So do you use that as one of your important tools in forecasting? Dr. BELL: Well, I believe the number that NOAA was spending was $4 million, but again I'm - not $100 million, that's insane. KATE: Oh, okay. (Soundbite of laughter) KATE: These are some astronomical numbers\u2026 Dr. BELL: I don't use\u2026 KATE: \u2026and my idea of a government celebration, but\u2026 Dr. BELL: Well, I'm not involved with that. I don't use the satellite per se. The satellite - let me restate this - we use the satellite very much to monitor the climate patterns and to open - make the seasonal hurricane predictions. The specific satellite they're talking - referring to is one that - it's called the - it has a QuikSCAT measurement device on it that allows you to get winds or something like that. I really don't use that type of thing for making the seasonal predictions. That information is mainly used by the Hurricane Center, and I'm not really able to speak on what NOAA is doing or not doing. I know they're - in hearing some conversations that they're - they've been aware the satellite has been going to go for many years, and they've got plans that they developed over many, many years, but I don't know the details on that. KATE: I think he said it may even be on its last leg, if I'm understanding correctly. Dr. BELL: It's on backup power. It's apparently not on its last leg, but I'm not really able to speak on those issues. FLATOW: Hey, we're going to look into that for you. KATE: Okay. Thanks so much. Good luck in your predictions. Dr. BELL: Thank you. FLATOW: Talking with Gerry Bell at this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Talking about the (unintelligible) hurricane. That would be not a nice thing if you lose a satellite, is it? Gerry, you don't want to lose a satellite. Dr. BELL: No. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. BELL: We have many, many meteorological satellites up there from giving us global coverage for things like climate prediction, monitoring ocean temperatures, global climate variability and so on. And then we have satellites that can hone on right in on helping us to get the estimates of the wind speeds in and around the hurricane itself - all of these. There is a wide array of meteorological satellites that NOAA uses. FLATOW: Let me go out a little further north of Florida. Let's go to Michigan. Hi, Jem(ph), in Three Rivers. JEM (Caller): Hi. My question is, if we do have an active hurricane season, what can those of us in the Lower Great Lakes expect in terms of changes in the weather? Will we see a smaller number, a very large rain event during the summer or any effect on us? FLATOW: Good question. JEM: And I'll take my answer off line, thanks. Dr. BELL: I don't think we can really say ahead of time whether there was going to be any changes in the weather patterns, if we have more hurricanes. So I wouldn't expect much in the way of, say, changes in the normal patterns of thunderstorm activity and so on. So I - there's not much of a relationship between the hurricane season and weather patterns in the Midwest. FLATOW: What would\u2026 Dr. BELL:  However, sometimes when the flow patterns do set up, you may have a large-scale jet-string pattern that not only, let's say, may produce certain type of conditions in the Midwest and downstream, it's also affecting the hurricane activity. That certainly - we see that type of thing, but there's too many different scenarios to really pinpoint anything at this time. FLATOW: How would global warming affect hurricane season? Dr. BELL: Well, that's - the global warming impacts - now for the very narrow issue of global warming impacts on Atlantic hurricanes, I don't believe that answer has been solved yet. The global warming impacts on Atlantic hurricanes' long-term transits are very important issue. Another very important issue is these long-term patterns that last for 25, 35, 40 years at a time and give us these active and inactive hurricane eras. We're developing a suite of climate models right now, not only within NOAA but the science community in general, to better handle these - all of these climate processes in hopes that I think one day we will be able to say, for instance, how much global warming is contributing in a given season versus these multi-decadal patterns, but I don't believe we're there yet. But they are all very important issues, and we're heavily invested in trying to answer these questions. FLATOW: Gerry, as always, thank you for coming on each year and giving us the seasonal forecast. Dr. BELL: It's a pleasure. Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: Gerry Bell is the lead seasonal hurricane forecaster for NOAA's Climate Prediction Center at the National Weather Service in Camp Springs, Maryland. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: Have a great weekend and a safe weekend, if you're leaving us. I'm Ira Flatow in New York.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  The 2007 hurricane season officially begins next week on June 1st, and you might be wondering: are we in for a relatively quiet season like we had last year or one like 2005, which brought the one-two punch of Katrina and Rita? And if you're a cynic, you might be asking: what's the use of predicting the hurricane season when last year's prediction was such a bust?  Well, joining us now to give us his predictions for this season, tell us weather conditions are right for really severe storms and explain why hurricane prediction is not an exact science, is my guest, Gerry Bell, the lead seasonal hurricane forecaster for the NOAA Climate Prediction Center at the National Weather Service in Camp Springs, Maryland.  Welcome back to the program, Dr. Bell.  Dr. GERRY BELL (Hurricane Forecaster, NOAA Climate Prediction Center, National Weather Service): Oh, it's a pleasure. Thank you, Ira.  FLATOW: Things getting busy for you now?  Dr. BELL: Oh, very much so. Looks like we're going to have a very active season here. We're predicting 13 to 17 main storms, of which we expect seven to 10 to become hurricanes and three to five to become major hurricanes.  FLATOW: May we know - you sat here about a year ago and you said almost the same thing.  Dr. BELL: Yes, we did. There's a big difference this year. We - since this current active hurricane era began in 1995, there have only been three seasons that were not above normal; all were El Nino years.  Last year, we had a rapidly developing El Nino during the summer months that was simply not predicted. And as a result, we fortunately got a reduction in the activity that we needed from these past several very heavy seasons. But this year, El Nino isn't in the cards at all. In fact, its counterpart, La Nina, is quite likely. And unfortunately, La Nina, in the presence of an active of hurricane era, is known to produce very high levels of hurricane activity.  FLATOW: What does La Nina do to encourage or help hurricanes develop?  Dr. BELL: La Nina acts to reduce the wind shear over the tropical Atlantic. The wind shear refers to how the winds change as you go up through the atmosphere.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. BELL:  It turns out hurricanes require that the wind shear be quite low, that the winds be relatively uniform as you go up through the atmosphere. La Nina produces that.  Those - already the wind shear is going to lower because we're in this active hurricane era that's favoring reduced wind shear. So you've got a combination of climate factors that are acting together this year, whereas last year, like I said, unfortunately, the El Nino came up. El Nino increases the wind shear and it was able to at least bring the activity down into a near-normal range. But we don't expect that this year.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number if you want to talk about the hurricanes. We'll be answering your calls. Do you expect that people are going be taking it seriously this year? You know, maybe they said last year, hey, you know, you guys predicted this; it didn't happen. That's always the real danger, isn't?  Dr. BELL: That is. The seasonal hurricane forecasts are normally highly confident forecasts. Last year was the first - last August was the first time we ever over-predicted the activity. And one year is different than the next. As I said, last year, we failed to predict El Nino. This year, El Nino is not in the cards, so it's a completely different physical situation.  So there's no rational basis whatsoever for concluding that because the forecast was wrong last year, it will be wrong this year. Generally, what we found is since we begun these hurricane outlooks in 1998 that they're highly accurate and normally highly confident forecasts.  FLATOW: Yeah. Give us some of the clues that make you think that it's going to be overly active this year.  Dr. BELL: Well, there's three main factors. The first one is the wind and air pressure patterns that have been in place since 1995, and we know those support an active hurricane era. Even last year, although the activity was reduced, these same conditions were still in place. So last year was no indicator that this current active era has ended.  In fact, this active era has not ended. These conditions - we've seen them before. We saw them in the 1950s and '60s when there was the previous active hurricane era. And we saw opposite conditions during the '70s, '80s and early '90s, which as you probably recall, was quite a below normal hurricane era.  The second major factor is ongoing warmer Atlantic Ocean temperatures. They've been quite warm now since 2003. Ongoing warmer water is consistent with more activity. And the third one is the possibility of a La Nina episode. But even if La Nina doesn't develop, just the ongoing active era and the warmer water is sufficient to produce above normal season.  The scary thing is that if La Nina does develop, that would increase the probabilities that the activity is going be at the upper end of our predicted range or possibly even higher.  FLATOW: One of the other hurricane forecasts predicted that six or even seven hurricanes would strike the U. S. Coast. Can you really predict how many hurricanes are going to make it - make landfall?  Dr. BELL: No. One societal(ph) belief that science is there to really make a specific prediction like that. For the climate conditions that are setting up now, historically, on average, two to four hurricanes have struck the United States. So it's certainly reasonable to expect two to four hurricane strikes this year. During these above normal seasons, both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast have equal probabilities of getting a hurricane, and that's - it's very high.  So if the activity does pan out, we would - it would be reasonable to expect hurricane strikes on both coasts. But the precise number really depends on the weather patterns over the United States as the individual hurricanes are approaching, and that's just simply not predictable at these extended ranges.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. How have you guys at NOAA fared since Katrina? Have you had an increase in muscle power or funding or any other kind of lack that you might have had pre-Katrina?  Dr. BELL: Well, I'm not really involved in the funding. I'm a research scientist and a hurricane forecaster.  FLATOW: Are you getting everything you need?  Dr. BELL: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely - we are more than, yeah, sufficiently funded to produce these forecasts. Anything I say I need, we get. So it's great, and it's consistent with - I mean, NOAA has been very involved with these seasonal hurricane outlooks since we began them back in 1998, and you could see from the press conference the other day, we had you know, people from cabinet level down to the head of FEMA, to the head of the Hurricane Center, to the head of NOAA, down to the forecasters.  So these forecasts are taken very seriously by all levels of government because we all understand how important they are, and people need to understand this as well. They should be - these forecasts should be people's cue to say, hey, the hurricane season is coming; I need to start thinking about my preparedness plan. Because we see time and time again those that have prepared, if a hurricane strikes, they fare much better than those who have not. So this should be people's cue along the coastline start getting prepared.  FLATOW: Get out the plywood, the spare water, an escape route, things like that.  Dr. BELL: That's right, and other things. Just simply as having a logical plan written down so that in an emergency, you don't have to try and do panic thinking and think, oh, what do I do? Have it written down so that you can just read right off the list that you've developed, you know, over a period of time in a calm, you know, thoughtful fashion.  FLATOW: Yeah, the week of a hurricane is not the time to buy those batteries for the flashlight.  Dr. BELL: No, it is not.

I'm Ira Flatow. A bit later in the hour, we'll be talking about biocomputers and this year's hurricane season. But up first, a discovery that sounds like the plot from one of those 1950s nuclear radiation science fiction movies. Remember them? Well, this one is just as fantastic, but it's real. Scientists studying the destroyed Chernobyl nuclear reactor were surprised to discover a fungus growing - not just growing; it was thriving on the highly reactive walls of the reactor. Should we be afraid the fungus is going to grow and escape the confine of the reactor and eat everything in sight? Here's where science comes in. How was the fungus able to not only survive the radiation - how was it able to use it as food? That's what my next guest wants us to know. The research is being published online in this week's Public Library of Science One, and here to talk about it is one of the authors. Ekaterina Dadachova is an associate professor of nuclear medicine and of microbiology and immunology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. She joins us today from her office. Welcome to the program. Dr. EKATERINA DADACHOVA (Associate Professor, Nuclear Medicine and Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine): Hi. Thank you for inviting me, Ira. I am happy to be here. FLATOW: Well, Dr. Dadachova, tell us about this. How does it survive the radiation? Why isn't it killed by the radiation, and how does it eat it? Dr. DADACHOVA: Well, it survives for the simple reason that there are doses of radiation inside the reactor in many places where this melanized fungi thrive that are not that high to kill the fungus, because fungi are extremely radio resistant. I will give you an example. For example, to kill one of the fungi, which we used in our paper, one needs to deliver around one million rads. This is the unit in which radiation exposure is measured. And the dose inside the Chernobyl reactor right now is only approximately one rad per day. So one need to radiate fungi for millions of days. So these doses are really beneficial for them if they can use radiation in their metabolism, but they're are not fungicidal. They do not kill fungi. FLATOW: We know that fungi, you know, they feast on dead wood and other things. But we never suspected that they feasted on radiation, did we? Dr. DADACHOVA: No. We never suspected it, but my collaborator, Dr. Casadevall, with whom we do this research, he actually suspected that, you know, fungi can use radiation as energy source when he was reading about this melanized fungi colonizing the destroyed reacting Chernobyl, the soils around it. And later on, we found reports that there are actually findings of melanized fungi in Arctic, in Antarctica, in high elevation. But what actually is in common between all those areas is the lack of other conventional nutrients, nutrients - for example, this deadwood, as you are referring to. So those fungi would be seeking other additional sources of energy, and apparently they will be finding them in ionizing radiation. FLATOW: Now, the key here seems to be - you have mentioned a couple times -melanin. These fungi have melanin in them. Dr. DADACHOVA: Yes. These fungi have melanin. Melanin is a pigment. Its name is derived from the Greek word for melanos, which is black. So it is a black to dark brown pigment. And in our experiments, we have shown in several species of fungi that it is actually the presence of melanin which allows those fungi to use the energy of ionizing radiation in their life cycle. If we use controlled fungi, the same fungi but without melanin, they couldn't utilize the benefits of being in the rotation field. FLATOW: Is this the same kind of melanin that we have on our skin that turn it into darker or makes our skin dark? Dr. DADACHOVA: Well, melanin is actually a very enigmatic pigment because there is no crystal structure of melanin, no good spectra of melanin, because it is impossible to crystallize it. But it has been shown by many studies that a lot of similarities between melanin, which is found in human skin, in (unintelligible), in hair and in - also in fungi. So it shares a lot of structural similarities. FLATOW: So does the melanin function in the fungi by absorbing the radiation much like chlorophyll would function in a green plant by absorbing the sunlight? Dr. DADACHOVA: Well, at this stage, we do not know the mechanism but this is analogy which seems to be correct, because one needs to have a pigment, which serves as a transducer of energy. And that is what chlorophyll does during photosynthesis, transfuse the energy of visible light into the chemical energy the plants are using. And here, it seems to be that melanin is capable of transfusing the energy of ionizing radiation into the chemical energy where fungi are capable to utilize. FLATOW: Well, let's move ahead and talk about what useful stuff could come out of this discovery. Dr. DADACHOVA: Well, for example, one can imagine that those fungi or other organisms which are capable of utilizing radiation, they can be used for production of biofuels, for example, now that biofuels is a growing area. But if one start to grow these biofuels on their good lands, you know, that wouldn't be really energy-efficient. But on the other hand, there are lots of wasted land where, you know, nothing can be grown. There are all this underground storage of radioactive byproducts of nuclear cycles, for example. That's where one can imagine growing all those fungi and using them for biofuel. Simultaneously, it is possible - now we know that genetic engineering of good crops is going ahead at full speed, so one can imagine that the system will be engineered where there - crops will have gene responsible for melanin in their genome, and they will be able to grow using ionizing radiation instead of visible light, for example. And this could be used in space flights and other application where growing crops conventionally is difficult. FLATOW: How much radiation do you need? Can it grow in background radiation -and these are higher radiation, as you say - in these nuclear waste sites? Dr. DADACHOVA: Well, it can grow - we have to actually determine what would be the optimal levels of radiation for this fungi, but it seems that they can be grown in a really broad range of radiation fluxes from something which is tolerable to humans to really high levels, because there are reports and literature that this melanized fungi, for example, live in the cooling pools of nuclear reactors. And over there, the radiation dose is so high that, you know, even this like destroyed reacting Chernobyl is not even getting close to that. FLATOW: Could we then think about - let's think of something that's out of this world. We're always looking for life in outer space and the harsh environments that are out there. Dr. DADACHOVA: Right. FLATOW: Could these fungi really be, you know, resistant to not just radiation but other harsher environments that we might look for them in other worlds? Dr. DADACHOVA: Melanin is known to be a protector of - from, you know, many insults, environmental insults. It protects microorganisms, like when they invade other organism from all this antimicrobial defenses, which the organisms are trying to put up. So melanin can protect against a lot of things, and it is known and it has been actually used in practice that it can absorb very harsh UV rays, for example. And it absorbs all visible light, that's why it is black. So it is possible that those particular microorganisms can withstand a lot of different insults, which they will encounter in the space. Yes, you are right. FLATOW: Yeah. It's interesting to think, as you say before, of having melanin fungi biomass producers, you know, for energy. Dr. DADACHOVA: Yeah because, you know, ionizing radiation is everywhere at certain levels, higher or lower, depending on what you are talking about. And it is just wasted. You know, it's being decayed and not used for anything. FLATOW: Right. Sitting in pools in barrels all over the world. Dr. DADACHOVA: Yes, exactly. FLATOW: Does the fungi itself become radioactive and dangerous, one that sits so close to the stuff? Dr. DADACHOVA: No. Fungi - that's I want to stress, you know, for the listeners - that fungi cannot become radioactive because all they do is they utilize the - for example, gamma radiation, which has been already emitted by radioactive sources. And what they're doing, they're just utilizing the energy of ionizing radiation. Radiation is energy. It's the source of radiation. That's a completely separate thing. So fungi, just using it exactly in the same manner, as we discussed earlier, the green plants would be using the visible light. So it has nothing to do with fungi becoming radioactive themselves. FLATOW: Is there enough radiation in outer space that we might grow the fungi in a spaceship if we're going to Mars or some place like that and using them -using it as an energy source? Dr. DADACHOVA: Oh, yeah. In outer space, there is a lot of radiation. Actually, it is known that radiation exposure of even those who fly on passenger jets, you know, often, they're approaching the radiation exposure of professional radiation workers like myself, for example. So there is a lot of radiation out there for fungi to thrive, yes. FLATOW: So where do you go from here? What's your next thing - how do you take this one step further? Dr. DADACHOVA: Well, what we would like to do now is actually to try and figure out the mechanism of this process, because, for example, to figure out the mechanism of photosynthesis, it took the work of several groups and several decades. Well, we hope that, you know, other research groups will become interested in these particular phenomena. And with the combined effort, we will be able to figure out the mechanism of this fascinating process, which will allow to use it for practical applications sooner than later. FLATOW: And which was - and basically discovered by accident? Dr. DADACHOVA: Well, I wouldn't say by accident, because, you know, as I said, this is a collaborative work. And my lab is very interested in using radiation for, say, therapy for different purposes. Dr. Casadevall, who is a prominent microbiologist, she has a long-standing interest in melanin. So at a certain point, you know, these two interests, they, you know, would come together, and they did. FLATOW: Right. Dr. DADACHOVA: And, I guess it's now becoming more and more obvious that microorganisms are very flexible and they can use different sources of energy. You see, last year, there was a report that microorganisms live at the bottom of the ocean. FLATOW: Oh\u2026 Dr. DADACHOVA: Yes? FLATOW: I've got to interrupt because we're running out of time. And this is\u2026 Dr. DADACHOVA: Yes, okay. Thank you so much. FLATOW: Thank you very much and good luck to you. Dr. Ekaterina Dadachova, associate professor of nuclear medicine at Albert Einstein College. We're going to come back, more science fiction-like stuff. Stay with us, we'll be right back. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  A bit later in the hour, we'll be talking about biocomputers and this year's hurricane season. But up first, a discovery that sounds like the plot from one of those 1950s nuclear radiation science fiction movies. Remember them? Well, this one is just as fantastic, but it's real.  Scientists studying the destroyed Chernobyl nuclear reactor were surprised to discover a fungus growing - not just growing; it was thriving on the highly reactive walls of the reactor. Should we be afraid the fungus is going to grow and escape the confine of the reactor and eat everything in sight?  Here's where science comes in. How was the fungus able to not only survive the radiation - how was it able to use it as food? That's what my next guest wants us to know. The research is being published online in this week's Public Library of Science One, and here to talk about it is one of the authors.  Ekaterina Dadachova is an associate professor of nuclear medicine and of microbiology and immunology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. She joins us today from her office. Welcome to the program.  Dr. EKATERINA DADACHOVA (Associate Professor, Nuclear Medicine and Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine): Hi. Thank you for inviting me, Ira. I am happy to be here.  FLATOW: Well, Dr. Dadachova, tell us about this. How does it survive the radiation? Why isn't it killed by the radiation, and how does it eat it?  Dr. DADACHOVA: Well, it survives for the simple reason that there are doses of radiation inside the reactor in many places where this melanized fungi thrive that are not that high to kill the fungus, because fungi are extremely radio resistant.  I will give you an example. For example, to kill one of the fungi, which we used in our paper, one needs to deliver around one million rads. This is the unit in which radiation exposure is measured. And the dose inside the Chernobyl reactor right now is only approximately one rad per day. So one need to radiate fungi for millions of days. So these doses are really beneficial for them if they can use radiation in their metabolism, but they're are not fungicidal. They do not kill fungi.  FLATOW: We know that fungi, you know, they feast on dead wood and other things. But we never suspected that they feasted on radiation, did we?  Dr. DADACHOVA: No. We never suspected it, but my collaborator, Dr. Casadevall, with whom we do this research, he actually suspected that, you know, fungi can use radiation as energy source when he was reading about this melanized fungi colonizing the destroyed reacting Chernobyl, the soils around it. And later on, we found reports that there are actually findings of melanized fungi in Arctic, in Antarctica, in high elevation. But what actually is in common between all those areas is the lack of other conventional nutrients, nutrients - for example, this deadwood, as you are referring to. So those fungi would be seeking other additional sources of energy, and apparently they will be finding them in ionizing radiation.  FLATOW: Now, the key here seems to be - you have mentioned a couple times -melanin. These fungi have melanin in them.  Dr. DADACHOVA: Yes. These fungi have melanin. Melanin is a pigment. Its name is derived from the Greek word for melanos, which is black. So it is a black to dark brown pigment. And in our experiments, we have shown in several species of fungi that it is actually the presence of melanin which allows those fungi to use the energy of ionizing radiation in their life cycle. If we use controlled fungi, the same fungi but without melanin, they couldn't utilize the benefits of being in the rotation field.  FLATOW: Is this the same kind of melanin that we have on our skin that turn it into darker or makes our skin dark?  Dr. DADACHOVA: Well, melanin is actually a very enigmatic pigment because there is no crystal structure of melanin, no good spectra of melanin, because it is impossible to crystallize it. But it has been shown by many studies that a lot of similarities between melanin, which is found in human skin, in (unintelligible), in hair and in - also in fungi. So it shares a lot of structural similarities.  FLATOW: So does the melanin function in the fungi by absorbing the radiation much like chlorophyll would function in a green plant by absorbing the sunlight?  Dr. DADACHOVA: Well, at this stage, we do not know the mechanism but this is analogy which seems to be correct, because one needs to have a pigment, which serves as a transducer of energy. And that is what chlorophyll does during photosynthesis, transfuse the energy of visible light into the chemical energy the plants are using. And here, it seems to be that melanin is capable of transfusing the energy of ionizing radiation into the chemical energy where fungi are capable to utilize.  FLATOW: Well, let's move ahead and talk about what useful stuff could come out of this discovery.  Dr. DADACHOVA: Well, for example, one can imagine that those fungi or other organisms which are capable of utilizing radiation, they can be used for production of biofuels, for example, now that biofuels is a growing area. But if one start to grow these biofuels on their good lands, you know, that wouldn't be really energy-efficient.  But on the other hand, there are lots of wasted land where, you know, nothing can be grown. There are all this underground storage of radioactive byproducts of nuclear cycles, for example. That's where one can imagine growing all those fungi and using them for biofuel.  Simultaneously, it is possible - now we know that genetic engineering of good crops is going ahead at full speed, so one can imagine that the system will be engineered where there - crops will have gene responsible for melanin in their genome, and they will be able to grow using ionizing radiation instead of visible light, for example. And this could be used in space flights and other application where growing crops conventionally is difficult.  FLATOW: How much radiation do you need? Can it grow in background radiation -and these are higher radiation, as you say - in these nuclear waste sites?  Dr. DADACHOVA: Well, it can grow - we have to actually determine what would be the optimal levels of radiation for this fungi, but it seems that they can be grown in a really broad range of radiation fluxes from something which is tolerable to humans to really high levels, because there are reports and literature that this melanized fungi, for example, live in the cooling pools of nuclear reactors. And over there, the radiation dose is so high that, you know, even this like destroyed reacting Chernobyl is not even getting close to that.  FLATOW: Could we then think about - let's think of something that's out of this world. We're always looking for life in outer space and the harsh environments that are out there.  Dr. DADACHOVA: Right.  FLATOW: Could these fungi really be, you know, resistant to not just radiation but other harsher environments that we might look for them in other worlds?  Dr. DADACHOVA: Melanin is known to be a protector of - from, you know, many insults, environmental insults.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. It sounds like the script for a movie. A man contracts a form of tuberculosis, but he feels and looks fine. So, despite advice from the county health service to stay put, he decides to go ahead with his long-planned wedding in Greece. Just after he leaves, public health officials learn the disease is XDR-TB, rare, very difficult to treat, highly resistant to drugs and deadly. The Centers for Disease Control tracks the man down on his honeymoon in Rome. They say they plan to fly him back home on their plane. He says they were going to put him in isolation in Italy indefinitely, and the couple bolts. We just wanted to come home and get treatment, he told the Atlanta Journal Constitution later. Evading a no-fly order, they got on a flight to Montreal, drive to New York, and he goes to a hospital. The man, still unidentified, is under federal quarantine with an armed guard outside the door of his hospital room near Atlanta. The CDC has issued an international health alert and questions pile up. What are the chances that the passengers or staff on those trans-Atlantic flights are infected? Why wasn't he prevented from flying? What was his obligation once he knew he was sick? Who's to blame if somebody else does get sick? TALK: 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK.

Later on in the program, Fred Thompson decides to run, the repercussions from the passage of the Iraq war funding bill. Is this the Democrats war now? And Republicans, home for the Memorial Day recess, face hostile questions on immigration. If you have questions for the Political Junkie, you can email them now. Again, the address is talk@npr. org. But first, the man with XDR-TB. Joining us now is Dr. Michael Iseman, a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine where he specializes in pulmonary and infectious diseases. He joins us from his office at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, Colorado. Nice to have you on the program today. MICHAEL ISEMAN: Thank you. Good afternoon. CONAN: And XDR-TB stands for extreme drug-resistant tuberculosis. Can you explain what that is? ISEMAN: It is a reference to the fact that the organism is resistant not only to the two drugs that defined MDR-TB, the scourge of the 1990s, but now resistant to more of the standard drugs. And it really represents a therapeutic challenge of immense dimensions. CONAN: And as I understand it, though, the good news is it's not as easily transmitted, as we might fear? ISEMAN: This individual case seems not to be at great risk for transmission. The markers of transmission most prominently are a positive sputum smear test, where we can identify the organisms in the expectorated sputum. This individual apparently was negative under the microscope, and that lessens the risk of transmission by almost an order of magnitude. But it's still a measurable and, in this case, an ominous threat. CONAN: And ominous because, if it's transmitted, look out. ISEMAN: Exactly. CONAN: It's deadly. ISEMAN: Well, it is an immense challenge to modern TB therapy. My institution, the National Jewish Hospital, has been caring for patients similar to this for the last 30 years. And we have encouraging success for an individual such as this. But in much of the world where we don't - where's there's not access to the exotic treatment drugs, don't have access to the actual and surgical support we enjoy, it is predictably lethal. CONAN: And as I understand it, this man, still unidentified for obvious reasons, but he may be headed your way. ISEMAN: There have been discussions about referring him here for therapy. Our experience, I think, is unique in respect that - several respects. We have, I think, the best laboratory in the world for identifying drugs that might be active against this particular strain of TB. We have the laboratory that helps us quant it, take the amount of medicines we give so we're not going intoxicate the patient with our medicines but give enough medicines to be effective. And then, finally, we have a really spectacular support surgical service. CONAN: And as I understand it, and this according to an article that was published in today's Atlanta Journal Constitution, he said, look - he had set up a plan to go to Denver to have this treated when he got back from his honeymoon, and then all of this drama erupted when he decided to go ahead and go to Greece and get married as he planned along to do. ISEMAN: I really shouldn't - I'm not qualified. I'm familiar with some of the published information about the case. But I don't know the details of it, and I don't think it would be appropriate for me to comment about the extent of which he knew of the risk. CONAN: Okay. Let me, then, ask about what the extent of the risk might be as far you know. Medically, from what we're told by the Centers for Disease Control, what they're concern about is maybe the passengers who were flying with him in his row and maybe the two rows around him, they might have - they might be at risk? ISEMAN: TB is spread by airborne transmission of the infectious bacterium. When a patient coughs, the bacteria can be disseminated in the air. And as it drifts farther away from the patient, the concentration of the infectious particles goes down. So the individuals who were in close proximity to the individual case are at greatest risk. Domestic air travel doesn't constitute a measurable risk because of the factor of time. But there have been clear cases where drug-resistant and other forms of TB have been spread on international travel of eight hours, such as the trip that this individual made. CONAN: And if you were a flight attendant on that flight, might you have concerns as well? ISEMAN: Yes. The studies have shown that flight attendants are relatively at greater risk cumulatively just because of the time they spend in the cabin. I don't want to over-represent the risk; on the other hand, I think the CDC's approach to aggressive public health investigation is right on. CONAN: So they're trying to find anybody who might have been on those flights, and if they were in the immediate vicinity, they will be tested. If they were not in the immediate vicinity, they can be tested if they want to, as far as I understand it. ISEMAN: The individuals who might reasonably consider themselves to be at greatest risk might be someone whose immune system has been compromised: an individual with HIV-infection, an individual with organ transplantation, an individual who've received cancer chemotherapy that might have recently impacted their immune system. That's an individual who clearly would want to be evaluated. CONAN: Let's see if we can get some callers on this conversation: 800-989-8255. Email is talk@npr. org. Right now we're talking with Dr. Michael Iseman, a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. And joining us now on the line from Philadelphia is Alfred. ALFRED: Hello. CONAN: Alfred, you're on the air. Go ahead, please. ALFRED: Yes. My question is why it is that there has been so much publicity to this incident when in fact it has caused a great deal of consternation and difficulty among people all over the country as though we are about to have a widespread epidemic of this particular viral disease? I can take my answer off the air, but I really find it counterproductive to have so much publicity about this single incident. The question, I guess, really is, what is the threat to the general population? I'll be glad to take my. . . CONAN: And thanks for the call, Alfred. ALFRED: . . . answer off the air. ISEMAN: This situation might be reasonably compared with the epidemic of SARS, which really generated wide-scale panic around the world. And, clearly, the likelihood of any individual being exposed to this TB case is relatively low. And you might arguably say that there's been overreaction, but you have to understand that the public health obligation to the community is such that the information has to be disseminated. Were the authorities to have not taken action, not have notified the individuals who might have been exposed, they would have been at risk of severe criticism if a case of XDR-TB had evolved. So it's kind of a damned if you do, damned if you don't. I certainly agree that the public should not be made to feel panic, however, the public health proceedings are absolutely correct in my opinion. CONAN: Well, the case also brings up some relatively arcane legal issues. Joining us now is Wendy Parmet. She's a Matthews Distinguished Professor of Law in Northeastern University and an expert on health, disability and public health law. She's with us today from the studios of our member station in Boston, WBUR. Nice to have you on the program. WENDY PARMET: Good afternoon. I'm glad to be here. CONAN: And the man was placed under federal quarantine, the first such order as far as anybody can remember in, I think, 40 years. PARMET: Yes, the federal quarantine power has been used very, very rarely in recent memory. States and local governments have quarantined people somewhat more frequently, but still even that's unusual. Quarantine is really a power that has been used much more in the past than in recent decades. CONAN: What kind of evidence does somebody need before they can be placed under federal quarantine? And who issues such an order? Is it a judge? Is it the president? Who? PARMET: Well, the president has authority to list the quarantinable diseases and to decide which diseases are subject to the federal quarantine power. And the president has done that, and tuberculosis is one of those diseases. The Centers for Disease Control is issuing the quarantine order, but one of the things that is unclear under federal quarantine law is, because it is old and because it has been used relatively, again, basically not in 40 years, the process by which this carried out and the role of courts in issuing or reviewing orders is really not all spelled out right now. We know much more about how the process works at the state level than we do at the federal level. CONAN: So if this man got a lawyer and a habeas corpus order - could he try to get a habeas corpus order? PARMET: Absolutely. He could try to bring a habeas corpus. That is the historical approach for seeking review of detention when the process is not given, and he certainly could claim that his constitutional rights have been violated or are subject to review. CONAN: Because he's sitting on a hospital room with an armed guard outside the door and understandably a little concerned. PARMET: Absolutely. I mean, we don't know all the facts right now, but we don't know whether he's been given legal process, whether he's been given access to an attorney and his basic constitutional rights. I'm not saying, by the way, that he hasn't been. But he certainly has constitutional rights and habeas corpus would be the approach that most lawyers would use to review the detention. CONAN: We're going to talk more about some of the legal questions, and the medical questions, surrounding this very unusual case of extremely rare tuberculosis. A man has been placed under federal quarantine outside of Atlanta, Georgia. If you'd like to join the conversation: 800-989-8255, 800- 989-TALK. Email is talk@npr. org. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. We'll get to our conversation with the Political Junkie a little later this hour. If you have questions for Ken Rudin about Iraq spending, immigration, Fred Thompson or the rest of the week's political news, drop us an email now, talk@npr. org. But now we're talking about the unidentified man in Georgia who's been diagnosed with a rare form of tuberculosis and put under federal quarantine. Our guests are Dr. Michael Iseman, professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, and Wendy Parmet, an expert on health, disability and public health law and the Matthews Distinguished Professor of Law at Northeastern University. TB: 800-989-TALK. Email talk@npr. org. You can also read what other listeners have to say at our blog, npr. org/blogofthenation. Here's an email question from Larry in Minneapolis. Is this case much like the resistant cases that Dr. Paul Farmer worked unsuccessfully in Peru, or is this a more severe and more resistant strain of TB? Dr. Iseman? ISEMAN: This is similar to the cases in Peru. I actually worked with Dr. Farmer, visited Lima and looked at the program there, and it has several features. What XDR-TB represents is the next step in the evolution of the resistance. XDR-TB signifies resistance to two of the major drugs used in treating cases with MDR-TB, the cases from Peru. And it just raises the degree of difficulty of cure. It lessens the likelihood of cure. It increases the need for surgery. It really raises the bar substantially. CONAN: To get another caller on the line and this is Kaleen(ph). Kaleen's with us from Indiana. KALEEN: Yes, this is Kaleen. CONAN: Go ahead, please. KALEEN: Well, actually, I was wondering, can you be charged with manslaughter if someone got infected or, you know, got a strain of it or some pre-meditated some form of murder under the law? CONAN: Yeah, Wendy Parmet, what's his legal obligation or what's his legal liability if somebody - in the unlikely event that he did infect somebody? PARMET: Well, I think we need to know much more than we know about exactly what did he know, and I gather that there are some controversy about what he was told to do. But it would be extraordinarily unusual to find that someone was guilty of manslaughter. There have been some cases that have been brought with infectious disease, but there really needs to be great, clear intent in knowing that he put someone at harm. His civil liability is more substantial. The intent level is reduced under the law. But again, he is pretty much - we will need to know that he understood that he was placing people at risk, and that's not completely clear. The other thing I should say is, of course, there are jurisdictional issues here since much of the contact was done, it appears, outside of the United States. KALEEN: What about for future people who will, you know, who are going to think they can break the law and can kind of get away with it? It seems this case here. PARMET: Well, it's not clear that he broke the law at all, at least any law in terms of a criminal law or a order. I understand that Dr. Gerberding has claimed that there was no order. KALEEN: Oh. PARMET: He didn't follow recommendations, but that's not breaking the law. CONAN: But that was on his out of the country. On his way back, when he was in Rome, he was apparently told, look, don't fly, and then he went and flew. PARMET: But that's not clear that there was a legal order that they had. CONAN: I see. Okay. KALEEN: Thank you very much. CONAN: Thanks very much. I wonder, is either the county health - public health office that handled this case initially or the CDC, could they be liable if somebody else got infected by this man - again, the unlikely event that that had happened - for not stopping him from flying? PARMET: That would be very hard to imagine. We give our public health officials pretty broad immunity in their so-called discretionary functions, and that's clear under the federal law. We don't usually hold government officials liable, or government agencies liable, for not taking a coercive action against an individual which then leads to potentially some harm for someone else. Taking a - putting him into quarantine, for example, before he left the country in this situation would have been quite unusual and almost unprecedented. And I can't - I don't believe that any court would find an official liable. CONAN: Now, do you suspect, in fact, that one of the reasons he's in quarantine was because he evaded whatever suggestions, advice - however you want to phrase it, whether it was short of an order or not - but there were concerns that he might be on the move again? PARMET: Again, we don't know the facts, but that appears likely. Almost all of the legal quarantine cases that we know about in the last 15 years or so have been with tuberculosis and have been in cases where the claim has been made that the individual is non-compliant with the advice of health officials. That the person was not doing what they were asked to do, health officials asked them not to travel, asked them to stay in the hospital, asked them to take their medications. And it's only - and courts have suggested that really needs to be shown, something like non-compliance. So I assume that that's the case here, but again all the facts are not out. CONAN: Wendy Parmet, thanks very much for your time. Appreciate it. PARMET: My pleasure. CONAN: Wendy Palmer, Matthews Distinguished Professor of Law at Northeastern University, an expert on health disability and public health law with us today from member station WBUR in Boston. Osama(ph) is on the line. Osama calling us from Detroit. OSAMA: Hi. Thanks for taking my call. CONAN: Sure. OSAMA: I'm going to try to keep this as untechnical as possible. But from my understanding there has been a trend that has been known for the past decade in the resistance of microbes such as the (unintelligible) seen in hospitals with MERSA and mycobacterium now. And one of the causes of this is the microbes' resistance to drug use, and this occurs with successive microbial generation. And we've known about this for a decade now and we've had the data from South America. And what I'm wondering now is how often has there been a change in the standardized use of certain treatments? And how often - or when will we see another paradigm shift in the way such antibiotic treatments are administered? CONAN: If I could summarize for those of us even less technical, is this strain of XDR-TB a result of overuse of antibiotics, Dr. Iseman? ISEMAN: It really doesn't represent overuse. It almost always originates within appropriate use. It either means that the prescribing physician did not administer sufficient number of drugs, did not administer the appropriate dose of the medications, or the patients chose to take the red pill but not the white pill and in some way subverted the logic of multiple drug therapy. TB is the essential paradigm of multiple drug therapy. It was recognized in 1950s that if we gave a single drug, the organisms that mutate become resistant. And we recognized then that three drugs had to be given in order to assure that the organism would be killed and not mutate and become resistant. It took us about a decade in HIV therapy to discover the same principle. And it's really that kind of the holy trinity of treatment of these types of infections. And I don't think it represents overuse of drugs but inadequate control. The United States was in the midst of an MDR epidemic from 1989 to 1993, and it was highly lethal. And we changed our practices to use directly observed therapy and it goes back to Ms. Parmet's comments about what quarantine represents. Quarantine in tuberculosis means you're served a notice that says, so long as you take the medicines reliably, you will be free to walk about our community. But if you don't, you are subject to being locked up to protect the public from transmission of TB. And it was that approach to TB that reduced drug resistance in the United States dramatically. In 1992 there were 500 cases of MDR-TB. Last year, there were under a hundred. And it's clear relationship to having quarantine power which puts teeth in the practice of public health. CONAN: And also, I guess, we should point out that the incidence of TB overall is also way down, and the incidence of this exotic form of TB is what, I think 50 a year or something like that. ISEMAN: It's a wonderful success story that we should celebrate. America's TB program from 1990 to the present time has been one of the great stories in modern public health. We've cut cases from 10. 5 per 100,000 to under five per 100,000. We've reduced drug-resistant TB. And it speaks to the power of a well- organized program that has at its root the enforcement capacity for quarantine. CONAN: All right. Osama, thanks very much for the question. OSAMA: Thank you very much. CONAN: Exactly what are your obligations to the rest of the society when you've been diagnosed with an infectious disease? The man now under federal quarantine traveled on two commercial flights early this month and may have exposed to other passengers. Nancy Kass is a Phoebe Berman Professor of Bioethics and Public Health at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. She joins us now from the studios of member station WYPR in Baltimore. Nice to have you on the program today. NANCY KASS: Thank you. Nice to be here. CONAN: And as we've mentioned, there are conflicting stories about what he was told about his disease and whether he could travel or not. But what, if any, are his personal obligations, knowing that he had at least some form of tuberculosis? KASS: It's hard to know, and again, as everyone has said, it's so hard to know what the facts are and they've become so relevant. Certainly if we imagine someone in a different situation who clearly was told that they absolutely should not travel, and it's not only that they are told that they should not travel but why they should not travel, namely that they have a disease that potentially could be both contagious and deadly to others, then he absolutely has a personal moral duty to follow those recommendations, restrictions, however it's framed. But I want to address what you said a minute ago. . . CONAN: Okay. KASS: . . . which is we have a parallel responsibility to him to attend to his needs and well-being to some extent if we, meaning society or the government, are the one who imposed a restriction on him for everyone else's benefit. CONAN: Ah-ha. So - but he - again, the facts in this case are not yet totally clear, but he was under treatment and was planning further treatments when he got back from his wedding and his honeymoon. And well, those were long-planned things. Obviously they were very important to him. ISEMAN: If I may make a comment. CONAN: Go ahead, Dr. Iseman. ISEMAN: There clearly is an obligation of the individual to adhere to the therapy. And I find it - it's unique in medicine. There's no other infectious disease that's quarantined like TB because of the risk of casual innocent sharing of air, unlike hepatitis or HIV that requires intimacy and some, and generally some complicity in the exposure; TB, because of the specter of sitting in a bus, sitting in a plane, going to a classroom and being exposed to a lethal infection, has given it a unique standing. CONAN: Aren't there others that are, you know, horrors that could be transmitted that way, a pneumonic plague, for example? ISEMAN: Pneumonic plague certainly could be, but that's usually an individual who's sick unto death in a hospital bed. Bubonic plague was - it was usually transmitted by fleas. And pneumonic plague, while it could be, was so quickly lethal that it didn't pose the during day-after-day, month-after-month risk of transmission. CONAN: We're talking with Dr. Michael Iseman, and also with Nancy Kass about the case of a man under federal quarantine with a rare form of tuberculosis. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. As we speak, the Centers for Disease Control is holding a news conference this hour. They have not released any more information on the man in this particular case, but they did give some further details on the trans-Atlantic flight that he took and which passengers might be at risk. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS CONFERENCE)PARMET: The patient sat in seat 12-C. This occurred on May 24th from Prague to Montreal on Czech Air Flight 0104. There were 191 passengers and nine crew on this flight. Approximately 30 persons were in that risk area, two rows in front, two rows behind, who are the highest priority for actively seeking and following up at this point. CONAN: That's a bit of the news conference underway at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. We'll continue to monitor that event for any further details or updates. And Dr. Iseman, that seems to relate to what you were talking about earlier. ISEMAN: The experience has been - there tends to be exposure only in the proximity of the seat because of the dilutional fact if you cough - certainly the air can be distributed in the cabin, but the likelihood or the concentration of infectious particles is closer proximate to the patient. CONAN: Let's get back to Nancy Kass. Nancy Kass, the head of the CDC, Dr. Julie Gerberding spoke yesterday on NPR about a covenant of trust between health officials and this patient. Can you explain a little bit more about that? KASS: Sure. Public health ethics is always very challenging because we, particularly in the United States, highly value our individual freedoms, our ability to get on airplanes, our ability to go to work. And at the same time, public health has a duty to essentially protect us from each other if there is a threat to the public's health, and also to protect us, obviously, from unsafe restaurants, unsafe water. Part of what comes when you want to both grant people freedoms but protect safety is that you trust people, that if they are told that they pose a threat, or if, again, if a restaurant, if a water source poses a threat, that they're - that they will follow the orders necessary. One of the things that we deeply believe in in ethics - and our public health departments generally follow this - is a moral requirement for the least restrictive alternative. So what the CDC potentially could have done with this patient or someone like him is immediately put them in jail. I think what Dr. Gerberding is referring to with this covenant of trust is that if we say to someone there are important public health reasons why your movements need to be restricted, that we value that least restrictive alternative enough to allow them to voluntarily follow that. Obviously we only take that so far because we have to err on the side of protecting the public when the disease is this serious. So if someone does not follow voluntary measures, that's when more restrictive measures are imposed. CONAN: And again, we don't know the exact facts in this case but perhaps miscommunication on the seriousness of these advisories suggest that things might be spelled out more clearly in the future. KASS: I agree. I mean, it's - I certainly don't know all the facts here, but there are plenty of teachable moments for all of us in public health, in medicine, in ethics, as we hear even the questions being raised. And I think what you just said is an important one, which is the public may not understand how TB is transmitted, what the difference is between infection and illness, and certainly how serious different forms of TB are. Certainly, when we're dealing with something that is this serious for the public's health, it's very important to communicate clearly, to make sure people understand, to repeat things and to not come across as you have option A or you have option B here. It is - it's really up to you to be much more directive. CONAN: Nancy Kass, thanks for your time today. KASS: Thank you. CONAN: Nancy Kass, Phoebe Berman professor of bioethics and public health at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. She joined us from WYPR in Baltimore. Dr. Iseman, thank you for taking the time to be with us. ISEMAN: Thank you very much. CONAN: Michael Iseman, professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine where he specializes in pulmonary and infectious diseases. And he joined us from his office at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver. When we come back, it's the Political Junkie, 800-989-8255, if you'd like to join us. This is Neal Conan from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, Host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. It sounds like the script for a movie. A man contracts a form of tuberculosis, but he feels and looks fine. So, despite advice from the county health service to stay put, he decides to go ahead with his long-planned wedding in Greece. Just after he leaves, public health officials learn the disease is XDR-TB, rare, very difficult to treat, highly resistant to drugs and deadly. The Centers for Disease Control tracks the man down on his honeymoon in Rome. They say they plan to fly him back home on their plane. He says they were going to put him in isolation in Italy indefinitely, and the couple bolts. We just wanted to come home and get treatment, he told the Atlanta Journal Constitution later. Evading a no-fly order, they got on a flight to Montreal, drive to New York, and he goes to a hospital. The man, still unidentified, is under federal quarantine with an armed guard outside the door of his hospital room near Atlanta. The CDC has issued an international health alert and questions pile up. What are the chances that the passengers or staff on those trans-Atlantic flights are infected? Why wasn't he prevented from flying? What was his obligation once he knew he was sick? Who's to blame if somebody else does get sick? TALK: 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK.

Later on in the program, Fred Thompson decides to run, the repercussions from the passage of the Iraq war funding bill. Is this the Democrats war now? And Republicans, home for the Memorial Day recess, face hostile questions on immigration. If you have questions for the Political Junkie, you can email them now. Again, the address is talk@npr. org. But first, the man with XDR-TB. Joining us now is Dr. Michael Iseman, a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine where he specializes in pulmonary and infectious diseases. He joins us from his office at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, Colorado. Nice to have you on the program today. MICHAEL ISEMAN: Thank you. Good afternoon. CONAN: And XDR-TB stands for extreme drug-resistant tuberculosis. Can you explain what that is? ISEMAN: It is a reference to the fact that the organism is resistant not only to the two drugs that defined MDR-TB, the scourge of the 1990s, but now resistant to more of the standard drugs. And it really represents a therapeutic challenge of immense dimensions. CONAN: And as I understand it, though, the good news is it's not as easily transmitted, as we might fear? ISEMAN: This individual case seems not to be at great risk for transmission. The markers of transmission most prominently are a positive sputum smear test, where we can identify the organisms in the expectorated sputum. This individual apparently was negative under the microscope, and that lessens the risk of transmission by almost an order of magnitude. But it's still a measurable and, in this case, an ominous threat. CONAN: And ominous because, if it's transmitted, look out. ISEMAN: Exactly. CONAN: It's deadly. ISEMAN: Well, it is an immense challenge to modern TB therapy. My institution, the National Jewish Hospital, has been caring for patients similar to this for the last 30 years. And we have encouraging success for an individual such as this. But in much of the world where we don't - where's there's not access to the exotic treatment drugs, don't have access to the actual and surgical support we enjoy, it is predictably lethal. CONAN: And as I understand it, this man, still unidentified for obvious reasons, but he may be headed your way. ISEMAN: There have been discussions about referring him here for therapy. Our experience, I think, is unique in respect that - several respects. We have, I think, the best laboratory in the world for identifying drugs that might be active against this particular strain of TB. We have the laboratory that helps us quant it, take the amount of medicines we give so we're not going intoxicate the patient with our medicines but give enough medicines to be effective. And then, finally, we have a really spectacular support surgical service. CONAN: And as I understand it, and this according to an article that was published in today's Atlanta Journal Constitution, he said, look - he had set up a plan to go to Denver to have this treated when he got back from his honeymoon, and then all of this drama erupted when he decided to go ahead and go to Greece and get married as he planned along to do. ISEMAN: I really shouldn't - I'm not qualified. I'm familiar with some of the published information about the case. But I don't know the details of it, and I don't think it would be appropriate for me to comment about the extent of which he knew of the risk. CONAN: Okay. Let me, then, ask about what the extent of the risk might be as far you know. Medically, from what we're told by the Centers for Disease Control, what they're concern about is maybe the passengers who were flying with him in his row and maybe the two rows around him, they might have - they might be at risk? ISEMAN: TB is spread by airborne transmission of the infectious bacterium. When a patient coughs, the bacteria can be disseminated in the air. And as it drifts farther away from the patient, the concentration of the infectious particles goes down. So the individuals who were in close proximity to the individual case are at greatest risk. Domestic air travel doesn't constitute a measurable risk because of the factor of time. But there have been clear cases where drug-resistant and other forms of TB have been spread on international travel of eight hours, such as the trip that this individual made. CONAN: And if you were a flight attendant on that flight, might you have concerns as well? ISEMAN: Yes. The studies have shown that flight attendants are relatively at greater risk cumulatively just because of the time they spend in the cabin. I don't want to over-represent the risk; on the other hand, I think the CDC's approach to aggressive public health investigation is right on. CONAN: So they're trying to find anybody who might have been on those flights, and if they were in the immediate vicinity, they will be tested. If they were not in the immediate vicinity, they can be tested if they want to, as far as I understand it. ISEMAN: The individuals who might reasonably consider themselves to be at greatest risk might be someone whose immune system has been compromised: an individual with HIV-infection, an individual with organ transplantation, an individual who've received cancer chemotherapy that might have recently impacted their immune system. That's an individual who clearly would want to be evaluated. CONAN: Let's see if we can get some callers on this conversation: 800-989-8255. Email is talk@npr. org. Right now we're talking with Dr. Michael Iseman, a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. And joining us now on the line from Philadelphia is Alfred. ALFRED: Hello. CONAN: Alfred, you're on the air. Go ahead, please. ALFRED: Yes. My question is why it is that there has been so much publicity to this incident when in fact it has caused a great deal of consternation and difficulty among people all over the country as though we are about to have a widespread epidemic of this particular viral disease? I can take my answer off the air, but I really find it counterproductive to have so much publicity about this single incident. The question, I guess, really is, what is the threat to the general population? I'll be glad to take my. . . CONAN: And thanks for the call, Alfred. ALFRED: . . . answer off the air. ISEMAN: This situation might be reasonably compared with the epidemic of SARS, which really generated wide-scale panic around the world. And, clearly, the likelihood of any individual being exposed to this TB case is relatively low. And you might arguably say that there's been overreaction, but you have to understand that the public health obligation to the community is such that the information has to be disseminated. Were the authorities to have not taken action, not have notified the individuals who might have been exposed, they would have been at risk of severe criticism if a case of XDR-TB had evolved. So it's kind of a damned if you do, damned if you don't. I certainly agree that the public should not be made to feel panic, however, the public health proceedings are absolutely correct in my opinion. CONAN: Well, the case also brings up some relatively arcane legal issues. Joining us now is Wendy Parmet. She's a Matthews Distinguished Professor of Law in Northeastern University and an expert on health, disability and public health law. She's with us today from the studios of our member station in Boston, WBUR. Nice to have you on the program. WENDY PARMET: Good afternoon. I'm glad to be here. CONAN: And the man was placed under federal quarantine, the first such order as far as anybody can remember in, I think, 40 years. PARMET: Yes, the federal quarantine power has been used very, very rarely in recent memory. States and local governments have quarantined people somewhat more frequently, but still even that's unusual. Quarantine is really a power that has been used much more in the past than in recent decades. CONAN: What kind of evidence does somebody need before they can be placed under federal quarantine? And who issues such an order? Is it a judge? Is it the president? Who? PARMET: Well, the president has authority to list the quarantinable diseases and to decide which diseases are subject to the federal quarantine power. And the president has done that, and tuberculosis is one of those diseases. The Centers for Disease Control is issuing the quarantine order, but one of the things that is unclear under federal quarantine law is, because it is old and because it has been used relatively, again, basically not in 40 years, the process by which this carried out and the role of courts in issuing or reviewing orders is really not all spelled out right now. We know much more about how the process works at the state level than we do at the federal level. CONAN: So if this man got a lawyer and a habeas corpus order - could he try to get a habeas corpus order? PARMET: Absolutely. He could try to bring a habeas corpus. That is the historical approach for seeking review of detention when the process is not given, and he certainly could claim that his constitutional rights have been violated or are subject to review. CONAN: Because he's sitting on a hospital room with an armed guard outside the door and understandably a little concerned. PARMET: Absolutely. I mean, we don't know all the facts right now, but we don't know whether he's been given legal process, whether he's been given access to an attorney and his basic constitutional rights. I'm not saying, by the way, that he hasn't been. But he certainly has constitutional rights and habeas corpus would be the approach that most lawyers would use to review the detention. CONAN: We're going to talk more about some of the legal questions, and the medical questions, surrounding this very unusual case of extremely rare tuberculosis. A man has been placed under federal quarantine outside of Atlanta, Georgia. If you'd like to join the conversation: 800-989-8255, 800- 989-TALK. Email is talk@npr. org. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. We'll get to our conversation with the Political Junkie a little later this hour. If you have questions for Ken Rudin about Iraq spending, immigration, Fred Thompson or the rest of the week's political news, drop us an email now, talk@npr. org. But now we're talking about the unidentified man in Georgia who's been diagnosed with a rare form of tuberculosis and put under federal quarantine. Our guests are Dr. Michael Iseman, professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, and Wendy Parmet, an expert on health, disability and public health law and the Matthews Distinguished Professor of Law at Northeastern University. TB: 800-989-TALK. Email talk@npr. org. You can also read what other listeners have to say at our blog, npr. org/blogofthenation. Here's an email question from Larry in Minneapolis. Is this case much like the resistant cases that Dr. Paul Farmer worked unsuccessfully in Peru, or is this a more severe and more resistant strain of TB? Dr. Iseman? ISEMAN: This is similar to the cases in Peru. I actually worked with Dr. Farmer, visited Lima and looked at the program there, and it has several features. What XDR-TB represents is the next step in the evolution of the resistance. XDR-TB signifies resistance to two of the major drugs used in treating cases with MDR-TB, the cases from Peru. And it just raises the degree of difficulty of cure. It lessens the likelihood of cure. It increases the need for surgery. It really raises the bar substantially. CONAN: To get another caller on the line and this is Kaleen(ph). Kaleen's with us from Indiana. KALEEN: Yes, this is Kaleen. CONAN: Go ahead, please. KALEEN: Well, actually, I was wondering, can you be charged with manslaughter if someone got infected or, you know, got a strain of it or some pre-meditated some form of murder under the law? CONAN: Yeah, Wendy Parmet, what's his legal obligation or what's his legal liability if somebody - in the unlikely event that he did infect somebody? PARMET: Well, I think we need to know much more than we know about exactly what did he know, and I gather that there are some controversy about what he was told to do. But it would be extraordinarily unusual to find that someone was guilty of manslaughter. There have been some cases that have been brought with infectious disease, but there really needs to be great, clear intent in knowing that he put someone at harm. His civil liability is more substantial. The intent level is reduced under the law. But again, he is pretty much - we will need to know that he understood that he was placing people at risk, and that's not completely clear. The other thing I should say is, of course, there are jurisdictional issues here since much of the contact was done, it appears, outside of the United States. KALEEN: What about for future people who will, you know, who are going to think they can break the law and can kind of get away with it? It seems this case here. PARMET: Well, it's not clear that he broke the law at all, at least any law in terms of a criminal law or a order. I understand that Dr. Gerberding has claimed that there was no order. KALEEN: Oh. PARMET: He didn't follow recommendations, but that's not breaking the law. CONAN: But that was on his out of the country. On his way back, when he was in Rome, he was apparently told, look, don't fly, and then he went and flew. PARMET: But that's not clear that there was a legal order that they had. CONAN: I see. Okay. KALEEN: Thank you very much. CONAN: Thanks very much. I wonder, is either the county health - public health office that handled this case initially or the CDC, could they be liable if somebody else got infected by this man - again, the unlikely event that that had happened - for not stopping him from flying? PARMET: That would be very hard to imagine. We give our public health officials pretty broad immunity in their so-called discretionary functions, and that's clear under the federal law. We don't usually hold government officials liable, or government agencies liable, for not taking a coercive action against an individual which then leads to potentially some harm for someone else. Taking a - putting him into quarantine, for example, before he left the country in this situation would have been quite unusual and almost unprecedented. And I can't - I don't believe that any court would find an official liable. CONAN: Now, do you suspect, in fact, that one of the reasons he's in quarantine was because he evaded whatever suggestions, advice - however you want to phrase it, whether it was short of an order or not - but there were concerns that he might be on the move again? PARMET: Again, we don't know the facts, but that appears likely. Almost all of the legal quarantine cases that we know about in the last 15 years or so have been with tuberculosis and have been in cases where the claim has been made that the individual is non-compliant with the advice of health officials. That the person was not doing what they were asked to do, health officials asked them not to travel, asked them to stay in the hospital, asked them to take their medications. And it's only - and courts have suggested that really needs to be shown, something like non-compliance. So I assume that that's the case here, but again all the facts are not out. CONAN: Wendy Parmet, thanks very much for your time. Appreciate it. PARMET: My pleasure. CONAN: Wendy Palmer, Matthews Distinguished Professor of Law at Northeastern University, an expert on health disability and public health law with us today from member station WBUR in Boston. Osama(ph) is on the line. Osama calling us from Detroit. OSAMA: Hi. Thanks for taking my call. CONAN: Sure. OSAMA: I'm going to try to keep this as untechnical as possible.

OSAMA: Thank you very much. CONAN: Exactly what are your obligations to the rest of the society when you've been diagnosed with an infectious disease? The man now under federal quarantine traveled on two commercial flights early this month and may have exposed to other passengers. Nancy Kass is a Phoebe Berman Professor of Bioethics and Public Health at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. She joins us now from the studios of member station WYPR in Baltimore.

CONAN: And as we've mentioned, there are conflicting stories about what he was told about his disease and whether he could travel or not.

KASS: It's hard to know, and again, as everyone has said, it's so hard to know what the facts are and they've become so relevant. Certainly if we imagine someone in a different situation who clearly was told that they absolutely should not travel, and it's not only that they are told that they should not travel but why they should not travel, namely that they have a disease that potentially could be both contagious and deadly to others, then he absolutely has a personal moral duty to follow those recommendations, restrictions, however it's framed.

KASS: . . . which is we have a parallel responsibility to him to attend to his needs and well-being to some extent if we, meaning society or the government, are the one who imposed a restriction on him for everyone else's benefit. CONAN: Ah-ha. So - but he - again, the facts in this case are not yet totally clear, but he was under treatment and was planning further treatments when he got back from his wedding and his honeymoon. And well, those were long-planned things. Obviously they were very important to him. ISEMAN: If I may make a comment. CONAN: Go ahead, Dr. Iseman. ISEMAN: There clearly is an obligation of the individual to adhere to the therapy. And I find it - it's unique in medicine. There's no other infectious disease that's quarantined like TB because of the risk of casual innocent sharing of air, unlike hepatitis or HIV that requires intimacy and some, and generally some complicity in the exposure; TB, because of the specter of sitting in a bus, sitting in a plane, going to a classroom and being exposed to a lethal infection, has given it a unique standing. CONAN: Aren't there others that are, you know, horrors that could be transmitted that way, a pneumonic plague, for example? ISEMAN: Pneumonic plague certainly could be, but that's usually an individual who's sick unto death in a hospital bed. Bubonic plague was - it was usually transmitted by fleas. And pneumonic plague, while it could be, was so quickly lethal that it didn't pose the during day-after-day, month-after-month risk of transmission. CONAN: We're talking with Dr. Michael Iseman, and also with Nancy Kass about the case of a man under federal quarantine with a rare form of tuberculosis. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. As we speak, the Centers for Disease Control is holding a news conference this hour. They have not released any more information on the man in this particular case, but they did give some further details on the trans-Atlantic flight that he took and which passengers might be at risk. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS CONFERENCE) PARMET: The patient sat in seat 12-C. This occurred on May 24th from Prague to Montreal on Czech Air Flight 0104. There were 191 passengers and nine crew on this flight. Approximately 30 persons were in that risk area, two rows in front, two rows behind, who are the highest priority for actively seeking and following up at this point. CONAN: That's a bit of the news conference underway at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. We'll continue to monitor that event for any further details or updates. And Dr. Iseman, that seems to relate to what you were talking about earlier. ISEMAN: The experience has been - there tends to be exposure only in the proximity of the seat because of the dilutional fact if you cough - certainly the air can be distributed in the cabin, but the likelihood or the concentration of infectious particles is closer proximate to the patient. CONAN: Let's get back to Nancy Kass. Nancy Kass, the head of the CDC, Dr. Julie Gerberding spoke yesterday on NPR about a covenant of trust between health officials and this patient. Can you explain a little bit more about that? KASS: Sure. Public health ethics is always very challenging because we, particularly in the United States, highly value our individual freedoms, our ability to get on airplanes, our ability to go to work. And at the same time, public health has a duty to essentially protect us from each other if there is a threat to the public's health, and also to protect us, obviously, from unsafe restaurants, unsafe water. Part of what comes when you want to both grant people freedoms but protect safety is that you trust people, that if they are told that they pose a threat, or if, again, if a restaurant, if a water source poses a threat, that they're - that they will follow the orders necessary. One of the things that we deeply believe in in ethics - and our public health departments generally follow this - is a moral requirement for the least restrictive alternative. So what the CDC potentially could have done with this patient or someone like him is immediately put them in jail. I think what Dr. Gerberding is referring to with this covenant of trust is that if we say to someone there are important public health reasons why your movements need to be restricted, that we value that least restrictive alternative enough to allow them to voluntarily follow that. Obviously we only take that so far because we have to err on the side of protecting the public when the disease is this serious. So if someone does not follow voluntary measures, that's when more restrictive measures are imposed. CONAN: And again, we don't know the exact facts in this case but perhaps miscommunication on the seriousness of these advisories suggest that things might be spelled out more clearly in the future. KASS: I agree. I mean, it's - I certainly don't know all the facts here, but there are plenty of teachable moments for all of us in public health, in medicine, in ethics, as we hear even the questions being raised. And I think what you just said is an important one, which is the public may not understand how TB is transmitted, what the difference is between infection and illness, and certainly how serious different forms of TB are. Certainly, when we're dealing with something that is this serious for the public's health, it's very important to communicate clearly, to make sure people understand, to repeat things and to not come across as you have option A or you have option B here. It is - it's really up to you to be much more directive. CONAN: Nancy Kass, thanks for your time today. KASS: Thank you. CONAN: Nancy Kass, Phoebe Berman professor of bioethics and public health at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. She joined us from WYPR in Baltimore. Dr. Iseman, thank you for taking the time to be with us. ISEMAN: Thank you very much.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. A good night's sleep - eight solid hours. When's the last time you had one? Some of us suffer from sleep disorders. Others can't sleep due to other medical problems. But for most of us there's no excuse, which doesn't stop us from inventing one. New polling numbers show that sleep time in the U. S. continues to decline. Experts say we're in denial, that we lie to ourselves that we really only need four to five hours a night, or a hundred other rationalizations. So what is your excuse? Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. Email talk@npr. org. And you can also excuse yourself on our blog. That's at npr. org/blogofthenation. Joining us now is Dr. William Dement. He's the chief of the Stanford University Division of Sleep, and he's been studying sleep medicine for over 55 years. He joins us today from the studios at Stanford University in California. And Dr. Dement, it's nice to talk to you again. Dr. WILLIAM DEMENT (Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University): Well, it's nice to talk to you. CONAN: We last spoke on this program 10 years ago. Do we get\u2026 Dr. DEMENT: Oh, it's that long. CONAN: That long. Dr. DEMENT: Whoa. CONAN: Do we get less sleep now than we did a decade ago? Dr. DEMENT: Probably. I think that it's slowly going down. It's often - you know, to really, really know what everybody is doing is a little difficult, but polls definitely show that. CONAN: Mm-hmm. And these are not necessarily scientific surveys, but polls show a trend that is shorter and shorter amounts of sleep. Dr. DEMENT: That's correct. And that means there's a higher and higher risk for, you know, negative consequences - falling asleep at the wheel, that sort of thing. CONAN: And safety - falling asleep at the wheel, that sort of thing, as you say - these are real issues. This is not a joke. Dr. DEMENT: No, not at all. It's a devastating negative consequence. You know, and when someone falls - like truck driver falls asleep at the wheel, he may - there is a figure, there are - I think eight innocent victims are killed in a fatal to the driver truck accident. And mistakes, and you can - there was someone - I remember someone forgetting to converting inches to centimeters in the $6 billion mistake in the Mars mission. CONAN: A lack of sleep, you suspect. Dr. DEMENT: I suspect. I always suspect that. (Soundbite of laughter) CONAN: Well, it's your\u2026 Dr. DEMENT: That's my business. CONAN: That's your job. (Soundbite of laughter) CONAN: Now this ability of the human mind, though, to tell itself reasons why it doesn't get enough sleep and to rationalize them, this is powerful, isn't it? Dr. DEMENT: Very powerful. And mainly it's ignorance. And we're ignorant about sleep disorders. We have - right now, we're carrying out the largest clinical trial on the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. But it's amazing, people don't know they have this illness, and yet there's a very, very affective treatment. And by the way, we could use a few more subjects. We're winding up this study, and\u2026 CONAN: And do you have to be in California to be subject of this study? Dr. DEMENT: No, it's actually in five cities: Boston, Tucson, Walla Walla, Washington, Stanford and St. Louis. The number to call - I'll just say it - sleep. fmri@yahoo. com. CONAN: That's the - we'll get somebody, one our nimble-fingered production assistants to scribble that down and we'll put it on our Web site for those of you who didn't get it down quickly enough. So we'll have that at npr. org/talk. Dr. Dement, as we listen to people's excuses - here, Tim in Pinedale, New York. I am constantly sleep deprived due to \"World of Warcraft,\" as I'm sure many of the other eight million players are as well. Playing regularly keeps me up until 2:00 or 3:00 AM. At work, I make up for it with at least eight shots of espresso a day. So it's not a problem yet, he adds. Dr. DEMENT: Well, I think what most people don't realize it is a problem. And we've actually been studying this very closely in recent years, that if you take any individual and have them get extra sleep, their performance improves. And, you know, it's always like here's my personal best. You know, I'm at my personal - well, it gets better. And that's a big surprise. CONAN: Yet people say there's so many demands on my time. I've got work. I've got kids. I've got - I'm supposed to be - my doctor tells me I'm supposed to be getting exercise every day as well. You've got to burn the candle on at least one end. Dr. DEMENT: Well, that's - I think what I would say is that, you know, we have all these demands, all these reasons, all these things we must do, and we don't have a good, solid knowledge about sleep to sort of, you know, oppose all that and say, okay, I know that I've got to sleep or I'll - this will happen to me, or my ability to do something will decrease. But people don't honestly know that. We were studying basketball players recently, and, you know, they have a personal best. I can shoot seven out of 10 foul shots, and that's my absolute best. They get extra sleep, it becomes eight of 10. And it's, you know, that's - people need to know that. CONAN: Let's get a caller on the line. If you'd like to join us, by the way, it's 800-989-8255. Email is talk@npr. org. Lisa's with us - Lisa calling from North Carolina. LISA (Caller): Good afternoon. CONAN: Afternoon. LISA: I was wondering what we would do about a husband who you love very dearly and you want to sleep in the same room and be next to him at night, but snores like\u2026 Dr. DEMENT: Yeah. LISA: \u2026like a bear. It's an awful, awful problem in trying to get rest. Dr. DEMENT: No, this is a very serious problem. It's, you know, due to a small airway, having tonsils and adenoids, big tongue. Probably, the only effective way to deal with this is surgical. But it's much more important than people realize, because recent studies are showing that if you sleep with someone who snores loudly all night long, you are paying a price. You know, your waking performance is impaired. You\u2026 LISA: Absolutely. Dr. DEMENT: \u2026aren't doing things as well as you could. Now whether you can actually get this done or not, I'm not sure, because it's not something that is - has really in the mainstream health care system - you know, treating snoring. But it's certainly a problem at a university, where, you know, you have a snoring roommate, for example. Then you are sleepy all day long. You don't do as well in class. CONAN: Roommates are easier to change than spouses. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. DEMENT: That's true. That's very wise. LISA: \u2026these apnea machines. How effective are those? My in-laws, both of them have one of those, and they take them on trip so that they can sleep on the same hotel bed. Dr. DEMENT: Yeah. They're very effective. Now here's the - if they're snoring and then a pause, then it - that must be treated with a continuous positive airway pressure machine. And you can use it for just - you know, people say benign snoring. I don't think there is any such thing, because it means that airflow is impaired if you snore. So snoring\u2026 CONAN: Now these devices, though, they do look like they come - they're manufactured by Torcamada(ph) Enterprises. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. DEMENT: Well, people swear by them, and I guess maybe a certain percentage find it intolerable. And at that point, you know, you have to do something else. So the dental splints, and, I think, the surgical approach. The beauty of the surgical approach - if insurance covers it - is that it's, you know, forever. It's the lifetime. You don't have to worry about it again. CONAN: Hmm. All right. Dr. DEMENT: Whereas wearing the mask, you know, is for the rest of your life. LISA: Thank you for your help. CONAN: And good luck, Lisa. LISA: Thanks. CONAN: Bye-bye. Let's see if we can get - this is Bob. Bob's on the air from Wisconsin. BOB (Caller): Yes, from Darlington, Wisconsin. CONAN: Go ahead, please. BOB: And I've been retired for a number of years down the - I've had the opportunity to turn on my radio at night between 8:30 and 9:00 and listen to NPR. (Soundbite of laughter) BOB: They have wonderful programs, and I listen maybe till 11:00, and then I'm kind of tired and then I turn off the radio and fall asleep quite nicely, and I've - get my seven, eight-hours sleep. CONAN: There are times like a fine formula, as long as you don't adapt it to the middle of the day. BOB: That's right. Dr. DEMENT: I get - all I can say is congratulations. BOB: Well, I just sort of a fell in to this pattern, and I didn't know how it was going to work out, but it just worked out beautifully, especially on Sunday and Saturday night when Norman Gilliland has the old-time radio program, sort of like \"The Lone Ranger\". CONAN: Nothing easier to fall asleep to than Fibber McGee and Molly. BOB: That's exactly right. So it seems to work beautifully for me. And then at the end of the sleep time, it seems like I've had my, well, at least seven and a half, eight hours sleep, so that's not bad. CONAN: Not bad at all. Dr. William Dement, is it true that we - it's harder to get eight hours of sleep as we get older? Dr. DEMENT: Yes, but the actual need for sleep probably decreases somewhat at least by an hour from young adulthood to elderly. And I think that the key is not so much saying I need a certain amount of sleep, but if I feel wide awake, rested and, you know, energetic and wanting to do things throughout the entire day, then you are getting the sleep you need. BOB: And could I say something? CONAN: Go ahead, Bob. BOB: If I sleep, like, seven hours, let's say - I'm 75 years old now - and if I sleep the reasonable seven hours, I feel quite refreshed. Dr. DEMENT: You know, that sounds about right. And that\u2026 BOB: But if it's much less than that, well, then it's a little more uncomfortable, right? Dr. DEMENT: Exactly. CONAN: All right, Bob. BOB: Thank you very much. CONAN: And have a good night. BOB: Yeah. CONAN: All right. Bye-bye. Here's an email from Bill: I try to get by on five hours per day. There's too much life to live. I'll sleep when I'm dead. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. DEMENT: No, I'd say - would you - the choice is going through life losing an hour of sleep at night, going through life as a zombie, or getting - giving up that one hour of being a zombie for wide awake, alert and at your personal best all day long. And I think the main things people - a lot of people just haven't experienced that since they were kids. So when we actually do our sleep debt reductions maneuvers, people say, oh my God, I haven't felt this great, you know, for years. I didn't realize - and then they are motivated to maintain it - maintain the schedule. CONAN: Let's get - this is Wyatt. Wyatt's with us from Minnesota. WYATT (Caller): Hi. My question was how do you naps relate if you're in need for sleep time? For example, last night, I slept four hours. And I'm at work right now. And when I get home, I'll probably take a three-hour nap. Does that mean that I'm reset? Dr. DEMENT: Well, it can reset, but most people who nap, they can maintain their schedule. And certainly, if you lose sleep at night, a nap in the daytime is a good idea. I thought you were going to say how do you nap? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. DEMENT: Everybody has their own little style. CONAN: Mm-hmm. What is a useful nap? Is 10 or 20 minutes useful? Do you need to get 40 minutes or an hour and a half to get a full rhythm in? Dr. DEMENT: I think that there's kind of a miraculous - and most people will report this - if they feel sleepy, their eyelids want to close and they let it happen and sleep for five minutes to 10 minutes, when they awaken, they're very refreshed, and it's kind of hard to explain. If you really, really want to replace lost sleep, again, it's probably a longer nap. But I think that a very short nap can - it's like going over some sort of boundary into sleepiness, and you get - a little bit of sleep can get you back across that boundary, so that you can keep your eyes open and, you know, continue to drive or whatever it is you're doing. CONAN: Wyatt, thanks for the call. WYATT: Thank you. CONAN: We're talking with Dr. William Dement, chief of the Stanford University Division of Sleep, and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And an email here from Neil: I was a soldier in the U. S. Army, stationed in Iraq in 2003. Army doctrine is that soldiers are only required four hours of uninterrupted sleep for a - in a 24-hour period to maintain combat operation functionality. In my experience, he writes, this was not enough by a large margin. Dr. DEMENT: And he's absolutely right, and I am aware of this erroneous doctrine. It's also at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station, where we've had the same thing we've - I think we've managed to change that because no one -almost no one can get along in four hours of sleep at night. And I think you get errors, friendly fire, all kinds of bad things happening. The Army should be well rested. CONAN: Anybody with automatic weapons should be well rested. I think we can all agree on that. Here's an email from Perry in Portland, Oregon: I put off sleep because life is so full of activities I love to do. I love what I do for a living, love exercising, love to eat, love to ride my bike, meditating and writing. Who has time for sleep when life is so full and fulfilling? And it's even more so during daylight savings, when the sun's setting between 8:00 and 9:00 PM and the day is being so beautiful. I want to stay out longer. There's just so much so many of us want to do. Dr. DEMENT: Well, I think that some people do need less sleep, but I think the things like - when we studied meditation some years ago, and all these meditators - it was would sleep. They would all fall asleep. So, I think - I think that people are not sufficiently aware of how they're functioning and what they're doing. So if they want - if you're doing things that are very, very active, yes, it's easy to stay awake, but not meditation or studying. CONAN: Let's talk with - who is this - Harvey. Harvey is with us from Coral Gables in Florida. HARVEY (Caller): Good afternoon. I'd like to ask about any research that's been done relative to like a night pulse, circadian rhythm for human beings. If we didn't know, you know, if it was day or night, what might that cycle tend to look like in hours or days or whatever? Is there been any relevant research on that lately? CONAN: Yup - this is my excuse, that I'm actually an alien from a 27-hour planet. Dr. DEMENT: That's possible. There has been enormous amount of research in time-isolation facilities in both Europe and the United States. And there is a natural period for human beings, which is - the average is, believe it or not, 24 hours and 11 minutes. There are some individual differences in that. And then what is the most important thing is, how you - how that cycle relates to time of day, so that the alert phase can be early for some people, or it can be very, very late. It certainly tends to be very, very late in college students who - for example, at Stanford - I think the average bedtime is 2:30 a. m. CONAN: Hmm. Dr. DEMENT: Then they - of course, there's difficulty getting up in the morning. CONAN: Here's a related email from Suzanne in Philadelphia: I don't get enough sleep at night because I'm on a non-24-hour sleep cycle. As a blind person with no light perception and no retina, I don't have the same ability to metabolize melatonin in the same way as most people. That may be an oversimplification, but I find the subject fascinating. Dr. DEMENT: Yes, that's - it's almost certainly true. We've studied several blind individuals, and they could not adjust to a 24-hour day so that we either had to - you know, they'd have to be knowledgeable and just do what they could and time their activities, or we could manipulate their sleep cycle with medication, you know, and then synchronize it. CONAN: Harvey, thanks for the call. Let's see if we can squeeze one last caller in. And this is David - David with us from Syracuse, New York. DAVID (Caller): Good afternoon. CONAN: Afternoon. DAVID: I wanted to ask about sleep prescriptions. The ones that have been tried for me are chloral hydrate, Benadryl and other things. I have a very light, dreaming sleep, not a restful sleep, and so I wind up more tired than without the prescription. So I was wondering why the sleep prescriptions do that, and just give me a light, dreaming sleep, not a restful sleep? Dr. DEMENT: Well, the names you mentioned are very, very old, and, in a sense, have long since been discarded by physicians. There are four or five more recently evaluated sleep medications, and they require a doctor's prescription, but they're safe and very effective. DAVID: Such as? Dr. DEMENT: Well, there's Ambien, Rozerem - these are trade names - Lunesta and Sonata. DAVID: And\u2026 CONAN: Good luck with those, David. DAVID: Okay. CONAN: I just wanted to end with this quote that you gave at something called the Orlando Conference, that \"An individual's sleep is normal and adequate should never be taken for granted by anyone. The more correct assumption would be that, until proven otherwise, their sleep is either inadequate, abnormal or both. \" Dr. Dement, thanks very much for being with us. Dr. DEMENT: I stand by that.

But it's certainly a problem at a university, where, you know, you have a snoring roommate, for example. Then you are sleepy all day long. You don't do as well in class.  CONAN: Roommates are easier to change than spouses.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. DEMENT: That's true. That's very wise.  LISA: \u2026these apnea machines. How effective are those? My in-laws, both of them have one of those, and they take them on trip so that they can sleep on the same hotel bed.  Dr. DEMENT: Yeah. They're very effective. Now here's the - if they're snoring and then a pause, then it - that must be treated with a continuous positive airway pressure machine. And you can use it for just - you know, people say benign snoring. I don't think there is any such thing, because it means that airflow is impaired if you snore. So snoring\u2026  CONAN: Now these devices, though, they do look like they come - they're manufactured by Torcamada(ph) Enterprises.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. DEMENT: Well, people swear by them, and I guess maybe a certain percentage find it intolerable. And at that point, you know, you have to do something else. So the dental splints, and, I think, the surgical approach. The beauty of the surgical approach - if insurance covers it - is that it's, you know, forever. It's the lifetime. You don't have to worry about it again.  CONAN: Hmm. All right.  Dr. DEMENT: Whereas wearing the mask, you know, is for the rest of your life.  LISA: Thank you for your help.  CONAN: And good luck, Lisa.  LISA: Thanks.  CONAN: Bye-bye. Let's see if we can get - this is Bob. Bob's on the air from Wisconsin.  BOB (Caller): Yes, from Darlington, Wisconsin.  CONAN: Go ahead, please.  BOB: And I've been retired for a number of years down the - I've had the opportunity to turn on my radio at night between 8:30 and 9:00 and listen to NPR.  (Soundbite of laughter)  BOB: They have wonderful programs, and I listen maybe till 11:00, and then I'm kind of tired and then I turn off the radio and fall asleep quite nicely, and I've - get my seven, eight-hours sleep.  CONAN: There are times like a fine formula, as long as you don't adapt it to the middle of the day.  BOB: That's right.  Dr. DEMENT: I get - all I can say is congratulations.  BOB: Well, I just sort of a fell in to this pattern, and I didn't know how it was going to work out, but it just worked out beautifully, especially on Sunday and Saturday night when Norman Gilliland has the old-time radio program, sort of like \"The Lone Ranger\".  CONAN: Nothing easier to fall asleep to than Fibber McGee and Molly.  BOB: That's exactly right. So it seems to work beautifully for me. And then at the end of the sleep time, it seems like I've had my, well, at least seven and a half, eight hours sleep, so that's not bad.  CONAN: Not bad at all. Dr. William Dement, is it true that we - it's harder to get eight hours of sleep as we get older?  Dr. DEMENT: Yes, but the actual need for sleep probably decreases somewhat at least by an hour from young adulthood to elderly. And I think that the key is not so much saying I need a certain amount of sleep, but if I feel wide awake, rested and, you know, energetic and wanting to do things throughout the entire day, then you are getting the sleep you need.  BOB: And could I say something?  CONAN: Go ahead, Bob.  BOB: If I sleep, like, seven hours, let's say - I'm 75 years old now - and if I sleep the reasonable seven hours, I feel quite refreshed.  Dr. DEMENT: You know, that sounds about right. And that\u2026  BOB: But if it's much less than that, well, then it's a little more uncomfortable, right?  Dr. DEMENT: Exactly.  CONAN: All right, Bob.  BOB: Thank you very much.  CONAN: And have a good night.  BOB: Yeah.  CONAN: All right. Bye-bye. Here's an email from Bill:  I try to get by on five hours per day. There's too much life to live. I'll sleep when I'm dead.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. DEMENT: No, I'd say - would you - the choice is going through life losing an hour of sleep at night, going through life as a zombie, or getting - giving up that one hour of being a zombie for wide awake, alert and at your personal best all day long. And I think the main things people - a lot of people just haven't experienced that since they were kids.  So when we actually do our sleep debt reductions maneuvers, people say, oh my God, I haven't felt this great, you know, for years. I didn't realize - and then they are motivated to maintain it - maintain the schedule.  CONAN: Let's get - this is Wyatt. Wyatt's with us from Minnesota.  WYATT (Caller): Hi. My question was how do you naps relate if you're in need for sleep time? For example, last night, I slept four hours. And I'm at work right now. And when I get home, I'll probably take a three-hour nap. Does that mean that I'm reset?  Dr. DEMENT: Well, it can reset, but most people who nap, they can maintain their schedule. And certainly, if you lose sleep at night, a nap in the daytime is a good idea. I thought you were going to say how do you nap?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. DEMENT: Everybody has their own little style.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. What is a useful nap? Is 10 or 20 minutes useful? Do you need to get 40 minutes or an hour and a half to get a full rhythm in?  Dr. DEMENT: I think that there's kind of a miraculous - and most people will report this - if they feel sleepy, their eyelids want to close and they let it happen and sleep for five minutes to 10 minutes, when they awaken, they're very refreshed, and it's kind of hard to explain. If you really, really want to replace lost sleep, again, it's probably a longer nap.  But I think that a very short nap can - it's like going over some sort of boundary into sleepiness, and you get - a little bit of sleep can get you back across that boundary, so that you can keep your eyes open and, you know, continue to drive or whatever it is you're doing.  CONAN: Wyatt, thanks for the call.  WYATT: Thank you.  CONAN: We're talking with Dr. William Dement, chief of the Stanford University Division of Sleep, and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  And an email here from Neil:  I was a soldier in the U. S. Army, stationed in Iraq in 2003. Army doctrine is that soldiers are only required four hours of uninterrupted sleep for a - in a 24-hour period to maintain combat operation functionality. In my experience, he writes, this was not enough by a large margin.  Dr. DEMENT: And he's absolutely right, and I am aware of this erroneous doctrine. It's also at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station, where we've had the same thing we've - I think we've managed to change that because no one -almost no one can get along in four hours of sleep at night. And I think you get errors, friendly fire, all kinds of bad things happening. The Army should be well rested.  CONAN: Anybody with automatic weapons should be well rested. I think we can all agree on that. Here's an email from Perry in Portland, Oregon:  I put off sleep because life is so full of activities I love to do. I love what I do for a living, love exercising, love to eat, love to ride my bike, meditating and writing. Who has time for sleep when life is so full and fulfilling? And it's even more so during daylight savings, when the sun's setting between 8:00 and 9:00 PM and the day is being so beautiful. I want to stay out longer. There's just so much so many of us want to do.  Dr. DEMENT: Well, I think that some people do need less sleep, but I think the things like - when we studied meditation some years ago, and all these meditators - it was would sleep. They would all fall asleep. So, I think - I think that people are not sufficiently aware of how they're functioning and what they're doing. So if they want - if you're doing things that are very, very active, yes, it's easy to stay awake, but not meditation or studying.  CONAN: Let's talk with - who is this - Harvey. Harvey is with us from Coral Gables in Florida.  HARVEY (Caller): Good afternoon. I'd like to ask about any research that's been done relative to like a night pulse, circadian rhythm for human beings. If we didn't know, you know, if it was day or night, what might that cycle tend to look like in hours or days or whatever? Is there been any relevant research on that lately?  CONAN: Yup - this is my excuse, that I'm actually an alien from a 27-hour planet.  Dr. DEMENT: That's possible. There has been enormous amount of research in time-isolation facilities in both Europe and the United States. And there is a natural period for human beings, which is - the average is, believe it or not, 24 hours and 11 minutes. There are some individual differences in that. And then what is the most important thing is, how you - how that cycle relates to time of day, so that the alert phase can be early for some people, or it can be very, very late. It certainly tends to be very, very late in college students who - for example, at Stanford - I think the average bedtime is 2:30 a. m.  CONAN: Hmm.  Dr. DEMENT: Then they - of course, there's difficulty getting up in the morning.  CONAN: Here's a related email from Suzanne in Philadelphia:  I don't get enough sleep at night because I'm on a non-24-hour sleep cycle. As a blind person with no light perception and no retina, I don't have the same ability to metabolize melatonin in the same way as most people. That may be an oversimplification, but I find the subject fascinating.  Dr. DEMENT: Yes, that's - it's almost certainly true. We've studied several blind individuals, and they could not adjust to a 24-hour day so that we either had to - you know, they'd have to be knowledgeable and just do what they could and time their activities, or we could manipulate their sleep cycle with medication, you know, and then synchronize it.  CONAN: Harvey, thanks for the call. Let's see if we can squeeze one last caller in. And this is David - David with us from Syracuse, New York.  DAVID (Caller): Good afternoon.  CONAN: Afternoon.  DAVID: I wanted to ask about sleep prescriptions. The ones that have been tried for me are chloral hydrate, Benadryl and other things. I have a very light, dreaming sleep, not a restful sleep, and so I wind up more tired than without the prescription. So I was wondering why the sleep prescriptions do that, and just give me a light, dreaming sleep, not a restful sleep?  Dr. DEMENT: Well, the names you mentioned are very, very old, and, in a sense, have long since been discarded by physicians. There are four or five more recently evaluated sleep medications, and they require a doctor's prescription, but they're safe and very effective.  DAVID: Such as?  Dr. DEMENT: Well, there's Ambien, Rozerem - these are trade names - Lunesta and Sonata.  DAVID: And\u2026  CONAN: Good luck with those, David.  DAVID: Okay.  CONAN: I just wanted to end with this quote that you gave at something called the Orlando Conference, that \"An individual's sleep is normal and adequate should never be taken for granted by anyone. The more correct assumption would be that, until proven otherwise, their sleep is either inadequate, abnormal or both. \" Dr. Dement, thanks very much for being with us.  Dr. DEMENT: I stand by that.  CONAN: William Dement, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine. I'm Neal Conan. It's TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.

Scientists have been pondering this question for years. Some stay it started as a Bing Bang. Others talked about quantum fluctuations. Others say it exists because we're here to observe it. Well, my next guest has pondered these questions and offers his own musings. Paul Davies says perhaps things we do today and in the future can actually go back in time from the future, travel back and influence the very distant past and the structure of the universe. His new book is called \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right For Life. \" He's also a professor at Arizona State University and director of the Beyond Center for Fundamental Concepts in Science. And he joins us from KJZZ in Arizona. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Davies. Dr. PAUL DAVIES (Author, \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right For Life\"): Thank you. Good afternoon. FLATOW: You're welcome. What part on this idea of talking about a new book? Of creating one. Dr. DAVIES: Well, I was struck by the fact that the multiverse theory of the universe was gaining a lot of momentum a few years ago. And this multiverse theory says that the reason the universe seems to be just right for life, almost like a fixed, is because there isn't just one universe. There's a vast ensemble of them out there somewhere. And the laws of physics, what we thought were the laws are really just more like the local bylaws - different in different patches. And so getting it just right for life would be a very rare thing, but it would be only in those universes where there would be observers. And I thought this was a bit of a cop-out. So that was the main motivation for writing this book. I wanted to have a really good critical look at this very popular multiverse theory. FLATOW: But you have come up with some really new ideas. I mean, new ideas to me and for mostly other readers, and they're the ideas that you have been thinking about for years\u2026 Mr. DAVIES: Right. FLATOW: \u2026and you've argued that a good case, I'm going to read from right from the book. A good case can be made that life and mind are fundamental physical phenomena, and so must be incorporated into the overall cosmic scheme - life and mind. We don't think about that as running the universe. Mr. DAVIES: Well, you see it's true that most scientists regard life as just some quirky little embellishment that's added on to the universe's afterthought. It's just something that happened in a funny little corner of the universe, end of story. And when it comes to mind, the similar thing, just a weird aberration, an odd phenomenon of no fundamental significance. And I've always thought that this is deeply wrong. That life and eventually mind are fundamental features of the universe. Fundamental in the same sense that elementary particles are fundamental or the dimensions of space are fundamental. So they play a deep role. And one of the reasons that idea was reinforced is because if the universe had any of ragbag of laws - if I gave you the task of design us a universe, you'd make a hash of it, and you get a universe in which almost certainly there could be no life. The one we're in is fine-tunes for life. There's no real disagreement about that. Where we start scrubbing is over what the explanation is. I take the reason for the fine-tuning to be that life itself and consciousness, the existence of conscious beings is deeply fundamental to the great overall scheme of things. And any attempt to explain existence - the ultimate explanation of existence had a really basic level, has to incorporate life and mind in a basic way, and not just sort of throw them in as a lucky bonus or something. FLATOW: Talking with Paul Davies, author of \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right For Life\" on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Paul Davies, are you saying then that the universe exist because there are lives and minds out there? We\u2026 Dr. DAVIES: Well, I wouldn't put it quite like that. What I would say is the following - that the universe has engineered its own self-awareness. It hasn't been imprinted on it from without, and it's not the result of just some, you know, winning the cosmic jackpot, so here's the title of the book. It isn't that there is a (unintelligible) number of universes out there and they were random and just here on then you're bound to get it just right for life. And I think that life and mind and the universe and the laws that bring it into being are all mutually explanatory. That is, that they form part of a single explanatory scheme. Now the traditional way of looking at the laws of physics are that they are sort of stamped on the universe by magic, like the maker's mark of the time of the Big Bang. That they are, basically, perfect mathematical statements of existence, some other worldly realm exact relationships but just happened to exist for reasons we know not what. And they're plunked on the universe, and we're stuck with them. They are amusable eternal transcendent laws. And I think that's a bogus idea. I think some idea that derives, originally, from theology, from monotheistic theology, the idea of a created world order in a rational plan. I don't think that the laws of physics like that. I think of them as more like software being round on the great cosmic machine, but the great cosmic computer we call the universe, until that the laws are inherent in the universe and emergent with it. And so I think that life and the laws and its observers are all part of a common package, and I come - in the book, I suggest a mechanism whereby the existence of life and observers can - as it would react back on the universe and engineer the very laws that are necessary for that to hold together self-consistently. FLATOW: But that would mean, and you explained this in your book, that people would have to travel back in time to create those laws. Dr. DAVIES: We are expressing it in much more of a dramatic manner. People certainly don't travel back in time, and it's important to realize that you can't change the past or send information back in the past, but we've known for over 50 years that this notion of a unique past is in any case affection. The idea that there was a particular state of the time at the Big Bang and its connected by a unique part in history to the present moment went out the window with quantum physics. Quantum mechanics, which has uncertainty at the top, tells us not only that the future is uncertain, the past is uncertain as well. If you apply quantum mechanics to the whole universe, a subject of quantum cosmology\u2026 FLATOW: Paul, I'm going to have to stop you here because you're getting into a big concept that needs some time to talk about. We have to go to a break. So we'll bring that up right as we come back from a break. Talking with Paul Davies author of \"Cosmic Jackpot. \" Stay with us, we'll be right back. I'm Ira Flatow this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Paul Davies, author of \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right For Life. \" There is so many - are there so many ideas in this book that's it a tremendous book. Dr. Davies begins the book by giving a terrific recap of where we stand in our knowledge about the universe, and then he goes further and speculates about why the universe is the way it is, and he talks about the universe and mind become one in far, far future, and he talks about how the knowledge will spread out through the universe and meld, and the mind will meld with the universe and actually be able to change what happened beforehand. Would that be right, Dr. Davies, what I'm talking\u2026 Dr. DAVIES: Everything except the word, change. FLATOW: Okay. Dr. DAVIES: Because this is quantum physics. This is where we need your poets to come back after help with that because, you know, quantum physics is this weird wonderland. FLATOW: Right. Dr. DAVIES: When Einstein spoke about spooky action of the distance is from his famous phrases. And what he meant is that in quantum physics, you can reach across the universe, two particles that might be millions of light years apart, somehow still subtly linked in a way that what happens to one concerns what happens to the other. But you can never use manipulation on one particle to change the other one. It's that they're deeply correlated in a way that makes no sense in daily life. Well, this goes to the action of the distance can be with the simple change of the reference frame, turned into ghostly action back in time. What it means is what we do today, what human beings choose to measure or it doesn't have the human beings, it can be some experimental set up in the lab, but what gets measured today affects the nature of reality as it was in the distant past. This is not in dispute. It sounds like a really amazing dramatic claim. This is not new. There are experiments you can do in the lab, and it's all correct. It's part and parcel of standard quantum physics. And Stephen Hawking has written about this very recently in which he says it's a mistake to think of there being a unique past. You must think of the present state of the universe or the quantum level as an amalgam of all the different histories. It's often called the many histories in view of quantum mechanics, all the different possible histories in the past. And what we choose to measure today, the existence of observance and so on, will to some limited extent affect which history is going to that amalgam in which dent, but of course, we're only at the start of the great cosmic journeys. You pointed out that in the trillions of years that are left ahead, we can imagine that life and conscious beings will spread out across the cosmos certainly from earth, but maybe from other planets too, and eventually these what John Wheeler called acts of observer-participancy will saturate the universe. So these ideas, although they seem very radical, actually are not that new. John Wheeler, he who coined the term black hole, was suggesting ideas like this about 30 years ago. What I've done is try to flush them out, and find a real physical mechanism to make them work. FLATOW: But you've also brought them backwards a little bit more in time, at least the public idea about them. Dr. DAVIES: I think this notion that what happens in the universe now is relevant to the past sounds dramatic and revolutionary. Well, I keep emphasizing that it's actually implicit already in quantum physics, which is pretty weird - weird things happen in quantum physics. And that's the hook, if you like, that can link life and mind with the universe, which back in the first split second, it's laws were only just sort of congealing, so to speak, out of the (unintelligible), the Big Bang. And that's the way in which those laws can zero in on the bio-friendly set of which I'm mystified about. That's how they got bio-friendly. FLATOW: I see. Let's go to David in Muncie, Indiana. Hi, David. DAVID (Caller): Hi. I don't have a background in science but I do have some interest in like a philosophy of science and philosophy at large, and I obviously haven't read your book and I just become and think- based on what I've heard so far, but when you were talking about mind and life as fundamental parts of the universe, like fundamental particles, and the taking (unintelligible) sort of a departure from like a traditional view, like a materialist or physicalist in the view of the world where the those things would be, say, emergent properties or something. It occurred to me that it - it's somewhat like creationist who are sort of presupposing, you know, a creator and then saying, well, this is the way that the process has worked but that there was a motivating force behind it or that maybe there's a conflation between theology and science, like maybe Teilhard de Chardin or something like that. And I can't help wondering if there's a blurring of the lines between science and something else, maybe theology or something else. Mr. DAVIES: Well, in one sense, you couldn't be more wrong, because this is an attempt to explain the universe - why it exists, why it has the laws it does, or why life (unintelligible) exists from entirely within the universe. Because one of the things I want to do is get away from the notion that somehow, this magic has been imprinted on the universe from without. Instead of appealing to something outside like a god or some set of laws that just happens to exist conveniently, I want to try and explain everything scientifically from within, so it's the exact opposite of what you were suggesting. But if you are saying that in revisiting these topics, like how did the universe come to exist; what is the place of human beings in the great scheme; are we trespassing on territory previously occupied by priests and philosophers - well then yes, of course. Any intent to grapple with the deep discretions of existence is going to stray across that line that formerly was the province of philosophy. It's now becoming part of science, and I'm taking a thoroughly scientific view of how to explain these things. So I would say that I disagree with your earlier sentiment. But one other thing I should say\u2026 DAVID: But I understand that the physical constants, they're not something which sort of arbitrarily occurred, but they're a product of life or mind? Mr. DAVIES: The - what I'm saying is that these physical constants, which have to be fine tuned in order for there to be life\u2026 DAVID: Right. Mr. DAVIES: \u2026these are - when the universe came into existence, these were not nailed down with their - that is what we have now. They were - some are fuzzy and unfocused. And the way in which they focused in on the bio-friendly set is connected with the very existence of observing beings who appear billions of years later through this quantum feedback loop, which John Wheeler explicated in its original form about 30 years ago. And I tried to develop this now. So that's the link that takes us from observers\u2026 DAVID: Is it a causal thing? Is there a cause and effect relationship? Mr. DAVIES: Well, you have to be really careful in quantum physics, with cause and effect, you know, what they are in daily life. But in some sense, it is. It's more of a consistency. FLATOW: David, the attempt on the mistake I made before in using the word, you know, changed something that happened earlier, is the trap that you were both falling into. You are saying that, you know, by influencing - listening to Dr. Davies talking about other humans influencing the direction of the universe takes, you're saying that we can go back and influence what happened or where there's a direct link, when - but there isn't. It's a spooky action that's really hard to understand. And I certainly don't understand all of it and\u2026 DAVID: Well, I guess, what I have in mind was that if the proposition that the minds or the lives have been the feature, which I'm - maybe cause isn't the right word - but which had an end-product such the universe had the particular set of features that it had, then it seems that in a way, that's like positing a creator. Mr. DAVIES: Why is that? Because the universe is engineering Zen self-awareness. Otherwise, you're stuck with the notion that something outside the universe has engineered it. And what is that? You know, then we turn it around. What is that going to be? It's either going to be a pre-existing designer god or some magical set of laws or something outside the universe. I wanted to be down from with inside, and so the universe engineers its own self-awareness. DAVID: But with the - what you call the magical set of laws, those are laws which are observable. And if they're observable, then that seems like it's a proper thing to have as part of science. If\u2026 Mr. DAVIES: Yeah, but where do they come from? That's the point. Are you saying that they got imprinted on the universe like the maker's mark by some external agency at the time of the Big Bang? You see, I don't buy that, because that is appealing to some creator being outside the universe. FLATOW: So you're saying the universe is self-contained and self-changing within itself. Mr. DAVIES: And self-explanatory, exactly. It's\u2026 FLATOW: And self-explanatory and\u2026 Mr. DAVIES: It's an attempt to get everything out of a common explanatory package instead of just shoving it off outside the universe - well, God did it or well, some magical set of laws that just happen to exist, or there's an infinite number of unseen universes. I want to do it all from within the universe. FLATOW: And if there were not intelligent beings here, would do the universe exist? Mr. DAVIES: That's a deep, philosophical question that you have to make up your mind about. Does something that can never, even in principle, be observed - can it really be said to exist? Some people think yes, some people think no. It depends on your philosophical stance. I keep changing my mind, though. FLATOW: I was going to ask you that. Does your head swim sometimes as much as mine at this moment? And it's a question to our listeners, those trying to understand this. Mr. DAVIES: Dealing with the deep discretions of existence is always challenging. And what I say at the end of the book, incidentally - because some of this stuff sounds just plain wacky - is that everybody's theory of the universe is plain wacky. You know, what have you got?  There's an unexplained god that just did it. How nice. There's a set of physical laws that just happens to be right and - for life and so on? Well, how convenient. There's an infinite number of universes we can never see even in principle. Well, you know, what about Akum's razor? They all seem totally crazy. If you're dealing with the deep discretions of existence, everything is going to seem bizarre. And I recommend - what I am offering is the least crazy of the lot. But it still sounds pretty wacky. FLATOW: I think it was John Wheeler - I remember interviewing him many years ago - saying, or maybe he was quoting Einstein - to say the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible. Mr. DAVIES: Right, and this is a big point because human beings are not just observers. It's not like, you know, we're selecting our place in the universe because we just happen to be here observing it. We can understand it, too. It's comprehensible to us, and that's why I think there is deep link. But I don't think that mind is just a trivial little embellishment, because why do we have to understand the universe? That suggests that our minds are linked in to the workings of the universe in a very deep way, and that's why I say fundamental. Not fundamental in some sort of - there's some spirit or anything like that, you know, just sort of pasted on. That's not what I meant. The first caller  seemed to misunderstand that. FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. DAVIES: I mean, fundamental in the sense of - the - of cosmic significance that the workings of the universe, as a whole, requires to understand it. FLATOW: But you know, when you talk to scientists - and I talked to many of them - they all sway, they stay away from the question of why the universe seems strangely suited to life. Mr. DAVIES: Yeah, they don't like it because it makes them feel very uncomfortable. I've just run through the alternatives on offer that you appeal to some external god who's unexplained - well, scientists don't like that; that there's an infinite number of universes -  well, they don't like that because it suggests that our theories of physics permits an infinite number of alternative realities. So they'd rather just describe this reality. And they, generally speaking, feel very uncomfortable with the idea of bringing observers into the picture, because physicists traditionally have tried to ignore mind, life and mind. They feel the very essence of physics is to be objective, that everyone can agree doesn't matter how the observer's moving, what their stance is; it would all agree to a common set of results. But at some stage, we must incorporate consciousness - or mind, if you like -into our description of the physical universe in a totally non-mystical way. The moment it's like sort of added on as an extra - most physicists trying not to think about it, but they think it rather as being of sort of something else - I would like to see our understanding of the conscious mind thoroughly integrated into physics, which means finding mechanisms that explain conscious experiences and how those experiences react back on the universe. And quantum physics, by general consent, seems to be the best way of getting at that connection. FLATOW: Talking with Paul Davies, author of \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right for Life\" on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. A truly fascinating book in concept. So you're wrestling with this, you've put out this idea, and you're still working it out in your own mind. Mr. DAVIES: Yes. I mentioned that the germ of this idea, of somehow the universe explaining itself and the existence of observers reacting back on the universe to make it bio-friendly - that idea was put out by John Archibald Wheeler, he of the black Hall of Fame about 30 years ago. But he called it an idea for an idea. He didn't develop it beyond thinking that quantum physics will be the way to bring about this connection. What I've been trying to do is to take this a step further. How is it the case that the laws of physics are malleable in this way? You know, mostly, you think that they're just sort of absolute, fixed, universal laws precisely narrowed down from the get-go. But indeed, there is a way, with our further understanding now of the nature of black holes, the nature of event horizons in cosmology, an understanding of how the laws of physics could be malleable, could be flexible. Flexi-laws is what Stephen Hawking calls it. And so these flexi laws or flexi history is just what we need to bring about this sort of self-consistent, explanatory loop. FLATOW: If we have some - if 75 percent of the universe, the dark energy, we have no idea what it is. Mr. DAVIES: Right. Well, we have an idea. There's plenty of theories, but we haven't\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. DAVIES: I've never seemed to be troubled by this. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: You're not troubled that we don't know what the - or we have theories, but, you know, it's just mysterious. Mr. DAVIES: I think it's exciting to contemplate. The lions' share comes from the so-called dark energy, the thing that's making the universe accelerate, expand faster and faster. And this dark energy of the moment is indistinguishable from the quantum vacuums, so we're back to the dreaded quantum again. Quantum physics tells us that anti-space should have a weird type of energy that would have an anti-gravity effect. And I have worked on that quantum vacuum, the gravity of the quantum vacuum, for most of my career. So I have a soft spot for it. The only problem is that when you put the numbers in, it's famously 120 powers of 10 too great that we get out of the theory. So, yeah, nice try, but we got to get our number down (unintelligible). FLATOW: I have 30 seconds just to ask you, Dr. Davies - do we need new physics? Will the physics we have explain what you're trying to describe? Mr. DAVIES: No. We need something new, and in particular, we need something that will bring the laws of physics themselves within the scope of science. FLATOW: And there's the search, and I want to thank you very much, Paul Davies, for taking time to talk with us, and continue the great work in tweaking our minds to think. Mr. DAVIES: It's been great fun. Thanks. FLATOW: You're welcome. Paul Davies is author of \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right for Life. \" Terrific read, I highly recommend it. It's really thought provoking. You're going to take some time to spend with this book. Surf over to our Web site at sciencefriday. com. Have a great weekend. We'll see you next week in Alaska. I'm Ira Flatow in New York.  IRA FLATOW, host:  Up next: how did the universe come into existence in the balance that allows for life? Scientists have been pondering this question for years. Some stay it started as a Bing Bang. Others talked about quantum fluctuations. Others say it exists because we're here to observe it.  Well, my next guest has pondered these questions and offers his own musings. Paul Davies says perhaps things we do today and in the future can actually go back in time from the future, travel back and influence the very distant past and the structure of the universe. His new book is called \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right For Life. \" He's also a professor at Arizona State University and director of the Beyond Center for Fundamental Concepts in Science. And he joins us from KJZZ in Arizona. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Davies.  Dr. PAUL DAVIES (Author, \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right For Life\"): Thank you. Good afternoon.  FLATOW: You're welcome. What part on this idea of talking about a new book? Of creating one.  Dr. DAVIES: Well, I was struck by the fact that the multiverse theory of the universe was gaining a lot of momentum a few years ago. And this multiverse theory says that the reason the universe seems to be just right for life, almost like a fixed, is because there isn't just one universe. There's a vast ensemble of them out there somewhere. And the laws of physics, what we thought were the laws are really just more like the local bylaws - different in different patches.  And so getting it just right for life would be a very rare thing, but it would be only in those universes where there would be observers. And I thought this was a bit of a cop-out. So that was the main motivation for writing this book. I wanted to have a really good critical look at this very popular multiverse theory.  FLATOW: But you have come up with some really new ideas. I mean, new ideas to me and for mostly other readers, and they're the ideas that you have been thinking about for years\u2026  Mr. DAVIES: Right.  FLATOW: \u2026and you've argued that a good case, I'm going to read from right from the book. A good case can be made that life and mind are fundamental physical phenomena, and so must be incorporated into the overall cosmic scheme - life and mind. We don't think about that as running the universe.  Mr. DAVIES: Well, you see it's true that most scientists regard life as just some quirky little embellishment that's added on to the universe's afterthought. It's just something that happened in a funny little corner of the universe, end of story. And when it comes to mind, the similar thing, just a weird aberration, an odd phenomenon of no fundamental significance. And I've always thought that this is deeply wrong. That life and eventually mind are fundamental features of the universe. Fundamental in the same sense that elementary particles are fundamental or the dimensions of space are fundamental. So they play a deep role. And one of the reasons that idea was reinforced is because if the universe had any of ragbag of laws - if I gave you the task of design us a universe, you'd make a hash of it, and you get a universe in which almost certainly there could be no life. The one we're in is fine-tunes for life. There's no real disagreement about that. Where we start scrubbing is over what the explanation is. I take the reason for the fine-tuning to be that life itself and consciousness, the existence of conscious beings is deeply fundamental to the great overall scheme of things. And any attempt to explain existence - the ultimate explanation of existence had a really basic level, has to incorporate life and mind in a basic way, and not just sort of throw them in as a lucky bonus or something.  FLATOW: Talking with Paul Davies, author of \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right For Life\" on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  Paul Davies, are you saying then that the universe exist because there are lives and minds out there? We\u2026  Dr. DAVIES: Well, I wouldn't put it quite like that. What I would say is the following - that the universe has engineered its own self-awareness. It hasn't been imprinted on it from without, and it's not the result of just some, you know, winning the cosmic jackpot, so here's the title of the book. It isn't that there is a (unintelligible) number of universes out there and they were random and just here on then you're bound to get it just right for life. And I think that life and mind and the universe and the laws that bring it into being are all mutually explanatory. That is, that they form part of a single explanatory scheme.  Now the traditional way of looking at the laws of physics are that they are sort of stamped on the universe by magic, like the maker's mark of the time of the Big Bang. That they are, basically, perfect mathematical statements of existence, some other worldly realm exact relationships but just happened to exist for reasons we know not what. And they're plunked on the universe, and we're stuck with them. They are amusable eternal transcendent laws.  And I think that's a bogus idea. I think some idea that derives, originally, from theology, from monotheistic theology, the idea of a created world order in a rational plan. I don't think that the laws of physics like that. I think of them as more like software being round on the great cosmic machine, but the great cosmic computer we call the universe, until that the laws are inherent in the universe and emergent with it.  And so I think that life and the laws and its observers are all part of a common package, and I come - in the book, I suggest a mechanism whereby the existence of life and observers can - as it would react back on the universe and engineer the very laws that are necessary for that to hold together self-consistently.  FLATOW: But that would mean, and you explained this in your book, that people would have to travel back in time to create those laws.  Dr. DAVIES: We are expressing it in much more of a dramatic manner. People certainly don't travel back in time, and it's important to realize that you can't change the past or send information back in the past, but we've known for over 50 years that this notion of a unique past is in any case affection. The idea that there was a particular state of the time at the Big Bang and its connected by a unique part in history to the present moment went out the window with quantum physics. Quantum mechanics, which has uncertainty at the top, tells us not only that the future is uncertain, the past is uncertain as well. If you apply quantum mechanics to the whole universe, a subject of quantum cosmology\u2026  FLATOW: Paul, I'm going to have to stop you here because you're getting into a big concept that needs some time to talk about. We have to go to a break. So we'll bring that up right as we come back from a break. Talking with Paul Davies author of \"Cosmic Jackpot. \" Stay with us, we'll be right back.  I'm Ira Flatow this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Paul Davies, author of \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right For Life. \"  There is so many - are there so many ideas in this book that's it a tremendous book. Dr. Davies begins the book by giving a terrific recap of where we stand in our knowledge about the universe, and then he goes further and speculates about why the universe is the way it is, and he talks about the universe and mind become one in far, far future, and he talks about how the knowledge will spread out through the universe and meld, and the mind will meld with the universe and actually be able to change what happened beforehand. Would that be right, Dr. Davies, what I'm talking\u2026  Dr. DAVIES: Everything except the word, change.  FLATOW: Okay.  Dr. DAVIES: Because this is quantum physics. This is where we need your poets to come back after help with that because, you know, quantum physics is this weird wonderland.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. DAVIES: When Einstein spoke about spooky action of the distance is from his famous phrases. And what he meant is that in quantum physics, you can reach across the universe, two particles that might be millions of light years apart, somehow still subtly linked in a way that what happens to one concerns what happens to the other. But you can never use manipulation on one particle to change the other one. It's that they're deeply correlated in a way that makes no sense in daily life.  Well, this goes to the action of the distance can be with the simple change of the reference frame, turned into ghostly action back in time. What it means is what we do today, what human beings choose to measure or it doesn't have the human beings, it can be some experimental set up in the lab, but what gets measured today affects the nature of reality as it was in the distant past. This is not in dispute. It sounds like a really amazing dramatic claim. This is not new. There are experiments you can do in the lab, and it's all correct. It's part and parcel of standard quantum physics.  And Stephen Hawking has written about this very recently in which he says it's a mistake to think of there being a unique past. You must think of the present state of the universe or the quantum level as an amalgam of all the different histories. It's often called the many histories in view of quantum mechanics, all the different possible histories in the past. And what we choose to measure today, the existence of observance and so on, will to some limited extent affect which history is going to that amalgam in which dent, but of course, we're only at the start of the great cosmic journeys.  You pointed out that in the trillions of years that are left ahead, we can imagine that life and conscious beings will spread out across the cosmos certainly from earth, but maybe from other planets too, and eventually these what John Wheeler called acts of observer-participancy will saturate the universe. So these ideas, although they seem very radical, actually are not that new. John Wheeler, he who coined the term black hole, was suggesting ideas like this about 30 years ago. What I've done is try to flush them out, and find a real physical mechanism to make them work.  FLATOW: But you've also brought them backwards a little bit more in time, at least the public idea about them.  Dr. DAVIES: I think this notion that what happens in the universe now is relevant to the past sounds dramatic and revolutionary. Well, I keep emphasizing that it's actually implicit already in quantum physics, which is pretty weird - weird things happen in quantum physics. And that's the hook, if you like, that can link life and mind with the universe, which back in the first split second, it's laws were only just sort of congealing, so to speak, out of the (unintelligible), the Big Bang. And that's the way in which those laws can zero in on the bio-friendly set of which I'm mystified about. That's how they got bio-friendly.  FLATOW: I see. Let's go to David in Muncie, Indiana. Hi, David.  DAVID (Caller): Hi. I don't have a background in science but I do have some interest in like a philosophy of science and philosophy at large, and I obviously haven't read your book and I just become and think- based on what I've heard so far, but when you were talking about mind and life as fundamental parts of the universe, like fundamental particles, and the taking (unintelligible) sort of a departure from like a traditional view, like a materialist or physicalist in the view of the world where the those things would be, say, emergent properties or something.  It occurred to me that it - it's somewhat like creationist who are sort of presupposing, you know, a creator and then saying, well, this is the way that the process has worked but that there was a motivating force behind it or that maybe there's a conflation between theology and science, like maybe Teilhard de Chardin or something like that. And I can't help wondering if there's a blurring of the lines between science and something else, maybe theology or something else.  Mr. DAVIES: Well, in one sense, you couldn't be more wrong, because this is an attempt to explain the universe - why it exists, why it has the laws it does, or why life (unintelligible) exists from entirely within the universe. Because one of the things I want to do is get away from the notion that somehow, this magic has been imprinted on the universe from without. Instead of appealing to something outside like a god or some set of laws that just happens to exist conveniently, I want to try and explain everything scientifically from within, so it's the exact opposite of what you were suggesting.  But if you are saying that in revisiting these topics, like how did the universe come to exist; what is the place of human beings in the great scheme; are we trespassing on territory previously occupied by priests and philosophers - well then yes, of course. Any intent to grapple with the deep discretions of existence is going to stray across that line that formerly was the province of philosophy. It's now becoming part of science, and I'm taking a thoroughly scientific view of how to explain these things. So I would say that I disagree with your earlier sentiment. But one other thing I should say\u2026  DAVID: But I understand that the physical constants, they're not something which sort of arbitrarily occurred, but they're a product of life or mind?  Mr. DAVIES: The - what I'm saying is that these physical constants, which have to be fine tuned in order for there to be life\u2026  DAVID: Right.  Mr. DAVIES: \u2026these are - when the universe came into existence, these were not nailed down with their - that is what we have now. They were - some are fuzzy and unfocused. And the way in which they focused in on the bio-friendly set is connected with the very existence of observing beings who appear billions of years later through this quantum feedback loop, which John Wheeler explicated in its original form about 30 years ago. And I tried to develop this now. So that's the link that takes us from observers\u2026  DAVID: Is it a causal thing? Is there a cause and effect relationship?  Mr. DAVIES: Well, you have to be really careful in quantum physics, with cause and effect, you know, what they are in daily life. But in some sense, it is. It's more of a consistency.  FLATOW: David, the attempt on the mistake I made before in using the word, you know, changed something that happened earlier, is the trap that you were both falling into. You are saying that, you know, by influencing - listening to Dr. Davies talking about other humans influencing the direction of the universe takes, you're saying that we can go back and influence what happened or where there's a direct link, when - but there isn't. It's a spooky action that's really hard to understand. And I certainly don't understand all of it and\u2026  DAVID: Well, I guess, what I have in mind was that if the proposition that the minds or the lives have been the feature, which I'm - maybe cause isn't the right word - but which had an end-product such the universe had the particular set of features that it had, then it seems that in a way, that's like positing a creator.  Mr. DAVIES: Why is that? Because the universe is engineering Zen self-awareness. Otherwise, you're stuck with the notion that something outside the universe has engineered it.  And what is that? You know, then we turn it around. What is that going to be? It's either going to be a pre-existing designer god or some magical set of laws or something outside the universe. I wanted to be down from with inside, and so the universe engineers its own self-awareness.  DAVID: But with the - what you call the magical set of laws, those are laws which are observable. And if they're observable, then that seems like it's a proper thing to have as part of science. If\u2026  Mr. DAVIES: Yeah, but where do they come from? That's the point. Are you saying that they got imprinted on the universe like the maker's mark by some external agency at the time of the Big Bang? You see, I don't buy that, because that is appealing to some creator being outside the universe.  FLATOW: So you're saying the universe is self-contained and self-changing within itself.  Mr. DAVIES: And self-explanatory, exactly. It's\u2026  FLATOW: And self-explanatory and\u2026  Mr. DAVIES: It's an attempt to get everything out of a common explanatory package instead of just shoving it off outside the universe - well, God did it or well, some magical set of laws that just happen to exist, or there's an infinite number of unseen universes. I want to do it all from within the universe.  FLATOW: And if there were not intelligent beings here, would do the universe exist?  Mr. DAVIES: That's a deep, philosophical question that you have to make up your mind about. Does something that can never, even in principle, be observed - can it really be said to exist? Some people think yes, some people think no. It depends on your philosophical stance. I keep changing my mind, though.  FLATOW: I was going to ask you that. Does your head swim sometimes as much as mine at this moment? And it's a question to our listeners, those trying to understand this.  Mr. DAVIES: Dealing with the deep discretions of existence is always challenging. And what I say at the end of the book, incidentally - because some of this stuff sounds just plain wacky - is that everybody's theory of the universe is plain wacky. You know, what have you got?  There's an unexplained god that just did it. How nice. There's a set of physical laws that just happens to be right and - for life and so on? Well, how convenient. There's an infinite number of universes we can never see even in principle.  Well, you know, what about Akum's razor? They all seem totally crazy. If you're dealing with the deep discretions of existence, everything is going to seem bizarre. And I recommend - what I am offering is the least crazy of the lot. But it still sounds pretty wacky.  FLATOW: I think it was John Wheeler - I remember interviewing him many years ago - saying, or maybe he was quoting Einstein - to say the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible.  Mr. DAVIES: Right, and this is a big point because human beings are not just observers. It's not like, you know, we're selecting our place in the universe because we just happen to be here observing it. We can understand it, too. It's comprehensible to us, and that's why I think there is deep link.  But I don't think that mind is just a trivial little embellishment, because why do we have to understand the universe? That suggests that our minds are linked in to the workings of the universe in a very deep way, and that's why I say fundamental. Not fundamental in some sort of - there's some spirit or anything like that, you know, just sort of pasted on. That's not what I meant. The first caller  seemed to misunderstand that.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Mr. DAVIES: I mean, fundamental in the sense of - the - of cosmic significance that the workings of the universe, as a whole, requires to understand it.  FLATOW: But you know, when you talk to scientists - and I talked to many of them - they all sway, they stay away from the question of why the universe seems strangely suited to life.  Mr. DAVIES: Yeah, they don't like it because it makes them feel very uncomfortable. I've just run through the alternatives on offer that you appeal to some external god who's unexplained - well, scientists don't like that; that there's an infinite number of universes -  well, they don't like that because it suggests that our theories of physics permits an infinite number of alternative realities. So they'd rather just describe this reality. And they, generally speaking, feel very uncomfortable with the idea of bringing observers into the picture, because physicists traditionally have tried to ignore mind, life and mind.  They feel the very essence of physics is to be objective, that everyone can agree doesn't matter how the observer's moving, what their stance is; it would all agree to a common set of results.  But at some stage, we must incorporate consciousness - or mind, if you like -into our description of the physical universe in a totally non-mystical way. The moment it's like sort of added on as an extra - most physicists trying not to think about it, but they think it rather as being of sort of something else - I would like to see our understanding of the conscious mind thoroughly integrated into physics, which means finding mechanisms that explain conscious experiences and how those experiences react back on the universe. And quantum physics, by general consent, seems to be the best way of getting at that connection.  FLATOW: Talking with Paul Davies, author of \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right for Life\" on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. A truly fascinating book in concept.

I'm Ira Flatow. A bit later in the hour: technology and global warming. But first, in the mid-1990s, there was a quiet revolution in breast cancer research. Scientists found two genes - BRCA1, BRCA2 - that if they had certain mutations dramatically increase the risk of breast cancer. Now, there are a handful of other genes that can be tested for as well. But this week, in papers and the journals Nature and Nature Genetics, several teams from around the world report the discovery of six areas in the genome that they believe to be linked to breast cancer. Those don't increase the risk of cancer nearly as much as the BRCA1 or two genes, but the researchers say that these regions may be found in many more women. Joining me now is Doctor David Hunter. He is lead author of one of the papers and a co-author of another. He's professor of cancer prevention at Harvard School of Public Health and epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. He joins us by phone from a conference in Albuquerque. Thank you for taking time from the conference to be with us, Dr. Hunter. Doctor DAVID HUNTER (Cancer Prevention Professor, Harvard School of Public Health; Epidemiologist, Brigham and Women's Hospital): Thank you. Glad to be with you. FLATOW: Well, then, tell us exactly what you found. These are not genes from cells per se, are they? Dr. HUNTER: Well, some of them variance in genes, some of them genetic regions that we use new technologies to scan the human genome for inherited variants that are associated with increased risk of breast cancer. And we identified some strong associations and confirmed one of these in three additional studies. The other groups concern additional genetic regions and the variance in those genes associated with breast cancer risk. FLATOW: And so what - what use do you make of this finding now? Dr. HUNTER: So at this point, I think the key thing to know is that there'll be more findings soon. We're using a new generation of technology that's been (unintelligible) by The Human Genome Project and the human (unintelligible) type map project that defines genetic variation around the world. And these new technologies allow us to look at gene variants that convey much lower degrees of risk than BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are the classic, very high-risk genes. And so, this is really the first reports of probably a series of reports as we really access these lower-risk genes for the first time. FLATOW: So are you saying you have a more sensitive task that brings out other risky genes that we might not have seen before? Dr. HUNTER: That's correct. It's basically - what we had to before was essentially look in families in which there was a very, very high burden of breast cancer. So by definition, the risks had to be very high for the variance from those genes in order to create those families with a very high burden. But most women with breast cancer either don't have a family history or just had a single family member who's been diagnosed with breast cancer and don't come from these very high-risk families. So the new generation of technology allows us to look at more than 500,000 variants across the genome and detect the location of these gene variants by screening thousands of women with breast cancer and thousands of women without breast cancer, but those women don't necessarily have to have a strong family history. FLATOW: 1-800 - 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Talking with David Hunter. Can you then theoretically continue screening and find even more variants that way? Dr. HUNTER: Almost certainly we will. These papers are really the first fruits of this new approach, and in our own study, we're actually calling deeper through the initial scan. We're taking large numbers of gene variants that are, well, weakly associated with breast cancer in the initial scan, seeing if they are associated in large studies. And it's very, very likely that there'll be more of these lower-risk variants discovered in the next months and years. FLATOW: You mentioned briefly about comparing them to the BRCA1 and two genes that really produced a significant increase in the risk of breast cancer. Can you give me an idea of one - something that you found - and compare it to the - to how they might compare to those two genes? Dr. HUNTER: Sure. So the variants that we found were in the gene called FGFR2, Fiber Glass Growth Factor Receptor 2, which wasn't really a gene that had been previously associated with at least inherited risk of breast cancer. And the risk variance there that we find are associated with about a 20-percent increase in risk if a woman carries a single copy and about a 60-percent increase in risk if a women carries two copies. And that compares with BRCA1 and BRCA2, where the risk increases more like 2,000 percent. So, we're comparing sort of a 1. 5 fold here with 20 fold plus with the BRCA1 and the BRCA2. The big difference is that the mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer in BRCA1 and BCA2 fortunately is fairly rare in the population. Less than one percent of the women in U. S. carry mutations on those genes, whereas now, we're finding genetic variants that actually the majority of women carry, but they give rise to a much more modest increase in risk. FLATOW: Did that give you - does that make you feel better that you find more of these variants in women, or does it make you feel worse that there might be more women at risk? Dr. HUNTER: Well, you know, we've known that breast cancer is a very common disease. About 11 percent of women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. So it's been very frustrating that through BRCA1, BRCA2, these very high-risk genes, we've only been able to explain a very small fraction of breast cancer risk. So this gives me hope that we're going to understand a much, much bigger piece of the inherited risk of breast cancer. And if we do that, we understand more about the mechanisms of beast cancer, and that may lead to better means of prevention and potentially treatments. FLATOW: At - at what point do doctors start, then, screening women for these other kinds of risk? Dr. HUNTER: Not yet - for two reasons. I think there'll be more variants soon, and it's only once we have the complete list of variants that we'll really be able to sensibly put them all on the table and work out which variants it would make sense to screen for in which combinations. That may only be two or three years away, but we're not there yet. The other reason is that we very rarely screen for risk of disease if there's no advise we can give that will then ameliorate that risk or alter that risk. And the real challenge here is, as we understand how better to sort out high from medium from lower risk for breast cancer - and in fact all common diseases - the real challenge is going to be then working out what advice we can give to allow people who are at high risk to reduce that risk, and that will require maybe several more years before we're really confident that we've got good evidence to give that advice. FLATOW: Penny in Redding, California. Hi, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. PENNY (Caller): Hi. Thank you for taking my call. I'm a registered nurse, and I've been working in the field for, like, 35 years. I recently took a course on oncology, and I have this wonderful little oncology nursing guidebook, and it says that breast cancer - the highest incidence was in Alamino County(ph) in the Bay Area and the second was Hawaii. And thinking what they might have in common is, like, World War II or a Navy chemical exposure. And I know they aren't testing people for how much exposures they get to these chemicals, and if they're in the air. And when I look at this book and I look under associated risk factors for all kinds of cancers, it's talking about vinyl chlorides, it's talking about I - you know, like radiation exposure, and nobody seems to want to talk about that. And I was wondering, you know, why that is, because my idea of how the genes work is that the genes are either turned on or turned off by what we're not quite sure. But, you know, it sounds like - by looking at this book - that it's chemical exposure that's doing it. FLATOW: Dr. Hunter? Dr. HUNTER: I think that that's a really good point. I mean, we know that environment and lifestyle are tremendously important for breast cancer and other diseases, and the data you refer to, which shows that in certain parts of the country, breast cancer rates are higher than other parts of the country has been a very, very active focus of research - the possibility exists that some of the pollution exposures that you refer to are maybe associated with breast cancer, but it's been very, very difficult to prove. And some of those geographic variabilities and risks have been shown to be due to different patterns of breast cancer risk factors that we do understand, like the age which a woman has her first child, the number of children, obesity, alcohol consumption. Those do vary around the country, and they do explain a substantial proportion of the geographic variability in breast cancer rates but not all. FLATOW: Thank you for calling, Penny. 1-800-989-8255. Is it appearing, as we - as we're able to probe the genome more and more, that cancers are having specific genes for certain cancers rather than, you know, a general gene for a lot of different cancers? Dr. HUNTER: That's pretty much what we're finding, and that raises a whole series of fascinating questions about why these gene variants are so organ-specific and may give us insight into the genesis of cancers at specific sites. FLATOW: Is it true that only 10 percent of all breast cancers are caused by genetic components? Dr. HUNTER: Well, that's the estimate for the - that's the upper end of the estimate for the, sort of, high-risk genes where there's a strong or at least present family history. The twin studies suggest that the proportion that's due to inherited genetic variation actually might be substantially higher and up to about 50 percent. But most of that risk is going to turn out to be these common but low-risk alleles, of which there may turn out to be before we're done\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. HUNTER: \u2026dozens, potentially even hundreds. FLATOW: So when you say before you're done, is that where you're headed next? Is that where you take this research? Dr. HUNTER: Exactly. So our group working with National Cancer Institute and the other groups internationally are really very well organized now to use these new technologies to comb through the genome to find these variants that are associated with these more modest degrees of risk. And then there's a whole other set of research opportunities. Basically, what's happening is that genes that we have no idea had really anything to do with cancer risks turn out to be involved. So we're very hopeful that this can open up whole new avenues of research into the causes of cancer. FLATOW: Well, Dr. Hunter, I want to thank you very much for taking time out of your busy week to talk with us. Dr. HUNTER: Thank you for having me on your show. FLATOW: And good luck to you. Dr. HUNTER: Thanks a lot. FLATOW: David Hunter is a professor of cancer prevention at the Harvard School of Public Health, and epidemiologist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. We're going to take a break and when we come back, we're going to talk about a new technology, a new way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We're going to talk about someone who is developing a technique to suck CO2 right out of the air like a vacuum cleaner. It's being developed now, and maybe that's how we can reduce CO2 levels. Just put this up around. We'll talk about it. Get your phone calls, our number 1-800-989-8255. Stay with us. We'll be right back. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  A bit later in the hour: technology and global warming. But first, in the mid-1990s, there was a quiet revolution in breast cancer research. Scientists found two genes - BRCA1, BRCA2 - that if they had certain mutations dramatically increase the risk of breast cancer. Now, there are a handful of other genes that can be tested for as well.  But this week, in papers and the journals Nature and Nature Genetics, several teams from around the world report the discovery of six areas in the genome that they believe to be linked to breast cancer. Those don't increase the risk of cancer nearly as much as the BRCA1 or two genes, but the researchers say that these regions may be found in many more women.  Joining me now is Doctor David Hunter. He is lead author of one of the papers and a co-author of another. He's professor of cancer prevention at Harvard School of Public Health and epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. He joins us by phone from a conference in Albuquerque. Thank you for taking time from the conference to be with us, Dr. Hunter.  Doctor DAVID HUNTER (Cancer Prevention Professor, Harvard School of Public Health; Epidemiologist, Brigham and Women's Hospital): Thank you. Glad to be with you.  FLATOW: Well, then, tell us exactly what you found. These are not genes from cells per se, are they?  Dr. HUNTER: Well, some of them variance in genes, some of them genetic regions that we use new technologies to scan the human genome for inherited variants that are associated with increased risk of breast cancer. And we identified some strong associations and confirmed one of these in three additional studies. The other groups concern additional genetic regions and the variance in those genes associated with breast cancer risk.  FLATOW: And so what - what use do you make of this finding now?  Dr. HUNTER: So at this point, I think the key thing to know is that there'll be more findings soon. We're using a new generation of technology that's been (unintelligible) by The Human Genome Project and the human (unintelligible) type map project that defines genetic variation around the world.  And these new technologies allow us to look at gene variants that convey much lower degrees of risk than BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are the classic, very high-risk genes. And so, this is really the first reports of probably a series of reports as we really access these lower-risk genes for the first time.  FLATOW: So are you saying you have a more sensitive task that brings out other risky genes that we might not have seen before?  Dr. HUNTER: That's correct. It's basically - what we had to before was essentially look in families in which there was a very, very high burden of breast cancer. So by definition, the risks had to be very high for the variance from those genes in order to create those families with a very high burden. But most women with breast cancer either don't have a family history or just had a single family member who's been diagnosed with breast cancer and don't come from these very high-risk families.  So the new generation of technology allows us to look at more than 500,000 variants across the genome and detect the location of these gene variants by screening thousands of women with breast cancer and thousands of women without breast cancer, but those women don't necessarily have to have a strong family history.  FLATOW: 1-800 - 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Talking with David Hunter. Can you then theoretically continue screening and find even more variants that way?  Dr. HUNTER: Almost certainly we will. These papers are really the first fruits of this new approach, and in our own study, we're actually calling deeper through the initial scan. We're taking large numbers of gene variants that are, well, weakly associated with breast cancer in the initial scan, seeing if they are associated in large studies. And it's very, very likely that there'll be more of these lower-risk variants discovered in the next months and years.  FLATOW: You mentioned briefly about comparing them to the BRCA1 and two genes that really produced a significant increase in the risk of breast cancer. Can you give me an idea of one - something that you found - and compare it to the - to how they might compare to those two genes?  Dr. HUNTER: Sure.

I'm Ira Flatow. A brief program note coming up on Monday - Neal Conan will be here for the discussion on where we should draw the line between political activism and domestic terrorism. Several members of a radical environmental group face sentencing as terrorists. Their supporters argue nobody got hurt; the government disagrees. Terrorism defined - that's Monday on TALK OF THE NATION. This hour, we're going to be turning to a different approach to reducing carbon emissions: going to a hydrogen economy. And when hydrogen is used and fuel cells are burned in a car, no greenhouse gases are emitted. But one of the stumbling blocks for using them in cars is the problem of getting the hydrogen to your filling stations. storing it there, then pumping it to your car. We don't have an infrastructure to do that, and people are not keen to the idea of driving around with a big tank of compressed hydrogen despite gasoline being much more dangerous and explosive, but that's another story. Well, hat if you could fill your car instead with a tank of water and make the hydrogen from the water right there in the car when you need it? Scientists at Purdue University say they have come up with a method to do that: metal pellets, which when dropped into water, release hydrogen. Joining me now is Jerry Woodall. He's a distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering and director of the Burton D. Morgan Center for entrepreneurship at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. He joins us from the studios of WBAA. Welcome to the program. Professor JERRY WOODALL (Electrical and Computer Engineering; Director, Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship, Purdue University): I'm glad to be here. FLATOW: Thank you. Is it as simple as what I described? Dr. WOODALL: Just about that. FLATOW: How do you get that to work? It seems like alchemy. Dr. WOODALL: Well, it's actually very simple high school chemistry. You know that we can use aluminum for lots of things. We can put it in the water and make boats out of it and cook with it. The reason you can do that is aluminum, in its natural state, has a thin native oxide on it that will prevent the water from getting to the core of it, and so the aluminum stays stable. So the oxide is the key to passiving(ph) aluminum. If that oxide were not there, it would split water readily, and - though what I've done is just merely added another element - in this case, gallium - on the group III part of the periodic table. And when you put that together with aluminum, it - the gallium acts as to prevent the oxide from forming or passiving on the surface so water will freely react to it - with it. The gallium itself is inert. The gallium itself cannot split water, although it can oxidize in air, so it's a good combination. So we can recover the gallium easily. The aluminum oxide, which is a product, can be easily recycled back to aluminum via commercial processes that are out there. We use them all the time to make new supplies of aluminum from bauxite. So, as far as I can tell, there are no showstoppers for this puppy. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: So, you know, I'm going to give you the question that I've been asked many times before - they ask a scientist when they say that - is if you're so smart, why ain't you rich? Dr. WOODALL: Ah. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. WOODALL: Now that is a good question. You just wait\u2026 FLATOW: Well, there's got to be a - well, describe. There's got to be a showstopper. Dr. WOODALL: Give me time. I'm only 68 years old, so I've got another 40 years to go. FLATOW: And you have a great track record. You've invented so many devices. You're not just a hydrogen guy; you invented the semi-conductor lasers that are in our CD players. You've invented transistors, components in solar cells. So people listen when you talk about something new, and I'm certainly interested to find out why. You know, you're at Purdue, this is something new - why hasn't anybody thought about this? And there's going to be a downside to it, or else somebody would have done it, right? Dr. WOODALL: You're right. You and I believe the same thing. There is nothing new under the sun. So let me tell you why this happened. When you think about it, people have thought about aluminum being a very energetic material in the past. So you can make aluminum powder. You can add a concentrated sodium hydroxide. There are all the kind of things you can do to make aluminum generate hydrogen; it's just they were not thought to be commercially or practically viable. This came about - in the discovery of my IBM lab back in 1967 when I was working on one of these compound semi-conductor projects that you were talking about. And I discovered that if I have a little liquid of gallium and aluminum together and add water to it, boom - I got hydrogen heat and aluminum oxide forming. It scared the hell out of me, so I went back to my office and spent a couple of hours, figuring out. And I finally figured, ah, yes, the aluminum atoms at the surface of the liquid metal see - oxygen, I'm sorry, water - they strip the -they pull the water apart and formed aluminum oxides. So in retrospect, it became very obvious that this would happen. But you ask yourself the question: who in their right mind are going to go around playing around with gallium or aluminum solutions when it's known that if I put gallium and aluminum, it makes the mechanical properties weak, and the main use for your aluminum at the time was its mechanic properties and not the chemical properties. FLATOW: So how far are we from making this practical? Dr. WOODALL: It depends on what you mean by practical. I think there are niche markets open to use to use it in a small scale. As you pointed out, the infrastructure is the big issue. I don't think there's any technical barriers. What has to happen is that both politics and the marketplace have to play a role here to move this thing along. I mean, there are no aluminum filling stations, just like there are only a very few - practically zero number of hydrogen filling stations. They're there to show people that you can actually use hydrogen. BMW, of course, has liquid hydrogen in their tanks to run that really fancy 750-H, I guess, they call it around Munich. And that's exciting, although I don't - I'm not wild about liquid nitrogen in the back of my car, just as - so I wouldn't want compressed hydrogen in the back of a car. So the thing is, this thing could - is going to be available, to answer your question specifically, in small applications. Like, we're considering making stand-by power units for medically fragile patients in the state of Indiana right now, and our business model is like that of Wal-Mart - you start a little store in Arkansas, you let it grow, and before Sears and Robuck(ph) and Penny can do anything about it, you have Wal-Mart's national - the biggest company in the world, practically. FLATOW: So see\u2026 Dr. WOODALL: Now I don't think we'll get there with this that way, but it's a start. FLATOW: But you can actually say, just add water\u2026 Dr. WOODALL: Right. FLATOW: \u2026and you've got what you\u2026 Dr. WOODALL: Just add water. FLATOW: \u2026just add water, and out comes the hydrogen. Dr. WOODALL: Tap water, to boot. It doesn't have to be very pure aluminum, it doesn't have to be pure gallium. So you get rid of the cost issues that way. FLATOW: Now what about recycling the product that you have left over once you've used up all of the hydrogen that's coming out? Do you have stuff to get rid of? Dr. WOODALL: Okay, so at the end of the day, at the process, you have hydrogen that you used, you have aluminum oxide - Al2O3, it is chemically. That you send back to the recycling plant, and they pass electric current through this, and it takes it back to the elemental form of aluminum. That process is currently - has an efficiency of 50 percent, which is pretty good. The Alcola folks think it will get to 75 percent in a few number of years. And so then I have to recover the gallium, but remember the gallium is a liquid, it's inert, and it doesn't get involved in the reaction, except there's a sort of like a catalyst to prevent the aluminum oxide from passiving the fuel. FLATOW: Ah, but aye, there's the rub. If you have to use electricity to recover it, don't you now again have to generate electricity in the process? Dr. WOODALL: Well, people tell me - yeah, but how do I regenerate dinosaurs? I don't know of a dinosaur form around right now\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. WOODALL: So you tell me. I mean, look\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. WOODALL: We can't violate - the laws of thermodynamics. FLATOW: Right. Dr. WOODALL: So you have to put more energy back than you get out. But so what? I'll use solar farms in the long haul. I can use wind turbines. And even - so economically speaking, if I use - if I co-locate aluminum recycling plant next to a nuclear power plant, I can recycle the aluminum oxide back to aluminum for two cents a kilowatt hour. And those are published numbers, so that makes the cost equivalent for the same amount of energy of aluminum about the same as gasoline. FLATOW: So you could do the same thing with a wind power plant - you could just bring the aluminum\u2026 Dr. WOODALL: Absolutely. FLATOW: \u2026to there, or so\u2026 Dr. WOODALL: Throw the dice, let her rip. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: You know, it sounds - we just did another segment with another scientist - maybe you were listening - who had his own idea\u2026 Dr. WOODALL: I was, though, but (unintelligible). FLATOW: You know, these things sound so good. They sound, you know, have you broached the government with this idea and maybe get some research funding for it, or do you not need it anymore? Why not private industry, go to Alcola or somebody like that? Dr. WOODALL: So that's really a good question. The answer is, I've done that. With all modesty, when you make a revolutionary breakthrough, it takes some time for the people around you are interested in this thing to accept it. So at this point in time, my colleagues at DOE are still pondering this thing over. I hope to be able to get some funding from them someday. But I also - one of - at my age, I would like to commercialize this thing, get it out there. I mean, it's not about money. I think it's that my grandchildren are actually going to be driving cars with this stuff in it. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. WOODALL: I predict that. FLATOW: So why not get the car companies involved in investing in this? Dr. WOODALL: Well, we will at some point in time. Remember, my role is to develop the fuel, so we have - there's a whole bunch of systems issues that need to be engineered that I need to put team - teams together to do this. But this stage of the project, I found something that's reproducible. It's real. You could come visit me in my laboratory, if you like, sometime. I'll give you a demo. I mean, it's not something you have to wait three or four days when the wind is right for it to work. It actually works every time. FLATOW: Let's go to the phones. Chris in San Francisco. Hi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. CHRIS (Caller): Yes, hi. Thank you. I just - I applaud the science and the progress that's going on here with technology, but I think this discussion needs to address limits in that we need to be limiting our emissions. Fundamentally, we need to stop developing technological excuses for so much auto and jet and other kinds of use that pollutes the environment so profoundly. And I guess what I want to contribute to this is that, you know, we need to remember that more cars on the road means more production of cars, which means more mining, which means more energy consumption and fossil fuel use for all the machines that are required to mine the metals and produce the rubber tires and all the things that go into - whether it's jets, cars, ships. You know, I'm not saying we're going to get rid of these things, obviously, but I think that, you know, the political solutions are critical in this, and we need to be talking about, you know, not just having some nice technological fixes. You know, and again, I applaud the science on this thing\u2026 FLATOW: Let me get a\u2026 CHRIS: By really trying to get the consumption of these fossil fuels and all the machinery that goes into that. FLATOW: Jerry? Dr. WOODALL: Yeah. Well, if this works out, there's plenty of aluminum on the planet. There's plenty of water. I mean, three-quarters of the planet is water, so this will work with salt water. So our missions are just water vapor out of the exhaust pipe. In fact, I have a picture of me over at the (unintelligible) labs with my nose on the exhaust pipe of an internal combustion engine. I'm still alive. So I claim that if we move to an aluminum economy and we use solar and other forms that don't heat up the planet, I'm not so much worried about green house; I'm more worried about the planet getting too hot. And so that's a longer haul thing, but we have to worry about it. So if we do all - if we make everything with hydrogen fuel, we don't add any more greenhouse gases to the planet, and we don't add extra heat to the planet. FLATOW: Talking with Jerry Woodall this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. So Jerry, you're basically saying if we move to a hydrogen-aluminum economy, we can make the hydrogen we need to from water. We can then recycle the aluminum and use solar or wind energy as the electrical source so we don't have to worry about pollution stemming from new production of hydrogen using fossil fuels. Dr. WOODALL: Right. FLATOW: And we can make enough of this to have a real impact. Dr. WOODALL: I think so. FLATOW: You think so. You know, things move slowly in this country or other countries. You know, in Europe, they think a lot greener than they do over here. Any interest over the air in\u2026 Dr. WOODALL: Well, I've - I have - I was in Singapore when the press release was released, and sort of seeing that it's not a big country, but I spent my evenings answering emails. I've got about 150 of these things from all over the world. I was really shocked about that. So this thing is getting pretty good coverage, so we'll see what happens as a result of this. FLATOW: Do you have a team working on this? Are you assembling\u2026 Dr. WOODALL: I have two students, a research scientist. I have a CEO that shows up at our meetings every week, and I have a few other consultants - informal consultants - at Purdue that work with me on this. So we're kind of a, you know, building this up from scratch, and hopefully more people will get interested in working with me on this. FLATOW: Let's see if I can get another call in - from David in San Jose. Hi, David. Quickly. DAVID (Caller): Hi. Yeah. I guess I'm just wondering how efficient is this process? How much hydrogen do you produce, and how much aluminum do you use? Is it like, (unintelligible) exact, like you have to use quite a bit of aluminum to make the hydrogen? And also, the second question back to what Ira said about, you know, it takes energy to make the aluminum. So how much does it actually take to make the aluminum originally versus also recycling it? So is there a net? You can't buy (unintelligible) access(ph). I mean, how efficient is the process in terms of energy use overall? Dr. WOODALL: Okay, I can answer that question. It turns out that two atoms of aluminum make three atoms of hydrogen gas - hundred percent efficient that way. So the only expenditure of energy is to bring the aluminum oxide back to aluminum. As I said earlier, that process is currently 50 percent. So when you consider fossil fuels and solar efficiencies of growing plants, which is about 10 to the minus four, I think 50 percent is a lot better than 10 to the minus four than growing plants. Of course, we have lots of land area - I won't argue that point - but still, this is one of the more efficient ways of making hydrogen, because the return process back to the aluminum is very efficient. FLATOW: Do we have to mine a lot more aluminum if we go to an aluminum economy? And is that going to add to the energy burden? Dr. WOODALL: Okay, that is a really good question. It turns out that the world has about a factor of two surplus capacity now. In other words, by the time they're finished making your Coke cans and other things you want to make with aluminum, now there's about 50 percent over capacity there. And if we were to use that, we could drive about - we could run about half the cars in the U. S. on that. So if you go worldwide, you want to get rid of all fossil fuels for energy - mobile energy applications, so yeah, we'll have to mine more, but there's plenty there to mine. FLATOW: And it won't upset the environment with all of the\u2026 Dr. WOODALL: No. FLATOW: \u2026energy it takes to mine it? Dr. WOODALL: No. FLATOW: No? All right, Jerry. Good luck. Thank you, Dr. Woodall, for taking your time to talk with us. Dr. WOODALL: Well, thanks for having me on the show. FLATOW: And we're always looking for new ideas and giving - you know, shining some light in those dark areas that never get any light for inventors and entrepreneurs like you. Thank you for taking time to be with us. Dr. WOODALL: Thank you. FLATOW: Jerry Woodall is distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering and director of the Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indian. I'm Ira Flatow in New York.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  A brief program note coming up on Monday - Neal Conan will be here for the discussion on where we should draw the line between political activism and domestic terrorism. Several members of a radical environmental group face sentencing as terrorists. Their supporters argue nobody got hurt; the government disagrees.  Terrorism defined - that's Monday on TALK OF THE NATION. This hour, we're going to be turning to a different approach to reducing carbon emissions: going to a hydrogen economy. And when hydrogen is used and fuel cells are burned in a car, no greenhouse gases are emitted.  But one of the stumbling blocks for using them in cars is the problem of getting the hydrogen to your filling stations. storing it there, then pumping it to your car. We don't have an infrastructure to do that, and people are not keen to the idea of driving around with a big tank of compressed hydrogen despite gasoline being much more dangerous and explosive, but that's another story. Well, hat if you could fill your car instead with a tank of water and make the hydrogen from the water right there in the car when you need it?  Scientists at Purdue University say they have come up with a method to do that: metal pellets, which when dropped into water, release hydrogen. Joining me now is Jerry Woodall. He's a distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering and director of the Burton D. Morgan Center for entrepreneurship at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. He joins us from the studios of WBAA. Welcome to the program.  Professor JERRY WOODALL (Electrical and Computer Engineering; Director, Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship, Purdue University): I'm glad to be here.  FLATOW: Thank you. Is it as simple as what I described?  Dr. WOODALL: Just about that.  FLATOW: How do you get that to work? It seems like alchemy.  Dr. WOODALL: Well, it's actually very simple high school chemistry. You know that we can use aluminum for lots of things. We can put it in the water and make boats out of it and cook with it. The reason you can do that is aluminum, in its natural state, has a thin native oxide on it that will prevent the water from getting to the core of it, and so the aluminum stays stable. So the oxide is the key to passiving(ph) aluminum.  If that oxide were not there, it would split water readily, and - though what I've done is just merely added another element - in this case, gallium - on the group III part of the periodic table. And when you put that together with aluminum, it - the gallium acts as to prevent the oxide from forming or passiving on the surface so water will freely react to it - with it.  The gallium itself is inert. The gallium itself cannot split water, although it can oxidize in air, so it's a good combination. So we can recover the gallium easily. The aluminum oxide, which is a product, can be easily recycled back to aluminum via commercial processes that are out there. We use them all the time to make new supplies of aluminum from bauxite. So, as far as I can tell, there are no showstoppers for this puppy.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: So, you know, I'm going to give you the question that I've been asked many times before - they ask a scientist when they say that - is if you're so smart, why ain't you rich?  Dr. WOODALL: Ah.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. WOODALL: Now that is a good question. You just wait\u2026  FLATOW: Well, there's got to be a - well, describe. There's got to be a showstopper.  Dr. WOODALL: Give me time. I'm only 68 years old, so I've got another 40 years to go.  FLATOW: And you have a great track record. You've invented so many devices. You're not just a hydrogen guy; you invented the semi-conductor lasers that are in our CD players. You've invented transistors, components in solar cells. So people listen when you talk about something new, and I'm certainly interested to find out why. You know, you're at Purdue, this is something new - why hasn't anybody thought about this? And there's going to be a downside to it, or else somebody would have done it, right?  Dr. WOODALL: You're right. You and I believe the same thing. There is nothing new under the sun. So let me tell you why this happened. When you think about it, people have thought about aluminum being a very energetic material in the past. So you can make aluminum powder. You can add a concentrated sodium hydroxide. There are all the kind of things you can do to make aluminum generate hydrogen; it's just they were not thought to be commercially or practically viable.  This came about - in the discovery of my IBM lab back in 1967 when I was working on one of these compound semi-conductor projects that you were talking about. And I discovered that if I have a little liquid of gallium and aluminum together and add water to it, boom - I got hydrogen heat and aluminum oxide forming.  It scared the hell out of me, so I went back to my office and spent a couple of hours, figuring out. And I finally figured, ah, yes, the aluminum atoms at the surface of the liquid metal see - oxygen, I'm sorry, water - they strip the -they pull the water apart and formed aluminum oxides. So in retrospect, it became very obvious that this would happen.  But you ask yourself the question: who in their right mind are going to go around playing around with gallium or aluminum solutions when it's known that if I put gallium and aluminum, it makes the mechanical properties weak, and the main use for your aluminum at the time was its mechanic properties and not the chemical properties.  FLATOW: So how far are we from making this practical?  Dr. WOODALL: It depends on what you mean by practical. I think there are niche markets open to use to use it in a small scale. As you pointed out, the infrastructure is the big issue. I don't think there's any technical barriers. What has to happen is that both politics and the marketplace have to play a role here to move this thing along.  I mean, there are no aluminum filling stations, just like there are only a very few - practically zero number of hydrogen filling stations. They're there to show people that you can actually use hydrogen. BMW, of course, has liquid hydrogen in their tanks to run that really fancy 750-H, I guess, they call it around Munich. And that's exciting, although I don't - I'm not wild about liquid nitrogen in the back of my car, just as - so I wouldn't want compressed hydrogen in the back of a car.  So the thing is, this thing could - is going to be available, to answer your question specifically, in small applications. Like, we're considering making stand-by power units for medically fragile patients in the state of Indiana right now, and our business model is like that of Wal-Mart - you start a little store in Arkansas, you let it grow, and before Sears and Robuck(ph) and Penny can do anything about it, you have Wal-Mart's national - the biggest company in the world, practically.  FLATOW: So see\u2026  Dr. WOODALL: Now I don't think we'll get there with this that way, but it's a start.  FLATOW: But you can actually say, just add water\u2026  Dr. WOODALL: Right.  FLATOW: \u2026and you've got what you\u2026  Dr. WOODALL: Just add water.  FLATOW: \u2026just add water, and out comes the hydrogen.  Dr. WOODALL: Tap water, to boot. It doesn't have to be very pure aluminum, it doesn't have to be pure gallium. So you get rid of the cost issues that way.  FLATOW: Now what about recycling the product that you have left over once you've used up all of the hydrogen that's coming out? Do you have stuff to get rid of?  Dr. WOODALL: Okay, so at the end of the day, at the process, you have hydrogen that you used, you have aluminum oxide - Al2O3, it is chemically. That you send back to the recycling plant, and they pass electric current through this, and it takes it back to the elemental form of aluminum. That process is currently - has an efficiency of 50 percent, which is pretty good. The Alcola folks think it will get to 75 percent in a few number of years. And so then I have to recover the gallium, but remember the gallium is a liquid, it's inert, and it doesn't get involved in the reaction, except there's a sort of like a catalyst to prevent the aluminum oxide from passiving the fuel.  FLATOW: Ah, but aye, there's the rub. If you have to use electricity to recover it, don't you now again have to generate electricity in the process?  Dr. WOODALL: Well, people tell me - yeah, but how do I regenerate dinosaurs? I don't know of a dinosaur form around right now\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. WOODALL: So you tell me. I mean, look\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. WOODALL: We can't violate - the laws of thermodynamics.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. WOODALL: So you have to put more energy back than you get out. But so what? I'll use solar farms in the long haul. I can use wind turbines. And even - so economically speaking, if I use - if I co-locate aluminum recycling plant next to a nuclear power plant, I can recycle the aluminum oxide back to aluminum for two cents a kilowatt hour. And those are published numbers, so that makes the cost equivalent for the same amount of energy of aluminum about the same as gasoline.  FLATOW: So you could do the same thing with a wind power plant - you could just bring the aluminum\u2026  Dr. WOODALL: Absolutely.  FLATOW: \u2026to there, or so\u2026  Dr. WOODALL: Throw the dice, let her rip.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: You know, it sounds - we just did another segment with another scientist - maybe you were listening - who had his own idea\u2026  Dr. WOODALL: I was, though, but (unintelligible).  FLATOW: You know, these things sound so good. They sound, you know, have you broached the government with this idea and maybe get some research funding for it, or do you not need it anymore? Why not private industry, go to Alcola or somebody like that?  Dr. WOODALL: So that's really a good question. The answer is, I've done that. With all modesty, when you make a revolutionary breakthrough, it takes some time for the people around you are interested in this thing to accept it. So at this point in time, my colleagues at DOE are still pondering this thing over. I hope to be able to get some funding from them someday. But I also - one of - at my age, I would like to commercialize this thing, get it out there. I mean, it's not about money. I think it's that my grandchildren are actually going to be driving cars with this stuff in it.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. WOODALL: I predict that.  FLATOW: So why not get the car companies involved in investing in this?  Dr. WOODALL: Well, we will at some point in time. Remember, my role is to develop the fuel, so we have - there's a whole bunch of systems issues that need to be engineered that I need to put team - teams together to do this. But this stage of the project, I found something that's reproducible. It's real. You could come visit me in my laboratory, if you like, sometime. I'll give you a demo. I mean, it's not something you have to wait three or four days when the wind is right for it to work. It actually works every time.  FLATOW: Let's go to the phones. Chris in San Francisco. Hi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  CHRIS (Caller): Yes, hi. Thank you. I just - I applaud the science and the progress that's going on here with technology, but I think this discussion needs to address limits in that we need to be limiting our emissions. Fundamentally, we need to stop developing technological excuses for so much auto and jet and other kinds of use that pollutes the environment so profoundly.  And I guess what I want to contribute to this is that, you know, we need to remember that more cars on the road means more production of cars, which means more mining, which means more energy consumption and fossil fuel use for all the machines that are required to mine the metals and produce the rubber tires and all the things that go into - whether it's jets, cars, ships. You know, I'm not saying we're going to get rid of these things, obviously, but I think that, you know, the political solutions are critical in this, and we need to be talking about, you know, not just having some nice technological fixes. You know, and again, I applaud the science on this thing\u2026  FLATOW: Let me get a\u2026  CHRIS: By really trying to get the consumption of these fossil fuels and all the machinery that goes into that.  FLATOW: Jerry?  Dr. WOODALL: Yeah. Well, if this works out, there's plenty of aluminum on the planet. There's plenty of water.

Later in the program, former Liberian President Charles Taylor faces war crimes charges. His trial starts today. But first, the number of violent crimes in the U. S. is on the rise for the second year in a row. It's the first time there's been an increase since the early 1990s - that news from an FBI report to be issued today. On Friday, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales announced he's sending federal agents to four cities to support local police in their efforts to curb the violence. There's plenty of speculation about why the increase is happening. Some say it's the increase in the youth population. Some say it's the release of more people from prison. Some Democrats say it's the lack of federal assistance to local law enforcement. Whatever the reason, violence - especially murder -causes scars that never heal. Today, we want to focus on a particular issue: the murder of teenagers, usually by other teenagers. In Chicago, at least 27 school-aged kids have been killed over the course of the school year. We're joined by two guests who see violent crime as a public health issue. Dr. Deborah Prothrow-Stith is the associate dean and professor of public health practice at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Gary Slutkin is a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health. He's the director of CeaseFire, a program that enlists inner city youth to stop violent crime before it happens. And also joining us is Juan Johnson, he's of the CeaseFire enlistees, also known as interrupters. Thank you all for joining us. Dr. GARY SLUTKIN (Professor, University of Illinois, Chicago School of Public Health): Thank you, Michel. Dr. DEBORAH PROTHROW-STITH (Associate Dean and Professor of Public Health Practice, Harvard School of Public Health): Good morning. Mr. JUAN JOHNSON (CeaseFire Violence Interrupter): Good morning. MARTIN: Doctor Slutkin, I'd like to start with you. That number, 27 school kids - that's more kids than were killed in Columbine. That's almost as many kids who were killed at Virginia Tech. Why is this happening? Dr. SLUTKIN: The 27, in fact, is only a small set of between 400 and 600 killings that are occurring annually here. And in cities throughout the U. S. , the numbers are in the hundreds in most cities. And the reasons are largely learned - are peer-directed pressure. And, in fact, this is - the turning point on our understanding of this issue is that we see this as learned behavior -model behavior that is driven by peers. People are expected to use violence if they see their friends doing it. And so no matter what the insult or disrespect or someone looked at someone's girlfriend or whatever, these are very, very normal events happening in the cities throughout the country. So the increases and decreases are rarely specifically attributable to any particular thing, unless you put into place specific interventions that are designed to reduce them. MARTIN: Okay. Dr. SLUTKIN: And that's what the CeaseFire program is designed to do. MARTIN: I want to hear more about it, but before we do that, you mentioned things like looking at somebody's girlfriend, or respect or disrespect. I think from a distance, a lot of people still have the view that these murders are related to things like the drug trade. Is that just not true, in your view? Dr. SLUTKIN: Well, there's a fraction of it that relates to that, but it's a minority. I mean, most of the disputes are someone is mad at someone else, and sometimes it's due to money, or sometimes it's due to disrespecting someone's group or a person or a relative. But these are largely interpersonal disputes. They frequently get characterized by law enforcement as gang events because people belong to organizations. I mean, just as in Iraq, people belong to Sunni or Shia groups, they belong - in Chicago or Los Angeles - to various groups. But the groups themselves are not illegal, and they're ordinarily just identification. So the issue is really whether there needs to be the use of violence or not, and that's the piece of it that needs to be specifically addressed. MARTIN: So having learned this behavior, it's your idea that people can unlearn it? Dr. SLUTKIN: Oh, absolutely. I mean, it's only a behavior. I mean, just like sexual behavior, eating behavior or exercise behavior, smoking behavior or seatbelt behavior, it's only a behavior. It's formed the same way all behaviors are formed, by modeling or copying what's going on around you - what your brother is doing, what your friends are doing, what they're doing in the neighborhood. And so it's reversible like the others are by interrupting events and by changing the social pressure. And there's some people who are better than others in changing social pressure. That's why we use people who used to be involved, who have a large amount of credibility, and they can influence people and change their minds and thinkings about it. MARTIN: Okay. Okay, let me bring in Dr. Prothrow-Stith. Dr. Prothrow-Stith, Boston went for two years without a youth homicide in the 1990s. How did you achieve that? What worked, and why did the streak of good fortune end? It's my understanding that Boston is also experiencing a spike in homicides. I understand that there are\u2026 Dr. PROTHROW-STITH: Right. MARTIN: \u2026something like 75 last year. So tell me what happened. Tell me what worked, and tell me what seems to have stopped working. Dr. PROTHROW-STITH: Sure. We are, in Boston, one of about 25 cities - and Chicago is as well - where the numbers have started going up. And our remarkable decline here in Boston I think was directly related to the accumulation of programs really helping children unlearn the violence. And I think that's an important point that Gary has just made, that, in fact, this is learned behavior and it's - in addition to peers encouraging each other, often the adults are encouraging and expecting this behavior. You have parents who say, you go back outside and fight or you - or I'm going to beat you up. And then you look what's in the movies and what we celebrate, and what we admire and what we glamorize. So there's so many messages that have in them these expectations that kids be tough - that they beat them up. And I think what happened in Boston is through classroom education, through youth outreach, through working with the police, through the clergy, through parents and tenants organizations. The city just started accumulating these programs to teach children other ways to handle conflict. And I think it's - the increase is directly resulted - a result of the cutback in those programs. MARTIN: Juan, you're one of the outreach workers that Dr. Slutkin refer to. You're an interrupter. Tell me what you do. How does it work? Mr. JOHNSON: Well, it's my job to try be on the street, get the pulse of the street, and seeing what might be in air. It's my job to either stop shootings before it happens, and if it does happen, try and prevent it from becoming -one shooting from becoming several and then becoming an all-out gang war. MARTIN: What - I mean, exactly what you do? You\u2026 Mr. JOHNSON: I do from simple mediation such as a - previously, we had this kid that called the 1-800 number and one of his friends had got shot, and he was being pressured to go retaliate that same Friday. And we got called into office to go talk to him because - I think, it was one of his family members brought him to the office, and we took him to the side and we spoke to him. We finally got to the truth, because he was already telling us everything from everybody. But we brought it out of him, and we mediated directly with him. And we kept him busy that same Friday. At the same time, we sent one interrupter to talk to the same group he was involved. And we took mediations from there also, because we have contacts with almost every street gang in Chicago. MARTIN: How did you deal with the whole question of loss of face that Dr. Slutkin was talking about earlier, this idea - and also Doctor Prothrow-Stith -the idea that this expectation arises that something happens, somebody's got to do something. If you don't do something, then, you know, it's on you. You have to live with this shame. How do you deal with that? Mr. JOHNSON: We tell them - we simply - why do you care about these people, what they think of you? If you go do it, if you go - get sent to the penitentiary, they're not going to come see you. They're not going to be there for you or your family. So why do you really care what these people think? Stop caring what these people think and stop caring what your - well, start caring what your loved ones think. MARTIN: Dr. Prothrow-Stith, you eluded to the fact - you said these programs you had in Boston were working, but then you said that there were cutbacks? What were the nature of the cutbacks? Why did that happened if these were successful programs? Dr. PROTHROW-STITH: Well, I think they happened both at the federal and state levels here. But an example, our street youth, or outreach workers - similar to the interrupters - numbered closed to 100 in the past, and now we are less than half of that and trying to get that number back up. It matters what we do with our children in the schools. It matters what we do with those who are out on the street and at higher risk. And this isn't really rocket science, Michel. This is just how do we, as a society, take care of all the children, not just the ones we know and love, and interfacing where there is a higher risk but also working early on to prevent that risk is where we fall short. As a society, we fund after the math, after the fact. We fund the intervention, the criminal justice, the prison, the major surgery, the hospitalizations, but we are so short on funding the programs that teach young kids how to handle the junk that happens to them, the conflict that occurs. And then, when we have children - we call them in the thick - who really have witnessed violence, have been victimized, are in disadvantage situations, we do vary little for them until they are ready to go to jail - I mean, until they have committed some horrible act and we're ready to spend $70,000 a year on them. So the ceasefire project in Chicago is an example of the way many cities are trying to address this, and I think the creative - put the person on the street, talking directly to the young people and figuring out what are the needs that are there. That's a kind of model that we need, and whether we do it early on, like big brother, big sister, when there's not a lot of risk, or later when they're out on the street - that's the kind of intervention we need. MARTIN: Dr. Slutkin, I began with you, I need to end with you. Do you think that most city officials accept your and Dr. Prothrow-Stith's framework for thinking about this? Because I think most people used to think this is a law enforcement problem. They would say, look, there's a failure of law enforcement here. There's a failure of investigation, of prosecution and commitment. Do you think your point of view is one that most people accept now, or do people just not buy it? Dr. SLUTKIN: I think it's coming. The main point here is that there - law enforcement can only catch you if you've crossed the line. And so then, once the event has happened, it's a failure. And our job is to keep people from crossing that line. I want to point out that over the last three years, there've been 900 of those types of interventions in Chicago that Juan just gave you one or two examples of, and the neighborhood that he's working in has an 82 percent drop in shootings and killings. They've gone from the range of 50 down to about nine, and the average amount of reduction that we're getting now is 45 percent shootings and killings down in the first year, and 60 percent after two to five years. And we've got two neighborhoods now that are in this. MARTIN: So\u2026 Dr. SLUTKIN: This is very specific intervention. MARTIN: Okay. Dr. Slutkin, we have to leave it there. Well, I think\u2026 Dr. PROTHROW-STITH: Michel, can I\u2026 MARTIN: I'm sorry, no, Doctor Prothrow-Stith. I think we're out of time. And we'd love to hear more from Juan in the future. Perhaps he could tell us more about how it actually works on the street. Thank you both all - I thank all of you for joining us. Dr. Deborah Prothrow-Stith is associate dean and professor of public health practice at the Harvard School of Public Health. She's the author of \"Murder Is No Accident\". She joined us from Harvard University. Also joining us from NPR's Chicago bureau, Dr. Gary Slutkin, executive director of Chicago Ceasefire, and Juan Johnson, an outreach worker. Thanks to all of you for joining us. (Soundbite of music) MARTIN: I'm Michel Martin. The conversation continues. This is TELL ME MORE form NPR News.  MICHEL MARTIN, host:  I'm Michel Martin, and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News.  Later in the program, former Liberian President Charles Taylor faces war crimes charges. His trial starts today. But first, the number of violent crimes in the U. S. is on the rise for the second year in a row. It's the first time there's been an increase since the early 1990s - that news from an FBI report to be issued today. On Friday, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales announced he's sending federal agents to four cities to support local police in their efforts to curb the violence.  There's plenty of speculation about why the increase is happening. Some say it's the increase in the youth population. Some say it's the release of more people from prison. Some Democrats say it's the lack of federal assistance to local law enforcement. Whatever the reason, violence - especially murder -causes scars that never heal. Today, we want to focus on a particular issue: the murder of teenagers, usually by other teenagers. In Chicago, at least 27 school-aged kids have been killed over the course of the school year.  We're joined by two guests who see violent crime as a public health issue. Dr. Deborah Prothrow-Stith is the associate dean and professor of public health practice at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Gary Slutkin is a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health. He's the director of CeaseFire, a program that enlists inner city youth to stop violent crime before it happens. And also joining us is Juan Johnson, he's of the CeaseFire enlistees, also known as interrupters. Thank you all for joining us.  Dr. GARY SLUTKIN (Professor, University of Illinois, Chicago School of Public Health): Thank you, Michel.  Dr. DEBORAH PROTHROW-STITH (Associate Dean and Professor of Public Health Practice, Harvard School of Public Health): Good morning.  Mr. JUAN JOHNSON (CeaseFire Violence Interrupter): Good morning.  MARTIN: Doctor Slutkin, I'd like to start with you. That number, 27 school kids - that's more kids than were killed in Columbine. That's almost as many kids who were killed at Virginia Tech. Why is this happening?  Dr. SLUTKIN: The 27, in fact, is only a small set of between 400 and 600 killings that are occurring annually here. And in cities throughout the U. S. , the numbers are in the hundreds in most cities. And the reasons are largely learned - are peer-directed pressure. And, in fact, this is - the turning point on our understanding of this issue is that we see this as learned behavior -model behavior that is driven by peers.  People are expected to use violence if they see their friends doing it. And so no matter what the insult or disrespect or someone looked at someone's girlfriend or whatever, these are very, very normal events happening in the cities throughout the country. So the increases and decreases are rarely specifically attributable to any particular thing, unless you put into place specific interventions that are designed to reduce them.  MARTIN: Okay.  Dr. SLUTKIN: And that's what the CeaseFire program is designed to do.  MARTIN: I want to hear more about it, but before we do that, you mentioned things like looking at somebody's girlfriend, or respect or disrespect. I think from a distance, a lot of people still have the view that these murders are related to things like the drug trade. Is that just not true, in your view?  Dr. SLUTKIN: Well, there's a fraction of it that relates to that, but it's a minority. I mean, most of the disputes are someone is mad at someone else, and sometimes it's due to money, or sometimes it's due to disrespecting someone's group or a person or a relative. But these are largely interpersonal disputes. They frequently get characterized by law enforcement as gang events because people belong to organizations. I mean, just as in Iraq, people belong to Sunni or Shia groups, they belong - in Chicago or Los Angeles - to various groups.  But the groups themselves are not illegal, and they're ordinarily just identification. So the issue is really whether there needs to be the use of violence or not, and that's the piece of it that needs to be specifically addressed.  MARTIN: So having learned this behavior, it's your idea that people can unlearn it?  Dr. SLUTKIN: Oh, absolutely. I mean, it's only a behavior. I mean, just like sexual behavior, eating behavior or exercise behavior, smoking behavior or seatbelt behavior, it's only a behavior. It's formed the same way all behaviors are formed, by modeling or copying what's going on around you - what your brother is doing, what your friends are doing, what they're doing in the neighborhood. And so it's reversible like the others are by interrupting events and by changing the social pressure.  And there's some people who are better than others in changing social pressure. That's why we use people who used to be involved, who have a large amount of credibility, and they can influence people and change their minds and thinkings about it.  MARTIN: Okay. Okay, let me bring in Dr. Prothrow-Stith. Dr. Prothrow-Stith, Boston went for two years without a youth homicide in the 1990s. How did you achieve that? What worked, and why did the streak of good fortune end? It's my understanding that Boston is also experiencing a spike in homicides. I understand that there are\u2026  Dr. PROTHROW-STITH: Right.  MARTIN: \u2026something like 75 last year. So tell me what happened. Tell me what worked, and tell me what seems to have stopped working.  Dr. PROTHROW-STITH: Sure. We are, in Boston, one of about 25 cities - and Chicago is as well - where the numbers have started going up. And our remarkable decline here in Boston I think was directly related to the accumulation of programs really helping children unlearn the violence. And I think that's an important point that Gary has just made, that, in fact, this is learned behavior and it's - in addition to peers encouraging each other, often the adults are encouraging and expecting this behavior.  You have parents who say, you go back outside and fight or you - or I'm going to beat you up. And then you look what's in the movies and what we celebrate, and what we admire and what we glamorize. So there's so many messages that have in them these expectations that kids be tough - that they beat them up. And I think what happened in Boston is through classroom education, through youth outreach, through working with the police, through the clergy, through parents and tenants organizations. The city just started accumulating these programs to teach children other ways to handle conflict. And I think it's - the increase is directly resulted - a result of the cutback in those programs.  MARTIN: Juan, you're one of the outreach workers that Dr. Slutkin refer to. You're an interrupter. Tell me what you do. How does it work?  Mr. JOHNSON: Well, it's my job to try be on the street, get the pulse of the street, and seeing what might be in air. It's my job to either stop shootings before it happens, and if it does happen, try and prevent it from becoming -one shooting from becoming several and then becoming an all-out gang war.  MARTIN: What - I mean, exactly what you do? You\u2026  Mr. JOHNSON: I do from simple mediation such as a - previously, we had this kid that called the 1-800 number and one of his friends had got shot, and he was being pressured to go retaliate that same Friday. And we got called into office to go talk to him because - I think, it was one of his family members brought him to the office, and we took him to the side and we spoke to him.  We finally got to the truth, because he was already telling us everything from everybody. But we brought it out of him, and we mediated directly with him. And we kept him busy that same Friday. At the same time, we sent one interrupter to talk to the same group he was involved. And we took mediations from there also, because we have contacts with almost every street gang in Chicago.

Is a medicine that's currently on the market safe? The drug in question is the popular diabetes pill Avandia. As NPR's Joanne Silberner reports, today's House committee hearing got mired in some of the finer points of evaluating drug safety. JOANNE SILBERNER: This was science and politics from the outset and it was not an easy mixture. In May, in the New England Journal of Medicine, a study concluded that the popular diabetes drug, Avandia, can cause heart attacks. The drug's manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline defended the drug. Yesterday, a new study sponsored by Glaxo was released, showing no problems with heart attacks. Today, California Democrat Henry Waxman chaired a hearing on Capitol Hill. At the outset, he admitted to some concern about raising a safety question that may not have answers. Representative HENRY WAXMAN (Democrat, California): I have struggled with the right tone for today's hearings. To diabetes is a serious illness and Avandia is an effective medication for lowering blood sugar. Sounding a false alarm about the dangers of the drug has a potential to cause serious harm to patients. SILBERNER: But then, the gloves came off. Republicans attack Steven Nissen, author of the study that linked Avandia to heart attacks. Representative Darrell Issa of California said Nissen was leaping to conclusions. Representative DARRELL ISSA (Republican, California): I believe that it is okay to look at something if it is a clear and present danger. That is not the case here. This drug is very much still effective and on the market for patients today and should not be artificially called into question as to its safetyness - safety, or side effects as a result of anecdotal information presented here. SILBERNER: Democrats jumped on the FDA. They wanted to know why the agency hadn't demanded more company research earlier, and they asked why it hadn't publicized the safety issue last year, when it got results from a Glaxo study that also linked Avandia to heart attacks. FDA head Andrew von Eschenbach. Mr. ANDREW von ESCHENBACH (Commissioner, Food and Drug Administration): We took the opportunity to recognize these - along with other information - were clues in any kind of detective game. But we had to look at all the clues, all the information, all the data. SILBERNER: Von Eschenbach said he doesn't think the verdict is in yet on the drug. Even so in his prepared testimony, he announced that two days after Nissen's study was published, the agency told the drug maker to put a special warning on the drug's label. As the hearing wore on, Republican Darrell Issa got into an argument with Nissen on how the study was done. The Congress member was bothered that Nissen left out six studies, where no heart problems were seen in either group. Nissen said he have to. It's how that type of study is done. Rep. ISSA: You left it out, didn't you. Dr. STEVEN NISSEN (President, American College of Cardiology): Mr. Issa, you can't calculate an effect size when there are no events. Rep. ISSA: Okay. SILBERNER: And the arguments over numbers went on and on. For those doctors and patients wanting to know whether Avandia is safe, Nissen said more research is needed. Dr. NISSEN: What would need to be done is an adequately sized, long-term trial probably in fairly high-risk patients, comparing Avandia to other therapies. Now unfortunately because such a trial doesn't exist, it would not be completed for probably about another seven years. SILBERNER: With no statistics that every one could agree on, several Republicans accuse Nissen of trying to bring down a drug company working to help diabetics. Democrats accuse Republicans of demagogueing the issue, and the FDA announced that it will ask a group of medical experts to evaluate Avandia at an advisory committee meeting, July 30th.

I'm Rebecca Roberts. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Throughout military history, advances in technology - from internal combustion engines to airplanes to robotics - have changed war strategy and affected war outcomes. In Iraq and Afghanistan, advances in body armor and battlefield medical treatment mean more soldiers are surviving their wounds. ROBERTS: But more of those survivors are amputees, which have highlighted a somewhat lagging technology, prosthetic limbs, especially arms. Historically, artificial legs have advanced more rapidly, in part because there's a bigger commercial market for legs. But also, the human arm is an incredible design challenge. Now, funded by the U. S. Defense Department, a huge international team of engineers and scientists is hoping to revolutionize prosthetic arms technology. The ultimate goal is to build a strong lightweight arm that's actually controlled by the amputee's thoughts. The project's home base is at Johns Hopkins University. Mr. BOB ARBITER(ph) (Johns Hopkins University): And this is literally what the patient's able to do through their EMG control. They can actuate all the different degrees of freedom, wrist flexion/extension, wrist rotation. And as actually for this hand, there's two different types of grasps. ROBERTS: Bob Arbiter works with the computer program that reads the patient's nerve impulses as the amputee imagines moving his or her arm. Mr. ARBITER: Just ask the patient to do what feels natural, literally move their phantom limb. And we're just going to take sort of a snapshot of what the signals look like. It's called pattern recognition. Literally, the computer is learning what the patient is trying to do, so it can recognize those. When it sees the signals again, it can command the arm to perform that way. ROBERTS: As sites for revolutions go, the applied physics lab at Johns Hopkins is an unlikely one. In a nondescript gray office building between D. C. and Baltimore, the lab is littered with plastic body parts and machine shop spec sheets. It's an unusual collaboration of more than 30 labs, universities and private companies, authorized to the tune of $30 million so far by DARPA, the usually secretive Defense Advance Research Projects Agency. Matt Kozlowski is one of the lead engineers. Mr. MATT KOZLOWSKI (Lead Engineer, DARPA Program): It is so darn neat, the technologies that are enabling this thing and the work that's being pulled in from all these collaborators all over the world. These people are the finest in their field and we're having the opportunity to work with them and take some of the things that they've been developing and actually put them to good use. ROBERTS: And they're making a huge step forward. One way, they're sending signals from the amputee's brain to the prosthetic arm through neuroconnectivity, involves a special surgery. First, the nerves from the patient's shoulder that used to run down the arm have to be rerouted to the patient's chest, once again connecting those nerves with healthy muscle. The arm itself is non-invasive. Electrodes can be placed on the amputee's chest to pick up electrical impulses from the tiny contractions of the muscle and move the prosthetic arm. Stuart Harshbarger, who heads the project for Hopkins, showed us a video of a double amputee named Jesse Sullivan using the lab's first prototype. Mr. STUART HARSHBARGER (Project Manager, Applied Physics Lab, Johns Hopkins University): It's one of my favorite clips of Jesse, stacking checkers. So, you know, even though he got this - first came, you know, pretty close. You know, it wasn't perfect so that will give him a little bit of a hard time about it. But then, you know, as you watch he very precisely placing it the second time around, he's not wanting to give up. He's pretty happy with himself and like, you know, and rightly so that's pretty precise movement and also, you know, pretty smooth movement actually in terms of moving that from there to there. ROBERTS: Jesse Sullivan was a civilian electrical lineman who lost both arms in a work-related accident. Amazingly, the system not only sends Jesse's thoughts to the robotic arm, the arm sends sensation back. Jesse could actually get a sense of grip. Mr. HARSHBARGER: We have a sensor in the prosthetic limbs system and as he grips an object, that amount of force is actually communicated to the little black device we call a tactor and it provides little pressure sensation in this area that he already perceives naturally as is coming from the ball of his hand. So he actually perceives that as if it's coming from the - his hand itself. ROBERTS: He can tell how tightly to hold a plastic cup, for instance, to keep from crushing or spilling it. The lab began this project by studying the limits of currently available prosthetics. The most cutting-edge one available now is called the myoelectric arm. It responds to muscle movements in the amputee's stump. If the patient moves a shoulder muscle a certain way, the elbow bends for instance. Another muscle contraction makes the hand move. And the myoelectric arm is heavy, around 14 pounds, so patients find it hard to learn and cumbersome. In fact, when this lab wanted a myoelectric arm to study, they found one on eBay, put up for sale by someone who had lost patience with the technology. Researchers talked to several amputees with similar frustrations and have returned to a lower-tech simple hook, or learn to live as a one-armed person. Another limitation of current arms is degrees of freedom, engineering speak for movement. Your arm has more than 30 degrees of freedom, from flapping your shoulder to giving a thumbs up. Current prosthetic arms have three. This lab's first prototype had eight. Prototype II will be a bigger leap. Mr. HARSHBARGER: We're going from eight degrees of freedom to 27. ROBERTS: Again, project manager Stuart Harshbarger. Mr. HARSHBARGER: And we're going from 11 pounds, for eight degrees of freedom to another 10 and half or so down to, you know, maybe something lower than nine. So we're continuing to drive, function up and reduce the overall weight. ROBERTS: The lead engineer on the second prototype is Tom van Doren(ph). He picks up a key component - a shiny metal cylinder a few inches long with wires protruding from it, which will form the shoulder. Mr. TOM VAN DOREN (Lead Engineer, Johns Hopkins University): This shoulder here is designed to match the size of a 50th percentile female shoulder and give the force of a roughly a 50th percentile male. So this particular piece that I have in my hand has what we refer to as two degrees of freedom, which means two motions, to bring your arm up forward out in front of you and then to bring your arm up to the side like you were doing a Jumping Jack. ROBERTS: And a 50th percentile female is what, about 5-foot-4? Mt. VAN DOREN: I'm not sure what her height is. I probably can quote the length of her humerus and the length of her fingers, but very small when you're designing the mechanical components. I think we are - all the mechanical engineers were very surprised when we finally started getting our components back from the machine shop at just how small they are. The weights of this device for the two shoulder components that we have here is very similar to the human arm, and we'll achieve speeds and forces that are very similar to the human arm. So that right there is the challenge for Proto II - was getting the force out of this arm and the load capacity out of the arm in the same size and mass as a human arm. We're not good enough mechanical engineers to design something that beats the human arm or trying to meet it. ROBERTS: Of course, these stubborn design challenges are like catnip for mechanical engineers. It's working with amputees like test patient Jesse Sullivan that get them back in the lab day after day. Matt Kozlowski was lead engineer for Prototype I. Mr. KOZLOWSKI: To see Jesse there as a bilateral amputee without anything on, and just seeing his chest, his torso, and realizing that he can't do anything without the assistance of a device such as this, it really is amazing because he can't open a doorknob, he can't go and get a drink out of the water fountain, things that you and I take for granted on, you know, completely, daily. When Bob and I sat there in the field and worked with Jesse and realized, you know, he'd been sitting there for an hour and a half and he haven't even drink, you know, you'd need to give him a drink because he can't do it himself, and that, sort of, brought it all home as far as how important some sort of advancements in prosthetics are. The key for the program is in the utility and neurologically interfacing it so that it's really a viable technology. You know, we can make robots all day long, but the reality of it in terms of usability, it's probably where we're going to make our breakthroughs and revolutionize to state-of-art. ROBERTS: Prototype II is due for completion in July. And assuming all goes well, in the fall, DARPA will sign off on another $25 million to $30 million to take this project to completion in 2009. The ultimate goal: FDA approval of an arm that weighs about seven pounds that can pick up a 50-pound weight, maybe even type; an arm that will really help people return to their daily lives.  REBECCA ROBERTS, host:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Rebecca Roberts.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  And I'm Robert Siegel.  Throughout military history, advances in technology - from internal combustion engines to airplanes to robotics - have changed war strategy and affected war outcomes. In Iraq and Afghanistan, advances in body armor and battlefield medical treatment mean more soldiers are surviving their wounds.  ROBERTS: But more of those survivors are amputees, which have highlighted a somewhat lagging technology, prosthetic limbs, especially arms.  Historically, artificial legs have advanced more rapidly, in part because there's a bigger commercial market for legs. But also, the human arm is an incredible design challenge.  Now, funded by the U. S. Defense Department, a huge international team of engineers and scientists is hoping to revolutionize prosthetic arms technology. The ultimate goal is to build a strong lightweight arm that's actually controlled by the amputee's thoughts. The project's home base is at Johns Hopkins University.  Mr. BOB ARBITER(ph) (Johns Hopkins University): And this is literally what the patient's able to do through their EMG control. They can actuate all the different degrees of freedom, wrist flexion/extension, wrist rotation. And as actually for this hand, there's two different types of grasps.  ROBERTS: Bob Arbiter works with the computer program that reads the patient's nerve impulses as the amputee imagines moving his or her arm.  Mr. ARBITER: Just ask the patient to do what feels natural, literally move their phantom limb. And we're just going to take sort of a snapshot of what the signals look like. It's called pattern recognition. Literally, the computer is learning what the patient is trying to do, so it can recognize those. When it sees the signals again, it can command the arm to perform that way.  ROBERTS: As sites for revolutions go, the applied physics lab at Johns Hopkins is an unlikely one. In a nondescript gray office building between D. C. and Baltimore, the lab is littered with plastic body parts and machine shop spec sheets. It's an unusual collaboration of more than 30 labs, universities and private companies, authorized to the tune of $30 million so far by DARPA, the usually secretive Defense Advance Research Projects Agency.  Matt Kozlowski is one of the lead engineers.  Mr. MATT KOZLOWSKI (Lead Engineer, DARPA Program): It is so darn neat, the technologies that are enabling this thing and the work that's being pulled in from all these collaborators all over the world. These people are the finest in their field and we're having the opportunity to work with them and take some of the things that they've been developing and actually put them to good use.  ROBERTS: And they're making a huge step forward. One way, they're sending signals from the amputee's brain to the prosthetic arm through neuroconnectivity, involves a special surgery. First, the nerves from the patient's shoulder that used to run down the arm have to be rerouted to the patient's chest, once again connecting those nerves with healthy muscle.  The arm itself is non-invasive. Electrodes can be placed on the amputee's chest to pick up electrical impulses from the tiny contractions of the muscle and move the prosthetic arm. Stuart Harshbarger, who heads the project for Hopkins, showed us a video of a double amputee named Jesse Sullivan using the lab's first prototype.  Mr. STUART HARSHBARGER (Project Manager, Applied Physics Lab, Johns Hopkins University): It's one of my favorite clips of Jesse, stacking checkers. So, you know, even though he got this - first came, you know, pretty close. You know, it wasn't perfect so that will give him a little bit of a hard time about it. But then, you know, as you watch he very precisely placing it the second time around, he's not wanting to give up. He's pretty happy with himself and like, you know, and rightly so that's pretty precise movement and also, you know, pretty smooth movement actually in terms of moving that from there to there.  ROBERTS: Jesse Sullivan was a civilian electrical lineman who lost both arms in a work-related accident. Amazingly, the system not only sends Jesse's thoughts to the robotic arm, the arm sends sensation back. Jesse could actually get a sense of grip.  Mr. HARSHBARGER: We have a sensor in the prosthetic limbs system and as he grips an object, that amount of force is actually communicated to the little black device we call a tactor and it provides little pressure sensation in this area that he already perceives naturally as is coming from the ball of his hand. So he actually perceives that as if it's coming from the - his hand itself.  ROBERTS: He can tell how tightly to hold a plastic cup, for instance, to keep from crushing or spilling it. The lab began this project by studying the limits of currently available prosthetics. The most cutting-edge one available now is called the myoelectric arm. It responds to muscle movements in the amputee's stump. If the patient moves a shoulder muscle a certain way, the elbow bends for instance. Another muscle contraction makes the hand move.  And the myoelectric arm is heavy, around 14 pounds, so patients find it hard to learn and cumbersome. In fact, when this lab wanted a myoelectric arm to study, they found one on eBay, put up for sale by someone who had lost patience with the technology. Researchers talked to several amputees with similar frustrations and have returned to a lower-tech simple hook, or learn to live as a one-armed person.  Another limitation of current arms is degrees of freedom, engineering speak for movement. Your arm has more than 30 degrees of freedom, from flapping your shoulder to giving a thumbs up.

Scientist have turned skin cells in mice into stem cells. If it works in humans, it could be a big deal for stem-cell research, research that could find a cure for illnesses such as diabetes and Parkinson's. And it would bypass a hot bioethical debate, using human embryos for that research. Meanwhile, the House votes today on freeing up more money for human embryo research. NPR's science correspondent Joe Palca joins us now with all these details. Hi, Joe. JOE PALCA: Hi, Madeleine. BRAND: First, Joe, tell us about this new research. Scientists were actually able to turn skin cells into stem cells? PALCA: That's right. Turns out that some earlier work showed that there were some genes that seemed to control the fate of cells in terms of whether they can be like embryonic stem cells. And you remember, embryonic stem cells are those cells that can turn into any cell in the body. And so after experimenting with a bunch of different genes, some scientists in Japan found four that seemed to do the trick, that seemed to transform an adult cell into a cell that behaved a lot more like an embryonic stem cell. And now there's a series of papers coming out today that had replicated that and shown that, yes, indeed these stem cells are, even though they came from skin cells, they're indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells that were derived from embryos. BRAND: So the idea being that any old cell on any part of your body could become a stem cell. PALCA: Right. That's the cool thing because right now the way they get embryonic stem cells is they take them from an early developing embryo. And of course, that's not such a problem for most people when you're talking about mice or pigs or something like that. But when you're talking about a human embryo, destroying a human embryo, that's the problematic part that's made this such a controversial issue. BRAND: So what does it mean then if this research comes out saying, well, we can use skin cells maybe or maybe sometime in the future, what does it mean then for the debate over embryonic? PALCA: Well, I mean, it short-circuits it. It's really amazing. People who are very, very much opposed to this research as it exist today and say, you know, we just can't go forward with it at all because it means destroying an embryo, and aren't even happy with President Bush's decision to allow some limited federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research, those same people now say I don't see a problem; it's not the cells we object to, the embryonic stem cells, it's not them that give us a moral problem, it's the way they're obtained, and if you can obtained them without destroying an embryo, well, their argument, that argument goes away for most people. BRAND: But the problem is, Joe, as I understand it, that these are mice skin cells, not human skin cells. So. . . PALCA: Well, Madeleine, you've hit on an extremely important point, and it is not trivial to say that mice are not humans. And the things that they did to make these mice cells turn into embryonic stem cells would not work in humans. They already know that these particular genes are not the ones that are going to need to be switched on in human embryonic stem cells. But also, the way they did it, they used various techniques of infecting them with viruses and turning on certain genes that you wouldn't want turned on because they're actually causing cancer. But they say okay, can we do it at all? Now they've shown they can do it at all and then the trick is, well, can we apply it to humans and can we make it safe in humans? And that's huge. It's a huge challenge. It might come soon, might not. But it would be wrong to think that this is one step away from being the breakthrough that people are hoping for. BRAND: NPR's Joe Palca.

I'm Michele Norris. We're going to take a trip to South Dakota now where the buffalo still roam, especially at Custer State Park in the Black Hills. The park has one of the nation's biggest buffalo herds. But park officials say tourists are getting a little too comfy around these massive creatures, animals that can run up to 40 miles an hour and turn on a dime. From the Black Hills, Jim Kent reports. JIM KENT: South Dakota is known for its wide-open spaces, Crazy Horse Memorial and buffalo. More than a million people come here to the Black Hills each year to see the buffalo herd at Custer State Park. Twelve hundred buffalo roam the park's rolling 70,000 acres in an environment where visitors can almost reach out and touch them. But South Dakota resident Cal Earhart(ph) says that's the last thing you want to do. Mr. CAL EARHART: They're just one of nature's marvelous things and that's what the park here is all about, for instance. You don't want to bother them because you can't do anything; a buffalo is going to do what he wants to do. And secondly, you want to just look at them, and they're marvelous animals. KENT: Of course, the definition of just looking at them is open to interpretation by some of the visitors. It's a rainy day in the Black Hills. Birds are chirping. The air's a little damp. It's just the start of the tourist season, so there aren't that many visitors trying to find the buffalo today. But Custer State Park official Gary Brundige says that'll change with the busy summer season. Mr. GARY BRUNDIGE (Wildlife Biologist, Custer State Park): The thing that we see happen that really needs to be cautioned against is if you're going to be watching the buffalo is to stay close to your vehicle, because those animals can go from placidly grazing on grass to chasing you down in a matter of seconds, much quicker than anybody ever could believe. KENT: Brundige says each summer, there are numerous encounters between buffalo - weighing a ton or more - and tourists that result in injuries. Those injuries range from cuts, bruises and broken bones to a fatality a few years ago. Mr. BRUNDIGE: This was a situation down by the corrals. And one old bull came around the corner that wasn't in the trap, and everybody except one gentleman, one old gentleman, got back in their cars, which was the right thing to do, and he stayed out there and ended up, unfortunately, getting himself between the fence and this old bull. And the old bull,  as it went by, basically, it just turned and it was just a quick hook of the head and, you know, 2,200-pound bull caught him somewhere down, I guess on the inside of the leg and just kind of split him open. KENT: Non-fatal encounters occur for the same reason. Some tourists treat the buffalo like big furry pets. But the warnings don't just come from the park staff. Oklahoma native, Lane Kendrick, has been the guest artist and residence at the park for the last four years. Ms. LANE KENDRICK (Guest Artist, Custer State Park): And I'm familiar with what people do around buffalo\u2026 KENT: Tell me. Ms. KENDRICK: \u2026unfortunately. Well, we had one lady that tried to put her child up on the back of the buffalo to have pictures or - and another gentleman that went up tried to pet him, and the gentleman was chased. But you can't walk up to any of them. They're not - they're quite wild. KENT: Hello. Unidentified Man: Hey, how are you? KENT: Good. How are you guys? Unidentified Man: Very well. KENT: You guys going to do some touring around in the park today? Unidentified Man: We think so. KENT: Rangers and even the park's gate attendants say when encountering buffalo anywhere, keep a good distance between you and the animal - yards not feet, preferably from inside your vehicle. And should you see a buffalo staring at you with its tail raised, retreat as quickly and calmly as possible. For NPR News, I'm Jim Kent in South Dakota's Black Hills.

When scientists first began to decode the human genome, the big news was and still is, in many ways, the genes, parts of the DNA that held the blueprint for creating all our parts of our bodies or malfunction to create disease. And the race was on to find the genes that cause diabetes or cancer or depression. The bits between the genes, the repeating sequences that didn't seem to do anything, were referred to as junk DNA and not really worth anything. But the genes, it turns out, make up only a small part of the genome, and scientists are learning that much of that so-called junk DNA may play a major role in regulating how the not-junk DNA or regular DNA is expressed. And this week, a consortium of researchers from around the world released a study looking at a sample of that junk DNA. And joining me now to talk about what they found is John M. Greally - he is assistant professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, and he's here with in our New York studio. Thank you for coming in today. Dr. JOHN M. GREALLY (Epigenomics and Human Disease, Albert Einstein College of Medicine): Thanks for inviting me. FLATOW: So the junk is not really junk after all? Dr. GREALLY: It'd be a very brave person who would call it junk at this stage. FLATOW: Why? Dr. GREALLY: Well, even before this study, when people were looking at small areas of the genome, the regions that were neighboring the genes that we knew were doing functional things like producing the red pigment in our red cells to carry oxygen - what they realized was that there were - some of these sequences that were not genes were actually responsible for switching on or off the gene expression. So we knew that it wasn't all junk, but this is the first study to kind of formally look at a large region of the genome and be systematic in research. FLATOW: And did you discover that that was the function of the so-called junk DNA, switching the other DNA on and off? Dr. GREALLY: They found a lot of different things in this particular study, but possibly the most interesting one was the ability of the DNA that was neighboring the genes to have a regulatory role. There are - it seems like there's a lot more happening in the genome than just the expression of these genes. FLATOW: And this is most of what's in the genome (unintelligible)\u2026 Dr. GREALLY: That's exactly right. FLATOW: Give us some idea of how much of it is not that normal DNA we think of. Dr. GREALLY: Well, if you were to try to visualize this, it would be like driving on a highway. And every time you pass an exit, it's like a snippet of the gene, an exon of a gene as we'd call it. Most of the time, we're on the highway; we're not at exits. And in fact, the genome is very like that. About 96 percent, conservatively, of the genome is not genes, so it's a little bit of a shock, I think to realize just how much of it is stuff that we don't understand. FLATOW: Would this switching function and the presence of this other kind of DNA explain things that we've seen everyday life but really couldn't, you know, explain before about how things work, like why somebody gets a disease while somebody does not get disease. Dr. GREALLY: Yeah. There are a couple of ways of looking at this. One is that these sequences that sit between the genes or beside the genes are determining which genes should be switched on or off in a specific cell type because the DNA itself is the same in a liver cell or a muscle cell or a brain cell, but the exact repertoire of genes that we switch on or off in each of those cell types differs. And those instructions are mediated by these sequences that live nearby. In terms of disease, that - this is where it gets very interesting - because some of the recent studies that were performed, for example, to look at large numbers of patients with adult diabetes, they realized that there were certain genes that looked like they were associated with the disease, but when you look at their results, you realize that a lot of the changes that they were seeing in the DNA sequence were not in the genes themselves, they were nearby. And it's - you know that those sequences are very associated with diabetes. You're much more likely to see it in a diabetic individual than somebody else. But the precise function, the way that it might be causing the diabetes, is still a mystery. FLATOW: Do we have a name for this DNA, instead of calling it none or other or something? Have scientists given these genes a name and the sequences or these parts? Dr. GREALLY: It depends on their function, and this particular study didn't really try to assign a function to the sequences. The study was really to try to identify the subset of this 96 percent that might be doing something functionally. When you start studying these in more detail, which would presumably be a follow-up study, some of these sequences act to increase the local gene expression, and they would be known as enhancers. Others tend to dampen down local gene expression. They would be known as silencers or perhaps repressors. And there are others that have this amazing property where if you have two genes side by side and you want to regulate them independently, the sequence in between will actually act as an insulator, and that's how they are referred. FLATOW: Could these genes - whatever we're calling them now - might have great influence in early embryology? Dr. GREALLY: Absolutely. FLATOW: I mean, things on and off - might that be a good place to study what they do? Dr. GREALLY: Yes, definitely. Yeah. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. GREALLY: It's already known that there are huge changes in the expression of genes during early development. There have been human malformation syndromes - things where children have been born with, you know, limb problems or problems with the - the formation of their brain - where the events have occurred out in the wilderness between the genes but not in the genes themselves. So clearly, that is going to be a very important area. FLATOW:  But we inherit these as the same way we inherit the other. Dr. GREALLY: It all comes as one package, one long string of DNA. It has all the intervening stuff and the genes. FLATOW: And so this may add a whole new layer of complexity; things are not as simple as we thought they used to be. Dr. GREALLY: Absolutely. And a further layer of complexity is when you impose epigenetics on top of that, which is an area of interest to a lot of people at the moment. FLATOW: Well, explain what that is. Dr. GREALLY: Yeah. What the ENCODE guys were doing - the consortium was doing -they were looking to see where the sequences are located that might be doing something. But having found those sequences, the - something has to mediate their role, and the broad group of regulatory mechanisms, biochemical mechanisms that do something to those sequences, have been loosely referred to as epigenetic. And what can happen at those sites is that sometimes, the epigenetic regulators can have one pattern that might be associated, perhaps, with strong activation of a gene nearby. And sometimes, it may have a different pattern where it may actually have exactly the opposite effect. And the reason that this becomes particularly interesting is that it's this epigenetic regulation that is our means of responding to the environment and to noxious stimuli and basically reorganize the way that we express genes in a way that will allow us to adopt to our environment. FLATOW: What does this mean for genetic testing? We do genetic testing - there are home genetic kits coming on the market. We're in an era where now we know what your genome is. Doesn't that make these genetic tests really inadequate? Because it may show you you have the gene, but we may not know if it gets -ever gets switched on or not by another gene. Dr. GREALLY: If you have a mutation in a gene, the gene is dead or the gene has got a problem. So it doesn't matter if the local regulatory mechanisms are acting inappropriately or not. Thinking very simplistically, you can put gas in the tank, you can put new brake pads on, but if the engine is blown, it's not going to go anywhere. And the engine, in this case, would be the gene, so it doesn't matter what you do nearby. However, in terms of the issue of DNA testing, what it does is it broadens the opportunities available to us. It may be that we are able to start focusing on these sequences that have regulatory functions in between the genes, look for the sequence changes that are occurring there, and actually be able to understand that they are as important as the changes in the genes and thus be able to do something predictive and accurate with our patients. FLATOW: So you'd have to look to those also. You just couldn't say you have this gene for, let's say, breast cancer or something. And you - you have to have the activator gene that might also turn on or switch it off. Dr. GREALLY: Well, the\u2026 FLATOW: That may be a bad example because of the\u2026 Dr. GREALLY: Yes. FLATOW: PrCA(ph). Dr. GREALLY: It's actually not a bad example in term of another type of cancer, which is colon cancer. There are some familial cases of colon cancer where these are very unfortunate families. The individuals get a very difficult type of cancer to diagnose, and they get it early in life, and it's called hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer. And that is due to mutations, generally, in a gene called MLH1. But recently, there was a very intriguing report where the gene was perfectly healthy. There was no mutation in either copy of the gene that this individual had. But what they had instead was a change in the regulation of the gene, so it was silenced. And it is important in this instance because it illustrates that silencing of both copies of the gene is as devastating to the cell or to the body as mutations of both of those copies. FLATOW: This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, talking with John Greally, assistant professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. So we're talking about rethinking the human genome with these - with these genes, these helper genes, the switcher genes, all kinds of genes. Well, maybe our listeners will come up with a name for what we can call the whole group of genes. Let's go to Jessica in Denver.  Hi, Jessica. JESSICA (Caller): Hi. Nice to be on the show. FLATOW: Hi. Thank you. JESSICA: I was just going to point out that the idea there may have been junk DNA in the first place seems quite absurd to me. It seems as if shortly after the genome was mapped, that James Watson has formulated some sort of language for the genome, and it was quite simple at first. But after a year of the scientific discovery, we have discovered that the genome can play a lot of tricks on us, that things aren't initially what they first appear. And we are still discovering things like that every day. It seems like most mappings of the genome play a very important part in the human body. FLATOW: Dr. Greally? Dr. GREALLY: Jessica, I think it's a fair point that there's a lot more complexity to the genome than we have realized up to now. I think even Dr. Watson was probably surprised at how little of the genome-encoded genes and -you know, we've had to deal with that in terms of our emotional well-being. But at the end of the day, the challenge is not to throw our hands up and say we don't understand the challenges, to say all of this material is out there in the genome. It's there to be understood. Let's tackle the problem. And that's what this - that's why this recent publication was such a landmark that these guys went after it systematically. FLATOW: Well, you bring up a good point. If only just a few percentage of the genome encodes for genes, and let's say 95 - could be a 98 - yeah, 95 percent of it is these other kinds of genes? Dr. GREALLY: Other kinds of sequences. FLATOW: Sequences. Dr. GREALLY: Yeah. FLATOW: And we haven't encoded those? Dr. GREALLY: We haven't figured\u2026 FLATOW: And we haven't - so we haven't figured - it's like the universe. We don't know what 95 percent of the universe is. We don't know what 95 percent of this other dark - it's called the dark genes, you know? Dr. GREALLY: People have referred to it as the dark matter, the genome. FLATOW: Yeah. So our work has just begun. Dr. GREALLY: It's a good thing if you're - if you're in this line of business. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: I mean, here we've been celebrating the deciphering of a human genome, but we haven't deciphered now, and now we see how important to know what it is - 95 percent of the genome. Dr. GREALLY: If we didn't have the Human Genome Project, we wouldn't have this problem. So the Human Genome Project was a great foundation for discovery. And now, we're going to take that one step further. FLATOW: What made this breakthrough possible? Dr. GREALLY: The usual combination, intellectual curiosity and technology. It would have been very difficult to do this about 10 years ago.  But there have been advances in technology that allow you to look at lots and lots of DNA sequences simultaneously, and particularly in areas such as microarray technology which is quite popular in the field at the moment. And because of the fact that people start to get clever about how they could use these microarrays and sequencing technologies, that, in particular, was a breakthrough. FLATOW: Was there one sequence that lit a light bulb up in someone's head and said, whoa - we can't explain it any other way but these dark genes? Dr. GREALLY: There - not in this particular project. This particular project was most notable for the sheer number of sequences it was pulling in simultaneously. So we have a bit of information overload to deal with. FLATOW: And so now, the work will go on to decipher. Dr. GREALLY: Absolutely. FLATOW: Are there any - could - how long do you think it would take? How many years? Dr. GREALLY: Well, through my retirement, I guess. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: You're going to look very old. There's other - there's a lot of work to be shared and done by everybody. Dr. GREALLY: Absolutely. But it's an accelerating pace, so being a typical, cautious scientist, I'm not going to put a number on it. FLATOW: And we won't force you. Thank you for taking time to be with us. Dr. GREALLY: Thank you for inviting me. FLATOW: John M. Greally is assistant professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine right here in the Bronx in New York. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: Have a great weekend. I'm Ira Flatow in New York.  IRA FLATOW, host:  And now, we're changing gears for the rest of the hour - reading between the genes. When scientists first began to decode the human genome, the big news was and still is, in many ways, the genes, parts of the DNA that held the blueprint for creating all our parts of our bodies or malfunction to create disease. And the race was on to find the genes that cause diabetes or cancer or depression. The bits between the genes, the repeating sequences that didn't seem to do anything, were referred to as junk DNA and not really worth anything.  But the genes, it turns out, make up only a small part of the genome, and scientists are learning that much of that so-called junk DNA may play a major role in regulating how the not-junk DNA or regular DNA is expressed. And this week, a consortium of researchers from around the world released a study looking at a sample of that junk DNA. And joining me now to talk about what they found is John M. Greally - he is assistant professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, and he's here with in our New York studio. Thank you for coming in today.  Dr. JOHN M. GREALLY (Epigenomics and Human Disease, Albert Einstein College of Medicine): Thanks for inviting me.  FLATOW: So the junk is not really junk after all?  Dr. GREALLY: It'd be a very brave person who would call it junk at this stage.  FLATOW: Why?  Dr. GREALLY: Well, even before this study, when people were looking at small areas of the genome, the regions that were neighboring the genes that we knew were doing functional things like producing the red pigment in our red cells to carry oxygen - what they realized was that there were - some of these sequences that were not genes were actually responsible for switching on or off the gene expression.

I'm Ira Flatow. We are in a revolutionary period where being tiny is very big, where atoms and molecules can be shaped, formed, mass produced to produce almost anything we want - from clothing, to the detergents that clean them; from cars, to the wax we shine them with; from drugs, to baseball bats, to tiny self-assembling biocomputers small enough to flow through your bloodstream. Nanotechnology is already all around us. And no one knows that better than Cornell University's NanoScale Science and Technology Facility. The lab turns thirty this week, and like all good academics, they threw a symposium to celebrate. Maybe they hoisted a few beers, we'll find out about that. And as we talk about it this hour with some of the scientists who gathered in Ithaca, New York, to talk about what they've accomplished and what lies ahead the future of nanotechnology, the field of nanomedicine. And how to grapple with these social and ethical issues surrounding a technology that has the potential to change the way we live, but with consequences that scientists don't yet fully understand, like what potential problems - what are those problems of having countless billions of nanoparticles inhaled, swallowed, or slathered on our skins? Do we know what effect they may have on our health, or in the environment? As landfills pile up with used and discarded nanowaste - old baseball bats, tennis rackets, skincare products, clothing, and on, and on, and on - where do all these nanoparticles go? So if you like to join our discussion, give us a call. Our number is 1-800-989-8255. 1-800-989-TALK. And as always, you can surf over to our Web site at sciencefriday. com. Let me introduce my guests, who join me today from the Cornell studios in Ithaca. Barbara Baird is the Horace White professor of chemistry in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell. Welcome to the program. Dr. BARBARA BAIRD (Horace White Professor of Chemistry, Department of Chemistry & Chemical Biology, Cornell University): Thank you. It's good to be here. FLATOW: You're welcome. Rosalyn Berne is an associate professor in the Department of Science, Technology and Society in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Welcome to the program. Professor ROSALYN BERNE (Associate Professor, Department of Science, Technology and Society, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, University of Virginia): Thank you. FLATOW: You're welcome. Larry Goldberg is senior engineering advisor in the Division of Electrical, Communications, and Cyber Systems at the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Virginia. Welcome to the program. Dr. LARRY GOLDBERG (Senior Engineering Advisor, Division of Electrical, Communications, and Cyber Systems, National Science Foundation, Arlington, Virginia): Thank you very much. FLATOW: You're welcome. John Silcox is the David E. Burr professor of engineering in the School of Applied and Engineering Physics at Cornell University. Welcome to the program, Dr. Silcox. Dr. JOHN SILCOX (David E. Burr Professor of Engineering, School of Applied and Engineering Physics, Cornell University): Thank you very much. Glad to be here. FLATOW: I just want to remind everyone that nanotechnology is really a relatively new field, but you guys at Cornell's NanoScale Facility have been doing it for 30 years. It's your 30th anniversary week. Dr. SILCOX: Oh, yes. We were nano before. . . FLATOW: You guys got on - you got out there ahead of the crowd. Dr. SILCOX: Yeah. We were nano before nano was cool. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Well, what did you know that no one else did? Dr. SILCOX: Oh, we were just beings responding to stimulus that I think the National Science Foundation gave us. And we submitted proposals seeking support for a facility that they had in mind, only, I think we made the mistake of looking for a very wide range of applications in actually one facility. And so that's how it all started. FLATOW: Larry Goldberg, the NSF has invested a lot of money and a lot of effort in nanotechnology, has it not? Dr. GOLDBERG: Yes, it has. And this is one investment, which we're particularly proud of because it dates back some 30 years, if you will, to 1977, an era when one really was talking about structures on micrometer scales, not yet shorter dimensions. But that investment has grown over the years to now a network of user facilities in which Cornell is a participant. That really served the broad science and engineering and technology sector in this new burgeoning field. FLATOW: Barbara Baird, let's talk about one of the most interesting fields of nanotechnology and that is nanomedicine. Let's talk about some of the advances in this field. Care to pick one out to begin with? Dr. BAIRD: Well, I'd like to take a step back from that and talk about nanobiotechnology, which underlies nanomedicine. FLATOW: Sure. Dr. BAIRD: And it's a recent thrust out from this main trunk of advances in micro and then nanotechnology. And the recognition - again, I'd like to think that Cornell was ahead of the game in the NSF - with the NSF support and stimulus to take some of the advances that had come about through development of electronics to smaller and smaller length scales to recognize that it was now possible to address biology at its most fundamental length scales - the molecular length scales of macromolecules, proteins, DNA and so forth, that make up the workings of cells, that make up the workings of organs and tissues and so forth. And so a lot is going on, both to examine these systems at this fundamental length scale to draw from the lessons of biology and the nanotools and technologies that have been going on for a long time in a working system. And with this understanding, hand in hand, developing new ways of engaging biology to intervene in pathological cases and perhaps, to make up for things that are missing in certain biological systems related to medicine. FLATOW: Mm hmm. John. . . Dr. BAIRD: So. . . FLATOW: I'm sorry, go ahead. Dr. BAIRD: No, I was just going to say that there's a lot going on. Maybe, a lot of the attention is directed towards what are the medical advances, but underlying that is a huge area of the interface between micro and nanotechnology and biology. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. What would you say is the hottest field then in nanomedicine at this point? Dr. BAIRD: Well, there's several possibilities. . . FLATOW: Pick one out for us. Dr. BAIRD: Okay. Well, let me just pick two. . . FLATOW: Pick two. Dr. BAIRD: . . . because they go in different directions. One is the diagnostic area - being able to detect diseases at very early stages before symptoms are manifest. And the other is more in the treatment area, such as in particles that can sense and deliver drugs, and then sense the recovery or the effects of the drugs. And then, there'd be regenerative medicine after that. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Rosalyn Berne, you have been interviewing nanotechnology scientists as part of your research. What are some of the things they're working on? Prof. BERNE: You're asking me, specifically in the laboratory, the kind of research they're doing? FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Prof. BERNE: Well, one of the more fascinating projects for me was learning about a device that scrapes the inside of the mouth, picks up the cells, puts it into a box, and ideally, then, lays out in terms of genetics, what diseases might be present. As a diagnostic tool, I think it's been referred to as Doc in the Box. I've spoken with people who are interested in various specific diseases of the brain. There are people interested in new materials and how those might be applied in a computing environment. Such a wide range of research - nano is not so much about anything in particular, more, how we approach further mastery of the material environment, whether it's through materials themselves, or chemical processes, or energetic reactions. It's more about scale is what I've learned. I've spoke with 35 different scientists in various fields, from biotechnology, to physics, to engineering science. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Do these scientists think of the social and ethical issues that may pop themselves up in their work? Prof. BERNE: Oh, this is a question I was hoping you would ask, because I think that they would like to be able to think about these things, talk about these things, but there are two immediate problems. One is that it's really difficult to do it without making it feel personal. So what I found as an initial reaction is well, these are fascinating questions but, of course, I don't need to ask them of myself, because I'm doing the best I can and I believe I'm doing the right thing here. I'm trying to solve serious problems. I'm trying to address cancer and human suffering. And so I don't understand what the ethical issues might be for me. But of course, my colleague down the hall, perhaps there's something they need to think about. The other thing I learned is that there are very few fora for actually dialoguing about this. The pressure to get work done, to get grants, to get reports into publications, to keep labs open and stocked and grad students moving through - only now am I beginning to see actual opportunities for these kinds of dialogues and questions to be asked between and among scientists and engineers. FLATOW: So there are sort of this - as the stereotypical scientist might do trying to avoid talking - thinking themselves about what their own ethical issues may be? Prof. BERNE: I wouldn't want to judge them in that way. I think it's more that the structure is not there in the training necessarily. It's just coming to be. It's - well, what was delightful was that once we close the door and sat down and began to talk, what I found were individuals who were full of reflection and ideas and concerns. And they were quite excited to be able to talk about them. A common comment was, when will you come back? I don't often have the opportunity to think about and talk about these things. So it's less about defending and buffering; more about the opportunity needs to be present in an open kind of forum where there are no accusations. And I think, unfortunately, sometimes with ethics, the presumption is that there's a right and a wrong and we want to see and make sure that you're doing it correctly. In the scale of nano investigations, it's not so simple. Dr. GOLDBERG: I would comment from the NSF perspective. We are trying to encourage in our research grant activities that the students are being trained, be exposed to ethical conduct of research as well as those working in the fields touching on nanotechnology, looking at societal and ethical implications. FLATOW: Well, Dr. Goldberg, what - name one ethical complication that they would be talking about for example. Dr. GOLDBERG: If you're in a laboratory environment and are conducting a series of process steps and there is strict health and safety standards, and you see a colleague who's avoiding those, perhaps, to speed up the process, question is, do you talk with that colleague? Do you report the colleague? Do you simply walk away from it? These are the considerations that people need to give in their conduct of research. Dr. SILCOX: In one of our centers, we have a series of lunchtime seminars that's intended for the students in which in fact ethical and all sorts of general questions are actually addressed. One of those lectures, I remember, was - there was a case of ethical misconduct about Bell Labs, about three or four years ago. Dr. Kendrick Cheung(ph) and one of the members of the committee that investigated the allegations and - which resulted in fact in a discovery that something that well over 20 papers needed to be withdrawn, came and gave a seminar and interacted with the students after the seminar. So we do make an effort to try and deal with this, but maybe not enough. FLATOW: Well, we'll talk more about it. We have quite a bit of time, and taking questions from our audience. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break. I'm Ira Flatow, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about nanotechnology with a special 30th anniversary symposium and, I guess, celebration going on at Cornell University's NanoScale Science and Technology Facility where our guests are coming from. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. And we're talking with - we were last talking to John Silcox, who is the David E. Burr professor of engineering in the School of Applied and Engineering Physics at Cornell University. Dr. Silcox, one of the things driving accomplishments in this field - and in all fields, you have to have these advances and the tools that you use. What kind of great advances do we see happening in nanotechnology that are allowing it to move forward, and allowed it to begin with? Dr. SILCOX: Well, the drivers certainly are the issue of trying to get new applications and, if you're a scientist, an academic scientist, then you're interested in new information. And I think the tools are the key things that actually limit how far the drivers can go. One of the interesting things that I heard in the first lecture in the symposium was the sort of the growth in an imprint technology. Typically, we do nanostructure by doing lithography - I, taking pictures on a sample - on a thin film using that as a resist to pattern and create the structures that we have. Optics and electrons are the kinds of typical tools that one is using. Electrons are effectively thin films, sized small, tiny beams that are scanned and duplicating what one sees on a computer screen. That becomes expensive, and one builds master pictures for that. The other side of the game is to get the cheap things coming out, and the cheap things are when we do the photography, the lithography techniques, then we can multiply - make many copies and do them at a very low cost. The new thing that seems to be coming through is an imprint lithography technique in which one impresses and creates a master and a mold, and one creates things of that nature. Those seem to be able to take us down to the nano scale, but it's a long way, in fact, from taking that technology now and creating new things. The insight, I think, that I brought away from that particular talk was a question, which is, how does the world want to nanocompute in a nanotechonology era? This is at a small scale. We're going to be looking at new forms of doing the computation. It brings - a lot of things have to be developed in order to take this. The most promising era, I think, is one that's going to have a compatibility with a seamless technology, which is what we've been using all along. But there are other possibilities that are coming out. As far as advances in the instrumental tools, the ability, perhaps, to go even further with electrons is one that excites me and that we have finally, after something like 60 years, begun to see solutions to the problem of making our lenses better. So that's one that looks as though on a long range that might improve the shorter range, I think, of the new ways of designing how computers are going to compute and do their job. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Barbara Baird, we talked recently on SCIENCE FRIDAY about biocomputers, these tiny devices that are actually constructed from DNA and RNA and proteins that researchers hope will be able to read a cell's signals and pick up the signs of trouble right before they manifest themselves as diseases. Do you think nanomedicine will change how we diagnose medical condition? Dr. BAIRD: I think there's no question about that. And part is that - I mean, it's driven by the availability of these tools, and the goals are to be able to look at smaller amounts of complex, physiological fluids and be able to test for a variety of conditions with a fairly simple and fast test. And so that, no question, will enable faster diagnoses in field test, in the military or in undeveloped countries. All of these things should become available and ultimately cheap and very thorough in terms of diagnostics. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. How much of nanotechnology is being investigated by corporations themselves instead of the university for making products? And I ask all of you. You know, we've seen cosmetic companies making sunscreens and women's makeup and we have seen everything from nanowax for cars - the list can go on and on and on - baseball bats, tennis rackets, things like that made out of nanomaterials. It's seems like the consumer industry has almost taken over the field? Dr. BAIRD: Well, I'll speak to that first, I guess. I think what all of those products that you described are based on materials, and it's a development of better materials and being able to make more finely controlled materials, allows you to control them in terms of lightness, strength and so forth. And so that certainly, there has been and will continue to be in a big investment in that and it will continue to improve. I think the big companies are more cautious in the more difficult, challenging devices, which are multifunctional to do certain things especially in biological or medical types of context. That's a much more ambitious and risky undertaking. And certainly small companies are beginning to probe some of these things that the big companies, I think, are waiting for them to be developed a little by the small companies, would be my idea. FLATOW: That's how it's always happened. Dr. GOLDBERG: I think you'd see the innovation in this area coming often from the individual of investigators, small companies, new startups who have an idea that they want to test further. And here's where I think the Cornell and other facilities that are being supported across the country have a really important enabling role in that they provide, if you will, a prototyping laboratory for these new ideas with the equipment that is needed to test out what really could become a commercial product. And if the U. S. is to remain ahead in many of the fields today, it's through innovation and new products that are going to come about by this type of research. Dr. BAIRD: And I would just add to that, what Larry said, is that not only is the innovation and this sort of the ideas taking the first step towards some type of device, but also the training of the students to think in this way, to think across disciplinary boundaries, to work together to bring these ideas to fruition. FLATOW: Let's go to the phones. 1-800-989-8255, to Scottsdale, Arizona. Is it Navine(ph)? NAVINE (Caller): Navine. Yes. Good afternoon, Ira. FLATOW: Hi there. NAVINE: Thank you for your wonderful show. It's always interesting. I had two questions. First of all, do you use testing on animals? And the second one would be, if you don't, would this enable science, maybe, not to use testing on animals anymore through the computer, being able maybe to facilitate that? FLATOW: In other words, do you test new nanoparticles or products on animals like you would a new drug, if you were making one? NAVINE: Right. Yeah. Or, any testing on animals. FLATOW: Dr. Baird, any? Dr. BAIRD: Well, I think that would be ultimately regulated by the FDA for types of materials that would be used for medical purposes. But one of the things that happens in the academic labs is as these materials are being developed or devices, is to test them on cell lines, not animals, but cells that have - are immortal, that you can continue to grow and then you can -began to test the effects on toxicity and so forth on cells. And as I was saying earlier, part of the excitement about nanotechnology is that this can be used to understand how cells work on the most fundamental levels and ultimately, how organisms work. And with that level of information, you can design more and more sophisticated computer programs or software that more realistically reflect what the response would be to a particular type of product, a drug or a nanoparticle or anything. So this really is - would be based on the fundamental research, and then would ultimately develop into something that you could hope would resemble a real animal response. FLATOW: Okay. Thank you for calling. NAVINE: Thank you. FLATOW: Do we know how safe nanomaterials are? I mentioned at the beginning how many countless billions, trillions - put a number on it - of these particles are now out everywhere, and we are virtually sniffing them in and eating them and not, you know, unknowingly consuming them. They come off our clothes, off our products. Sometimes, they might even be in our water. How much - and from the research that I have in front of me, looking at the amount of research that's going on, I know the NSF, for example, is also funding research on nanoparticles, it doesn't appear to be, to me at least, that there's a great percentage of the money invested in nanotechnology, invested in the health and possible environmental consequences of what might happen here? Dr. GOLDBERG: I think, Ira, there is a significant investment being made at the federal level in order to study these questions and develop the basic science underlying them in order to have informed policy making. And at the NSF, we have invested in science and technology centers that deal with biological environmental nanotechnology several years back. And we've had continuing grant competitions in partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, looking at the science issues in this field of risk. So, I think the federal government is placing an emphasis on this aspect. FLATOW: Dr. Baird, do we know what the long-term effects are? I mean, they haven't been around very long, this nanoparticles. Dr. BAIRD: Oh no, we don't, of course. Any time something new comes along, you're not sure what long-term effects are. I wouldn't place these in too different a category than drugs. And as the regulation - regulatory agencies already exist, these things are tested. And there may be unintended consequences, but I don't think there's any more reason for alarm in these cases than there are in other developments of technology. But one - a point I wanted to make is that with the investment of the federal agencies in nanotechnology, there has been from the very beginning a concern that this aspect be considered. I have served on a number of advisory committees, both with the NSF and the NIH, and together with the consideration of what new products, what new research, what new frontiers can be addressed, has been the consideration, or how can we deal with the unintended consequences? How can we be alerted to those as early as possible? So, that we can head those off. Prof. BERNE: This is Rosalyn speaking. It seems to me, however, that we have products in the marketplace, perhaps prematurely not knowing, in fact, what effect they might have. There is some ambiguity - perhaps consumers are willing to live with those ambiguities because of the convenience those products provide. Anecdotally, I was in a laboratory at - I will not name the institution - where a senior investigator who's been working for many years was speaking with me, and I asked her, are you concerned about protecting the well-being of your students you all work with carbon nanotubes? And she said, what can we do? We just - we work with what we have. We don't know that much. We're interested to investigate these problems and these questions. I hope we will be well. So, I think there's a great amount of faith that we will be well, that we are doing what we can to learn what we can, that we're willing to take some risks because the studies are not definitive yet. Some of them - to my knowledge -are really just beginning. FLATOW: This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about nanotechnology, the future of it. We're talking up until the break - coming break about the safety of nanoparticles and concerns about it. There's a news article that's coming out of the University of Missouri in Columbia of a study that is funded by the NSF about silver nanotechnology particles. And one of the professors of civil and environmental engineering at the College of Engineering says silver nanoparticles are emerging as one of the fastest-growing nanomaterials with wide applications. It goes on to say currently, little is known about the adverse effects of silver nanoparticles to human health and their fate in ecological systems. And these are some of the things - not just, I guess, the health of what happens in the immediate, what you're wearing or inhaling in your factory or home, but what happens when we fill up these landfills, or we have nanoparticles that are might making their way into water filtration systems, things like that. We don't know what's going to happen to these particles, do we? And that's one of the reasons people are studying it. Obviously, people are concerned about it. Dr. GOLDBERG: The July issue of Consumer's Report actually carries some issue on nanotechnology. And one of the things I was interested to learn from that particular issue was that, in fact, the FDA has been approached by a number of organizations to try and address, in particular - I think, it came up over a problem with this - or a perceived problem with the silver nanoparticles, that they have actually now formed a nanotechnology task force to see whether in fact they should be, I assume, to see whether they should be much more heavily involved in this. I think what we're seeing is an agency that is beginning wake up to the fact that we have some things that they should, perhaps be looking at there. So, my sense says that perhaps we're getting some action on a federal level. One would also like to ask what is happening with some of the NIH. I think there's an institution, institute for occupational safety and health, and I would assume that they were, they need to be involved in generating research in this area, and I think they have been. FLATOW: Ah, John. . . Dr. BAIRD: That would be the national. . . FLATOW: I'm sorry. Dr. BAIRD: Excuse me, I think that would the National Institute on Environment Health and Safety. Dr. SILCOX: Occupational. . . Dr. GOLDBERG: Occupational health and Safety. Dr. SILCOX: Ah Yes. FLATOW: John Silcox, is this something that worry about in your lab? Dr. SILCOX: I certainly make sure - try to make sure that we have plenty of, you know, that the students are very careful about how they're dealing with these things. I'm not sure that I particularly worry that we're discarding a great number of these nanoparticles, but I don't because I don't think we are. They tend to dry up. They sort of coagulate eventually after we're finished using them, and that they're effectively, sort of, gone-go back into a form in which they can be reasonably, and easily discarded appropriately. But - so, that sort of looking at my particular lab, we do worry about it, and we talk about it. But, I'm not sure that we've seen much that we should be doing what we aren't already doing. FLATOW: All right. We're going to take a short break, come back and talk lots more. Let's change gears a little bit. We've talked about the potential hazards of nanotechnology and nanoparticles. We're going to get back and talk more about the promises, what kinds of things are in the future? Take your calls, our number, 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Also, you can surf over to our Web site at sciencefriday. com, and learn more about what we're talking about. Put on our crystal balls, take a gaze into them and see what kinds of stuff that is possible. Maybe, we'd talk a little bit about computers? What about other kinds of nanotechnology devices are in these laboratories and haven't made it out yet. Stay with us. We'll talk about it when we get back to it right after this break. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about nanotechnology as Cornell University celebrates its NanoScale facility, the 30th anniversary of its work in nanotechnology. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Our guests are Rosalyn Berne, who is at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville; Larry Goldberg of the National Science Foundation; John Silcox, there at Cornell; and Barbara Baird, also at Cornell. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Let me give you all a chance and hopefully to think - put your thinking caps on and give you the Ira Flatow blank check question, which is if we - and this is good for the NSF, too, which could use a blank check these days. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. SILCOX: You're so right, Ira. FLATOW: What if you had a blank check? What device or what device would you like to create or what something in nanotechnology that really needs to be developed that you'd like to see it if you had the unlimited funds to do it. And let me begin with you, John Silcox. Dr. SILCOX: Oh, that's a shocker. I'm not sure. I would like to pass from that one. CONAN: Okay. Dr. SILCOX: . . . let someone else get it - has some good idea. FLATOW: Larry Goldberg. Dr. SILCOX: I'll come right back with it. FLATOW: Okay. Dr. GOLDBERG: Okay. Let me take a perspective from the electronics side, where we have these chips that have billions of transistors, the ones that fit into your computer or your cell phone, in their feature sizes or in the tenths of nanometer scale. So one of the real developments now is putting systems on the chip and systems that have all sorts of functionality that can sense that can - then compute and send back as a distributed group of sensors' information. And the size of these can become quite small, and so you can envision this capability really serving wide societal needs, both environmental sensing, sensing in the whole medical aspects. It's the shrinking of functionality that goes together with the shrinking of scale. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And we would expect. . . Dr. GOLDBERG: . . . the increase of functionality, really. FLATOW: And we would probably expect to see these chips everywhere. Dr. GOLDBERG: Yeah. FLATOW: As sensors, that could, you know. . . Dr. GOLDBERG: Yes. FLATOW: . . . to tell you there's a ring around your collar, a time to - time to send the shirt to the laundry. Dr. GOLDBERG: One has that for your favorite dog or you would spite to make sure you don't lose. FLATOW: They have them imbedded in their ears or something like that. Let me move on to Larry. Are you ready for your answer? I'll move on to Barbara Baird, let me get Barbara in here first. Dr. BAIRD: Well, one way to approach a question like this is to ask well, what are the big problems. And because of my background, I tend to think of health-type questions because my interest is biological systems. But they're similar, fundamental problems like that. And clean water for most of the year is one. And so building a membrane that can or a combination of devices that senses what's wrong with the water and then be able to filter out whatever it is that's wrong; first prescribing what's necessary and then being able to eliminate what's there and to develop pure water. So that requires a combination of things, not just one thing. And that's another point, I guess, I wanted to make is nanotechnology, for my view, is one tool and it's to be put together with a variety of other tools to be maximally effective. So that's - I would - so that's how I would address a question like that. And if we took - went over to the health side, a goal would be able to detect diseases before they're manifest. And that comes from first it's what they call personalized medicine now, understand what you susceptibilities are and then be on guard for when that might manifest and be able to deal with it right away. So that's a combination of diagnostics, being able to sequence DNA very quickly, and then have the knowledge based to know what that DNA would predict for your health future. . . FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. BAIRD: . . . and then whatever diagnostic is necessary to be able to determine whether that is in fact happening, and to deal with right away. FLATOW: And we've been, actually reporting on these little chips, able to actually diagnose or to exist inside a human cell. And know when the cell is beginning to malfunction. It was an interesting story. I think we did it a little bit - a week before last on it. Dr. BAIRD: Right.  Actually saw it. . . FLATOW: Yeah. That was kind of interesting. John Silcox, you're ready yet? Dr. SILCOX: I'm not really, not ready. I'm not sure I'm going to come up with this. I like Larry's. I like Barbara's. Both of them are very nice things, but they're sort of the big system type of story. Dr. GOLDBERG: Let me take another. . . FLATOW: Well, okay. You give him a little help. Dr. GOLDBERG: Another try. Let's look at various sectors. Barbara's raised health care, which is obviously quite, quite important in the future. But so is energy. FLATOW: Right. Dr. GOLDBERG: And everyone talks about alternative sources and conservation. We have to remember that it's a two-pronged equation. And some of the contributions, too, of nanotechnology in the alternative technologies, the fuel cell, more efficient catalysts that really can raise the efficiency and energy output of these devices. Also in lighting, solid-state lighting is becoming quite important - still an economic issue. But solar cells - right now, the real promise is in organic materials but their efficiencies are as low as a percent and they're degradable. So here, the research challenges are great. And then, of course, the conservation issue that goes on with using light sources that are much lower in energy consumption. Dr. SILCOX: Let me reflect on Larry's solar-state lighting. I mean, my sense is the solar-state - the devices for the solar-state lighting are basically here. The problem we have is that we can't replace the house's wiring in order to provide the right electrical system. So perhaps, what we need to invent is a device that can, preferably on the nano scale, be a wireless capability that can sort of beam - you know, what you can put in the house - beam the power to the different lights and effectively let the old copper wire and aluminum wire to stay there in place and just rot. I don't know. So, that's my contribution for what it's worth. FLATOW: Well, energy. . . Prof. BERNE: We could recycle that copper. Dr. SILCOX: Sorry? Prof. BERNE: Maybe we could recycle that copper. Dr. SILCOX: It would be nice to recycle the copper. That might take a lot of labor to pull it out, which is what I think the current problem is that just sort of rewiring the house appropriately is going to be too expensive. So, certainly, we have these wonderful nitride semiconductor and lighting sources that can give us a great deal of light and actually at various colors. FLATOW: How about fuel cell research? Can nanotechnology involve there? It might help us. It all make. . . Dr. SILCOX: There is some fuel cell research that's going on that involves nanotechnology at a level. I think it's basically growing the right materials and producing it. I think that would work. I'm not sure that it's going to have the, you know, create the hydrogen economy that quickly as, I think, people are hoping. FLATOW: Well, we space enthusiasts are holding out for the space elevator, which they keep talking about the nanotubes strong enough to build the, you know, the cable up into orbit. Dr. GOLDBERG: I'm not sure that's a really practical scheme there, Ira. But it, you know, you have this dangerous situation, if you say that someone's going to go do it. And. . . FLATOW: Yeah, you really. . . Dr. GOLDBERG: Can we do it? Not really tried it. FLATOW: People - can you imagine I'm getting off the ground? I might fall down. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. SILCOX: I do think our problems, though, are here on Earth. FLATOW: Yes. That's a very good point. And it's interesting, talking about the water situation. I've actually seen nanotechnology devices that - where you can be able to suck the water up and it filters it right out before it goes to your mouth. Anything that could, you know, solve something very simple but certainly international problems with nanotechnology. It's certainly a good place to begin. Let's go to the phones. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's see who we can get. John(ph) from Fayetteville. Hi, John JOHN (Caller): Hi, Ira. How are you doing? FLATOW: Fine. How are you? JOHN: I'm doing good. My question is about the potential of nanotechnology in use for the military. I'm a recent graduate of the University of Albany. And although I was not part of their science program, we have a fairly large nanotechnology school, very new. And I know that one of the buildings is devoted exclusively to Department of Defense research. And I understand that they do mostly research with naval guidance. But I'm wondering what the potential and the controversy of using nanotechnology in improving military weapons. FLATOW: Rosalyn Berne, any ethical. . . Prof. BERNE: There was an interesting talk about this yesterday on our panel. In fact, a man named (unintelligible) who's written a book about ethics and military applications of nano, his concern was the disproportionate allocation of funding in our country for military applications of nano in comparison to other areas of interest and also, in comparison to other initiatives around the globe saying that in the United States, in past initiatives it's been around 65 percent, he cited that, now, we're at 80 percent of our funding going to nano. And I'm not sure where his figure is coming from, so I'm not going to be the authority on it. But he was concerned about whether we're doing enough assessment of military applications of nano. There was also reference to the soldier - Institute of Soldier Technologies at MIT. Some of it seems to be there to protect and make things more efficient. Some of it seems to be there to make us more powerful and more competitive. This man's concern was that there is a gap. And studying and thinking about the implications of these allocations and these applications - it's an important question that our caller has asked. FLATOW: All right, John. Thanks for calling and asking it. JOHN: Thank you. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. In a few moments we have left when we all sit here 30 years from now, and we're talking about 60 years past of nanotechnology research. Do you think that we could - it's able to even predict, I mean, technology moves so fast these days. If you consider how fast the 30 years, things have happened in 30 years, from where they began. Do you think it's impossible to actually predict where nanotechnology or, you know, or even to predict, you know, what might not happen 30 years from now? Dr. GOLDBERG: I think the only safe prediction is that you ain't seen nothing yet. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. GOLDBERG: I think it's just going to go explode and it will be into everything, everywhere, is my guess. Dr. BAIRD: When - if I could just make a comment. . . FLATOW: Sure. Dr. BAIRD: I think one revolution that we're just beginning to see or just approaching is really even more integration amongst the disciplines. This has really been driven by the engineering and somewhat from the physical sciences side and being able to make things smaller and have all these different specifications. I think, it is yet to be embraced as much as it can be and will be by the medical side, say, or the biological side where there's really an integration of the knowledge bases of those several disciplines. And so as they become more integrated, you'll see a lot more integration of devices and particles with biological systems. I think that's for sure. And certainly, the miniaturization or the nanoturization(ph) or microminiaturization of computers will really play a big role in that. And I hope. . . FLATOW: This is - oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Let me just remind. . . Dr. BAIRD: Well, I just hope. . . FLATOW: Yeah. Go ahead. Dr. BAIRD: I just hope that at the same time, and I think this will also happen because of some of the drivers of this will have - you'll see a much bigger impact around the world, and not just in these countries that can afford this type of technology at this time. FLATOW: This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. There was a word you used there that I hadn't heard as a verb - nanoturization? Is that the word? Dr. BAIRD: Well, I was just - I'm sure. . . FLATOW: It's like moving Google into a vocabulary and now it's- what's the word you used? Dr. BAIRD: No, I said nanoturization. I was trying to move from miniaturization because all of a sudden that seemed too big and clunky. And. . . FLATOW: Well, I think you just coined the word for it. Dr. BAIRD: Maybe, it could make it a little easier to say, but certainly that's the direction we're going. FLATOW: Has to go up on Wikipedia tonight, I think. Nanoturization. Interesting. You know, are we going to need new physics as we get smaller and smaller here? Dr. GOLDBERG: Well, I think the physics is there. We're at the quantum level. We're beginning to understand how that plays a role into some of the new ideas in nano scale electronics, which are so critical to keeping us moving forward in that regime. But in looking at your question of 30 years ahead, I think if I look 30 years back, our prediction of the future was terrible. And I think it's probably going to be the same way as John had said. But one thing is clearer. The U. S. is going to have to run just to keep a pace in this technology field. Other countries all over the world - China, India, as examples - are just moving very rapidly and this will have important ramifications in our economy. FLATOW: So we have to train more students here. Dr. BAIRD: Yes. One comment I would make is your question about new physics. In fact, some of the very appropriate physics has been around since the early part of the 20th century and before, but as a teacher, it's actually great to point to actual quantum effects that students can see, seeing quantum dots and other things, and it's not some kind of magic. It's actually being put to use now in practical times to applications. Dr. SILCOX: My reaction to the new physics was, we will see, sort of, new applications of physics but I was really wondering whether, in fact, there might be new chemistry. Barbara? Dr. BAIRD: Well, there's always new chemistry. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. BAIRD: There's always new things to do, and chemistry is making molecules. But what you'll see rather than the engineering of what's called top-down is what you see now is more bottom up, that is making the molecules to the specifications to solve the problems that we need to solve. And the chemists, as you know, are very, very versatile and creative in coming up to the speed unless needed. FLATOW: Well, you get the last word on that, Barbara. You've got the last word. Dr. GOLDBERG: That was a good one. FLATOW: And a nice way to sum up Barbara Baird, a Horace White Professor of Chemistry at Cornell University. Thank you for joining us today. I want to also thank John Silcox, the David E. Burr professor of engineering at Cornell. Rosalyn Berne, associate professor in the Department of Science and Technology, and Society at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Larry Goldberg, senior engineering advisor in the Division of Electrical Communications and Cyber Systems at the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Virginia. Thank you all for taking time to be with us. Dr. BAIRD: Thank you. Dr. GOLDBERG: Thank you very much. Dr. SILCOX: Thank you. FLATOW: Have a great Father's Day. We'll see you next week. I'm Ira Flatow in New York.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  We are in a revolutionary period where being tiny is very big, where atoms and molecules can be shaped, formed, mass produced to produce almost anything we want - from clothing, to the detergents that clean them; from cars, to the wax we shine them with; from drugs, to baseball bats, to tiny self-assembling biocomputers small enough to flow through your bloodstream.  Nanotechnology is already all around us. And no one knows that better than Cornell University's NanoScale Science and Technology Facility. The lab turns thirty this week, and like all good academics, they threw a symposium to celebrate. Maybe they hoisted a few beers, we'll find out about that. And as we talk about it this hour with some of the scientists who gathered in Ithaca, New York, to talk about what they've accomplished and what lies ahead the future of nanotechnology, the field of nanomedicine.  And how to grapple with these social and ethical issues surrounding a technology that has the potential to change the way we live, but with consequences that scientists don't yet fully understand, like what potential problems - what are those problems of having countless billions of nanoparticles inhaled, swallowed, or slathered on our skins? Do we know what effect they may have on our health, or in the environment?  As landfills pile up with used and discarded nanowaste - old baseball bats, tennis rackets, skincare products, clothing, and on, and on, and on - where do all these nanoparticles go?  So if you like to join our discussion, give us a call. Our number is 1-800-989-8255. 1-800-989-TALK. And as always, you can surf over to our Web site at sciencefriday. com.  Let me introduce my guests, who join me today from the Cornell studios in Ithaca. Barbara Baird is the Horace White professor of chemistry in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell. Welcome to the program.  Dr. BARBARA BAIRD (Horace White Professor of Chemistry, Department of Chemistry & Chemical Biology, Cornell University): Thank you. It's good to be here.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Rosalyn Berne is an associate professor in the Department of Science, Technology and Society in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Welcome to the program.  Professor ROSALYN BERNE (Associate Professor, Department of Science, Technology and Society, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, University of Virginia): Thank you.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Larry Goldberg is senior engineering advisor in the Division of Electrical, Communications, and Cyber Systems at the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Virginia. Welcome to the program.  Dr. LARRY GOLDBERG (Senior Engineering Advisor, Division of Electrical, Communications, and Cyber Systems, National Science Foundation, Arlington, Virginia): Thank you very much.  FLATOW: You're welcome. John Silcox is the David E. Burr professor of engineering in the School of Applied and Engineering Physics at Cornell University. Welcome to the program, Dr. Silcox.  Dr. JOHN SILCOX (David E. Burr Professor of Engineering, School of Applied and Engineering Physics, Cornell University): Thank you very much. Glad to be here.  FLATOW: I just want to remind everyone that nanotechnology is really a relatively new field, but you guys at Cornell's NanoScale Facility have been doing it for 30 years. It's your 30th anniversary week.  Dr. SILCOX: Oh, yes. We were nano before. . .  FLATOW: You guys got on - you got out there ahead of the crowd.  Dr. SILCOX: Yeah. We were nano before nano was cool.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Well, what did you know that no one else did?  Dr. SILCOX: Oh, we were just beings responding to stimulus that I think the National Science Foundation gave us. And we submitted proposals seeking support for a facility that they had in mind, only, I think we made the mistake of looking for a very wide range of applications in actually one facility. And so that's how it all started.  FLATOW: Larry Goldberg, the NSF has invested a lot of money and a lot of effort in nanotechnology, has it not?  Dr. GOLDBERG: Yes, it has. And this is one investment, which we're particularly proud of because it dates back some 30 years, if you will, to 1977, an era when one really was talking about structures on micrometer scales, not yet shorter dimensions. But that investment has grown over the years to now a network of user facilities in which Cornell is a participant. That really served the broad science and engineering and technology sector in this new burgeoning field.  FLATOW: Barbara Baird, let's talk about one of the most interesting fields of nanotechnology and that is nanomedicine. Let's talk about some of the advances in this field. Care to pick one out to begin with?  Dr. BAIRD: Well, I'd like to take a step back from that and talk about nanobiotechnology, which underlies nanomedicine.  FLATOW: Sure.  Dr. BAIRD: And it's a recent thrust out from this main trunk of advances in micro and then nanotechnology. And the recognition - again, I'd like to think that Cornell was ahead of the game in the NSF - with the NSF support and stimulus to take some of the advances that had come about through development of electronics to smaller and smaller length scales to recognize that it was now possible to address biology at its most fundamental length scales - the molecular length scales of macromolecules, proteins, DNA and so forth, that make up the workings of cells, that make up the workings of organs and tissues and so forth.  And so a lot is going on, both to examine these systems at this fundamental length scale to draw from the lessons of biology and the nanotools and technologies that have been going on for a long time in a working system. And with this understanding, hand in hand, developing new ways of engaging biology to intervene in pathological cases and perhaps, to make up for things that are missing in certain biological systems related to medicine.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. John. . .  Dr. BAIRD: So. . .  FLATOW: I'm sorry, go ahead.  Dr. BAIRD: No, I was just going to say that there's a lot going on. Maybe, a lot of the attention is directed towards what are the medical advances, but underlying that is a huge area of the interface between micro and nanotechnology and biology.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. What would you say is the hottest field then in nanomedicine at this point?  Dr. BAIRD: Well, there's several possibilities. . .  FLATOW: Pick one out for us.  Dr. BAIRD: Okay. Well, let me just pick two. . .  FLATOW: Pick two.  Dr. BAIRD: . . . because they go in different directions. One is the diagnostic area - being able to detect diseases at very early stages before symptoms are manifest. And the other is more in the treatment area, such as in particles that can sense and deliver drugs, and then sense the recovery or the effects of the drugs. And then, there'd be regenerative medicine after that.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Rosalyn Berne, you have been interviewing nanotechnology scientists as part of your research. What are some of the things they're working on?  Prof. BERNE: You're asking me, specifically in the laboratory, the kind of research they're doing?  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Prof. BERNE: Well, one of the more fascinating projects for me was learning about a device that scrapes the inside of the mouth, picks up the cells, puts it into a box, and ideally, then, lays out in terms of genetics, what diseases might be present. As a diagnostic tool, I think it's been referred to as Doc in the Box. I've spoken with people who are interested in various specific diseases of the brain. There are people interested in new materials and how those might be applied in a computing environment.  Such a wide range of research - nano is not so much about anything in particular, more, how we approach further mastery of the material environment, whether it's through materials themselves, or chemical processes, or energetic reactions. It's more about scale is what I've learned. I've spoke with 35 different scientists in various fields, from biotechnology, to physics, to engineering science.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Do these scientists think of the social and ethical issues that may pop themselves up in their work?  Prof. BERNE: Oh, this is a question I was hoping you would ask, because I think that they would like to be able to think about these things, talk about these things, but there are two immediate problems. One is that it's really difficult to do it without making it feel personal. So what I found as an initial reaction is well, these are fascinating questions but, of course, I don't need to ask them of myself, because I'm doing the best I can and I believe I'm doing the right thing here.  I'm trying to solve serious problems. I'm trying to address cancer and human suffering. And so I don't understand what the ethical issues might be for me. But of course, my colleague down the hall, perhaps there's something they need to think about.  The other thing I learned is that there are very few fora for actually dialoguing about this. The pressure to get work done, to get grants, to get reports into publications, to keep labs open and stocked and grad students moving through - only now am I beginning to see actual opportunities for these kinds of dialogues and questions to be asked between and among scientists and engineers.  FLATOW: So there are sort of this - as the stereotypical scientist might do trying to avoid talking - thinking themselves about what their own ethical issues may be?  Prof. BERNE: I wouldn't want to judge them in that way. I think it's more that the structure is not there in the training necessarily. It's just coming to be. It's - well, what was delightful was that once we close the door and sat down and began to talk, what I found were individuals who were full of reflection and ideas and concerns. And they were quite excited to be able to talk about them.  A common comment was, when will you come back? I don't often have the opportunity to think about and talk about these things. So it's less about defending and buffering; more about the opportunity needs to be present in an open kind of forum where there are no accusations. And I think, unfortunately, sometimes with ethics, the presumption is that there's a right and a wrong and we want to see and make sure that you're doing it correctly. In the scale of nano investigations, it's not so simple.  Dr. GOLDBERG: I would comment from the NSF perspective. We are trying to encourage in our research grant activities that the students are being trained, be exposed to ethical conduct of research as well as those working in the fields touching on nanotechnology, looking at societal and ethical implications.  FLATOW: Well, Dr. Goldberg, what - name one ethical complication that they would be talking about for example.  Dr. GOLDBERG: If you're in a laboratory environment and are conducting a series of process steps and there is strict health and safety standards, and you see a colleague who's avoiding those, perhaps, to speed up the process, question is, do you talk with that colleague? Do you report the colleague? Do you simply walk away from it? These are the considerations that people need to give in their conduct of research.  Dr. SILCOX: In one of our centers, we have a series of lunchtime seminars that's intended for the students in which in fact ethical and all sorts of general questions are actually addressed. One of those lectures, I remember, was - there was a case of ethical misconduct about Bell Labs, about three or four years ago. Dr. Kendrick Cheung(ph) and one of the members of the committee that investigated the allegations and - which resulted in fact in a discovery that something that well over 20 papers needed to be withdrawn, came and gave a seminar and interacted with the students after the seminar. So we do make an effort to try and deal with this, but maybe not enough.  FLATOW: Well, we'll talk more about it. We have quite a bit of time, and taking questions from our audience. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break.  I'm Ira Flatow, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking this hour about nanotechnology with a special 30th anniversary symposium and, I guess, celebration going on at Cornell University's NanoScale Science and Technology Facility where our guests are coming from.  Our number, 1-800-989-8255. And we're talking with - we were last talking to John Silcox, who is the David E. Burr professor of engineering in the School of Applied and Engineering Physics at Cornell University.  Dr. Silcox, one of the things driving accomplishments in this field - and in all fields, you have to have these advances and the tools that you use. What kind of great advances do we see happening in nanotechnology that are allowing it to move forward, and allowed it to begin with?  Dr. SILCOX: Well, the drivers certainly are the issue of trying to get new applications and, if you're a scientist, an academic scientist, then you're interested in new information. And I think the tools are the key things that actually limit how far the drivers can go. One of the interesting things that I heard in the first lecture in the symposium was the sort of the growth in an imprint technology.  Typically, we do nanostructure by doing lithography - I, taking pictures on a sample - on a thin film using that as a resist to pattern and create the structures that we have. Optics and electrons are the kinds of typical tools that one is using. Electrons are effectively thin films, sized small, tiny beams that are scanned and duplicating what one sees on a computer screen. That becomes expensive, and one builds master pictures for that.  The other side of the game is to get the cheap things coming out, and the cheap things are when we do the photography, the lithography techniques, then we can multiply - make many copies and do them at a very low cost. The new thing that seems to be coming through is an imprint lithography technique in which one impresses and creates a master and a mold, and one creates things of that nature. Those seem to be able to take us down to the nano scale, but it's a long way, in fact, from taking that technology now and creating new things.  The insight, I think, that I brought away from that particular talk was a question, which is, how does the world want to nanocompute in a nanotechonology era? This is at a small scale. We're going to be looking at new forms of doing the computation. It brings - a lot of things have to be developed in order to take this. The most promising era, I think, is one that's going to have a compatibility with a seamless technology, which is what we've been using all along.  But there are other possibilities that are coming out. As far as advances in the instrumental tools, the ability, perhaps, to go even further with electrons is one that excites me and that we have finally, after something like 60 years, begun to see solutions to the problem of making our lenses better. So that's one that looks as though on a long range that might improve the shorter range, I think, of the new ways of designing how computers are going to compute and do their job.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Barbara Baird, we talked recently on SCIENCE FRIDAY about biocomputers, these tiny devices that are actually constructed from DNA and RNA and proteins that researchers hope will be able to read a cell's signals and pick up the signs of trouble right before they manifest themselves as diseases. Do you think nanomedicine will change how we diagnose medical condition?  Dr. BAIRD: I think there's no question about that. And part is that - I mean, it's driven by the availability of these tools, and the goals are to be able to look at smaller amounts of complex, physiological fluids and be able to test for a variety of conditions with a fairly simple and fast test.  And so that, no question, will enable faster diagnoses in field test, in the military or in undeveloped countries. All of these things should become available and ultimately cheap and very thorough in terms of diagnostics.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. How much of nanotechnology is being investigated by corporations themselves instead of the university for making products? And I ask all of you. You know, we've seen cosmetic companies making sunscreens and women's makeup and we have seen everything from nanowax for cars - the list can go on and on and on - baseball bats, tennis rackets, things like that made out of nanomaterials. It's seems like the consumer industry has almost taken over the field?  Dr. BAIRD: Well, I'll speak to that first, I guess. I think what all of those products that you described are based on materials, and it's a development of better materials and being able to make more finely controlled materials, allows you to control them in terms of lightness, strength and so forth. And so that certainly, there has been and will continue to be in a big investment in that and it will continue to improve.  I think the big companies are more cautious in the more difficult, challenging devices, which are multifunctional to do certain things especially in biological or medical types of context. That's a much more ambitious and risky undertaking. And certainly small companies are beginning to probe some of these things that the big companies, I think, are waiting for them to be developed a little by the small companies, would be my idea.  FLATOW: That's how it's always happened.  Dr. GOLDBERG: I think you'd see the innovation in this area coming often from the individual of investigators, small companies, new startups who have an idea that they want to test further. And here's where I think the Cornell and other facilities that are being supported across the country have a really important enabling role in that they provide, if you will, a prototyping laboratory for these new ideas with the equipment that is needed to test out what really could become a commercial product. And if the U. S. is to remain ahead in many of the fields today, it's through innovation and new products that are going to come about by this type of research.  Dr. BAIRD: And I would just add to that, what Larry said, is that not only is the innovation and this sort of the ideas taking the first step towards some type of device, but also the training of the students to think in this way, to think across disciplinary boundaries, to work together to bring these ideas to fruition.  FLATOW: Let's go to the phones. 1-800-989-8255, to Scottsdale, Arizona. Is it Navine(ph)?  NAVINE (Caller): Navine. Yes. Good afternoon, Ira.  FLATOW: Hi there.  NAVINE: Thank you for your wonderful show. It's always interesting. I had two questions. First of all, do you use testing on animals? And the second one would be, if you don't, would this enable science, maybe, not to use testing on animals anymore through the computer, being able maybe to facilitate that?  FLATOW: In other words, do you test new nanoparticles or products on animals like you would a new drug, if you were making one?  NAVINE: Right. Yeah. Or, any testing on animals.  FLATOW: Dr. Baird, any?  Dr. BAIRD: Well, I think that would be ultimately regulated by the FDA for types of materials that would be used for medical purposes. But one of the things that happens in the academic labs is as these materials are being developed or devices, is to test them on cell lines, not animals, but cells that have - are immortal, that you can continue to grow and then you can -began to test the effects on toxicity and so forth on cells.  And as I was saying earlier, part of the excitement about nanotechnology is that this can be used to understand how cells work on the most fundamental levels and ultimately, how organisms work. And with that level of information, you can design more and more sophisticated computer programs or software that more realistically reflect what the response would be to a particular type of product, a drug or a nanoparticle or anything. So this really is - would be based on the fundamental research, and then would ultimately develop into something that you could hope would resemble a real animal response.  FLATOW: Okay. Thank you for calling.  NAVINE: Thank you.  FLATOW: Do we know how safe nanomaterials are? I mentioned at the beginning how many countless billions, trillions - put a number on it - of these particles are now out everywhere, and we are virtually sniffing them in and eating them and not, you know, unknowingly consuming them. They come off our clothes, off our products. Sometimes, they might even be in our water. How much - and from the research that I have in front of me, looking at the amount of research that's going on, I know the NSF, for example, is also funding research on nanoparticles, it doesn't appear to be, to me at least, that there's a great percentage of the money invested in nanotechnology, invested in the health and possible environmental consequences of what might happen here?  Dr. GOLDBERG: I think, Ira, there is a significant investment being made at the federal level in order to study these questions and develop the basic science underlying them in order to have informed policy making. And at the NSF, we have invested in science and technology centers that deal with biological environmental nanotechnology several years back. And we've had continuing grant competitions in partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, looking at the science issues in this field of risk. So, I think the federal government is placing an emphasis on this aspect.  FLATOW: Dr. Baird, do we know what the long-term effects are? I mean, they haven't been around very long, this nanoparticles.  Dr. BAIRD: Oh no, we don't, of course. Any time something new comes along, you're not sure what long-term effects are. I wouldn't place these in too different a category than drugs. And as the regulation - regulatory agencies already exist, these things are tested. And there may be unintended consequences, but I don't think there's any more reason for alarm in these cases than there are in other developments of technology.  But one - a point I wanted to make is that with the investment of the federal agencies in nanotechnology, there has been from the very beginning a concern that this aspect be considered. I have served on a number of advisory committees, both with the NSF and the NIH, and together with the consideration of what new products, what new research, what new frontiers can be addressed, has been the consideration, or how can we deal with the unintended consequences? How can we be alerted to those as early as possible? So, that we can head those off.  Prof. BERNE: This is Rosalyn speaking. It seems to me, however, that we have products in the marketplace, perhaps prematurely not knowing, in fact, what effect they might have. There is some ambiguity - perhaps consumers are willing to live with those ambiguities because of the convenience those products provide.  Anecdotally, I was in a laboratory at - I will not name the institution - where a senior investigator who's been working for many years was speaking with me, and I asked her, are you concerned about protecting the well-being of your students you all work with carbon nanotubes? And she said, what can we do? We just - we work with what we have. We don't know that much. We're interested to investigate these problems and these questions. I hope we will be well.  So, I think there's a great amount of faith that we will be well, that we are doing what we can to learn what we can, that we're willing to take some risks because the studies are not definitive yet. Some of them - to my knowledge -are really just beginning.  FLATOW: This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking this hour about nanotechnology, the future of it. We're talking up until the break - coming break about the safety of nanoparticles and concerns about it. There's a news article that's coming out of the University of Missouri in Columbia of a study that is funded by the NSF about silver nanotechnology particles. And one of the professors of civil and environmental engineering at the College of Engineering says silver nanoparticles are emerging as one of the fastest-growing nanomaterials with wide applications. It goes on to say currently, little is known about the adverse effects of silver nanoparticles to human health and their fate in ecological systems.  And these are some of the things - not just, I guess, the health of what happens in the immediate, what you're wearing or inhaling in your factory or home, but what happens when we fill up these landfills, or we have nanoparticles that are might making their way into water filtration systems, things like that. We don't know what's going to happen to these particles, do we? And that's one of the reasons people are studying it. Obviously, people are concerned about it.  Dr. GOLDBERG: The July issue of Consumer's Report actually carries some issue on nanotechnology. And one of the things I was interested to learn from that particular issue was that, in fact, the FDA has been approached by a number of organizations to try and address, in particular - I think, it came up over a problem with this - or a perceived problem with the silver nanoparticles, that they have actually now formed a nanotechnology task force to see whether in fact they should be, I assume, to see whether they should be much more heavily involved in this.  I think what we're seeing is an agency that is beginning wake up to the fact that we have some things that they should, perhaps be looking at there. So, my sense says that perhaps we're getting some action on a federal level. One would also like to ask what is happening with some of the NIH. I think there's an institution, institute for occupational safety and health, and I would assume that they were, they need to be involved in generating research in this area, and I think they have been.  FLATOW: Ah, John. . .  Dr. BAIRD: That would be the national. . .  FLATOW: I'm sorry.  Dr. BAIRD: Excuse me, I think that would the National Institute on Environment Health and Safety.  Dr. SILCOX: Occupational. . .  Dr. GOLDBERG: Occupational health and Safety.  Dr. SILCOX: Ah Yes.  FLATOW: John Silcox, is this something that worry about in your lab?  Dr. SILCOX: I certainly make sure - try to make sure that we have plenty of, you know, that the students are very careful about how they're dealing with these things. I'm not sure that I particularly worry that we're discarding a great number of these nanoparticles, but I don't because I don't think we are. They tend to dry up. They sort of coagulate eventually after we're finished using them, and that they're effectively, sort of, gone-go back into a form in which they can be reasonably, and easily discarded appropriately. But - so, that sort of looking at my particular lab, we do worry about it, and we talk about it. But, I'm not sure that we've seen much that we should be doing what we aren't already doing.  FLATOW: All right. We're going to take a short break, come back and talk lots more. Let's change gears a little bit. We've talked about the potential hazards of nanotechnology and nanoparticles. We're going to get back and talk more about the promises, what kinds of things are in the future? Take your calls, our number, 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Also, you can surf over to our Web site at sciencefriday. com, and learn more about what we're talking about.  Put on our crystal balls, take a gaze into them and see what kinds of stuff that is possible. Maybe, we'd talk a little bit about computers? What about other kinds of nanotechnology devices are in these laboratories and haven't made it out yet. Stay with us. We'll talk about it when we get back to it right after this break.

Our guests are Rosalyn Berne, who is at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville; Larry Goldberg of the National Science Foundation; John Silcox, there at Cornell; and Barbara Baird, also at Cornell. Our number, 1-800-989-8255.  Let me give you all a chance and hopefully to think - put your thinking caps on and give you the Ira Flatow blank check question, which is if we - and this is good for the NSF, too, which could use a blank check these days.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. SILCOX: You're so right, Ira.  FLATOW: What if you had a blank check? What device or what device would you like to create or what something in nanotechnology that really needs to be developed that you'd like to see it if you had the unlimited funds to do it. And let me begin with you, John Silcox.  Dr. SILCOX: Oh, that's a shocker. I'm not sure. I would like to pass from that one.  CONAN: Okay.  Dr. SILCOX: . . . let someone else get it - has some good idea.  FLATOW: Larry Goldberg.  Dr. SILCOX: I'll come right back with it.  FLATOW: Okay.  Dr. GOLDBERG: Okay. Let me take a perspective from the electronics side, where we have these chips that have billions of transistors, the ones that fit into your computer or your cell phone, in their feature sizes or in the tenths of nanometer scale.  So one of the real developments now is putting systems on the chip and systems that have all sorts of functionality that can sense that can - then compute and send back as a distributed group of sensors' information.  And the size of these can become quite small, and so you can envision this capability really serving wide societal needs, both environmental sensing, sensing in the whole medical aspects. It's the shrinking of functionality that goes together with the shrinking of scale.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And we would expect. . .  Dr. GOLDBERG: . . . the increase of functionality, really.  FLATOW: And we would probably expect to see these chips everywhere.  Dr. GOLDBERG: Yeah.  FLATOW: As sensors, that could, you know. . .  Dr. GOLDBERG: Yes.  FLATOW: . . . to tell you there's a ring around your collar, a time to - time to send the shirt to the laundry.  Dr. GOLDBERG: One has that for your favorite dog or you would spite to make sure you don't lose.  FLATOW: They have them imbedded in their ears or something like that. Let me move on to Larry. Are you ready for your answer? I'll move on to Barbara Baird, let me get Barbara in here first.  Dr. BAIRD: Well, one way to approach a question like this is to ask well, what are the big problems. And because of my background, I tend to think of health-type questions because my interest is biological systems. But they're similar, fundamental problems like that. And clean water for most of the year is one.  And so building a membrane that can or a combination of devices that senses what's wrong with the water and then be able to filter out whatever it is that's wrong; first prescribing what's necessary and then being able to eliminate what's there and to develop pure water.  So that requires a combination of things, not just one thing. And that's another point, I guess, I wanted to make is nanotechnology, for my view, is one tool and it's to be put together with a variety of other tools to be maximally effective.  So that's - I would - so that's how I would address a question like that. And if we took - went over to the health side, a goal would be able to detect diseases before they're manifest. And that comes from first it's what they call personalized medicine now, understand what you susceptibilities are and then be on guard for when that might manifest and be able to deal with it right away.  So that's a combination of diagnostics, being able to sequence DNA very quickly, and then have the knowledge based to know what that DNA would predict for your health future. . .  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. BAIRD: . . . and then whatever diagnostic is necessary to be able to determine whether that is in fact happening, and to deal with right away.  FLATOW: And we've been, actually reporting on these little chips, able to actually diagnose or to exist inside a human cell. And know when the cell is beginning to malfunction. It was an interesting story. I think we did it a little bit - a week before last on it.  Dr. BAIRD: Right.  Actually saw it. . .  FLATOW: Yeah. That was kind of interesting. John Silcox, you're ready yet?  Dr. SILCOX: I'm not really, not ready. I'm not sure I'm going to come up with this. I like Larry's. I like Barbara's. Both of them are very nice things, but they're sort of the big system type of story.  Dr. GOLDBERG: Let me take another. . .  FLATOW: Well, okay. You give him a little help.  Dr. GOLDBERG: Another try. Let's look at various sectors. Barbara's raised health care, which is obviously quite, quite important in the future. But so is energy.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. GOLDBERG: And everyone talks about alternative sources and conservation. We have to remember that it's a two-pronged equation. And some of the contributions, too, of nanotechnology in the alternative technologies, the fuel cell, more efficient catalysts that really can raise the efficiency and energy output of these devices.  Also in lighting, solid-state lighting is becoming quite important - still an economic issue. But solar cells - right now, the real promise is in organic materials but their efficiencies are as low as a percent and they're degradable. So here, the research challenges are great.  And then, of course, the conservation issue that goes on with using light sources that are much lower in energy consumption.  Dr. SILCOX: Let me reflect on Larry's solar-state lighting. I mean, my sense is the solar-state - the devices for the solar-state lighting are basically here. The problem we have is that we can't replace the house's wiring in order to provide the right electrical system. So perhaps, what we need to invent is a device that can, preferably on the nano scale, be a wireless capability that can sort of beam - you know, what you can put in the house - beam the power to the different lights and effectively let the old copper wire and aluminum wire to stay there in place and just rot. I don't know. So, that's my contribution for what it's worth.  FLATOW: Well, energy. . .  Prof. BERNE: We could recycle that copper.  Dr. SILCOX: Sorry?  Prof. BERNE: Maybe we could recycle that copper.  Dr. SILCOX: It would be nice to recycle the copper. That might take a lot of labor to pull it out, which is what I think the current problem is that just sort of rewiring the house appropriately is going to be too expensive. So, certainly, we have these wonderful nitride semiconductor and lighting sources that can give us a great deal of light and actually at various colors.  FLATOW: How about fuel cell research? Can nanotechnology involve there? It might help us. It all make. . .  Dr. SILCOX: There is some fuel cell research that's going on that involves nanotechnology at a level. I think it's basically growing the right materials and producing it. I think that would work. I'm not sure that it's going to have the, you know, create the hydrogen economy that quickly as, I think, people are hoping.  FLATOW: Well, we space enthusiasts are holding out for the space elevator, which they keep talking about the nanotubes strong enough to build the, you know, the cable up into orbit.  Dr. GOLDBERG: I'm not sure that's a really practical scheme there, Ira. But it, you know, you have this dangerous situation, if you say that someone's going to go do it. And. . .  FLATOW: Yeah, you really. . .  Dr. GOLDBERG: Can we do it? Not really tried it.  FLATOW: People - can you imagine I'm getting off the ground? I might fall down.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. SILCOX: I do think our problems, though, are here on Earth.  FLATOW: Yes. That's a very good point. And it's interesting, talking about the water situation. I've actually seen nanotechnology devices that - where you can be able to suck the water up and it filters it right out before it goes to your mouth. Anything that could, you know, solve something very simple but certainly international problems with nanotechnology. It's certainly a good place to begin.  Let's go to the phones. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's see who we can get. John(ph) from Fayetteville. Hi, John  JOHN (Caller): Hi, Ira. How are you doing?  FLATOW: Fine. How are you?  JOHN: I'm doing good. My question is about the potential of nanotechnology in use for the military. I'm a recent graduate of the University of Albany. And although I was not part of their science program, we have a fairly large nanotechnology school, very new. And I know that one of the buildings is devoted exclusively to Department of Defense research. And I understand that they do mostly research with naval guidance. But I'm wondering what the potential and the controversy of using nanotechnology in improving military weapons.  FLATOW: Rosalyn Berne, any ethical. . .  Prof. BERNE: There was an interesting talk about this yesterday on our panel. In fact, a man named (unintelligible) who's written a book about ethics and military applications of nano, his concern was the disproportionate allocation of funding in our country for military applications of nano in comparison to other areas of interest and also, in comparison to other initiatives around the globe saying that in the United States, in past initiatives it's been around 65 percent, he cited that, now, we're at 80 percent of our funding going to nano. And I'm not sure where his figure is coming from, so I'm not going to be the authority on it. But he was concerned about whether we're doing enough assessment of military applications of nano.  There was also reference to the soldier - Institute of Soldier Technologies at MIT. Some of it seems to be there to protect and make things more efficient. Some of it seems to be there to make us more powerful and more competitive. This man's concern was that there is a gap. And studying and thinking about the implications of these allocations and these applications - it's an important question that our caller has asked.  FLATOW: All right, John. Thanks for calling and asking it.  JOHN: Thank you.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. In a few moments we have left when we all sit here 30 years from now, and we're talking about 60 years past of nanotechnology research. Do you think that we could - it's able to even predict, I mean, technology moves so fast these days. If you consider how fast the 30 years, things have happened in 30 years, from where they began. Do you think it's impossible to actually predict where nanotechnology or, you know, or even to predict, you know, what might not happen 30 years from now?  Dr. GOLDBERG: I think the only safe prediction is that you ain't seen nothing yet.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. GOLDBERG: I think it's just going to go explode and it will be into everything, everywhere, is my guess.  Dr. BAIRD: When - if I could just make a comment. . .  FLATOW: Sure.  Dr. BAIRD: I think one revolution that we're just beginning to see or just approaching is really even more integration amongst the disciplines. This has really been driven by the engineering and somewhat from the physical sciences side and being able to make things smaller and have all these different specifications. I think, it is yet to be embraced as much as it can be and will be by the medical side, say, or the biological side where there's really an integration of the knowledge bases of those several disciplines. And so as they become more integrated, you'll see a lot more integration of devices and particles with biological systems. I think that's for sure.  And certainly, the miniaturization or the nanoturization(ph) or microminiaturization of computers will really play a big role in that. And I hope. . .  FLATOW: This is - oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Let me just remind. . .  Dr. BAIRD: Well, I just hope. . .  FLATOW: Yeah. Go ahead.  Dr. BAIRD: I just hope that at the same time, and I think this will also happen because of some of the drivers of this will have - you'll see a much bigger impact around the world, and not just in these countries that can afford this type of technology at this time.  FLATOW: This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. There was a word you used there that I hadn't heard as a verb - nanoturization? Is that the word?  Dr. BAIRD: Well, I was just - I'm sure. . .  FLATOW: It's like moving Google into a vocabulary and now it's- what's the word you used?  Dr. BAIRD: No, I said nanoturization. I was trying to move from miniaturization because all of a sudden that seemed too big and clunky. And. . .  FLATOW: Well, I think you just coined the word for it.  Dr. BAIRD: Maybe, it could make it a little easier to say, but certainly that's the direction we're going.  FLATOW: Has to go up on Wikipedia tonight, I think. Nanoturization. Interesting. You know, are we going to need new physics as we get smaller and smaller here?  Dr. GOLDBERG: Well, I think the physics is there. We're at the quantum level. We're beginning to understand how that plays a role into some of the new ideas in nano scale electronics, which are so critical to keeping us moving forward in that regime. But in looking at your question of 30 years ahead, I think if I look 30 years back, our prediction of the future was terrible. And I think it's probably going to be the same way as John had said.  But one thing is clearer. The U. S. is going to have to run just to keep a pace in this technology field. Other countries all over the world - China, India, as examples - are just moving very rapidly and this will have important ramifications in our economy.  FLATOW: So we have to train more students here.  Dr. BAIRD: Yes. One comment I would make is your question about new physics. In fact, some of the very appropriate physics has been around since the early part of the 20th century and before, but as a teacher, it's actually great to point to actual quantum effects that students can see, seeing quantum dots and other things, and it's not some kind of magic. It's actually being put to use now in practical times to applications.  Dr. SILCOX: My reaction to the new physics was, we will see, sort of, new applications of physics but I was really wondering whether, in fact, there might be new chemistry. Barbara?  Dr. BAIRD: Well, there's always new chemistry.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. BAIRD: There's always new things to do, and chemistry is making molecules. But what you'll see rather than the engineering of what's called top-down is what you see now is more bottom up, that is making the molecules to the specifications to solve the problems that we need to solve. And the chemists, as you know, are very, very versatile and creative in coming up to the speed unless needed.  FLATOW: Well, you get the last word on that, Barbara. You've got the last word.  Dr. GOLDBERG: That was a good one.  FLATOW: And a nice way to sum up Barbara Baird, a Horace White Professor of Chemistry at Cornell University. Thank you for joining us today.  I want to also thank John Silcox, the David E. Burr professor of engineering at Cornell. Rosalyn Berne, associate professor in the Department of Science and Technology, and Society at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Larry Goldberg, senior engineering advisor in the Division of Electrical Communications and Cyber Systems at the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Virginia. Thank you all for taking time to be with us.  Dr. BAIRD: Thank you.  Dr. GOLDBERG: Thank you very much.  Dr. SILCOX: Thank you.  FLATOW: Have a great Father's Day. We'll see you next week.

The National Science Foundation is about to pick a site for the nation's new, deep underground science lab. Researchers intend to study all sorts of things underground, from the Earth's inner core to outer space. Four states are competing for the site in hopes of winning federal funding and high-tech jobs. South Dakota Public Radio's Charles Michael Ray has the story. CHARLES MICHAEL RAY: A good way to get a group of physicists excited is to ask them what they'd like to study in a deep, underground lab. Unidentified Man #1: Well, I'm interested in neutrino oscillations. Unidentified Man #2: What we are interested in is the measurement of radioactivity. Unidentified Man #3: We're interested in how cosmic rays can affect semiconductor memory. Unidentified Man #4: And my main interest is dark matter searches. MICHAEL RAY: If things like cosmic rays, solar neutrinos and dark matter are a little over your head, join the club. But it turns out that deep underground is a good place to look into outer space. Underground, radiation from the sun is filtered out, so it's easier to detect the minute signals that are emitted from deep outer space. But Ken Landy, a professor of physics at the University of Pennsylvania, says the United States needs to play catch up in this type of science. He says the Europeans, the Japanese, the Russians and Canadians all have underground labs of their own. KEN LANDY: And so we've lagged behind in our own national facility. And this is sort of wonderful to see that we about to get one. MICHAEL RAY: Besides physics, scientists say an underground lab could be useful to a wide range of research, including biology, geology and mining engineering. Even the Defense Department may have an interest in underground research. Bob Wilson, a physicist with the University of Colorado, has an if-you-build-it- they-will-come attitude. BOB WILSON: The history of science has been that if you generate a tool and a facility that what comes out of it is far greater than you anticipated. So excited as I am by what I know we can do, though, deep within me I'm more excited about what I don't know we're going to do, but will be doing 15, 20 years from now. MICHAEL RAY: The prospect of a new, underground laboratory is getting politicians excited, too. They see a potential for federal funding for their deep tunnels and underground mines. One of the sites being considered is the Henderson Mine in the Colorado Rockies near Boulder. Colorado Governor Bill Ritter sees new jobs for his state. BILL RITTER: These are great jobs. It is high paying, high-tech, just the kind of thing the state wants to reach out and get. It's just a fantastic opportunity. MICHAEL RAY: In South Dakota, the Homestake Gold Mine is a possible site for the new NSF lab. Governor Mike Rounds has taken the lead in lobbying for the lab. The state has already invested about $5 million with 116 more million promised if the lab comes. South Dakota has gone so far as to acquire title to the former gold mine and has started to build a lab of its own. Critics say the state runs the risk of inheriting environmental problems if the deal goes south, but Rounds says it's a worthy gamble because it could foster a new tech-based economy in the state. MIKE ROUNDS: That means that our young people will have a chance to rub shoulders with some of the greatest minds in the world. And at the same time, young people who before had to leave South Dakota to do research could actually stay here, giving our kids a chance to be involved in the science and technology that, right now, is on the forefront. MICHAEL RAY: The Pioneer Tunnel in Washington and the Sudan Mine in northern Minnesota are also in the running for the lab. Regardless of the outcome, funding for the actual underground lab construction will be up to Congress, and those involved don't expect that to come any time before 2009.

That means 240,000 fewer smokers since 2002. That's according to a study published today. It is the steepest decline in the nation since 1965. Why the drop? Well, high taxes, a ban on public smoking, and scary TV ads like this one featuring a man who needed a tracheotomy because of his smoking habit. Unidentified Man: I will have to do this for the rest of my life. BRAND: Sarah Perl is assistant commissioner at New York City's Health Department's Bureau of Tobacco Control. She co-wrote the new study. Welcome to the program. Ms. SARAH PERL (New York City Health Department): Thank you so much. BRAND: So which do you credit most for reducing smoking? Ms. PERL: Well, it really is the combination of all three of those elements. It's the tax, with the Smoke-Free Air Act, and also the hard-hitting media. I think if I had to choose one thing, it would certainly be the hard-hitting media from the last year. But I think overall we know that tax is really the most effective intervention to help smokers quit and to keep potential smokers from starting. BRAND: So people actually can't afford to smoke so they quit smoking? Ms. PERL: I think part of what the tax actually does is it begins to squeeze people, in other words. I think most smokers, and we know this from the data, want to quit. So if it's too hard to afford cigarettes to smoke, if there's no place to smoke them, and if it's just too problematic to smoke them, smokers are much more likely to quit. BRAND: Talk about that ad for a minute. That features a Hispanic man. And there's a large Hispanic population in New York City. Did you see large declines in the Hispanic community? Ms. PERL: We did, in fact, see declines in the Hispanic community. The decline was from 20. 2 percent to 17. 1 percent in that one year between 2005 and 2006. So it is possible that the Hispanic community was more responsive to the ad than the rest of the communities. But we've seen declines in the rest of the communities too. So we think that really that ad is just very effective for smokers overall. It is scary. I think that part of what makes that ad effective is the fact that it's not about somebody dying. It's about living with the consequences of smoking for the rest of your life. It's about not being able to swim. It's about having a permanent hole in your throat and having to speak through a device. It's about some serious consequences that really impact your life in a way that's not very pleasant. BRAND: What is the takeaway message do you think for people in your position in other cities across the country? What should they be focusing on? Ms. PERL: Well, we think that these three elements are the key elements for tobacco control, that if you have a tax, you have Smoke-Free Air Act, and you're willing to run hard-hitting ads that are both graphic and frequent, that you really are going to see the kind of decline that we have seen. This decline of almost 20 percent, almost a quarter of a million fewer smokers in New York City, has been over the course of four years, which is really very quick. And we think it's because we've put all of these elements into place at the same time and we've continued to keep the message about tobacco fresh for people, that quitting is something that they need to do. Even if they've tried to quit and not succeeded, they need to try again until they do succeed. We know that most smokers try to quit several times before they are successful. So it's really pushing them to make quit attempts. They learn something about themselves every time they make a quit attempt - what triggers them, what kind of support they need. Maybe they need nicotine replacement therapy. Maybe they need to try a different medication. And each time they get a little closer to quitting, and eventually they succeed. BRAND: Sarah Perl is with New York City's Health Department's Bureau of Tobacco Control talking about the dramatic decrease in smoking in that city. Thank you, Sarah Perl. Ms. PERL: Thank you.

Ms. PERL: Well, we think that these three elements are the key elements for tobacco control, that if you have a tax, you have Smoke-Free Air Act, and you're willing to run hard-hitting ads that are both graphic and frequent, that you really are going to see the kind of decline that we have seen.  This decline of almost 20 percent, almost a quarter of a million fewer smokers in New York City, has been over the course of four years, which is really very quick. And we think it's because we've put all of these elements into place at the same time and we've continued to keep the message about tobacco fresh for people, that quitting is something that they need to do. Even if they've tried to quit and not succeeded, they need to try again until they do succeed.  We know that most smokers try to quit several times before they are successful. So it's really pushing them to make quit attempts. They learn something about themselves every time they make a quit attempt - what triggers them, what kind of support they need. Maybe they need nicotine replacement therapy. Maybe they need to try a different medication. And each time they get a little closer to quitting, and eventually they succeed.  BRAND: Sarah Perl is with New York City's Health Department's Bureau of Tobacco Control talking about the dramatic decrease in smoking in that city. Thank you, Sarah Perl.  Ms. PERL: Thank you.

IRA FLATOW, host: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. Sure, every job has good things and bad things about it, but what could be that great about studying garbage for a living or spending weeks on end strapped to a bed in the name of gravity research. Well for four years, \"Popular Science\" magazine has come out with a yearly ranking of what it calls The Worst Jobs in Science. This one is written by Jason Daley with illustrations by Chris Gall. And joining me now to talk about the jobs - and maybe you have a job of your own. I mentioned before the break, if you've got a really terrible job in science, in a laboratory - wherever you work - we want to hear about it. Our number 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. Mark Jannot is editor-in-chief of Popular Science, and he's here to talk with us about this issue. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Mr. MARK JANNOT (Editor-in-Chief, Popular Science): Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: Whose idea was this idea anyway? Mr. JANNOT: Well, it was a sort of collective eureka moment, I think. About four or five years ago, we were sitting in a conference room, you know, brainstorming ideas, and someone mentioned the notion of doing, you know, a classic sort of rundown of the best jobs in science. FLATOW: Right. Mr. JANNOT: And I think we all sort of yawned collectively and said, oh, God, the best jobs in science A, people are going to expect that to be, actually, objective in some way, or they're going to - they're going to expect it to be a sort of rigorous selection process there. And B, you know, the best jobs are all going to be kind of good in similar ways, but. . . FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. JANNOT: . . . but maybe there's a different way to go at it. Maybe we could do the worst jobs and - oh my God. That's brilliance, you know. FLATOW: So you hired a blue ribbon panel of experts to come in and judge, right? Mr. JANNOT: Yes. Well, that first year, we hired a tremendous freelancer named Speed Weed who. . . FLATOW: Is that right? Mr. JANNOT: No kidding. And he contacted a thousand or more scientists and science professionals and researchers and drudges and whatever, and took as many nominations as he could. And then we, we just put it to a vote, basically, of our staff. There was truly nothing scientific about the ranking especially. Well, about any of it, really. FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah. Mr. JANNOT: It's just, you know, come up with some really noxious, horrible jobs. . . FLATOW: Well. . . Mr. JANNOT: . . . that cast some interesting perspective on science and we'll vote as a staff on which ones are really the worst. FLATOW: Right. Let's go to some of your picture. Top 10. Give me your number 10 pick. Mr. JANNOT: Number 10. I love the fact that this is number 10, which means there are nine worse jobs than this. This is the whale feces researcher. These are basically scientists who trail along behind right whales out in the ocean, waiting for them to do their jobs, so they can, you know, scoop it up, get their big pooper-scooper out there and then analyze it for - to, you know, to study the whales themselves and in an obviously much, you know, non-invasive way. FLATOW: Right. Mr. JANNOT: It's, you know, it scores high on the smelly noxious . . . FLATOW: Yuck factor. Mr. JANNOT: . . . yuck factor scale, which is almost a guarantee. Every year, there's some very high-scoring yuck factor jobs in our list. So yeah - but, you know, like almost every one of these jobs, there is legitimate and important research going on here. And, you know, as - like most of the rest of the jobs also, the researchers themselves are incredulous when they hear, you know, when they get a call from us actually suggesting that they have one of the worst jobs in science, because think it's. . . FLATOW: Right. Mr. JANNOT: I guess the smell of the salty sea air is great until they get upon their prey, you know. . . FLATOW: I'm sure. But what. . . Mr. JANNOT: And they captured it on film recently, the first time they think that they actually got a whale fart on film. It formed a big bubble and then popped, and then you can imagine the smell of that. FLATOW: It must be number one on YouTube. Mr. JANNOT: Exactly. FLATOW: Speaking of one, let's go right to the number one job that you had. Mr. JANNOT: Number one. Well, you'll see a trend here. Number one this year is the hazmat diver. These are highly trained divers who go into a - basically they swim through sewage. Enough said. They go through sewage. They go through a swim in nuclear reactors and toxic waste spills to clean up those waste spills. There is - the worst example that we found was a guy, a hazmat diver, who had to dive into a trough of pig excrements that someone had fallen into and died, and to retrieve the body, basically. So you've got, you know, death - rotting corpses and, you know, pig poop he has to deal with all at the same time. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. John(ph)is from Minneapolis. Hi, have you got a job as bad as that? JOHN (Caller): Actually, my job right now is very good, but I used to have a pretty poor job. Not quite as bad as swimming in poop, but I got to weigh it in little dishes and put it in the oven. FLATOW: Hmm. And to what end? JOHN: I was working for the sewage treatment plant in Saint Paul, Minnesota. And it was gravimetric analysis of the sewage at every point to determine the solids that they were taking out of the water. FLATOW: Right. JOHN: So you would weigh the sewage and - before and after drying and before and after burning it. FLATOW: Did you have to have special clothing for this? JOHN: No (unintelligible). FLATOW: You weren't going in with your flip-flops on, I don't think. Mr. JANNOT: Special gas masks, perhaps? JOHN: No. No funny clothes, really. It was pretty much a lab job, but it stunk pretty bad. Mr. JANNOT: Nothing to protect you from major (unintelligible). FLATOW: Well, it's good that you don't have that now, part-time job I was hoping. JOHN: Yeah, yeah. I like what I'm doing now a lot better. FLATOW: All right. Thanks for calling. JOHN: Yup(ph). FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Let's work our way up down again from nine. Let's see at number nine on your list. Mr. JANNOT: Number nine this year - forensic entomologist. Of course, this is sort of a sexy job, I suppose, these days with CSI being so popular. But you know, entomology, as you well know Ira, is the study of bugs, and forensic entomology is the study of bugs on corpses - so it's sort of like two great tastes that go great together or something like that - you get to hang around rotting corpses. And I found in - this year, the guy that we interviewed, that Jason Daley interviewed, really proves to me that it takes an entirely different breed of human to do this. I mean, the first guy that he end up working on, he was - a detective at the local police department called him in because he knew he was an entomologist and studied bugs, and he said, you know, I've got this corpse I really need to figure out when he died or whatever. And the guy, it turned out, was a guy that this guy knew and had breakfast with regularly. And - but he just got so into it, he's like, wow, actually I found some maggots in his eyes. And then I, oh, and in his mouth, and God, was so cool, you know. . . FLATOW: Right. Okay, (unintelligible). Mr. JANNOT: Yes, yes. FLATOW: I think we've had him on the show. Oh, years ago, yeah. This is a great pick I think. Because I can't think - they have a laboratory where the bodies lie around in the backyard and decay there. Mr. JANNOT: They let them decay. They use pig, pigs also, I think, to study. So they can compare. I think pigs and human decay are the same. . . FLATOW: May not be PC anymore to use real bodies. But they used to use real corpses. . . Mr. JANNOT: Yeah. FLATOW: . . . in different positions. So, that's a terrible job. All right, I want you  - any of these, as you say, could be number one. FLATOW: Yes, exactly. Mr. JANNOT: Exactly. There's - we often get into a, you know, debates and fisticuffs in the office. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. JANNOT: Different people have their job that they're advocating for. FLATOW: Let's speak to somebody on the line. Hi, Eric(ph) in Madison. Hi welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. ERIC (Caller): Hello. Thank you for taking my call. FLATOW: Hi, go ahead. What is your worst job? ERIC: Well, I actually - I make penguins puke. (Soundbite of laughter) ERIC: In Antarctica, I study the diet and foraging behavior of Adelie penguins on the Antarctic Peninsula, which entails me making them puke. FLATOW: Isn't that against the law or the treaty or something? ERIC: No, no, no. That's all - it's all sanctioned by government agencies and all the appropriate permits, and it's all in the name of science. FLATOW: Eric, I'm not going to ask - oh, I will ask the obvious question, how do you make a penguin puke? ERIC: Well, part of it entails me sticking my finger down their throat. Mr. JANNOT: Awesome. ERIC: Yeah, it's not that great of a smell when it comes up either. FLATOW: You must have to hold them pretty tightly to get - are these Emperor penguins? ERIC: These are Adelie penguins. FLATOW: Adelie penguin. ERIC: Yeah, you kind of hold them like a football or like a bagpipe under your arm. And you kind of - when you stick your finger down, you kind of give him a little squeeze with your elbow to help things come up. Mr. JANNOT: Just to help, yeah. FLATOW: Right. You got to assist them. And so what do you learn? What their diet is, obviously. ERIC: Right. And actually what we're doing is we're looking at how their diet has been changing over the last 10-15 years because, well, because of the global warming and the sea ice has been declining down there and their major prey base - these shrimps and these krill - have been moving and have been changing also. And so that's kind of what we're looking at. FLATOW: How long did you have this job for? ERIC: Oh, I still have it. I just - I was down there this past January and we'll be going back again this coming January for another couple of months to start all over again. Mr. JANNOT: You're just refining your technique, I guess. ERIC: I am. I'm getting it down pat(ph). FLATOW: So you are a true specialist in what you do there? ERIC: I think so. I think so. FLATOW: Well, good luck to you and thank you, and have a nice trip down to the ice. ERIC: All right, thanks a lot. FLATOW: Bye, bye. Mr. JANNOT: I'm taking notes on these, you know, we're doing research for next year here on the air. FLATOW: I don't think you'll ever hear somebody say that they make penguins puke. Mr. JANNOT: I know. And it's not one we've come up - It's not one we had come upon and then rejected because it wasn't good enough. FLATOW: You see? You could sit around a table think - you know, brainstorming but there are some things that just. . . Mr. JANNOT:  Yes. Truth is far stranger than brainstorming. FLATOW: Let's go to number two on your list. Mr. JANNOT: Number two, working down from the top - oceanographer. Now this isn't the grand. . . FLATOW: You wouldn't think an oceanographer. . . Mr. JANNOT: You certainly wouldn't. And every year, there's one or two that kind of fall into this category of jobs that you would expect to be tremendous and that for certain reasons are less tremendous as you would - than you would think. In the first year, we had astronaut, you know, many people think that's one of the best jobs in the solar system. FLATOW: Yeah. Sure. Mr. JANNOT: But because A, many astronauts don't even make it into space, they have to suffer tremendous indignities and centrifuge training and all these stuff. FLATOW: Right. Right. Right. Mr. JANNOT: And they have the risk of getting killed and whatever. That made our list. Now, oceanographer, you know, this is in the category of, you know, spirit breaking. You know, you're a passionate scientist who's an oceanographer because he loves the sea. He loves sea animals. And every year, it's just more doom and gloom. And basically, you are the messenger and the discoverer of how bad things are getting. FLATOW: Another dead coral reef. Mr. JANNOT: Exactly. The coral reefs are, you know, going to be rubble. FLATOW: Another empty fishing ground gone. Mr. JANNOT: Exactly. FLATOW: Dragnets scraping the bottom. Mr. JANNOT: Yup. And you feel like - I mean, obviously, you wouldn't do it if you didn't feel like: A, the research was important; B, the research you're doing could have an effect. And obviously, one hopes that it will. But day in and day out, discoveries can be quite soul-zapping. FLATOW: I wonder what the rate of people going to, you know, into therapy is. Mr. JANNOT: Right. We had - I think it was our second year. . . FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. JANNOT: . . . one of the jobs we had was similar in a way. It was veterinarian. FLATOW: Right. Mr. JANNOT: And it was - the reason for this was that you get in - the veterinarians get into it. It's lab animal veterinarians, Number three in 2004. FLATOW: A lab animal. . . Mr. JANNOT: Lab animal veterinarian. You get into - you know, become a veterinarian because you love animals. FLATOW: Right. Mr. JANNOT: And then - but when you want to get into research, because you're serious about it, you realize that you've gone from making animals - taking sick animals and making them healthy to taking healthy animals and making them sick or killing them. FLATOW: All those mice you have to deal with. Mr. JANNOT: Yes, and worse. FLATOW: Right. Mr. JANNOT: So - and we had people caught in there saying that, yes, it does lead to, you know, psychological, you know, therapeutic and intervention necessary. So yeah, it can be spirit-crushing in some ways. FLATOW: All right. Let's see who else we got on the line. Let's go to Kaleb in Jamesville, Wisconsin. Hi. KALEB (Caller): Hi. How are you doing? FLATOW: Hi. There. KALEB: I'm definitely not going to top the guy with the penguin poop. Wow. Or the penguin - making the penguin throw up. I'm sorry. Wow. When I was a freshman at the University of Arizona, I was in microbiology, you know, going for my Bachelor's in Microbiology. And I got this great job in the laboratory. They were studying nitroform fixation in rats and insects. I thought it was fascinating. When I went in for the first day, they told me that what I'd be doing is cleaning out the containers where they stored the media that they grew E. coli in. But I'd be cleaning out the ones that went bad. Mr. JANNOT: Oh, nice. KALEB: Yeah. FLATOW: Oh, what a discovery on your first day of work. KALEB: Oh, wow. Everyday, when I got done with the work, my eyes were watering. You know, my throat hurts. I just - I came home, I couldn't do it. I had to quit the program and go off and do something else. It was terrible. FLATOW: What did that pay - that job? KALEB: $7. 50 an hour. FLATOW: Minimum wage. Mr. JANNOT: I thought you were going to tell me it was free. (Soundbite of laughter) KALEB: Well, they did invite me to the lab meetings, which would have been great for, you know, the whole learning experience thing, but after about a week I decided it really wasn't for me, you know? Mr. JANNOT: Wow. FLATOW: Wow. And you're doing something better now, I hope. KALEB: Well, I'm in IT. So. . . FLATOW: All right, Kaleb. Thanks for calling. KALEB: All right. Thank you. FLATOW: Bye, bye. 1-800-898-8255 is our number. We're talking about the worst jobs you can have at science on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News, with Mark Jannot, editor in chief of Popular Science. This month's issue called - well, it's got a picture of a dive from space on the cover but the article is about the worst jobs you can have in science. And if you've got one we want to know about, our number, 1-800-989-8255. Let's - a lot of - oh, some jobs here. Let's go to Todd(ph) in St. Louis. Hi, Todd. TODD (Caller): Hi. How are you doing today? FLATOW: Hi. TODD: Good. I guess I kind of consider my job a job of science. I operate a company called Traumatic Cleanup and Restoration. I clean up homicides, suicides and natural deaths. Mr. JANNOT: Hmm. Oh my goodness. That does not sound fun. FLATOW: How do you steel yourself for this? I mean, do you remember your first day on the job? TODD: Well, yeah. The first one that I've ever did was a - I think it was a 14-year-old Kid whose girlfriend broke up with him so he shot himself in the chest with like a . 357. And he had an arterial bleed so he had an adrenaline rush so jumped up off of the couch, ran throughout the house before, obviously, there was no more blood to pump out. FLATOW: If you're at California and you're eating lunch now. This is. . . TODD: We won't get to the part with the maggots until after lunch. FLATOW: Okay. And so your job is you go to these crime scenes and you clean them up. TODD: Right. Right. And I think the worst jobs there are are probably decompositions where someone's gone unfounded for say four to six weeks. And by that time, the flies are probably as big as dragonflies. They've got a pretty good food source. The odor is unbelievable. Many times, we have to tear out dry wall, carpet. If it's a wood floor, we have to completely remove the floor. We have to completely remove the source of the odor, obviously, before we can attempt to get the odor out of everything else, which it permeates anything that's porous. So anything that's in the house is basically ruined. We do run ozone generators to try to help mitigate the odor. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Just every case is different. FLATOW: With all these crime-scene shows on television, have you ever seen one that looked realistic enough for what you've seen? TODD: You know, I tried to watch \"CSI\" a couple of times and no, it just -going in and seeing it on my level, it's really hard to watch it on TV and say, oh, this is great, this is so real. Because, I mean, they do a good job but for the person that's not used to going in there and seeing all these, I guess that it's great. I mean, the show has great ratings. But for me, no. It doesn't do anything for me. Mr. JANNOT: How does one get inspired to go into this line of work? TODD: Well, my trade was a funeral director - mortician. And just going on various calls to remove bodies, people asked me probably 50 times - who can we call? Who can we call to do this? Because a shotgun under the chin is like sticking a stick of dynamite in someone's mouth and just lighting a fuse. It's just an explosion. It's all over the ceiling, walls, floors - you name it. And one day I just said, hey, I can make some money doing this. I've been doing it for 12 years. FLATOW: Well, Todd, I never thought I'd say this in earnest but it's a terrible job and somebody's got to do it. TODD: That's right. And every time I do a job, 99 percent of the time, the person always says, oh, we didn't know anyone like this existed. Well, yeah. And you hope that you don't have to use me again. But we have had repeat customers, believe it or not. Only a couple of times, but, unfortunately, some families have had a couple of suicides. FLATOW: All right, Todd. Thanks for calling. TODD: Thank you. FLATOW: If you've got a job that - we're having - can you top this hour at SCIENCE FRIDAY with terrible jobs? Mr. JANNOT: Bottom. Bottom this. FLATOW: Button this. They're hard to, really, to bottom them, with Mark Jannot, editor-in-chief of Popular Science magazine. Stay with us. We'll take a short break and come back and see if you can bottom this. We'll be right back. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow, with a program note on Monday's TALK OF THE NATION. When it comes to food, we're basically foragers. Joining Neal Conan, an author of \"Wasteland\", on reasons why we grab fruity pebbles instead of fresh fruits and what you can do about it. We're talking this hour about the worst jobs in science with my guest Mark Jannot, editor-in-chief of Popular Science, with their July issue, which features a rundown on 10 jobs they think are specially bad. And we're topping those today. Mr. JANNOT: Yeah. Not as bad as the listeners out there. FLATOW: Go ahead, Mark. Give me your number three. Mr. JANNOT: Number three, elephant vasectomist. Separating the boys from the pachyderms. FLATOW: Wow. Mr. JANNOT: Yeah. It doesn't pay to make a randy bull pachyderm angry. FLATOW: No. Mr. JANNOT: Which is why they use a dart to sedate them before they do this. But down in African wildlife parks, the elephants have been breeding too quickly and eating up more than their fair share of the surrounding habitat. So they've decided that they want to sterilize at least some of them. So they get out these - they sedate them, then they lift them up by a crane, cut open some incisions and the vas deference in the elephant is a centimeter thick. And they - which, you know, so they use big scissors in there to cut a couple inches out of it and then, you know, run as fast you can in the other direction before the guy wakes up. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Heather(ph) in Tucson. Hi, Heather. HEATHER (Caller): Hi. FLATOW: Hi there. You've got a terrible job? HEATHER: Well, not anymore. But years ago, I used to have a job rendering road kill for an archeological lab. They wanted to get the skeletons for their comparative collections. So we took things out of the freezer that people, like, collected over the last few years and boil them in a pot with detergent and then basically pulled everything apart with our fingers because we do not have much equipment in the lab. We were changing buildings and they've taken all the equipment with them. FLATOW: Wow. Mr. JANNOT: You know, that job was on our list the first year. HEATHER: Oh, really? FLATOW: That's right. That was on yours. Mr. JANNOT: It wasn't road kill, but it was a carcass cleanser for, you know, specimens that would, you know, they wanted to the skeletons for a natural, you know, history museums or whatever. And everyone had their own way of doing it. They had beetles that would eat away at the carcass, and they had, you know. . . HEATHER: Oh, we were not that sophisticated. Mr. JANNOT: Yeah. Well, I like your can-do spirit. HEATHER: Well, I'm now a forensic anthropologist and I spent a lot of time in mass graves and pretty fresh ones, including one that was under a pile of pig manure. And I can tell you, rendering road kill is worse. FLATOW: No kidding. Mr. JANNOT: Wow. All right. FLATOW: Do you remember there was a book out a few - about 10 years ago how to recognize road kill by it's silhouette? I can't remember the name of it. HEATHER: I missed that one. FLATOW: It followed - I think that followed the book how to recognize - how to recognize what bugs were splattered on your windshield. I think it followed -anyhow. So, that was the worst job. Wow. I can't imagine that. Thanks for calling, Heather. HEATHER: Sure. FLATOW: Glad you did it and not me. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's move up from number four, from elephant vasectomist to a little better than that one. Mr. JANNOT: A little better, yes. The margins here are very small in some cases. Garbologist is number four. Now, this is not - we didn't come up with the name garbologist. William Rathje of Stanford University calls himself a garbologist. He is a guy who, with his students, sifts through tons and tons of landfill garbage to, you know, discover things about how we, as consumers, you know. . . FLATOW: Right. Right. Mr. JANNOT: . . . consume things. And what, you know, what does or does not, you know, decompose fast or slow. One of - my favorite thing that they discovered was that there is a correlation between cat-ownership, which they decided had to do with litter - you know, they found litter in the garbage - and National Enquirer readers. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. JANNOT: I mean, I don't know if that actually overturned anyone's expectations. FLATOW: Well, wow. But the Enquirer was not in the cat litter box, was it? Mr. JANNOT: No. No. Well, I guess right nearby, you know? This is important research that's going on out there, Ira. FLATOW: This is important research. 1-800-989-8255. I think we have - boy, there are so many jobs here. Maybe we'll do a blog on this today. We'll get more people who could not submit their jobs. Let's go to - I think the last time we have John(ph) of Fort Wayne. Hi, John. JOHN (Caller): Howdy. When I was in college we had a local meatpacker and you had to transport the blood from the meatpacker to the people who rendered the meat or the waste and made blood meal. And you'd have to fill 50 gallon drums, half full, of blood so they could put them on these trucks. And it all got collected in this tank and you had to actually scoop this out and then it had to be inspected by the inspectors to make sure it was clean because it was a food-processing plant. Mr. JANNOT: Wow. JOHN: But you had to scoop blood, put it in these tanks and you also had to take the guts that didn't fall down the shoots and go into the tank or into the tank or into the fit the gallon drums properly. You had to shovel those with pitchforks. FLATOW: Wow. JOHN: And it was not an exciting job. FLATOW: All right, John, thanks for sharing that with us. JOHN: Yeah. FLATOW: Take care. I want to thank also Mark Jannot - thank you for coming by. . . Mr. JANNOT: Thank you. FLATOW: . . . who is the editor-in-chief of Popular Science. And their July issue features a rundown of 10 jobs that they think are especially bad, and they're as bad as the ones we've gotten here today. Thanks for joining us today. Mr. JANNOT: Sure.  I'm Ira Flatow, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  Sure, every job has good things and bad things about it, but what could be that great about studying garbage for a living or spending weeks on end strapped to a bed in the name of gravity research.  Well for four years, \"Popular Science\" magazine has come out with a yearly ranking of what it calls The Worst Jobs in Science. This one is written by Jason Daley with illustrations by Chris Gall. And joining me now to talk about the jobs - and maybe you have a job of your own. I mentioned before the break, if you've got a really terrible job in science, in a laboratory - wherever you work - we want to hear about it. Our number 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK.  Mark Jannot is editor-in-chief of Popular Science, and he's here to talk with us about this issue. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Mr. MARK JANNOT (Editor-in-Chief, Popular Science): Thank you, Ira.  FLATOW: Whose idea was this idea anyway?  Mr. JANNOT: Well, it was a sort of collective eureka moment, I think. About four or five years ago, we were sitting in a conference room, you know, brainstorming ideas, and someone mentioned the notion of doing, you know, a classic sort of rundown of the best jobs in science.  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. JANNOT: And I think we all sort of yawned collectively and said, oh, God, the best jobs in science A, people are going to expect that to be, actually, objective in some way, or they're going to - they're going to expect it to be a sort of rigorous selection process there. And B, you know, the best jobs are all going to be kind of good in similar ways, but. . .  FLATOW: Yeah.  Mr. JANNOT: . . . but maybe there's a different way to go at it. Maybe we could do the worst jobs and - oh my God. That's brilliance, you know.  FLATOW: So you hired a blue ribbon panel of experts to come in and judge, right?  Mr. JANNOT: Yes. Well, that first year, we hired a tremendous freelancer named Speed Weed who. . .  FLATOW: Is that right?  Mr. JANNOT: No kidding. And he contacted a thousand or more scientists and science professionals and researchers and drudges and whatever, and took as many nominations as he could. And then we, we just put it to a vote, basically, of our staff. There was truly nothing scientific about the ranking especially. Well, about any of it, really.  FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah.  Mr. JANNOT: It's just, you know, come up with some really noxious, horrible jobs. . .  FLATOW: Well. . .  Mr. JANNOT: . . . that cast some interesting perspective on science and we'll vote as a staff on which ones are really the worst.  FLATOW: Right. Let's go to some of your picture. Top 10. Give me your number 10 pick.  Mr. JANNOT: Number 10. I love the fact that this is number 10, which means there are nine worse jobs than this. This is the whale feces researcher. These are basically scientists who trail along behind right whales out in the ocean, waiting for them to do their jobs, so they can, you know, scoop it up, get their big pooper-scooper out there and then analyze it for - to, you know, to study the whales themselves and in an obviously much, you know, non-invasive way.  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. JANNOT: It's, you know, it scores high on the smelly noxious . . .  FLATOW: Yuck factor.  Mr. JANNOT: . . . yuck factor scale, which is almost a guarantee. Every year, there's some very high-scoring yuck factor jobs in our list. So yeah - but, you know, like almost every one of these jobs, there is legitimate and important research going on here. And, you know, as - like most of the rest of the jobs also, the researchers themselves are incredulous when they hear, you know, when they get a call from us actually suggesting that they have one of the worst jobs in science, because think it's. . .  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. JANNOT: I guess the smell of the salty sea air is great until they get upon their prey, you know. . .  FLATOW: I'm sure. But what. . .  Mr. JANNOT: And they captured it on film recently, the first time they think that they actually got a whale fart on film. It formed a big bubble and then popped, and then you can imagine the smell of that.  FLATOW: It must be number one on YouTube.  Mr. JANNOT: Exactly.  FLATOW: Speaking of one, let's go right to the number one job that you had.  Mr. JANNOT: Number one. Well, you'll see a trend here. Number one this year is the hazmat diver. These are highly trained divers who go into a - basically they swim through sewage. Enough said. They go through sewage. They go through a swim in nuclear reactors and toxic waste spills to clean up those waste spills.  There is - the worst example that we found was a guy, a hazmat diver, who had to dive into a trough of pig excrements that someone had fallen into and died, and to retrieve the body, basically. So you've got, you know, death - rotting corpses and, you know, pig poop he has to deal with all at the same time.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. John(ph)is from Minneapolis. Hi, have you got a job as bad as that?  JOHN (Caller): Actually, my job right now is very good, but I used to have a pretty poor job. Not quite as bad as swimming in poop, but I got to weigh it in little dishes and put it in the oven.  FLATOW: Hmm. And to what end?  JOHN: I was working for the sewage treatment plant in Saint Paul, Minnesota. And it was gravimetric analysis of the sewage at every point to determine the solids that they were taking out of the water.  FLATOW: Right.  JOHN: So you would weigh the sewage and - before and after drying and before and after burning it.  FLATOW: Did you have to have special clothing for this?  JOHN: No (unintelligible).  FLATOW: You weren't going in with your flip-flops on, I don't think.  Mr. JANNOT: Special gas masks, perhaps?  JOHN: No. No funny clothes, really. It was pretty much a lab job, but it stunk pretty bad.  Mr. JANNOT: Nothing to protect you from major (unintelligible).  FLATOW: Well, it's good that you don't have that now, part-time job I was hoping.  JOHN: Yeah, yeah. I like what I'm doing now a lot better.  FLATOW: All right. Thanks for calling.  JOHN: Yup(ph).  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Let's work our way up down again from nine. Let's see at number nine on your list.  Mr. JANNOT: Number nine this year - forensic entomologist. Of course, this is sort of a sexy job, I suppose, these days with CSI being so popular. But you know, entomology, as you well know Ira, is the study of bugs, and forensic entomology is the study of bugs on corpses - so it's sort of like two great tastes that go great together or something like that - you get to hang around rotting corpses.  And I found in - this year, the guy that we interviewed, that Jason Daley interviewed, really proves to me that it takes an entirely different breed of human to do this. I mean, the first guy that he end up working on, he was - a detective at the local police department called him in because he knew he was an entomologist and studied bugs, and he said, you know, I've got this corpse I really need to figure out when he died or whatever. And the guy, it turned out, was a guy that this guy knew and had breakfast with regularly. And - but he just got so into it, he's like, wow, actually I found some maggots in his eyes. And then I, oh, and in his mouth, and God, was so cool, you know. . .  FLATOW: Right. Okay, (unintelligible).  Mr. JANNOT: Yes, yes.  FLATOW: I think we've had him on the show. Oh, years ago, yeah. This is a great pick I think. Because I can't think - they have a laboratory where the bodies lie around in the backyard and decay there.  Mr. JANNOT: They let them decay. They use pig, pigs also, I think, to study. So they can compare. I think pigs and human decay are the same. . .  FLATOW: May not be PC anymore to use real bodies. But they used to use real corpses. . .  Mr. JANNOT: Yeah.  FLATOW: . . . in different positions. So, that's a terrible job. All right, I want you  - any of these, as you say, could be number one.  FLATOW: Yes, exactly.  Mr. JANNOT: Exactly. There's - we often get into a, you know, debates and fisticuffs in the office.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. JANNOT: Different people have their job that they're advocating for.  FLATOW: Let's speak to somebody on the line. Hi, Eric(ph) in Madison. Hi welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  ERIC (Caller): Hello. Thank you for taking my call.  FLATOW: Hi, go ahead. What is your worst job?  ERIC: Well, I actually - I make penguins puke.  (Soundbite of laughter)  ERIC: In Antarctica, I study the diet and foraging behavior of Adelie penguins on the Antarctic Peninsula, which entails me making them puke.  FLATOW: Isn't that against the law or the treaty or something?  ERIC: No, no, no. That's all - it's all sanctioned by government agencies and all the appropriate permits, and it's all in the name of science.  FLATOW: Eric, I'm not going to ask - oh, I will ask the obvious question, how do you make a penguin puke?  ERIC: Well, part of it entails me sticking my finger down their throat.  Mr. JANNOT: Awesome.  ERIC: Yeah, it's not that great of a smell when it comes up either.  FLATOW: You must have to hold them pretty tightly to get - are these Emperor penguins?  ERIC: These are Adelie penguins.  FLATOW: Adelie penguin.  ERIC: Yeah, you kind of hold them like a football or like a bagpipe under your arm. And you kind of - when you stick your finger down, you kind of give him a little squeeze with your elbow to help things come up.  Mr. JANNOT: Just to help, yeah.  FLATOW: Right. You got to assist them. And so what do you learn? What their diet is, obviously.  ERIC: Right. And actually what we're doing is we're looking at how their diet has been changing over the last 10-15 years because, well, because of the global warming and the sea ice has been declining down there and their major prey base - these shrimps and these krill - have been moving and have been changing also. And so that's kind of what we're looking at.  FLATOW: How long did you have this job for?  ERIC: Oh, I still have it. I just - I was down there this past January and we'll be going back again this coming January for another couple of months to start all over again.  Mr. JANNOT: You're just refining your technique, I guess.  ERIC: I am. I'm getting it down pat(ph).  FLATOW: So you are a true specialist in what you do there?  ERIC: I think so. I think so.  FLATOW: Well, good luck to you and thank you, and have a nice trip down to the ice.  ERIC: All right, thanks a lot.  FLATOW: Bye, bye.  Mr. JANNOT: I'm taking notes on these, you know, we're doing research for next year here on the air.  FLATOW: I don't think you'll ever hear somebody say that they make penguins puke.  Mr. JANNOT: I know. And it's not one we've come up - It's not one we had come upon and then rejected because it wasn't good enough.  FLATOW: You see? You could sit around a table think - you know, brainstorming but there are some things that just. . .  Mr. JANNOT:  Yes. Truth is far stranger than brainstorming.  FLATOW: Let's go to number two on your list.  Mr. JANNOT: Number two, working down from the top - oceanographer. Now this isn't the grand. . .  FLATOW: You wouldn't think an oceanographer. . .  Mr. JANNOT: You certainly wouldn't. And every year, there's one or two that kind of fall into this category of jobs that you would expect to be tremendous and that for certain reasons are less tremendous as you would - than you would think.  In the first year, we had astronaut, you know, many people think that's one of the best jobs in the solar system.  FLATOW: Yeah. Sure.  Mr. JANNOT: But because A, many astronauts don't even make it into space, they have to suffer tremendous indignities and centrifuge training and all these stuff.  FLATOW: Right. Right. Right.  Mr. JANNOT: And they have the risk of getting killed and whatever. That made our list. Now, oceanographer, you know, this is in the category of, you know, spirit breaking. You know, you're a passionate scientist who's an oceanographer because he loves the sea. He loves sea animals. And every year, it's just more doom and gloom. And basically, you are the messenger and the discoverer of how bad things are getting.  FLATOW: Another dead coral reef.  Mr. JANNOT: Exactly. The coral reefs are, you know, going to be rubble.  FLATOW: Another empty fishing ground gone.  Mr. JANNOT: Exactly.  FLATOW: Dragnets scraping the bottom.  Mr. JANNOT: Yup. And you feel like - I mean, obviously, you wouldn't do it if you didn't feel like: A, the research was important; B, the research you're doing could have an effect. And obviously, one hopes that it will. But day in and day out, discoveries can be quite soul-zapping.  FLATOW: I wonder what the rate of people going to, you know, into therapy is.  Mr. JANNOT: Right. We had - I think it was our second year. . .  FLATOW: Yeah.  Mr. JANNOT: . . . one of the jobs we had was similar in a way. It was veterinarian.  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. JANNOT: And it was - the reason for this was that you get in - the veterinarians get into it. It's lab animal veterinarians, Number three in 2004.  FLATOW: A lab animal. . .  Mr. JANNOT: Lab animal veterinarian. You get into - you know, become a veterinarian because you love animals.  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. JANNOT: And then - but when you want to get into research, because you're serious about it, you realize that you've gone from making animals - taking sick animals and making them healthy to taking healthy animals and making them sick or killing them.  FLATOW: All those mice you have to deal with.  Mr. JANNOT: Yes, and worse.  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. JANNOT: So - and we had people caught in there saying that, yes, it does lead to, you know, psychological, you know, therapeutic and intervention necessary. So yeah, it can be spirit-crushing in some ways.  FLATOW: All right. Let's see who else we got on the line. Let's go to Kaleb in Jamesville, Wisconsin. Hi.  KALEB (Caller): Hi. How are you doing?  FLATOW: Hi. There.  KALEB: I'm definitely not going to top the guy with the penguin poop. Wow. Or the penguin - making the penguin throw up. I'm sorry. Wow.  When I was a freshman at the University of Arizona, I was in microbiology, you know, going for my Bachelor's in Microbiology. And I got this great job in the laboratory. They were studying nitroform fixation in rats and insects. I thought it was fascinating. When I went in for the first day, they told me that what I'd be doing is cleaning out the containers where they stored the media that they grew E. coli in. But I'd be cleaning out the ones that went bad.  Mr. JANNOT: Oh, nice.  KALEB: Yeah.  FLATOW: Oh, what a discovery on your first day of work.  KALEB: Oh, wow. Everyday, when I got done with the work, my eyes were watering. You know, my throat hurts. I just - I came home, I couldn't do it. I had to quit the program and go off and do something else. It was terrible.  FLATOW: What did that pay - that job?  KALEB: $7. 50 an hour.  FLATOW: Minimum wage.  Mr. JANNOT: I thought you were going to tell me it was free.  (Soundbite of laughter)  KALEB: Well, they did invite me to the lab meetings, which would have been great for, you know, the whole learning experience thing, but after about a week I decided it really wasn't for me, you know?  Mr. JANNOT: Wow.  FLATOW: Wow. And you're doing something better now, I hope.  KALEB: Well, I'm in IT. So. . .  FLATOW: All right, Kaleb. Thanks for calling.  KALEB: All right. Thank you.  FLATOW: Bye, bye. 1-800-898-8255 is our number. We're talking about the worst jobs you can have at science on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News, with Mark Jannot, editor in chief of Popular Science. This month's issue called - well, it's got a picture of a dive from space on the cover but the article is about the worst jobs you can have in science.  And if you've got one we want to know about, our number, 1-800-989-8255. Let's - a lot of - oh, some jobs here. Let's go to Todd(ph) in St. Louis. Hi, Todd.  TODD (Caller): Hi. How are you doing today?  FLATOW: Hi.  TODD: Good. I guess I kind of consider my job a job of science. I operate a company called Traumatic Cleanup and Restoration. I clean up homicides, suicides and natural deaths.  Mr. JANNOT: Hmm. Oh my goodness. That does not sound fun.  FLATOW: How do you steel yourself for this? I mean, do you remember your first day on the job?  TODD: Well, yeah. The first one that I've ever did was a - I think it was a 14-year-old Kid whose girlfriend broke up with him so he shot himself in the chest with like a . 357. And he had an arterial bleed so he had an adrenaline rush so jumped up off of the couch, ran throughout the house before, obviously, there was no more blood to pump out.  FLATOW: If you're at California and you're eating lunch now. This is. . .  TODD: We won't get to the part with the maggots until after lunch.  FLATOW: Okay. And so your job is you go to these crime scenes and you clean them up.  TODD: Right. Right. And I think the worst jobs there are are probably decompositions where someone's gone unfounded for say four to six weeks. And by that time, the flies are probably as big as dragonflies. They've got a pretty good food source. The odor is unbelievable. Many times, we have to tear out dry wall, carpet. If it's a wood floor, we have to completely remove the floor. We have to completely remove the source of the odor, obviously, before we can attempt to get the odor out of everything else, which it permeates anything that's porous.  So anything that's in the house is basically ruined. We do run ozone generators to try to help mitigate the odor. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Just every case is different.  FLATOW: With all these crime-scene shows on television, have you ever seen one that looked realistic enough for what you've seen?  TODD: You know, I tried to watch \"CSI\" a couple of times and no, it just -going in and seeing it on my level, it's really hard to watch it on TV and say, oh, this is great, this is so real. Because, I mean, they do a good job but for the person that's not used to going in there and seeing all these, I guess that it's great. I mean, the show has great ratings. But for me, no. It doesn't do anything for me.  Mr. JANNOT: How does one get inspired to go into this line of work?  TODD: Well, my trade was a funeral director - mortician. And just going on various calls to remove bodies, people asked me probably 50 times - who can we call? Who can we call to do this? Because a shotgun under the chin is like sticking a stick of dynamite in someone's mouth and just lighting a fuse. It's just an explosion. It's all over the ceiling, walls, floors - you name it. And one day I just said, hey, I can make some money doing this. I've been doing it for 12 years.  FLATOW: Well, Todd, I never thought I'd say this in earnest but it's a terrible job and somebody's got to do it.  TODD: That's right. And every time I do a job, 99 percent of the time, the person always says, oh, we didn't know anyone like this existed. Well, yeah. And you hope that you don't have to use me again. But we have had repeat customers, believe it or not. Only a couple of times, but, unfortunately, some families have had a couple of suicides.  FLATOW: All right, Todd. Thanks for calling.  TODD: Thank you.  FLATOW: If you've got a job that - we're having - can you top this hour at SCIENCE FRIDAY with terrible jobs?  Mr. JANNOT: Bottom. Bottom this.  FLATOW: Button this. They're hard to, really, to bottom them, with Mark Jannot, editor-in-chief of Popular Science magazine. Stay with us. We'll take a short break and come back and see if you can bottom this. We'll be right back.  I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow, with a program note on Monday's TALK OF THE NATION. When it comes to food, we're basically foragers. Joining Neal Conan, an author of \"Wasteland\", on reasons why we grab fruity pebbles instead of fresh fruits and what you can do about it.  We're talking this hour about the worst jobs in science with my guest Mark Jannot, editor-in-chief of Popular Science, with their July issue, which features a rundown on 10 jobs they think are specially bad. And we're topping those today.  Mr. JANNOT: Yeah. Not as bad as the listeners out there.  FLATOW: Go ahead, Mark. Give me your number three.  Mr. JANNOT: Number three, elephant vasectomist. Separating the boys from the pachyderms.  FLATOW: Wow.  Mr. JANNOT: Yeah. It doesn't pay to make a randy bull pachyderm angry.  FLATOW: No.  Mr. JANNOT: Which is why they use a dart to sedate them before they do this. But down in African wildlife parks, the elephants have been breeding too quickly and eating up more than their fair share of the surrounding habitat. So they've decided that they want to sterilize at least some of them. So they get out these - they sedate them, then they lift them up by a crane, cut open some incisions and the vas deference in the elephant is a centimeter thick. And they - which, you know, so they use big scissors in there to cut a couple inches out of it and then, you know, run as fast you can in the other direction before the guy wakes up.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Heather(ph) in Tucson. Hi, Heather.  HEATHER (Caller): Hi.  FLATOW: Hi there. You've got a terrible job?  HEATHER: Well, not anymore. But years ago, I used to have a job rendering road kill for an archeological lab. They wanted to get the skeletons for their comparative collections. So we took things out of the freezer that people, like, collected over the last few years and boil them in a pot with detergent and then basically pulled everything apart with our fingers because we do not have much equipment in the lab. We were changing buildings and they've taken all the equipment with them.  FLATOW: Wow.  Mr. JANNOT: You know, that job was on our list the first year.  HEATHER: Oh, really?  FLATOW: That's right. That was on yours.  Mr. JANNOT: It wasn't road kill, but it was a carcass cleanser for, you know, specimens that would, you know, they wanted to the skeletons for a natural, you know, history museums or whatever. And everyone had their own way of doing it. They had beetles that would eat away at the carcass, and they had, you know. . .  HEATHER: Oh, we were not that sophisticated.  Mr. JANNOT: Yeah. Well, I like your can-do spirit.  HEATHER: Well, I'm now a forensic anthropologist and I spent a lot of time in mass graves and pretty fresh ones, including one that was under a pile of pig manure. And I can tell you, rendering road kill is worse.  FLATOW: No kidding.  Mr. JANNOT: Wow. All right.  FLATOW: Do you remember there was a book out a few - about 10 years ago how to recognize road kill by it's silhouette? I can't remember the name of it.  HEATHER: I missed that one.  FLATOW: It followed - I think that followed the book how to recognize - how to recognize what bugs were splattered on your windshield. I think it followed -anyhow. So, that was the worst job. Wow. I can't imagine that. Thanks for calling, Heather.  HEATHER: Sure.  FLATOW: Glad you did it and not me.  1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's move up from number four, from elephant vasectomist to a little better than that one.  Mr. JANNOT: A little better, yes. The margins here are very small in some cases. Garbologist is number four. Now, this is not - we didn't come up with the name garbologist. William Rathje of Stanford University calls himself a garbologist. He is a guy who, with his students, sifts through tons and tons of landfill garbage to, you know, discover things about how we, as consumers, you know. . .  FLATOW: Right. Right.  Mr. JANNOT: . . . consume things. And what, you know, what does or does not, you know, decompose fast or slow. One of - my favorite thing that they discovered was that there is a correlation between cat-ownership, which they decided had to do with litter - you know, they found litter in the garbage - and National Enquirer readers.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. JANNOT: I mean, I don't know if that actually overturned anyone's expectations.  FLATOW: Well, wow. But the Enquirer was not in the cat litter box, was it?  Mr. JANNOT: No. No. Well, I guess right nearby, you know? This is important research that's going on out there, Ira.  FLATOW: This is important research. 1-800-989-8255. I think we have - boy, there are so many jobs here. Maybe we'll do a blog on this today. We'll get more people who could not submit their jobs. Let's go to - I think the last time we have John(ph) of Fort Wayne. Hi, John.  JOHN (Caller): Howdy. When I was in college we had a local meatpacker and you had to transport the blood from the meatpacker to the people who rendered the meat or the waste and made blood meal. And you'd have to fill 50 gallon drums, half full, of blood so they could put them on these trucks. And it all got collected in this tank and you had to actually scoop this out and then it had to be inspected by the inspectors to make sure it was clean because it was a food-processing plant.  Mr. JANNOT: Wow.  JOHN: But you had to scoop blood, put it in these tanks and you also had to take the guts that didn't fall down the shoots and go into the tank or into the tank or into the fit the gallon drums properly. You had to shovel those with pitchforks.  FLATOW: Wow.  JOHN: And it was not an exciting job.  FLATOW: All right, John, thanks for sharing that with us.  JOHN: Yeah.  FLATOW: Take care. I want to thank also Mark Jannot - thank you for coming by. . .  Mr. JANNOT: Thank you.  FLATOW: . . . who is the editor-in-chief of Popular Science. And their July issue features a rundown of 10 jobs that they think are especially bad, and they're as bad as the ones we've gotten here today. Thanks for joining us today.  Mr. JANNOT: Sure.

I'm Ira Flatow. A bit later in the hour, we'll talk about energy policy and the future of coal. But first, for the second time in less than a year, President Bush vetoed an embryonic stem cell bill passed by Congress. The bill would have given federal funding to scientists working on new embryonic stem cell lines. The president says his veto represents the ethical principles that America was founded on. But do Americans agree with this decision? New research published online yesterday by the journal Science suggests the White House is out of touch with the country. In the study, a survey of infertility patients found that over a half of the patients, 60 percent, said they would like to donate their unused frozen embryos to stem cell research. Here to talk about the study is its lead author, Dr. Anne Lyerly. Dr. Lyerly is an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. She's also spent time studying bioethics at both Johns Hopkins and Duke, focusing on women's medical issues. Welcome to the program, Dr. Lyerly. Dr. ANNE DRAPKIN LYERLY (Associate Professor, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Duke University): Thank you. I'm delighted to be here. FLATOW: Tell us how you came about to do this survey. Dr. LYERLY: Well, I started this work about six years ago when I was finishing up my work in bioethics at Johns Hopkins. And there were really two observations that made me want to do this. The first was that in my work with infertility doctors, what I learned was that their patients who had embryos remaining after treatment were oftentimes having a hard time figuring out what to do with these leftover embryos. It turned out that it was a difficult moral decision for them. It was actually these very same embryos that lawmakers and my colleagues in bioethics were debating about, and the perspectives of the people who were facing the very personal moral decision about what to do with these embryos were really absent from the debate. FLATOW: See if you can\u2026 Dr. LYERLY: So I wanted to learn. FLATOW: Yeah, see - so tell us about this study and how you did it, what you learned. Dr. LYERLY: Well, we started by just interviewing about 50 infertility patients, just to get a handle on the sorts of concerns they were having when thinking about their embryos, that we then developed a survey that was 12 pages long, which we validated by a number of methods. And then, I identified collaborators at nine infertility centers across the country who would be willing to participate in the study. And each of these sites randomly selected 300 patients to be sent the survey. FLATOW: So you got over 1,200 patients in total? Dr. LYERLY: Well, we sent it out to over 2,000, and we had a 60 percent response rate, so about 1,200. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And you asked them what? And they said that 60 percent - if I read the data correctly - 60 percent said they would donate their stem - their embryos to stem cell research. Dr. LYERLY: Right. Well, we asked them, given the embryos you have stored right now, how likely would you be to donate them to research, donate them to stem cell research, thaw and discard them, or give them to another couple. And as you say, 50 percent said they would be likely to donate them to medical research. And then when we asked about specific kinds of research, including stem cell research, that number went up to 60 percent. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Is there any way to expand this to the - to the population in general? Or is this, basically, you're talking about people who've actually gone through this process? Dr. LYERLY: Well, in our study, we tried to get a representative sample. They were geographically diverse and represented people who had had care both in big academic centers and big private centers and smaller centers. And so when we looked at these data, we did in our paper try to think about how if these were applied to the whole population of infertility patients, what that would mean in terms of potential embryos\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. LYERLY: \u2026available for stem cell research. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So your study, actually, then found a disconnect between what these patients actually want to do and what - what clinics and politicians are saying about what they want to do with it. Dr. LYERLY: Well, there was a difference when - about three years ago, there was a study that said only three percent of the embryos that are currently stored are intended to be donated for research purposes. So our findings were surprising in that way that when we actually asked patients themselves what they wanted to do with the embryos, we could increase the estimates of the proportion that would be willing to donate embryos to research by at least a factor of 10. So there was a difference - sort of a disconnect between what clinics understood were the intentions for the embryos and what the patients themselves said. And then, of course, there is also the disconnect between current public policy and the wishes of these patients. So their preferred option for disposition is donation for research, but this may not be an available option for them. And so they would have to either discard them or donate them to another couple hoping to have a baby. FLATOW: So then, if all these people who said they would donate their embryos actually did donate their embryos, how many new stem cell lines might we have? Dr. LYERLY: Well, we calculated that in our paper and our conservative estimate was that there would be between 2,000 and 3,000 embryonic stem cell lines available for research. As you know, currently, there's only 20 stem cell lines that are available for federal funds, and all of the currently available stem cell lines are felt to be contaminated. So they're not safe for therapy in humans. But if new stem cell lines are developed, these problems would be avoided, we can presume. And so that not only could we increase the number of stem cell lines by a hundred times, but they would be useful for human therapies if we got to that point. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. But I think most people believe that under the current regulation that the president has put into effect, patients are unable to donate any of their embryos. Dr. LYERLY: Well, that is probably broadly suspected, but it's not completely true. There are - donation of embryos for research is legal in almost every state. It is just research using embryos. Research that destroys embryos and research using stem cell lines derived after 2001 is not available for federal funding. But there are some private and state funds that will fund this research, but it's excluded from anybody who's using federal funding. FLATOW: So if you could donate your embryos to private research, you could still have them become useful? Dr. LYERLY: Right. FLATOW: Yeah. And is there any way from those embryos, then, to find their way from private to a laboratory, let's say, that has federal money? Dr. LYERLY: Not right now. So laboratories that have federal money right now can only use the 20 cell lines that President Bush identified back in 2001. FLATOW: Right. Dr. LYERLY: So that is really essentially what the Embryonic Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act was aimed at doing, was if these stem cell lines are derived, then federal funding can be used for them. FLATOW: Do you think this is going to come up in Congress again? We're going to have another go around with this? Dr. LYERLY: Oh, certainly. Certainly it will. FLATOW: When we might see that? Within months, within years, or what kind of time frame do you think? Dr. LYERLY: Oh, my understanding is that they're working on the next thing right now. So I think we'll see it again soon. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And your survey - you sent out 2,000 questionnaires - did they go around the country with a certain demographics? Because we know, probably, certain people in certain parts of the country feel one way and others feel another way. Dr. LYERLY: Well, probably. But, yeah, we had every major Census Bureau region represented. So I think it's fairly representative of the population of infertility patients. Although, you know, we didn't just randomly sample all of them, which is, of course, impossible because lists of people who have embryos in storage are not accessible to anybody and shouldn't be accessible to anybody, except their doctors. FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah. Let me ask you this question - because we're running out of time - to find out why do you think the people with these embryos decided that scientific research is a good destination for them? Dr. LYERLY: Well, I mean, I think one of the things that we learned both in our qualitative work and from this big survey was that many of the people who face these very personal decisions about reproduction reason in, perhaps, different ways than other folks do who don't have the same relationship with embryos. And so, it struck me that there's probably at least two reasons. One, certainly, is a belief that stem cell research is valuable and they've invested a lot in these embryos and they want them to be used for something good if they're not used for them to make babies with. The other point is a little bit more of a subtle point. But what we also found was that only 22 percent of the people in the survey would be willing to donate their embryos to another couple. And when that number is broken down, only six percent would be very likely to donate their embryos to another couple. FLATOW: Hmm. What we heard when we had talked to folks before was less a worry about the moral concerns of, you know, destroying embryos, which have dominated the political debate. Is it ethically acceptable to destroy a human embryo? What we really heard from these people was moral concern about the embryos becoming children, but not raised by them, not within their homes, and their families, and with their love. And\u2026 FLATOW: Well, I've got to say goodbye. We've run out of time. Thank you, Dr. Lyerly for taking that interview. Dr. LYERLY: Well, thank you. FLATOW: You're welcome. Anne Lyerly, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University. We're going to take a short break, come back and talk more about energy. So stay with us, we'll be right back. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  A bit later in the hour, we'll talk about energy policy and the future of coal.  But first, for the second time in less than a year, President Bush vetoed an embryonic stem cell bill passed by Congress. The bill would have given federal funding to scientists working on new embryonic stem cell lines. The president says his veto represents the ethical principles that America was founded on. But do Americans agree with this decision? New research published online yesterday by the journal Science suggests the White House is out of touch with the country. In the study, a survey of infertility patients found that over a half of the patients, 60 percent, said they would like to donate their unused frozen embryos to stem cell research.  Here to talk about the study is its lead author, Dr. Anne Lyerly. Dr. Lyerly is an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. She's also spent time studying bioethics at both Johns Hopkins and Duke, focusing on women's medical issues. Welcome to the program, Dr. Lyerly.  Dr. ANNE DRAPKIN LYERLY (Associate Professor, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Duke University): Thank you. I'm delighted to be here.  FLATOW: Tell us how you came about to do this survey.  Dr. LYERLY: Well, I started this work about six years ago when I was finishing up my work in bioethics at Johns Hopkins. And there were really two observations that made me want to do this. The first was that in my work with infertility doctors, what I learned was that their patients who had embryos remaining after treatment were oftentimes having a hard time figuring out what to do with these leftover embryos. It turned out that it was a difficult moral decision for them. It was actually these very same embryos that lawmakers and my colleagues in bioethics were debating about, and the perspectives of the people who were facing the very personal moral decision about what to do with these embryos were really absent from the debate.  FLATOW: See if you can\u2026  Dr. LYERLY: So I wanted to learn.  FLATOW: Yeah, see - so tell us about this study and how you did it, what you learned.  Dr. LYERLY: Well, we started by just interviewing about 50 infertility patients, just to get a handle on the sorts of concerns they were having when thinking about their embryos, that we then developed a survey that was 12 pages long, which we validated by a number of methods. And then, I identified collaborators at nine infertility centers across the country who would be willing to participate in the study. And each of these sites randomly selected 300 patients to be sent the survey.  FLATOW: So you got over 1,200 patients in total?  Dr. LYERLY: Well, we sent it out to over 2,000, and we had a 60 percent response rate, so about 1,200.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And you asked them what? And they said that 60 percent - if I read the data correctly - 60 percent said they would donate their stem - their embryos to stem cell research.  Dr. LYERLY: Right. Well, we asked them, given the embryos you have stored right now, how likely would you be to donate them to research, donate them to stem cell research, thaw and discard them, or give them to another couple. And as you say, 50 percent said they would be likely to donate them to medical research. And then when we asked about specific kinds of research, including stem cell research, that number went up to 60 percent.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Is there any way to expand this to the - to the population in general? Or is this, basically, you're talking about people who've actually gone through this process?  Dr. LYERLY: Well, in our study, we tried to get a representative sample. They were geographically diverse and represented people who had had care both in big academic centers and big private centers and smaller centers. And so when we looked at these data, we did in our paper try to think about how if these were applied to the whole population of infertility patients, what that would mean in terms of potential embryos\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. LYERLY: \u2026available for stem cell research.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So your study, actually, then found a disconnect between what these patients actually want to do and what - what clinics and politicians are saying about what they want to do with it.  Dr. LYERLY: Well, there was a difference when - about three years ago, there was a study that said only three percent of the embryos that are currently stored are intended to be donated for research purposes. So our findings were surprising in that way that when we actually asked patients themselves what they wanted to do with the embryos, we could increase the estimates of the proportion that would be willing to donate embryos to research by at least a factor of 10.

Tracing your family history is, you know, is a big pastime for many folks. But if you've ever tried it like I have, you'll know that building a complete picture of your family tree takes a good, hard detective work and more than a little luck. But there is a high-tech solution; high-tech help is on the way. This week, one genealogy-related Web site, ancestry. com, an asset that was teaming up with the genetics lab to offer itself, offer you a handy-dandy home DNA test kit. So starting later this summer, you can compare your DNA to that of other people who have chosen to file their genetic patterns in the company's DNA database. And who knows? Maybe you'll find some distantly related person with whom you can compare notes, discover a remote relative, who knows? Maybe there's somebody you know you want to send them a kit, right? So, you know what? I think we're related. Okay, send me a kit, we'll do this DNA thing ourselves and see if there's anything to it. Joining me now is Megan Smolenyak. She is chief family historian for ancestry. com, and the co-author of the book, \"Trace Your Roots with DNA Using Genetic Tests to Explore your Family Tree. \" She joins us by phone from New Jersey. Welcome back to the program. Ms. MEGAN SMOLENYAK (Chief Family Historian, Ancestry. com; Co-Author, \"Trace Your Roots with DNA Using Genetic Tests to Explore your Family Tree\"): Thank you. FLATOW: Is it basically that simple what I said, how I described it? Ms. SMOLENYAK: It's pretty straightforward. It's mostly a matchmaking game. Basically, you take a DNA test and it's like conventional databases. Normally you would be searching for, say, other John Smiths. This time the databases are comparing a bunch of numbers that you got from your DNA results. And whenever you find somebody who's a match with you, that's when you want to start comparing notes. And obviously, you're particularly interested in anybody who shares the same surname. . . FLATOW: Right. Ms. SMOLENYAK: And has the same genetic signature. FLATOW: So what do you get in this kit? Ms. SMOLENYAK: It's straightforward. It's a mouth swab. Usually, you get two of them, just to be sure. And you just scrape the inside of your cheek and you have the paperwork, you fill that out and just send it right back. And about two or three weeks later, you get your results. FLATOW: Now, when you say get your results. I mean, it's not going to be a little sad - it's not going to be something that you understand, is it? What is it going to tell you? Ms. SMOLENYAK: As I said, the results are usually a piled numbers and people try to - they make themselves crazy trying to read some meaning into it. And I tell people just to think of it as parts list. It doesn't mean anything. It doesn't mean you're going to have blue eyes or be short or anything like that. It's mostly junk DNA. But you use it for the matchmaking game. So you use the databases and you compare, you look for anybody else who's a close fit and hopefully, you end up matching somebody who's done a little more homework than you have. So for instance, last year, I was speaking in Oklahoma. There was a Shields in the audience and I happen to belong to the Shields surname project. And he decided to join us. It's a tiny project, only 16 people. He met somebody perfectly, shot him off an e-mail, poof, 450 new relatives. FLATOW: Wow. Ms. SMOLENYAK: Yeah. FLATOW: Wow. Ms. SMOLENYAK: Yeah. FLATOW: They may not be good news. . . (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. SMOLENYAK: Just what kind of relatives are you looking for? FLATOW: If somebody found you after all of those years and you owed them money or something like that. Ms. SMOLENYAK: Yeah, there's all sorts of games you can play, I suppose, if you got creative. FLATOW: What are you actually testing for? What does the test look for? Ms. SMOLENYAK: Well, the most popular test for roots purposes is - it uses a Y-chromosome, which, of course, only men have. So if women want to play, they have to talk to either their dad or their brother into representing them. But we basically piggyback also the efforts of population geneticists and it's, you know, it's still cost-prohibitive to test the entire genome. So they have picked out certain markers that are highly variable and so they're good at distinguishing between populations and we found even between people. And so in a typical test, you have say 20 some odd of these markers tested and that's what you're playing the matchmaking game. You get a number for each one of those markers and the databases are running those numbers against everybody else's. FLATOW: And you're looking for the Y-chromosome that gets passed down from generation untouched? Ms. SMOLENYAK: Yeah, it gets passed down intact from father to son down to the generations just like surnames do, which is why this is the number one toy for genealogists. It's, you know, basically the Y-DNA and the surnames travel on tandems through history. And so this is why it's our most popular application. FLATOW: But does that mean you can only find men on this? Ms. SMOLENYAK: No, there is - there are other kinds of tests - the mitochondrial DNA test that you can use on the maternal side. But what it will do, for example, when I wanted to test the family I was born into, I just ask my dad to take the test so he represented me by proxy. So men are taking the test but everybody can play. You just may have to, you know, pester a cousin if you're a woman. FLATOW: Of course, you might find your real parents? Ms. SMOLENYAK: You know, all sorts. . . FLATOW: If you're adopted. Ms. SMOLENYAK: If people are really, really creative, I suppose people could do some pretty remarkable things with it. But the Y-chromosome, it's not like what people see on CSI. FLATOW: Right. Ms. SMOLENYAK: It doesn't give away all your secrets. It's not giving away any medical clues. You're not going to end up in any criminal databases. Some people have privacy concerns, but it's - I always describe it to my audience as a little bit more innocent, because it's more restrictive. It's just looking at a tiny snippet of your DNA. FLATOW: In your own test, were you able to trace back where your family came from? Ms. SMOLENYAK: Well, yeah, actually, I had an interesting experience. Because like most people, I started by testing my own surname, which is Smolenyak, and there's not too many of us. And there's, in fact, only four families of us. We all come from a (unintelligible) village in Slovakia and had all four lines traced back to the 1700s, but I still haven't found our common ancestor. So I tested all four lines to prove that we were all related. Lo and behold, none of us matched. So at first I was disappointed, then I realized, I just saved myself several decades in trying to prove something that's just completely false. So that's an example of what DNA testing can do that the paper trail is never going to do. FLATOW: You've done away with the mythology. Ms. SMOLENYAK: Exactly, exactly. I was just completely wrong and that was the only way I would have found that out. FLATOW: There are tests that claim to tell you if you're probably related to Genghis Khan, for example, or. . . Ms. SMOLENYAK: Yeah, yeah. There's some different types of ethnic tests and so forth. The company that has the Genghis Khan test, props for marketing. If you've matched that particular genetic signature, you get a free dinner for two in a Mongolian restaurant in London, which is great. But really, you could just take a regular old test and compare your results against his signature, which is floating out there on the Internet. FLATOW: Now, if you go into the database and you get a hit, is there a way to say how closely related you are? Ms. SMOLENYAK: It doesn't tell you exactly. These tests can't tell you that, okay, it's your mutual great, great, grandfather. . . FLATOW: Right. Ms. SMOLENYAK: . . . but you know that if you have a perfect match that your lines do connect up at some point. And so what you want to do is shoot that individual an e-mail and start, you know, talking back and forth, and if you're really lucky, you know, you hit somebody who's been already digging into their roots for some time. FLATOW: Can you refine these tests anymore to give you anything? Ms. SMOLENYAK: Yeah. It's - it's, you know, back when the very first tests were launched, which was, oh, five, six years ago? The highest test available was four markers, which to us is laughable now. So that gives you some sense of the progress. Most people these days test 20 some odd markers. FLATOW: Right. Ms. SMOLENYAK: And it's possible, a lot of companies may do as high as 40 some odd, you can even get as high as 67 markers. FLATOW: This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow talking now with Megan Smolenyak. She's the chief family historian for ancestry. com and co-author of the book, \"Trace your Roots with DNA: Using Genetic Tests to Explore your Family Tree. \" Is this a very popular thing now that the Internet is around? You know, I know since, you know, I sort of have a semi-famous name. People are always asking me, am I related. Now, that the Internet is here, people see, you know, all kinds of relationships going on. Ms. SMOLENYAK: Yeah, it's - all of a sudden it's become very popular just in last year or so. I'm not quite sure what the trigger has been, but, yeah, sure that - in my mind, there's been two revolutions in genealogy. The first was the Internet because that made it possible to find your second and third and fourth cousins. Now with DNA, it's going to make it possible to find, you know, your ninth and your 16th cousin. So it's pretty remarkable. FLATOW: So you don't need to - people may be worried, hey, I have to send in a blood sample or something. You just need a swab from the inside of your mouth. Ms. SMOLENYAK: Yeah, yeah. And that's a common myth by the way. I know that one scientific study had to actually switch the way they gathered samples because they used to do blood samples and their database was becoming lopsided because, and I didn't know this, a lot of men are afraid of needles. And so their database was becoming predominantly female. So it doesn't hurt. It's just plain old mouth swab. Looks like a glorified Q-Tip. FLATOW: All right. Let's see if we have a caller here. Andrew(ph) in St. Paul. Hi, Andrew. ANDREW (Caller): Hi. I'm just calling to suggest that ancestry. com might be opening up a little bit of can of worms because I ran across some information that there's surprisingly large number of people in the country that are being raped by people who they think are their father, but might not necessarily be. So I just thought that that might be a possible landmine for you, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Ms. SMOLENYAK: In genealogical terms, actually, the phrase we use for that is NPE, non-paternity events. And, you know, that possibility always exist but in most cases, in fact, when we're researching the book, we found, you know, some sort of whoopsies(ph) in projects about two-thirds of the time. But in most cases, usually the whoopsy you're uncovering occurred maybe 100, 200, 300 years ago. And so it's usually not a big deal to folks. But yeah, that possibility does exist. If somebody wanted to try to use genealogical test more on of paternity kind of style, but then again, you know, all the men who are related on the paternal side with the father would share that same genetic signature. So it's not nearly as definitive as an actual paternity test. FLATOW: Now, where would you go from there? Let's say you get a match. What would - how would you progress toward narrowing down and widening your search? Ms. SMOLENYAK: Well, what you want to do is you want to swap e-mails with anybody who is a perfect match to you. If you have a really unusual genetic signature, you may not have any perfect matches so you might be interested in exchanging e-mails with people who are one or two mutations off of you. But you are going to just bounce back and forth and compare notes and say yeah, you know, we have the same surname. Well, get this, we're from the same part in Ireland, that kind of thing. And you're going to widdle it down, naturally, to the ones that are of greatest interested to you. And it's just a quicker way to find those folks, those distant cousins out there, especially once still back in the old country. FLATOW: Yeah, when you say a perfect match, people may think that, gee, I have a twin out there. They're not the same - that of a twin. Ms. SMOLENYAK: No, again. This is just looking at a tiny snippet of your DNA. It's not the kind that uses autosomal DNA like what the FBI uses or what you see on CSI. It's not giving away any sort of secrets. It's basically, let's say somebody did get a hold of, say, your results and put them out there in the Internet with your name attached to it. The worst that would happen really is people could figure out they're distant cousins of yours. So we still, obviously, don't do that kind of thing. We're very protective of all the data. But it's not giving away all sorts of secrets. FLATOW: All right. Megan, thank you for making time to be with us. Ms. SMOLENYAK: Oh, my pleasure. FLATOW: Have a good weekend. Ms. SMOLENYAK: You too. FLATOW: Megan Smolenyak is chief family historian for ancestry. com and co-author of the book, \"Trace your Roots with DNA Using Genetic Tests to Explore your Family Tree. \" Have a great weekend.

This time the databases are comparing a bunch of numbers that you got from your DNA results. And whenever you find somebody who's a match with you, that's when you want to start comparing notes. And obviously, you're particularly interested in anybody who shares the same surname. . .  FLATOW: Right.  Ms. SMOLENYAK: And has the same genetic signature.  FLATOW: So what do you get in this kit?  Ms. SMOLENYAK: It's straightforward. It's a mouth swab. Usually, you get two of them, just to be sure. And you just scrape the inside of your cheek and you have the paperwork, you fill that out and just send it right back. And about two or three weeks later, you get your results.  FLATOW: Now, when you say get your results. I mean, it's not going to be a little sad - it's not going to be something that you understand, is it? What is it going to tell you?  Ms. SMOLENYAK: As I said, the results are usually a piled numbers and people try to - they make themselves crazy trying to read some meaning into it. And I tell people just to think of it as parts list. It doesn't mean anything. It doesn't mean you're going to have blue eyes or be short or anything like that. It's mostly junk DNA. But you use it for the matchmaking game. So you use the databases and you compare, you look for anybody else who's a close fit and hopefully, you end up matching somebody who's done a little more homework than you have.  So for instance, last year, I was speaking in Oklahoma. There was a Shields in the audience and I happen to belong to the Shields surname project. And he decided to join us. It's a tiny project, only 16 people. He met somebody perfectly, shot him off an e-mail, poof, 450 new relatives.  FLATOW: Wow.  Ms. SMOLENYAK: Yeah.  FLATOW: Wow.  Ms. SMOLENYAK: Yeah.  FLATOW: They may not be good news. . .  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. SMOLENYAK: Just what kind of relatives are you looking for?  FLATOW: If somebody found you after all of those years and you owed them money or something like that.  Ms. SMOLENYAK: Yeah, there's all sorts of games you can play, I suppose, if you got creative.  FLATOW: What are you actually testing for? What does the test look for?  Ms. SMOLENYAK: Well, the most popular test for roots purposes is - it uses a Y-chromosome, which, of course, only men have. So if women want to play, they have to talk to either their dad or their brother into representing them. But we basically piggyback also the efforts of population geneticists and it's, you know, it's still cost-prohibitive to test the entire genome. So they have picked out certain markers that are highly variable and so they're good at distinguishing between populations and we found even between people.  And so in a typical test, you have say 20 some odd of these markers tested and that's what you're playing the matchmaking game. You get a number for each one of those markers and the databases are running those numbers against everybody else's.  FLATOW: And you're looking for the Y-chromosome that gets passed down from generation untouched?  Ms. SMOLENYAK: Yeah, it gets passed down intact from father to son down to the generations just like surnames do, which is why this is the number one toy for genealogists. It's, you know, basically the Y-DNA and the surnames travel on tandems through history. And so this is why it's our most popular application.  FLATOW: But does that mean you can only find men on this?  Ms. SMOLENYAK: No, there is - there are other kinds of tests - the mitochondrial DNA test that you can use on the maternal side. But what it will do, for example, when I wanted to test the family I was born into, I just ask my dad to take the test so he represented me by proxy. So men are taking the test but everybody can play. You just may have to, you know, pester a cousin if you're a woman.  FLATOW: Of course, you might find your real parents?  Ms. SMOLENYAK: You know, all sorts. . .  FLATOW: If you're adopted.  Ms. SMOLENYAK: If people are really, really creative, I suppose people could do some pretty remarkable things with it. But the Y-chromosome, it's not like what people see on CSI.  FLATOW: Right.  Ms. SMOLENYAK: It doesn't give away all your secrets. It's not giving away any medical clues. You're not going to end up in any criminal databases. Some people have privacy concerns, but it's - I always describe it to my audience as a little bit more innocent, because it's more restrictive. It's just looking at a tiny snippet of your DNA.  FLATOW: In your own test, were you able to trace back where your family came from?  Ms. SMOLENYAK: Well, yeah, actually, I had an interesting experience. Because like most people, I started by testing my own surname, which is Smolenyak, and there's not too many of us. And there's, in fact, only four families of us. We all come from a (unintelligible) village in Slovakia and had all four lines traced back to the 1700s, but I still haven't found our common ancestor.  So I tested all four lines to prove that we were all related. Lo and behold, none of us matched. So at first I was disappointed, then I realized, I just saved myself several decades in trying to prove something that's just completely false. So that's an example of what DNA testing can do that the paper trail is never going to do.  FLATOW: You've done away with the mythology.  Ms. SMOLENYAK: Exactly, exactly. I was just completely wrong and that was the only way I would have found that out.  FLATOW: There are tests that claim to tell you if you're probably related to Genghis Khan, for example, or. . .  Ms. SMOLENYAK: Yeah, yeah. There's some different types of ethnic tests and so forth. The company that has the Genghis Khan test, props for marketing. If you've matched that particular genetic signature, you get a free dinner for two in a Mongolian restaurant in London, which is great. But really, you could just take a regular old test and compare your results against his signature, which is floating out there on the Internet.  FLATOW: Now, if you go into the database and you get a hit, is there a way to say how closely related you are?  Ms. SMOLENYAK: It doesn't tell you exactly. These tests can't tell you that, okay, it's your mutual great, great, grandfather. . .  FLATOW: Right.  Ms. SMOLENYAK: . . . but you know that if you have a perfect match that your lines do connect up at some point. And so what you want to do is shoot that individual an e-mail and start, you know, talking back and forth, and if you're really lucky, you know, you hit somebody who's been already digging into their roots for some time.  FLATOW: Can you refine these tests anymore to give you anything?  Ms. SMOLENYAK: Yeah. It's - it's, you know, back when the very first tests were launched, which was, oh, five, six years ago? The highest test available was four markers, which to us is laughable now. So that gives you some sense of the progress. Most people these days test 20 some odd markers.  FLATOW: Right.  Ms. SMOLENYAK: And it's possible, a lot of companies may do as high as 40 some odd, you can even get as high as 67 markers.  FLATOW: This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow talking now with Megan Smolenyak. She's the chief family historian for ancestry. com and co-author of the book, \"Trace your Roots with DNA: Using Genetic Tests to Explore your Family Tree. \"  Is this a very popular thing now that the Internet is around? You know, I know since, you know, I sort of have a semi-famous name. People are always asking me, am I related. Now, that the Internet is here, people see, you know, all kinds of relationships going on.  Ms. SMOLENYAK: Yeah, it's - all of a sudden it's become very popular just in last year or so. I'm not quite sure what the trigger has been, but, yeah, sure that - in my mind, there's been two revolutions in genealogy. The first was the Internet because that made it possible to find your second and third and fourth cousins. Now with DNA, it's going to make it possible to find, you know, your ninth and your 16th cousin. So it's pretty remarkable.  FLATOW: So you don't need to - people may be worried, hey, I have to send in a blood sample or something. You just need a swab from the inside of your mouth.  Ms. SMOLENYAK: Yeah, yeah. And that's a common myth by the way. I know that one scientific study had to actually switch the way they gathered samples because they used to do blood samples and their database was becoming lopsided because, and I didn't know this, a lot of men are afraid of needles. And so their database was becoming predominantly female. So it doesn't hurt. It's just plain old mouth swab. Looks like a glorified Q-Tip.  FLATOW: All right. Let's see if we have a caller here. Andrew(ph) in St. Paul. Hi, Andrew.  ANDREW (Caller): Hi. I'm just calling to suggest that ancestry. com might be opening up a little bit of can of worms because I ran across some information that there's surprisingly large number of people in the country that are being raped by people who they think are their father, but might not necessarily be. So I just thought that that might be a possible landmine for you, guys. Thanks for taking my call.  Ms. SMOLENYAK: In genealogical terms, actually, the phrase we use for that is NPE, non-paternity events. And, you know, that possibility always exist but in most cases, in fact, when we're researching the book, we found, you know, some sort of whoopsies(ph) in projects about two-thirds of the time. But in most cases, usually the whoopsy you're uncovering occurred maybe 100, 200, 300 years ago. And so it's usually not a big deal to folks.  But yeah, that possibility does exist. If somebody wanted to try to use genealogical test more on of paternity kind of style, but then again, you know, all the men who are related on the paternal side with the father would share that same genetic signature. So it's not nearly as definitive as an actual paternity test.  FLATOW: Now, where would you go from there? Let's say you get a match. What would - how would you progress toward narrowing down and widening your search?  Ms. SMOLENYAK: Well, what you want to do is you want to swap e-mails with anybody who is a perfect match to you. If you have a really unusual genetic signature, you may not have any perfect matches so you might be interested in exchanging e-mails with people who are one or two mutations off of you.  But you are going to just bounce back and forth and compare notes and say yeah, you know, we have the same surname. Well, get this, we're from the same part in Ireland, that kind of thing. And you're going to widdle it down, naturally, to the ones that are of greatest interested to you. And it's just a quicker way to find those folks, those distant cousins out there, especially once still back in the old country.  FLATOW: Yeah, when you say a perfect match, people may think that, gee, I have a twin out there. They're not the same - that of a twin.  Ms. SMOLENYAK: No, again. This is just looking at a tiny snippet of your DNA. It's not the kind that uses autosomal DNA like what the FBI uses or what you see on CSI. It's not giving away any sort of secrets. It's basically, let's say somebody did get a hold of, say, your results and put them out there in the Internet with your name attached to it. The worst that would happen really is people could figure out they're distant cousins of yours. So we still, obviously, don't do that kind of thing. We're very protective of all the data. But it's not giving away all sorts of secrets.  FLATOW: All right. Megan, thank you for making time to be with us.  Ms. SMOLENYAK: Oh, my pleasure.  FLATOW: Have a good weekend.  Ms. SMOLENYAK: You too.  FLATOW: Megan Smolenyak is chief family historian for ancestry. com and co-author of the book, \"Trace your Roots with DNA Using Genetic Tests to Explore your Family Tree. \"  Have a great weekend.

And we've all heard that medical advice whether we want it or not. Got a cold? Eat chicken soup. But is any of this stuff true? New York Times Science writer Anahad O'Connor collected the answers to these and other questions in his new book, \"Never Shower in a Thunderstorm: Surprising Facts and Misleading Myths About Our Health And The World We Live In. \" Anahad O'Connor joins us from our bureau in New York City. Welcome. Mr. ANAHAD O'CONNOR (Author, \"Never Shower in a Thunderstorm: Surprising Facts and Misleading Myths About Our Health And The World We Live In\"): Hey. Thanks for having me. SEABROOK: It's great to have you. Now, first, let's start with the title. \"Never Shower in a Thunderstorm. \" Should we heed this advice? (Soundbite of pans clanging) Mr. O'CONNOR: This is something that I always heard growing up. When I was a toddler, it was just my mother's way to get me out of the shower or get me off the phone. But the way it works is that, actually, every year, about 20 people in the United States are shocked indoors while they're showering\u2026 SEABROOK: Wow. That's a lot. Mr. O'CONNOR: \u2026or they're talking on the phone. Yeah. SEABROOK: Did - are those people counted in the, you know, the people who are hit by a lightning? Mr. O'CONNOR: Yeah. Yeah. There's actually a database that describes every incident in detail online that you can look up. SEABROOK: Because I've always heard that it's - you're more likely to get hit by a lightning than be in a plane crash, for example. Mr. O'CONNOR: Yeah. That is true. And with the, I mean, you're much less likely to get shocked indoors, but it does happen. And the way it works is that if you think about a building kind of acting like a metal cage when it's struck by a lightning, the electricity is kind of conducted around you through pipes and the wiring. And usually, it dissipates into the ground. But if you actually come into contact with, let's say, an appliance or you touch a faucet, that electricity that can go through the pipes or through the wiring and jump to you. And it happens. SEABROOK: Does that include the phone? Mr. O'CONNOR: Yeah. It can go through phone wires. SEABROOK: I mean, for those old people who have landline phones. Mr. O'CONNOR: Yeah. Yeah. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. O'CONNOR: It does happen. SEABROOK: Okay. How about health? Is watching TV, does that damage your eyes? Mr. O'CONNOR: You know, this is something that I probably call an old technology tale because years ago when the, when the first TVs came out, they emitted levels of radiation that could theoretically be harmful. But the way TVs are designed today, I mean, you might get some eyestrain, but that's about it. SEABROOK: If you have questions for Anahad O'Connor or myths that you heard growing up you want him to truth squad, our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK, or send us an a-mail at talk@npr. org. Anahad O'Connor, tell us about chicken soup. Is it really the elixir of health? Mr. O'CONNOR: This is one that most people will probably think is a myth, but several teams of scientists have actually studied chicken soup and found that there are certain chemicals in chicken soup that can help you beat a cold. One is cysteine, which is related to a chemical called acetylcysteine, which is actually a type of medicine that doctors use to help clear up mucus in the lungs. So this is - you know, it can do the same in the form of chicken soup. SEABROOK: I love doing radio about mucus. Let me ask you\u2026 Mr. O'CONNOR: Very nice imagery. SEABROOK: Yeah. Let me ask you this. It's really - it's serendipitous to have you on today because I've been reading all of the big news about second children of which I am one, and about how they are genuinely dumber than their first children counterparts even though in your book, you discount this claim. Mr. O'CONNOR: Yeah. I mean, what I say in the book is really that studies have shown that it's not really birth order, it's kind of the factors involved in it. So if you take a big family, for example, studies have shown that oftentimes, you know, if it's a single parent family, then the children born later will have certain - yeah, will suffer certain side effects, you know, and that can be, you know, less time spent with their parents\u2026 SEABROOK: Hmm. Mr. O'CONNOR: \u2026or, you know, mothers who have lots of children tend to start very young and so that means that they have younger parents and that affects you know, their education and things like that. So this is more of a complicated answer. It's not really a yes or no. There are so many different variables involved. SEABROOK: Let's go to the phones. I know lots of people have lots of questions for you. Let's start with Lucy(ph) in Ketchum, Idaho. Go ahead with your question. LUCY (Caller): Hello. SEABROOK: Hi. Go ahead. LUCY: Hi. Yes. My question is, is standing in front of the microwave harmful while it's functioning, while it's being in use? SEABROOK: Great question. I know that this is one of those things that the pregnancy police bugged me about when I was pregnant. And that is all the millions of things that you can't do unless you want to, you know, go to Hades for harming your baby. So is standing in front of the microwave, is that terrible? Mr. O'CONNOR: If your standing in front of a microwave that's been - that's relatively new and a recent design, then you're pretty safe, because they're built with very sturdy shielding. And - I mean, studies have looked at this and shown that there's really no risk. SEABROOK: And Veronica(ph) in San Antonio. She has a good one. VERONICA (Caller): I come from a very Hispanic traditional family. And about every old family I know says that if you take a shower and go out, especially on a chilly day, you will get sick automatically just because it's cold outside. SEABROOK: Hmm. VERONICA: Your head is wet. SEABROOK: Anahad? Mr. O'CONNOR: This one, there are kind of several variables involved. The way it works is that studies have actually shown that people who are, you know, who are wet and who are cold, that can actually affect your immune system. And that can cause dormant colds to - or that can give rise to dormant colds. So it can have some effect. But generally, the reason people catch more colds in the winter, it's because they spend more time indoors. So people think it's often because, you know, they're outside without proper clothing or\u2026 SEABROOK: Oh. Mr. O'CONNOR: \u2026just the cold weather. But usually, it's because people spend a lot more time indoors during the winter. And that allows - you know, the proximity allows germs to jump more easily from one person to the next. So there are different variables involved with this, you know, catch a cold, I'm sorry, catch a chill or catch a cold old wives' tale. SEABROOK: Fascinating. Mary(ph)in Minneapolis, what's your question? MARY (Caller): Oh, hi. I was wondering if cell phones cause cancer? SEABROOK: Hmm. Mr. O'CONNOR: This is one that they've been looking at for many years now. And so far, there's pretty good evidence that suggest that they don't and what they've done is they've looked at people who have used cell phones for many years and who have developed brain tumors and they've compared them to people who haven't used cell phones and have brain tumors. And they've compared them to people who haven't used cell phones and have brain tumors, and they, you know, really found that there's really no good correlation. You know, for example, it haven't shown that, you know, a brain tumor might correspond to the same side of your head that you hold the phone to. But then, on the other hand, cell phones really haven't been around that long. I mean, so there aren't any studies that are, you know, go back more than about 10 years. SEABROOK: Dan, dan, dan. Mr. O'CONNOR: So, I mean, we don't know yet if using a cell phone everyday for four years can affect you. But so far, the evidence suggest that right now, it's probably not that much of a risk. SEABROOK: I guess we're throwing caution to the wind. Mr. O'CONNOR: Yeah. SEABROOK: We have a couple of e-mails here. One - this one is from Drew(ph) in - I think it says Bemus Point, New York. Never touch a baby bird or its parents won't take care of it. Mr. O'CONNOR: Oh, that one is not true. SEABROOK: Really? Mr. O'CONNOR: Yeah. Zoologist have actually looked at this and found that it is - it's not true. SEABROOK: Oh, we're going to try and stump you now. Mr. O'CONNOR: Hmm. SEABROOK: Here is this from Ashley(ph). Is it true that your heart skips a beat when you sneeze? Mr. O'CONNOR: No, it does not. I talked to a cardiologist about this one. It's a popular one, but they say it's definitely not true. SEABROOK: I'm sorry. That was from Art(ph). We need to give Art his due. And now, let's go back to the phones. This is William(ph) in - let me pronounce this right, Noank, Connecticut? Hello? WILLIAM (Caller): Yes. Hi. SEABROOK: Go ahead. WILLIAM: Yes. This is William in Noank. I heard that you were going to address swimming after eating. I'm a retired physician. When I was 16, I was exercising vigorously in the water. Got out. Ate an enormous couple of sandwiches and got back in, had a stomach cramp. And within three seconds was unconscious sinking like a lead ball to the bottom. And was rescued. Had not been rescued, I would have been dead. And the Red Cross manual, about 30 years ago, tells that if you suffer a stomach cramp, you will not be able to recover yourself as - versus the leg cramp. And what happens is the demands of digestion shut the blood to the stomach. It doesn't get enough blood, so it has pain just as the person having a heart attack has pain. And it causes the body to curl up, the lungs deflate, and you sink like a canon ball. SEABROOK: Anahad, is Dr. William on the right track here? Mr. O'CONNOR: Mm-hmm. WILLIAM: Hi. Mr. O'CONNOR: Well, I talked to the Red Cross about this one and - I mean, they say that generally it's not a huge risk factor. What they're really concern about is alcohol. There have been a lot of studies and there are a lot of statistics showing that people who consume alcohol and then get in the water have increased risk of drowning. But so far, at least according to the Red Cross, they haven't attributed any cases of drowning to a full stomach. So I talked to some gastroenterologists who say that, you know, there could be or there is a decrease of blood flow, you know, to other parts of the body once you, you know, after you eat, you know, a full meal because of digestion. But generally, you know, they say that if you do get a cramp - I mean, usually a cramp is so debilitating that you can't get out of the water. I mean, it sounds that this might be an exception. I mean - and often - I mean also if you look at professional swimmers, you know, Olympic swimmers, they eat meals before they get in the water to give them energy. So the conventional thinking is that it's not a huge risk unless your meal involves an alcohol. But it just sounds like a pretty astounding exception. SEABROOK: In your book, you wrote about another rumored aphrodisiac, oysters. Now, this is a tease here. We've posted an excerpt on our Web page where you talk more about that. So we're not really going to talk about that. You have to go to our website, npr. org/talk. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Anahad O'Connor, let's talk about some health-related myths or maybe not myths here. There's a chapter on germs. Do, let me ask, toilet seats - do they spread germs? Mr. O'CONNOR: There are actually are a couple diseases that can be transmitted by toilet seats. But generally, toilet seats are not a good, you know, you're not really at risk for catching many things from a toilet seat because of the cold environment. You know, germs don't really survive very well on porcelain and in that cold environment. But - I mean there have been cases of people catching some bacterial diseases. SEABROOK: I have in fact heard that it's like the least germy place in the bathroom. Mr. O'CONNOR: Yeah. In the bathroom, the - I mean, studies have shown pretty conclusively that the most germ laden places are the faucets. Of course, because people, you know, hit the toilet and then hit the sinks, and touch the faucets. And then also, the door handles. Those are just - I mean you definitely going to use tissue to open the door if you are, you know, kind of a germ freak, because\u2026 SEABROOK: Do you have to\u2026 Mr. O'CONNOR: \u2026they are just crawling. SEABROOK: Okay. Do you have to be a germ freak? You don't have to be a germ freak. America, wash your hands. This is a special report from TALK OF THE NATION. Let me ask you another one. Do antiperspirants cause cancer? Mr. O'CONNOR: There is a chemical in some antiperspirants that have been linked to, you know, breast cancer, for example. That chemical - those chemicals are called parabens. But the NIH has been studying this for several decades. And, you know, it hasn't really found a very conclusive link. SEABROOK: Is this the same things that are in those Nalgene water bottles, the crunchy people carry around all the time? It's the same paraben. Is that the same\u2026 Mr. O'CONNOR: It may be. SEABROOK: Have I stumped you? Mr. O'CONNOR: It may be. SEABROOK: Okay. We have another water bottle question, this one from Gwen(ph) in Wichita, Kansas. Go ahead. GWEN (Caller): Ah, yes. I have a question. A couple of months ago I received a mass mailing from a friend that stated that we should not drink water when it has been left in a vehicle. Because the gases from the bottle will emit into the (audio gap) is not healthy for us. Is that true? Mr. O'CONNOR: I'm sorry. Because the gases will emit\u2026 GWEN: The fumes that displaces from the bottle, that make up structure - the properties of the bottle\u2026 Mr. O'CONNOR: Mm-hmm. GWEN: \u2026and it will release into the water. SEABROOK: Good question, Gwen. Mr. O'CONNOR: There has been a lot of studies on this. And, I mean, you're really not at that much of a risk. I mean, what happens is that in order for, I mean, there've been a lot of e-mails on the Web, you know, saying that it's dangerous to drink from, you know, plastic bottles especially if they've been, or any plastic containers especially in microwaved or put in the freezer. But the way it works is that there are certain chemicals in plastic containers called phthalates, and these are the chemicals that give the containers their flexibility. And they can get into the water but it takes high temperature, and you need high temperature to get that chemical reaction started. SEABROOK: So, Gwen is right. If you leave the bottle of water in the car, it can get really hot and then you shouldn't drink it. Mr. O'CONNOR: Well, I think if you just leave a bottle of water in a car, I mean, it depends on the temperature. SEABROOK: I see. Mr. O'CONNOR: I don't think the temperature would get high enough and I don't think the bottle would be in there long enough for there to be a chemical reaction taking place. But if you were to microwave a plastic container, for example, that's not designed for microwave use, then those phthalates will definitely get into the water and you can definitely put yourself at risk over time. SEABROOK: Here's another water myth, or maybe not. A scientific study showing the need or benefit from drinking six to eight glasses of water per day, this is what Gary(ph) in St. Louis wants to see. What do you think? Mr. O'CONNOR: There's no truth to the, you know, claim that you need exactly six or exactly eight glasses of water. I mean, basically you just need enough to stay hydrated. For some people it's less, you know. So, if you try to force feed yourself six or eight glasses of water a day, you may just be doing yourself a disservice. SEABROOK: And a great one quick from Jim in Spencer, Iowa. Go ahead. JIM (Caller): Yes. I was curious to know if there's any truth to the rumors that animals can detect the oncoming presence of an earthquake or tornado. Some of those types of stories I'm sure you've heard? Mr. O'CONNOR: Yeah. This was a popular one that came out, particularly, after the big tsunami hit a few years ago. And, I mean, there's a lot of debate about this in a scientific community and it's not quite clear. It seems like there may be some animals, you know, that can, like birds, for example, you know, can see, you know, these natural disasters coming. You know, certain animals that are closer to the ground. But it's - it hasn't much shown the animals have any kind of sixth sense for these types of disasters. SEABROOK: So, just birds? Mr. O'CONNOR: Well, there's - it's still being debated and it's still being looked at scientifically. But - I mean, it does, there is some evidence that some animals can probably see these things coming. SEABROOK: Hmm. Okay. Anahad O'Connor, thank you for clearing these things up for us.

And come on, you really want to know about oysters and whether or not they're really an aphrodisiac. So, we've put an excerpt of his book up on our Web page at npr. org/talk. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Neal Conan is back tomorrow. I'm Andrea Seabrook in Washington.  ANDREA SEABROOK, host:  We've all grown up hearing warnings from our parents like don't sit too close to that TV it'll hurt your eyes. And we've all heard that medical advice whether we want it or not. Got a cold? Eat chicken soup. But is any of this stuff true? New York Times Science writer Anahad O'Connor collected the answers to these and other questions in his new book, \"Never Shower in a Thunderstorm: Surprising Facts and Misleading Myths About Our Health And The World We Live In. \" Anahad O'Connor joins us from our bureau in New York City. Welcome.  Mr. ANAHAD O'CONNOR (Author, \"Never Shower in a Thunderstorm: Surprising Facts and Misleading Myths About Our Health And The World We Live In\"): Hey. Thanks for having me.  SEABROOK: It's great to have you. Now, first, let's start with the title. \"Never Shower in a Thunderstorm. \" Should we heed this advice?  (Soundbite of pans clanging)  Mr. O'CONNOR: This is something that I always heard growing up. When I was a toddler, it was just my mother's way to get me out of the shower or get me off the phone. But the way it works is that, actually, every year, about 20 people in the United States are shocked indoors while they're showering\u2026  SEABROOK: Wow. That's a lot.  Mr. O'CONNOR: \u2026or they're talking on the phone. Yeah.  SEABROOK: Did - are those people counted in the, you know, the people who are hit by a lightning?  Mr. O'CONNOR: Yeah. Yeah. There's actually a database that describes every incident in detail online that you can look up.  SEABROOK: Because I've always heard that it's - you're more likely to get hit by a lightning than be in a plane crash, for example.  Mr. O'CONNOR: Yeah. That is true. And with the, I mean, you're much less likely to get shocked indoors, but it does happen. And the way it works is that if you think about a building kind of acting like a metal cage when it's struck by a lightning, the electricity is kind of conducted around you through pipes and the wiring. And usually, it dissipates into the ground. But if you actually come into contact with, let's say, an appliance or you touch a faucet, that electricity that can go through the pipes or through the wiring and jump to you. And it happens.  SEABROOK: Does that include the phone?  Mr. O'CONNOR: Yeah. It can go through phone wires.  SEABROOK: I mean, for those old people who have landline phones.  Mr. O'CONNOR: Yeah. Yeah.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. O'CONNOR: It does happen.  SEABROOK: Okay. How about health? Is watching TV, does that damage your eyes?  Mr. O'CONNOR: You know, this is something that I probably call an old technology tale because years ago when the, when the first TVs came out, they emitted levels of radiation that could theoretically be harmful. But the way TVs are designed today, I mean, you might get some eyestrain, but that's about it.  SEABROOK: If you have questions for Anahad O'Connor or myths that you heard growing up you want him to truth squad, our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK, or send us an a-mail at talk@npr. org. Anahad O'Connor, tell us about chicken soup. Is it really the elixir of health?  Mr. O'CONNOR: This is one that most people will probably think is a myth, but several teams of scientists have actually studied chicken soup and found that there are certain chemicals in chicken soup that can help you beat a cold. One is cysteine, which is related to a chemical called acetylcysteine, which is actually a type of medicine that doctors use to help clear up mucus in the lungs. So this is - you know, it can do the same in the form of chicken soup.  SEABROOK: I love doing radio about mucus. Let me ask you\u2026  Mr. O'CONNOR: Very nice imagery.  SEABROOK: Yeah. Let me ask you this. It's really - it's serendipitous to have you on today because I've been reading all of the big news about second children of which I am one, and about how they are genuinely dumber than their first children counterparts even though in your book, you discount this claim.  Mr. O'CONNOR: Yeah. I mean, what I say in the book is really that studies have shown that it's not really birth order, it's kind of the factors involved in it. So if you take a big family, for example, studies have shown that oftentimes, you know, if it's a single parent family, then the children born later will have certain - yeah, will suffer certain side effects, you know, and that can be, you know, less time spent with their parents\u2026  SEABROOK: Hmm.  Mr. O'CONNOR: \u2026or, you know, mothers who have lots of children tend to start very young and so that means that they have younger parents and that affects you know, their education and things like that. So this is more of a complicated answer. It's not really a yes or no. There are so many different variables involved.  SEABROOK: Let's go to the phones. I know lots of people have lots of questions for you. Let's start with Lucy(ph) in Ketchum, Idaho. Go ahead with your question.  LUCY (Caller): Hello.  SEABROOK: Hi. Go ahead.  LUCY: Hi. Yes. My question is, is standing in front of the microwave harmful while it's functioning, while it's being in use?  SEABROOK: Great question. I know that this is one of those things that the pregnancy police bugged me about when I was pregnant. And that is all the millions of things that you can't do unless you want to, you know, go to Hades for harming your baby. So is standing in front of the microwave, is that terrible?  Mr. O'CONNOR: If your standing in front of a microwave that's been - that's relatively new and a recent design, then you're pretty safe, because they're built with very sturdy shielding. And - I mean, studies have looked at this and shown that there's really no risk.  SEABROOK: And Veronica(ph) in San Antonio. She has a good one.  VERONICA (Caller): I come from a very Hispanic traditional family. And about every old family I know says that if you take a shower and go out, especially on a chilly day, you will get sick automatically just because it's cold outside.  SEABROOK: Hmm.  VERONICA: Your head is wet.  SEABROOK: Anahad?  Mr. O'CONNOR: This one, there are kind of several variables involved. The way it works is that studies have actually shown that people who are, you know, who are wet and who are cold, that can actually affect your immune system. And that can cause dormant colds to - or that can give rise to dormant colds. So it can have some effect. But generally, the reason people catch more colds in the winter, it's because they spend more time indoors. So people think it's often because, you know, they're outside without proper clothing or\u2026  SEABROOK: Oh.  Mr. O'CONNOR: \u2026just the cold weather. But usually, it's because people spend a lot more time indoors during the winter. And that allows - you know, the proximity allows germs to jump more easily from one person to the next. So there are different variables involved with this, you know, catch a cold, I'm sorry, catch a chill or catch a cold old wives' tale.  SEABROOK: Fascinating. Mary(ph)in Minneapolis, what's your question?  MARY (Caller): Oh, hi. I was wondering if cell phones cause cancer?  SEABROOK: Hmm.  Mr. O'CONNOR: This is one that they've been looking at for many years now. And so far, there's pretty good evidence that suggest that they don't and what they've done is they've looked at people who have used cell phones for many years and who have developed brain tumors and they've compared them to people who haven't used cell phones and have brain tumors. And they've compared them to people who haven't used cell phones and have brain tumors, and they, you know, really found that there's really no good correlation.  You know, for example, it haven't shown that, you know, a brain tumor might correspond to the same side of your head that you hold the phone to. But then, on the other hand, cell phones really haven't been around that long. I mean, so there aren't any studies that are, you know, go back more than about 10 years.  SEABROOK: Dan, dan, dan.  Mr. O'CONNOR: So, I mean, we don't know yet if using a cell phone everyday for four years can affect you. But so far, the evidence suggest that right now, it's probably not that much of a risk.  SEABROOK: I guess we're throwing caution to the wind.  Mr. O'CONNOR: Yeah.  SEABROOK: We have a couple of e-mails here. One - this one is from Drew(ph) in - I think it says Bemus Point, New York. Never touch a baby bird or its parents won't take care of it.  Mr. O'CONNOR: Oh, that one is not true.  SEABROOK: Really?  Mr. O'CONNOR: Yeah. Zoologist have actually looked at this and found that it is - it's not true.  SEABROOK: Oh, we're going to try and stump you now.  Mr. O'CONNOR: Hmm.  SEABROOK: Here is this from Ashley(ph). Is it true that your heart skips a beat when you sneeze?  Mr. O'CONNOR: No, it does not. I talked to a cardiologist about this one. It's a popular one, but they say it's definitely not true.  SEABROOK: I'm sorry. That was from Art(ph). We need to give Art his due. And now, let's go back to the phones. This is William(ph) in - let me pronounce this right, Noank, Connecticut? Hello?  WILLIAM (Caller): Yes. Hi.  SEABROOK: Go ahead.  WILLIAM: Yes. This is William in Noank. I heard that you were going to address swimming after eating. I'm a retired physician. When I was 16, I was exercising vigorously in the water. Got out. Ate an enormous couple of sandwiches and got back in, had a stomach cramp. And within three seconds was unconscious sinking like a lead ball to the bottom. And was rescued. Had not been rescued, I would have been dead.  And the Red Cross manual, about 30 years ago, tells that if you suffer a stomach cramp, you will not be able to recover yourself as - versus the leg cramp. And what happens is the demands of digestion shut the blood to the stomach. It doesn't get enough blood, so it has pain just as the person having a heart attack has pain. And it causes the body to curl up, the lungs deflate, and you sink like a canon ball.  SEABROOK: Anahad, is Dr. William on the right track here?  Mr. O'CONNOR: Mm-hmm.  WILLIAM: Hi.  Mr. O'CONNOR: Well, I talked to the Red Cross about this one and - I mean, they say that generally it's not a huge risk factor. What they're really concern about is alcohol. There have been a lot of studies and there are a lot of statistics showing that people who consume alcohol and then get in the water have increased risk of drowning.  But so far, at least according to the Red Cross, they haven't attributed any cases of drowning to a full stomach. So I talked to some gastroenterologists who say that, you know, there could be or there is a decrease of blood flow, you know, to other parts of the body once you, you know, after you eat, you know, a full meal because of digestion. But generally, you know, they say that if you do get a cramp - I mean, usually a cramp is so debilitating that you can't get out of the water. I mean, it sounds that this might be an exception.  I mean - and often - I mean also if you look at professional swimmers, you know, Olympic swimmers, they eat meals before they get in the water to give them energy. So the conventional thinking is that it's not a huge risk unless your meal involves an alcohol. But it just sounds like a pretty astounding exception.  SEABROOK: In your book, you wrote about another rumored aphrodisiac, oysters. Now, this is a tease here. We've posted an excerpt on our Web page where you talk more about that. So we're not really going to talk about that. You have to go to our website, npr. org/talk.  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  Anahad O'Connor, let's talk about some health-related myths or maybe not myths here. There's a chapter on germs. Do, let me ask, toilet seats - do they spread germs?  Mr. O'CONNOR: There are actually are a couple diseases that can be transmitted by toilet seats. But generally, toilet seats are not a good, you know, you're not really at risk for catching many things from a toilet seat because of the cold environment. You know, germs don't really survive very well on porcelain and in that cold environment. But - I mean there have been cases of people catching some bacterial diseases.  SEABROOK: I have in fact heard that it's like the least germy place in the bathroom.  Mr. O'CONNOR: Yeah. In the bathroom, the - I mean, studies have shown pretty conclusively that the most germ laden places are the faucets. Of course, because people, you know, hit the toilet and then hit the sinks, and touch the faucets. And then also, the door handles. Those are just - I mean you definitely going to use tissue to open the door if you are, you know, kind of a germ freak, because\u2026  SEABROOK: Do you have to\u2026  Mr. O'CONNOR: \u2026they are just crawling.  SEABROOK: Okay. Do you have to be a germ freak? You don't have to be a germ freak. America, wash your hands. This is a special report from TALK OF THE NATION.  Let me ask you another one. Do antiperspirants cause cancer?  Mr. O'CONNOR: There is a chemical in some antiperspirants that have been linked to, you know, breast cancer, for example. That chemical - those chemicals are called parabens. But the NIH has been studying this for several decades. And, you know, it hasn't really found a very conclusive link.  SEABROOK: Is this the same things that are in those Nalgene water bottles, the crunchy people carry around all the time? It's the same paraben. Is that the same\u2026  Mr. O'CONNOR: It may be.  SEABROOK: Have I stumped you?  Mr. O'CONNOR: It may be.  SEABROOK: Okay. We have another water bottle question, this one from Gwen(ph) in Wichita, Kansas. Go ahead.  GWEN (Caller): Ah, yes. I have a question. A couple of months ago I received a mass mailing from a friend that stated that we should not drink water when it has been left in a vehicle. Because the gases from the bottle will emit into the (audio gap) is not healthy for us. Is that true?  Mr. O'CONNOR: I'm sorry. Because the gases will emit\u2026  GWEN: The fumes that displaces from the bottle, that make up structure - the properties of the bottle\u2026  Mr. O'CONNOR: Mm-hmm.  GWEN: \u2026and it will release into the water.  SEABROOK: Good question, Gwen.  Mr. O'CONNOR: There has been a lot of studies on this. And, I mean, you're really not at that much of a risk. I mean, what happens is that in order for, I mean, there've been a lot of e-mails on the Web, you know, saying that it's dangerous to drink from, you know, plastic bottles especially if they've been, or any plastic containers especially in microwaved or put in the freezer.  But the way it works is that there are certain chemicals in plastic containers called phthalates, and these are the chemicals that give the containers their flexibility. And they can get into the water but it takes high temperature, and you need high temperature to get that chemical reaction started.  SEABROOK: So, Gwen is right. If you leave the bottle of water in the car, it can get really hot and then you shouldn't drink it.  Mr. O'CONNOR: Well, I think if you just leave a bottle of water in a car, I mean, it depends on the temperature.  SEABROOK: I see.  Mr. O'CONNOR: I don't think the temperature would get high enough and I don't think the bottle would be in there long enough for there to be a chemical reaction taking place. But if you were to microwave a plastic container, for example, that's not designed for microwave use, then those phthalates will definitely get into the water and you can definitely put yourself at risk over time.  SEABROOK: Here's another water myth, or maybe not. A scientific study showing the need or benefit from drinking six to eight glasses of water per day, this is what Gary(ph) in St. Louis wants to see. What do you think?  Mr. O'CONNOR: There's no truth to the, you know, claim that you need exactly six or exactly eight glasses of water. I mean, basically you just need enough to stay hydrated. For some people it's less, you know. So, if you try to force feed yourself six or eight glasses of water a day, you may just be doing yourself a disservice.  SEABROOK: And a great one quick from Jim in Spencer, Iowa. Go ahead.  JIM (Caller): Yes. I was curious to know if there's any truth to the rumors that animals can detect the oncoming presence of an earthquake or tornado. Some of those types of stories I'm sure you've heard?  Mr. O'CONNOR: Yeah. This was a popular one that came out, particularly, after the big tsunami hit a few years ago. And, I mean, there's a lot of debate about this in a scientific community and it's not quite clear. It seems like there may be some animals, you know, that can, like birds, for example, you know, can see, you know, these natural disasters coming. You know, certain animals that are closer to the ground. But it's - it hasn't much shown the animals have any kind of sixth sense for these types of disasters.  SEABROOK: So, just birds?  Mr. O'CONNOR: Well, there's - it's still being debated and it's still being looked at scientifically. But - I mean, it does, there is some evidence that some animals can probably see these things coming.  SEABROOK: Hmm. Okay. Anahad O'Connor, thank you for clearing these things up for us. Very important questions here.

You know, there hasn't always been a bathroom scale. We're going to talk a bit about that a little bit more, and now why we're so obsessed with it. We are a nation of dieters, from Ornish to Atkins to Slim-Fast to Weight Watchers. We spend countless dollars each year on weight-loss products. You've got your books, your diets, your supplements, your gym memberships, your infomercial gadgets meant to shrink our abs, but you know what, we're still getting bigger. According to the latest obesity researchers, 67 percent of Americans are overweight or obese. It seems almost like the harder we try to lose weight, the more weight we are gaining. And for all the money we spend on weight loss gimmicks, scientists at clinics and universities spend their research dollars trying to figure out even the most basic questions about weight. Is one diet better than another? Are there genetic reasons for obesity? The answers have often been surprising, and my next guest has been following weight loss research, has gathered the myths and realities about dieting into her new book. Gina Kolata is a science writer for the New York Times. She's the author of \"Rethinking Thin: The New Science of Weight Loss - and the Myths and Realities of Dieting. \" Good to see you again, Gina. Ms. GINA KOLATA (Author, \"Rethinking Thin: The New Science of Weight Loss - and the Myths and Realities of Dieting\"): It's great to be here, Ira. It's good to see you, too. FLATOW: What is the biggest myth about dieting? Ms. KOLATA: It's that anybody who wants to can weigh - can be arbitrarily thin. They just have to push themselves away from the table, eat less and exercise more. FLATOW: They just - that's what everybody says. . . Ms. KOLATA: That's right. FLATOW: . . . if you only had more willpower. Ms. KOLATA: Yeah. Right, of course. It's all up to you. You don't have to be fat. Anybody can be thin if they really wanted to. And it's a big myth. FLATOW: And why is that a myth? Ms. KOLATA: Well, there's been decade after decade after decade of research that explains not - that shows not just how very difficult it is, but why it's so very difficult. And then, there's even a more practical reason: if it was that easy, nobody would be fat. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: So you're a - are you of the mind that it doesn't matter what you do, your body has a certain weight it wants to be and it's going to be that weight. Ms. KOLATA: Well, I go - I tried - because I'm a reporter, I try to go into things with a blank mind, without a preconception. FLATOW: Right. Ms. KOLATA: But I think that the science has been very persuasive that there is not just one weight that you could be but a range of weights. It may span like 20 pounds or so. And if you try to go below it or above it, it becomes almost impossible, and that happens for normal weight people and for fatter people. Everybody - and it seems to be genetically determined. For example, they did a study in the 1980s with children who were adopted and didn't know their biological parents at all. And the question was when they were 40 years old, how - what weight did they have? Did they resemble their biological parents or their adopted parents? They resembled - you probably guess - their biological parents. Same thing with twins, identical twins ended up not just the same kinds of weights, but even the same distribution of body fat. I have this slide from a journal like 30 years ago, where they have photos of twins, identical and fraternal. They even have like the same love handles and they were identical. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. KOLATA: Identical. FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Gina Kolata, author of \"Rethinking Thin: The New Science of Weight Loss - and the Myths and Realities of Dieting. \" Our number 1-800-989-8255. Is it a myth that now our kids are getting fatter and we've seen this happening, we - we hear about type 2 diabetes, all these diseases like that that kids never got before? Ms. KOLATA: Well, actually, kids are fatter than they used to be. Everybody is slightly fatter than they used to be. But weirdly enough, the effect has really been on the fattest people getting a lot fatter and most people have gained on average like five or seven pounds which is probably, you know, getting towards - whatever the environmental effect is, it's probably - may be pushing people towards the top rather than the bottom or so their natural range. Type 2 diabetes in kids is extraordinarily rare. It's so rare that it's almost impossible to track. It's much rarer than type 1 diabetes, which is very -which is a very rare disease. That's only one-tenth of all diabetics. But there are some children who have type 2 diabetes. And type 2 diabetes is affected by weight. The problem is almost everybody with type 2 diabetes would give anything not to have that disease. And if all they had to do was eat less and exercise more, most of them - who wants to inject yourself with insulin or take drugs all day? FLATOW: But why are we seeing kids have it more or they - or did they always have it more and we never picked it up? Ms. KOLATA: Well, it's not entirely clear because there's also a whole lot more surveillance especially when a fat kid comes in. And when you have a lot more surveillance, you're going to find a lot more because type 2 diabetes often has no symptoms. People don't know they have it until they have a blood sugar test. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. I was surprised to read about how some of these new fad diets are really not new at all, especially the Atkins diet, which you reported. Ms. KOLATA: Oh, that was amazing. Yeah, these - almost everything that people try to do with dieting was discovered a long time ago. The Atkins diet was discovered twice in the 1800s, both times, it was in best-selling books. The second one was by an undertaker, sort of a funny person to write the best-selling book on dieting. FLATOW: He's going to see a lot of fat people. Ms. KOLATA: Right. William Banting. He was very fat and he discovered a low-carbohydrate diet. He was so miserable. People made fun of him. And he could hardly walk and he had all these health problems. And then he got on this diet and lost weight, wrote a little pamphlet about it, became such a hit internationally that the word for dieting became banting. So people, instead of saying I'm dieting, they would say I'm banting. FLATOW: Wow. Ms. KOLATA: And then that sort of fell out of favor in the early 1900s, when calorie counting came in and that's when our calorie charts were invented, and a lot of the same ones are there now. There's another best-selling book called \"How To Live. \" And it told you, you know, you can't really - people think that they're counting calories, but you really have to count calories. You throw some peanuts in your mouth between meals, that's calories. You put some cream in your coffee, that's calories. You can't fool your body. But if you actually kept track of your calories, you would be thin. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Ms. KOLATA: So we've had that one, too. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255. Let's get some calls in. Patrick in Tampa. Hi, Patrick. PATRICK (Caller): Hi. So my question is if people are genetically predisposed to the weight that they are, then how can they - at least when I travel on vacation to Europe, it seems like all the Europeans are much thinner than Americans are. Ms. KOLATA: I love that question because I was just in Europe. I was in Italy. And I hear this all the time. I actually asked one of the researchers. I said, are people - how much fatter are people in the U. S. ? He said we really don't know because nobody but the U. S. does - has the kind of data we have. We have to - you actually have to weigh people, not just ask them what they weigh, and because people often, sort of, tend to, you know, shade the truth. So I was in Italy, just out of curiosity, and I thought I'm going to try to guess who were the Americans. And I found that it was so strange, I couldn't tell what nationality people were until they - I heard them speaking. And we were in this little town, we saw people at this bay, swimming, and my husband said, don't tell me Italians are thin ever again. And on a train, I saw this guy with this big stomach and I said, I know that guy is an American. Then I heard him speak - he was German. So I don't know. I actually don't know. A lot of it is economics. You go to Europe. And when we were in Rome, we saw a lot of thin people. But then we were on a cycling trip and we were out in sort of rural Italy and it changed a lot. And if you're in New York, I think you see a lot thinner people than you do in certain other areas of the country. PATRICK: Me, too. Ms. KOLATA: So it's sort of hard to know sometimes. FLATOW: We walk a lot here. Ms. KOLATA: Well, that's the theory, but I'm not sure. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. KOLATA: I need evidence. I'm a science reporter. FLATOW: All right, Patrick. Thanks for calling. PATRICK: All right. Thank you. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. So is this just a moneymaking scheme, all these diets and losing weight? Or, what. . . Ms. KOLATA: Oh, well, you know, I think there's more than - I think in a way, it's like the cosmetics industry that tells us, oh, if you just bought the skin cream, those wrinkles would go away. And you know you're buying a myth, but it's just so alluring. You see all the pictures. On the other hand, there is this - I'd speak to a psychologist about why people keep going on diets. And he was really interesting. He said, you know - he asked the same question. He said, you would think that if in psychology there's one thing you learn is that behavior they call getting - gets extinguished. If you get punished for it over and over again, you're not going to continue. So you go on a diet, you gain the weight back. You'd do another diet. You gain the weight back. Why would you go on another diet after that? And he learned that people love going on diets. Sounds crazy, but they start out and they feel in total control. This is the beginning of the new me, the first day of the rest of my life. The weight starts to fall off at first and everybody tells them how great they look and they feel so wonderful and it'll never come back. They swear it'll never come back. And then they get to a point where it does come back, it always, it almost - I can't say always, but almost always does. And instead of saying, well, I'm never going on a diet again, was that a bad experience, they say I failed -it was me. I just lost control one day and I could never get it back again, or I was under stress at work. And then the next diet comes along, and they're so excited. They're in control again. It's a weird cycle. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 and there are scientists who believe just like you do, who have done research and believe that no matter what you do, you're going to be going up and down in this little range. Your body wants to be there. Ms. KOLATA: Well, there have been so - this hasn't been just one study. There have been decades of studies, and they show over and over and over again exactly what you just said. FLATOW: You point out, even people who've lost a hundred pounds. Ms. KOLATA: Yes. FLATOW: And you'd think I'm off. I've got the weight off. I'm going to keep it off now. Ms. KOLATA: It comes back and they wanted - they were very interesting because they've lost - this is - among the first studies that were done. And they put people in the hospital, to get their weight down. And they found that they looked like they were a normal weight when they left the hospital, but biologically, they were like people who were starving to death - all their physiological signs and symptoms. And then they craved food. Their metabolism slowed down by about 25 percent. So all of a sudden, they couldn't eat as much and the weight was - the weight came back. I actually had somebody e-mail me. She says she's lost a hundred pounds several times and she's wondering if there's any hope for her with any diet. FLATOW: And. Ms. KOLATA: I said to her that the research was not encouraging, but if she wanted to try again, who am I to say no. FLATOW: There's some research that says these yoyo diets are dangerous for you. Not sure? Ms. KOLATA: I'm not sure if it's dangerous for you, but you know, it's, it must be frustrating. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255. Tom is in Flagstaff. Hi, Tom. TOM (Caller): Hi, how are you guys doing? FLATOW: Hi there. TOM: I saw this show on the Discovery Channel maybe a year ago about this very obese woman, who was in perfect health conditions beside she's obese. So I was wondering if the correlation between obesity and health is sort of a myth? Ms. KOLATA: It's a great question. They're actually out - I have two kinds of answers. One of them was there was a big study in the U. S. that was - and it confirms with - also been shown on other countries as well, asking at what weight - what weight do you live longest? What's the death rate at different weights? And it turned out that the healthiest weight to be at as far as mortality is concerned is the so-called overweight range. The mortality curve looks like a U that's sort of flat on the bottom, and the bottom of the U was overweight. And not just like people keep saying, slightly overweight - no, overweight. And at the very - at the other end sits the very thin and very fat - there's a higher death rate. And very thin, people say, oh, that's because they were sick anyway. But no, they made sure that people who were in the very thin range had been thin for a long time, not suddenly. And they weren't - they took out the smokers, they adjusted - every time they look for something, the curve persisted. So I said, well, why would it be that overweight is better? And one hypothesis -and it's just a hypothesis - is when people get old and they get a chronic disease and they get cancer or something, if they're very thin, they have no reserves, I mean, if they start to lose weight because they're ill, there's nothing left. The other thing is the question of being fit and fat. There is - everybody is extremely concerned, as you know - as everybody knows about diabetes among fatter people. And many people who are fat have a sort of like a tipping point. They hit a certain weight range and then their blood sugar goes up, and if they could just get below it, it might go down again, but they have a lot of trouble. There is a big study by the National Institutes of Health, which took people who were on the verge of getting diabetes, their blood sugar have been rising. And they divided them into three groups. One group took a blood sugar-lowering drug. One group was the control and one group dieted and exercised. They had intensive therapy on dieting and exercise. At about seven years later, the diet and exercise group did better than any other group in terms of not getting diabetes. They hadn't really lost weight. What they'd done was kept up with the walking program. And that seem - and so that wasn't so much that they've lost a lot of weight, but that they were fit. So if maybe that if health is the issue, maybe trying to tell everybody that they have to lose 50, 60, 70 pounds - which they can't do anyway - is not really the best answer. FLATOW: And the answer would be to get some exercise. Ms. KOLATA: Well, this study seems to indicate that for diabetes. FLATOW: Right. Ms. KOLATA: Yes. And there's been studies showing that for heart disease, your heart - you'll do better with - well, these are - what they observe people. They are randomized to one thing or another. But observing people who do moderate exercise that seems to be good for your heart as well. TOM: All right. Thank you guys. Have a good one. FLATOW: Thank you. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Terence(ph) in Lansing, Michigan. Hi, Terence. TERENCE (Caller): Hey, Ira. Love the show. Thanks for having me. FLATOW: Thank you. TERENCE: Hey, I just wanted to point out, you know, you talk about diets and I think diets really don't work as a short-term solution. But what about changing your diet? Recently, I've gone vegetarian and tried to go more vegan, almost. And I lost quite a bit of weight and I've managed to keep it off for about a year now. And I just wonder, you know, maybe the diets that the American people eat, the processed foods and all the foods that are heavy in high-fructose corn syrup and things like that maybe, you know, something - it leads to people being fat and not necessarily genetic. Ms. KOLATA: That's a hypotheses that I've heard a lot. And the problem is there's lots of hypothesis about why people have been getting fatter, and there is nothing really solid that would sort of back any of them up. But it's interesting - your story is really interesting because - well, first of all, in my book, \"Rethinking Thin,\" I did follow people in a federal study. And it went on for two years and I don't want to be disheartening, but the first year, they all lost a lot of weight and the second year, it came back again, which is kind of typical. Within five years, most people gain back weight. However, there are people who don't and it's weird, it's unknown why some people respond to one thing and some people respond to another. Some people respond very well to some of the diet drugs that are on the market, which for most people do very little of, if anything at all. But some people actually really respond. There's something that just hits them. I was at a dinner last night. There's a woman there who's been on the - went on the Atkins type diet about 10 years ago and lost a lot of weight, and she's been eating that way ever since and never put it back. And now, you've gone on a vegan. type diet, lost some weight and haven't put it back. So there may be - and it's totally unnoticed, and this is like a total speculation on my part - various things that might work for somebody, and maybe not for the group as a whole. And if something works, I mean, I would say go for it, of course. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Thanks for calling. 1-800-989-8255. You've studied a lot of research. You looked at a lot of stuff. You're a great science writer. Did you discover holes in research? You say why didn't somebody - why don't they look at this or what is missing. You know, you say this is anecdotal information about that. Ms. KOLATA: Well, I wish that we - you know, actually, what I discovered was that there's research that is ignored. As though holes that have been filled and no one wants to hear about the filling, so they pretend it hasn't happened. My favorite one was two gigantic federal studies asking about whether you could prevent children from gaining weight. And they both - they were randomized, controlled clinical trials of the most rigorous kind. And both of them, they took hundreds of schools and they randomly assigned them to be an intervention school or a control school. And the intervention school, they did everything they say you should do for children. They took - they got rid of all the junk food. They gave them lots of nutrition education. They taught the children what to eat. They brought the parents in and educated the parents. They got all the families involved. They had physical education. In fact, they had lots of it. They hired special teachers to come in during the day and give them phys-ed breaks. Everything. Two years later - and one group was done with mainly kids in the Southwest who are often - lots of Native American kids who are at high risk. Usually if something works, you'll see it in the high-risk group right away. The other was just kids who were just normal-risk in another whole group, another giant study. So each study lasted two years and the question was did the intervention kids gain less weight? And the answer was no effect whatsoever. So one of the studies, this time with the Southwest kids - I went to the journal and they always say this study has been cited. Then they say what journal cited it. It was cited nowhere. No one ever cited that study. And called the researcher, he said, oh, yes, you're very astute, my friend. No one ever mentioned it again. FLATOW: Wow. Ms. KOLATA: It's like they don't want to hear it. And then I asked people, well, okay. So what does this mean? It tells you that everything you're trying hasn't had an effect. I mean, not that you would say eat junk food. But to say that's going to make you thin rather than healthy, to change your diet, maybe we should rethink it. And they said, oh, no. We just have to do more. Get everything involved. The whole entire community has to change. The grocery stores have to change. I asked a statistician what he thought of this and he said it reminds him of a story. . . FLATOW: Hey, let me just interrupt you. Ms. KOLATA: Okay. FLATOW: Because I have to give a station break. We're talking about dieting this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News with Gina Kolata, author of \"Rethinking Thin\" and telling a great story that I had interrupt about. . . Ms. KOLATA: Sorry. FLATOW: No. No. No. This is a great story because I have never heard the study myself either. Ms. KOLATA: No one had. No one. It's an amazing study. FLATOW: And you heard the study where they've tried everything with these kids. Ms. KOLATA: Two studies. FLATOW: Two studies. And nothing worked. Ms. KOLATA: Nothing worked. FLATOW: And you went back to the researcher and he said you're the first person asking about it. Ms. KOLATA: That's what it was. It was amazing. FLATOW: And continue. Ms. KOLATA: Well, I asked a statistician. FLATOW: Yeah. Ms. KOLATA: I said is this amazing or what? Here are these two studies, millions and millions. And one of them cost $20 million - gigantic studies -and nobody ever - even the government, that did it, never talks about it. And then when I asked them what to do, they say just get everybody - obviously, it wasn't enough. You have to do more. FLATOW: Of course. Ms. KOLATA: He said it reminds him of a study - it was a study that was done in the 1800s where a guy really believed that if you bleed people with leeches, it would cure tuberculosis or something - pneumonia - to cure pneumonia. So he did a study, a nice rigorous study, and the leeches didn't help. So his answer was you have to bleed harder and bleed longer. FLATOW: Things haven't changed. Ms. KOLATA: Yes, like the leeches. FLATOW: Wow. Wow. Ms. KOLATA: I mean, maybe doing more would help but you got to show that. You can't assume. FLATOW: But we have all our - all our policies are based on these kinds. . . Ms. KOLATA: I know. They are all based on it. FLATOW: They were all based on if we just do the right thing and. . . Ms. KOLATA: Right. Right. FLATOW: . . . then you're saying, doesn't matter what you do. Ms. KOLATA: It didn't matter. FLATOW: It's going to - it's not going. Ms. KOLATA: Well, there is something in the environment that made people get fatter now than they used to be. Now, we're also healthier than we used to be. Every major disease is on the wane. People are getting them later. Disabilities are down. People are living longer. People are definitely healthier than they used to be. One researcher at the Centers for Disease Control told me that he was at this photography exhibit with some colleagues. And they saw this picture of these kids, they were coal miners around the early 1900s. And his colleagues looked at them and said, look, they are thin. He said, damn right, they're thin. But you think they are healthy? These are kinds in the coal mines. The first thing they looked at it and they say, look at that, the kids are thin. I mean, there is more to health than being thin. FLATOW: All right, we're going to take a break. Come back to talk more with Gina Kolata, author of \"Rethinking Thin: The New Science of Weight Loss - and the Myths and Realities of Dieting. \" Boy, we've busted a couple of myths today. I learned something new. I think you did. Stay with us, we'll be right back after this short break. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about weight loss with my guest, Gina Kolata, senior writer for the New York Times, author of \"Rethinking Thin: The New Science of Weight Loss - and the Myths and Realities of Dieting. \" Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Did you come up with any of your own hypotheses about being fat and whatever, about why all this may be - we may be seeing, you know, fatter kids and is there something going on out there? Ms. KOLATA: Well, the main thing that I've discovered was how little is actually known. Because you could say, well, it's the environment. Then, what in the environment and when does it affect you? One thing that kind of surprised me was so many people now - and more and more, like everyday, I keep hearing about researchers who say we think now that the place to look may be back in prenatal life, which was kind of a surprise. And they said, you know, we know that animals, that if you make changes in the diet or all sorts of things during prenatal life, their offspring grow fat as adults. And weirdly enough, there's also a couple of examples with people. There've been 15 studies now that showed that women who smoked during pregnancy had kids who tended to grow fat as adults, which is weird. No one knows why. And then, there's also, with animals, if you don't give them enough to eat during pregnancy, their kids tend - kids - their offspring tend to develop diabetes and get fat. And no one knows why again. But with people, there is this one sort of a grisly experiment. During World War II, in Holland, there is this - they call it the hongerwinter, where everybody was starving - pregnant women, everybody - wasn't getting enough to eat. And when the babies were born, they looked fine at birth and they looked perfectly normal as they were growing up. But now, in middle age, they're getting - they are fat and they're getting diabetes. FLATOW: Wow. Ms. KOLATA: So it's weird. I mean, it's so - people know that you can make a difference in lots of health things, including weight and diabetes by affecting various things in the environment that early on. So there. . . FLATOW: When you're in the womb? Ms. KOLATA: In the womb, yeah. FLATOW: We know that with alcohol, certainly, right? Ms. KOLATA: Yeah. Right. Yeah. So here, if you say the environment made us fat, you say, well, when and what? If you start from the womb and you go all the way on from there, what's happening and when is it happening? It's just not clear. FLATOW: Wrong choice of word - a fertile ground for study? Ms. KOLATA: Well, there's a lot of study. FLATOW: Yeah. About that. Ms. KOLATA: A lot of study. And especially in this in-the-womb stuff. FLATOW: Yes. Ms. KOLATA: Every time I look at my e-mail, seems like somebody else is doing an in-the-womb study, usually with animals, but they're all trying to sort of get at what could it be. Is there something that we didn't think about, some little trigger, because what many people are beginning to think is that once you start - once you've already got this little range that your body wants to be in, it's very hard to budge it. And they did discover in mice, though, that there is - a couple of critical times, one of them is in adolescence, when the brain sort of gets rewired. FLATOW: Right. Ms. KOLATA: And you may change it then. So maybe it's an environment thing in adolescence. Who knows? It's really a mystery. FLATOW: So it may not just be a genetic thing is what you say. Ms. KOLATA: Well, it probably isn't genetic, because genes didn't change that much. On the other hand, genes and environment interact. FLATOW: Right. Ms. KOLATA: And in the Civil War, the average height of a man was 5 feet 5. So genes didn't change, environment did. And our environment has changed but we have no - no one knows. We - I'm not a scientist. Scientists don't know what -they have lots of ideas, but they don't really know what did it. FLATOW: Is there some are you yourself would like to, you know, as a journalist, pursue? Would this be a good. . . Ms. KOLATA: What I like to see - I just sit there and react. FLATOW: Well, if we have - you mentioned that you have this idea about the prenatal stage. Ms. KOLATA: Oh, no. I'm really fascinated with that. FLATOW: Yeah. Ms. KOLATA: I would also love to see whether or not there really is kind of an Achilles heel to this - that's a horrible - that's like the wrong analogy. But if there's like a little weak link in this brain system that controls weight because - so there's two ideas about whether or not there'll ever be a magic pill to sort of let people lose weight. One of them is that this system is so tightly controlled with controls upon controls that if you knock one thing out, something else will take its place. So it may be almost impossible to ever really affect it, because it's so important for survival. You know, people don't - aren't supposed to starve to death or eat themselves to death. The other is that if you were clever enough and you knocked out a few things at once, maybe you could tweak the system and control and then, sort of, lower the bodyweight range that people have. FLATOW: Right. I want to thank you for taking time to be with us. A fascinating book - \"Rethinking Thin: The New Science of Weight Loss - and the Myths and Realities of Dieting. \" Gina Kolata, always a pleasure. Ms. KOLATA: Thank you. It's great being here again, Ira. FLATOW: Thank you. Good luck with the book.  IRA FLATOW, host:  Up next, our national obsession with the bathroom scale. You know, there hasn't always been a bathroom scale. We're going to talk a bit about that a little bit more, and now why we're so obsessed with it. We are a nation of dieters, from Ornish to Atkins to Slim-Fast to Weight Watchers. We spend countless dollars each year on weight-loss products. You've got your books, your diets, your supplements, your gym memberships, your infomercial gadgets meant to shrink our abs, but you know what, we're still getting bigger.  According to the latest obesity researchers, 67 percent of Americans are overweight or obese. It seems almost like the harder we try to lose weight, the more weight we are gaining. And for all the money we spend on weight loss gimmicks, scientists at clinics and universities spend their research dollars trying to figure out even the most basic questions about weight. Is one diet better than another? Are there genetic reasons for obesity?  The answers have often been surprising, and my next guest has been following weight loss research, has gathered the myths and realities about dieting into her new book. Gina Kolata is a science writer for the New York Times. She's the author of \"Rethinking Thin: The New Science of Weight Loss - and the Myths and Realities of Dieting. \" Good to see you again, Gina.  Ms. GINA KOLATA (Author, \"Rethinking Thin: The New Science of Weight Loss - and the Myths and Realities of Dieting\"): It's great to be here, Ira. It's good to see you, too.  FLATOW: What is the biggest myth about dieting?  Ms. KOLATA: It's that anybody who wants to can weigh - can be arbitrarily thin. They just have to push themselves away from the table, eat less and exercise more.  FLATOW: They just - that's what everybody says. . .  Ms. KOLATA: That's right.  FLATOW: . . . if you only had more willpower.  Ms. KOLATA: Yeah. Right, of course. It's all up to you. You don't have to be fat. Anybody can be thin if they really wanted to. And it's a big myth.  FLATOW: And why is that a myth?  Ms. KOLATA: Well, there's been decade after decade after decade of research that explains not - that shows not just how very difficult it is, but why it's so very difficult. And then, there's even a more practical reason: if it was that easy, nobody would be fat.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: So you're a - are you of the mind that it doesn't matter what you do, your body has a certain weight it wants to be and it's going to be that weight.  Ms. KOLATA: Well, I go - I tried - because I'm a reporter, I try to go into things with a blank mind, without a preconception.  FLATOW: Right.  Ms. KOLATA: But I think that the science has been very persuasive that there is not just one weight that you could be but a range of weights. It may span like 20 pounds or so. And if you try to go below it or above it, it becomes almost impossible, and that happens for normal weight people and for fatter people. Everybody - and it seems to be genetically determined.  For example, they did a study in the 1980s with children who were adopted and didn't know their biological parents at all. And the question was when they were 40 years old, how - what weight did they have? Did they resemble their biological parents or their adopted parents? They resembled - you probably guess - their biological parents. Same thing with twins, identical twins ended up not just the same kinds of weights, but even the same distribution of body fat. I have this slide from a journal like 30 years ago, where they have photos of twins, identical and fraternal. They even have like the same love handles and they were identical.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. KOLATA: Identical.  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Gina Kolata, author of \"Rethinking Thin: The New Science of Weight Loss - and the Myths and Realities of Dieting. \" Our number 1-800-989-8255.  Is it a myth that now our kids are getting fatter and we've seen this happening, we - we hear about type 2 diabetes, all these diseases like that that kids never got before?  Ms. KOLATA: Well, actually, kids are fatter than they used to be. Everybody is slightly fatter than they used to be. But weirdly enough, the effect has really been on the fattest people getting a lot fatter and most people have gained on average like five or seven pounds which is probably, you know, getting towards - whatever the environmental effect is, it's probably - may be pushing people towards the top rather than the bottom or so their natural range.  Type 2 diabetes in kids is extraordinarily rare. It's so rare that it's almost impossible to track. It's much rarer than type 1 diabetes, which is very -which is a very rare disease. That's only one-tenth of all diabetics. But there are some children who have type 2 diabetes. And type 2 diabetes is affected by weight. The problem is almost everybody with type 2 diabetes would give anything not to have that disease. And if all they had to do was eat less and exercise more, most of them - who wants to inject yourself with insulin or take drugs all day?  FLATOW: But why are we seeing kids have it more or they - or did they always have it more and we never picked it up?  Ms. KOLATA: Well, it's not entirely clear because there's also a whole lot more surveillance especially when a fat kid comes in. And when you have a lot more surveillance, you're going to find a lot more because type 2 diabetes often has no symptoms. People don't know they have it until they have a blood sugar test.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. I was surprised to read about how some of these new fad diets are really not new at all, especially the Atkins diet, which you reported.  Ms. KOLATA: Oh, that was amazing. Yeah, these - almost everything that people try to do with dieting was discovered a long time ago. The Atkins diet was discovered twice in the 1800s, both times, it was in best-selling books. The second one was by an undertaker, sort of a funny person to write the best-selling book on dieting.  FLATOW: He's going to see a lot of fat people.  Ms. KOLATA: Right. William Banting. He was very fat and he discovered a low-carbohydrate diet. He was so miserable. People made fun of him. And he could hardly walk and he had all these health problems. And then he got on this diet and lost weight, wrote a little pamphlet about it, became such a hit internationally that the word for dieting became banting. So people, instead of saying I'm dieting, they would say I'm banting.  FLATOW: Wow.  Ms. KOLATA: And then that sort of fell out of favor in the early 1900s, when calorie counting came in and that's when our calorie charts were invented, and a lot of the same ones are there now. There's another best-selling book called \"How To Live. \" And it told you, you know, you can't really - people think that they're counting calories, but you really have to count calories.  You throw some peanuts in your mouth between meals, that's calories. You put some cream in your coffee, that's calories. You can't fool your body. But if you actually kept track of your calories, you would be thin.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Ms. KOLATA: So we've had that one, too.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255. Let's get some calls in. Patrick in Tampa. Hi, Patrick.  PATRICK (Caller): Hi. So my question is if people are genetically predisposed to the weight that they are, then how can they - at least when I travel on vacation to Europe, it seems like all the Europeans are much thinner than Americans are.  Ms. KOLATA: I love that question because I was just in Europe. I was in Italy. And I hear this all the time. I actually asked one of the researchers. I said, are people - how much fatter are people in the U. S. ? He said we really don't know because nobody but the U. S. does - has the kind of data we have. We have to - you actually have to weigh people, not just ask them what they weigh, and because people often, sort of, tend to, you know, shade the truth.  So I was in Italy, just out of curiosity, and I thought I'm going to try to guess who were the Americans. And I found that it was so strange, I couldn't tell what nationality people were until they - I heard them speaking.  And we were in this little town, we saw people at this bay, swimming, and my husband said, don't tell me Italians are thin ever again. And on a train, I saw this guy with this big stomach and I said, I know that guy is an American. Then I heard him speak - he was German.  So I don't know. I actually don't know. A lot of it is economics. You go to Europe. And when we were in Rome, we saw a lot of thin people. But then we were on a cycling trip and we were out in sort of rural Italy and it changed a lot. And if you're in New York, I think you see a lot thinner people than you do in certain other areas of the country.  PATRICK: Me, too.  Ms. KOLATA: So it's sort of hard to know sometimes.  FLATOW: We walk a lot here.  Ms. KOLATA: Well, that's the theory, but I'm not sure.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. KOLATA: I need evidence. I'm a science reporter.  FLATOW: All right, Patrick. Thanks for calling.  PATRICK: All right. Thank you.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. So is this just a moneymaking scheme, all these diets and losing weight? Or, what. . .  Ms. KOLATA: Oh, well, you know, I think there's more than - I think in a way, it's like the cosmetics industry that tells us, oh, if you just bought the skin cream, those wrinkles would go away. And you know you're buying a myth, but it's just so alluring. You see all the pictures.  On the other hand, there is this - I'd speak to a psychologist about why people keep going on diets. And he was really interesting. He said, you know - he asked the same question. He said, you would think that if in psychology there's one thing you learn is that behavior they call getting - gets extinguished.  If you get punished for it over and over again, you're not going to continue. So you go on a diet, you gain the weight back. You'd do another diet. You gain the weight back. Why would you go on another diet after that?  And he learned that people love going on diets. Sounds crazy, but they start out and they feel in total control. This is the beginning of the new me, the first day of the rest of my life. The weight starts to fall off at first and everybody tells them how great they look and they feel so wonderful and it'll never come back. They swear it'll never come back.  And then they get to a point where it does come back, it always, it almost - I can't say always, but almost always does. And instead of saying, well, I'm never going on a diet again, was that a bad experience, they say I failed -it was me. I just lost control one day and I could never get it back again, or I was under stress at work. And then the next diet comes along, and they're so excited. They're in control again. It's a weird cycle.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 and there are scientists who believe just like you do, who have done research and believe that no matter what you do, you're going to be going up and down in this little range. Your body wants to be there.  Ms. KOLATA: Well, there have been so - this hasn't been just one study. There have been decades of studies, and they show over and over and over again exactly what you just said.  FLATOW: You point out, even people who've lost a hundred pounds.  Ms. KOLATA: Yes.  FLATOW: And you'd think I'm off. I've got the weight off. I'm going to keep it off now.  Ms. KOLATA: It comes back and they wanted - they were very interesting because they've lost - this is - among the first studies that were done. And they put people in the hospital, to get their weight down. And they found that they looked like they were a normal weight when they left the hospital, but biologically, they were like people who were starving to death - all their physiological signs and symptoms.  And then they craved food. Their metabolism slowed down by about 25 percent. So all of a sudden, they couldn't eat as much and the weight was - the weight came back.  I actually had somebody e-mail me. She says she's lost a hundred pounds several times and she's wondering if there's any hope for her with any diet.  FLATOW: And.  Ms. KOLATA: I said to her that the research was not encouraging, but if she wanted to try again, who am I to say no.  FLATOW: There's some research that says these yoyo diets are dangerous for you. Not sure?  Ms. KOLATA: I'm not sure if it's dangerous for you, but you know, it's, it must be frustrating.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255. Tom is in Flagstaff. Hi, Tom.  TOM (Caller): Hi, how are you guys doing?  FLATOW: Hi there.  TOM: I saw this show on the Discovery Channel maybe a year ago about this very obese woman, who was in perfect health conditions beside she's obese. So I was wondering if the correlation between obesity and health is sort of a myth?  Ms. KOLATA: It's a great question. They're actually out - I have two kinds of answers. One of them was there was a big study in the U. S. that was - and it confirms with - also been shown on other countries as well, asking at what weight - what weight do you live longest?  What's the death rate at different weights? And it turned out that the healthiest weight to be at as far as mortality is concerned is the so-called overweight range. The mortality curve looks like a U that's sort of flat on the bottom, and the bottom of the U was overweight. And not just like people keep saying, slightly overweight - no, overweight. And at the very - at the other end sits the very thin and very fat - there's a higher death rate.  And very thin, people say, oh, that's because they were sick anyway. But no, they made sure that people who were in the very thin range had been thin for a long time, not suddenly. And they weren't - they took out the smokers, they adjusted - every time they look for something, the curve persisted.  So I said, well, why would it be that overweight is better? And one hypothesis -and it's just a hypothesis - is when people get old and they get a chronic disease and they get cancer or something, if they're very thin, they have no reserves, I mean, if they start to lose weight because they're ill, there's nothing left.  The other thing is the question of being fit and fat. There is - everybody is extremely concerned, as you know - as everybody knows about diabetes among fatter people. And many people who are fat have a sort of like a tipping point. They hit a certain weight range and then their blood sugar goes up, and if they could just get below it, it might go down again, but they have a lot of trouble.  There is a big study by the National Institutes of Health, which took people who were on the verge of getting diabetes, their blood sugar have been rising. And they divided them into three groups. One group took a blood sugar-lowering drug. One group was the control and one group dieted and exercised. They had intensive therapy on dieting and exercise.  At about seven years later, the diet and exercise group did better than any other group in terms of not getting diabetes. They hadn't really lost weight. What they'd done was kept up with the walking program. And that seem - and so that wasn't so much that they've lost a lot of weight, but that they were fit. So if maybe that if health is the issue, maybe trying to tell everybody that they have to lose 50, 60, 70 pounds - which they can't do anyway - is not really the best answer.  FLATOW: And the answer would be to get some exercise.  Ms. KOLATA: Well, this study seems to indicate that for diabetes.  FLATOW: Right.  Ms. KOLATA: Yes. And there's been studies showing that for heart disease, your heart - you'll do better with - well, these are - what they observe people. They are randomized to one thing or another. But observing people who do moderate exercise that seems to be good for your heart as well.  TOM: All right. Thank you guys. Have a good one.  FLATOW: Thank you. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Terence(ph) in Lansing, Michigan. Hi, Terence.  TERENCE (Caller): Hey, Ira. Love the show. Thanks for having me.  FLATOW: Thank you.  TERENCE: Hey, I just wanted to point out, you know, you talk about diets and I think diets really don't work as a short-term solution. But what about changing your diet? Recently, I've gone vegetarian and tried to go more vegan, almost. And I lost quite a bit of weight and I've managed to keep it off for about a year now. And I just wonder, you know, maybe the diets that the American people eat, the processed foods and all the foods that are heavy in high-fructose corn syrup and things like that maybe, you know, something - it leads to people being fat and not necessarily genetic.  Ms. KOLATA: That's a hypotheses that I've heard a lot. And the problem is there's lots of hypothesis about why people have been getting fatter, and there is nothing really solid that would sort of back any of them up. But it's interesting - your story is really interesting because - well, first of all, in my book, \"Rethinking Thin,\" I did follow people in a federal study. And it went on for two years and I don't want to be disheartening, but the first year, they all lost a lot of weight and the second year, it came back again, which is kind of typical. Within five years, most people gain back weight.  However, there are people who don't and it's weird, it's unknown why some people respond to one thing and some people respond to another. Some people respond very well to some of the diet drugs that are on the market, which for most people do very little of, if anything at all. But some people actually really respond. There's something that just hits them.  I was at a dinner last night. There's a woman there who's been on the - went on the Atkins type diet about 10 years ago and lost a lot of weight, and she's been eating that way ever since and never put it back. And now, you've gone on a vegan. type diet, lost some weight and haven't put it back. So there may be - and it's totally unnoticed, and this is like a total speculation on my part - various things that might work for somebody, and maybe not for the group as a whole. And if something works, I mean, I would say go for it, of course.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Thanks for calling. 1-800-989-8255. You've studied a lot of research. You looked at a lot of stuff. You're a great science writer. Did you discover holes in research? You say why didn't somebody - why don't they look at this or what is missing. You know, you say this is anecdotal information about that.  Ms. KOLATA: Well, I wish that we - you know, actually, what I discovered was that there's research that is ignored. As though holes that have been filled and no one wants to hear about the filling, so they pretend it hasn't happened. My favorite one was two gigantic federal studies asking about whether you could prevent children from gaining weight. And they both - they were randomized, controlled clinical trials of the most rigorous kind. And both of them, they took hundreds of schools and they randomly assigned them to be an intervention school or a control school.  And the intervention school, they did everything they say you should do for children. They took - they got rid of all the junk food. They gave them lots of nutrition education. They taught the children what to eat. They brought the parents in and educated the parents. They got all the families involved. They had physical education. In fact, they had lots of it. They hired special teachers to come in during the day and give them phys-ed breaks. Everything.  Two years later - and one group was done with mainly kids in the Southwest who are often - lots of Native American kids who are at high risk. Usually if something works, you'll see it in the high-risk group right away. The other was just kids who were just normal-risk in another whole group, another giant study. So each study lasted two years and the question was did the intervention kids gain less weight? And the answer was no effect whatsoever.  So one of the studies, this time with the Southwest kids - I went to the journal and they always say this study has been cited. Then they say what journal cited it. It was cited nowhere. No one ever cited that study. And called the researcher, he said, oh, yes, you're very astute, my friend. No one ever mentioned it again.  FLATOW: Wow.  Ms. KOLATA: It's like they don't want to hear it. And then I asked people, well, okay. So what does this mean? It tells you that everything you're trying hasn't had an effect. I mean, not that you would say eat junk food. But to say that's going to make you thin rather than healthy, to change your diet, maybe we should rethink it. And they said, oh, no. We just have to do more. Get everything involved. The whole entire community has to change. The grocery stores have to change. I asked a statistician what he thought of this and he said it reminds him of a story. . .  FLATOW: Hey, let me just interrupt you.  Ms. KOLATA: Okay.  FLATOW: Because I have to give a station break. We're talking about dieting this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News with Gina Kolata, author of \"Rethinking Thin\" and telling a great story that I had interrupt about. . .  Ms. KOLATA: Sorry.  FLATOW: No. No. No. This is a great story because I have never heard the study myself either.  Ms. KOLATA: No one had. No one. It's an amazing study.  FLATOW: And you heard the study where they've tried everything with these kids.  Ms. KOLATA: Two studies.  FLATOW: Two studies. And nothing worked.  Ms. KOLATA: Nothing worked.  FLATOW: And you went back to the researcher and he said you're the first person asking about it.  Ms. KOLATA: That's what it was. It was amazing.  FLATOW: And continue.  Ms. KOLATA: Well, I asked a statistician.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Ms. KOLATA: I said is this amazing or what? Here are these two studies, millions and millions. And one of them cost $20 million - gigantic studies -and nobody ever - even the government, that did it, never talks about it. And then when I asked them what to do, they say just get everybody - obviously, it wasn't enough. You have to do more.  FLATOW: Of course.  Ms. KOLATA: He said it reminds him of a study - it was a study that was done in the 1800s where a guy really believed that if you bleed people with leeches, it would cure tuberculosis or something - pneumonia - to cure pneumonia. So he did a study, a nice rigorous study, and the leeches didn't help. So his answer was you have to bleed harder and bleed longer.  FLATOW: Things haven't changed.  Ms. KOLATA: Yes, like the leeches.  FLATOW: Wow. Wow.  Ms. KOLATA: I mean, maybe doing more would help but you got to show that. You can't assume.  FLATOW: But we have all our - all our policies are based on these kinds. . .  Ms. KOLATA: I know. They are all based on it.  FLATOW: They were all based on if we just do the right thing and. . .  Ms. KOLATA: Right. Right.  FLATOW: . . . then you're saying, doesn't matter what you do.  Ms. KOLATA: It didn't matter.  FLATOW: It's going to - it's not going.  Ms. KOLATA: Well, there is something in the environment that made people get fatter now than they used to be. Now, we're also healthier than we used to be. Every major disease is on the wane. People are getting them later. Disabilities are down. People are living longer. People are definitely healthier than they used to be.  One researcher at the Centers for Disease Control told me that he was at this photography exhibit with some colleagues. And they saw this picture of these kids, they were coal miners around the early 1900s. And his colleagues looked at them and said, look, they are thin. He said, damn right, they're thin. But you think they are healthy? These are kinds in the coal mines. The first thing they looked at it and they say, look at that, the kids are thin. I mean, there is more to health than being thin.  FLATOW: All right, we're going to take a break. Come back to talk more with Gina Kolata, author of \"Rethinking Thin: The New Science of Weight Loss - and the Myths and Realities of Dieting. \" Boy, we've busted a couple of myths today. I learned something new. I think you did. Stay with us, we'll be right back after this short break.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about weight loss with my guest, Gina Kolata, senior writer for the New York Times, author of \"Rethinking Thin: The New Science of Weight Loss - and the Myths and Realities of Dieting. \" Our number, 1-800-989-8255.  Did you come up with any of your own hypotheses about being fat and whatever, about why all this may be - we may be seeing, you know, fatter kids and is there something going on out there?  Ms. KOLATA: Well, the main thing that I've discovered was how little is actually known. Because you could say, well, it's the environment. Then, what in the environment and when does it affect you? One thing that kind of surprised me was so many people now - and more and more, like everyday, I keep hearing about researchers who say we think now that the place to look may be back in prenatal life, which was kind of a surprise. And they said, you know, we know that animals, that if you make changes in the diet or all sorts of things during prenatal life, their offspring grow fat as adults. And weirdly enough, there's also a couple of examples with people. There've been 15 studies now that showed that women who smoked during pregnancy had kids who tended to grow fat as adults, which is weird. No one knows why.  And then, there's also, with animals, if you don't give them enough to eat during pregnancy, their kids tend - kids - their offspring tend to develop diabetes and get fat. And no one knows why again. But with people, there is this one sort of a grisly experiment. During World War II, in Holland, there is this - they call it the hongerwinter, where everybody was starving - pregnant women, everybody - wasn't getting enough to eat. And when the babies were born, they looked fine at birth and they looked perfectly normal as they were growing up. But now, in middle age, they're getting - they are fat and they're getting diabetes.  FLATOW: Wow.  Ms. KOLATA: So it's weird. I mean, it's so - people know that you can make a difference in lots of health things, including weight and diabetes by affecting various things in the environment that early on. So there. . .  FLATOW: When you're in the womb?  Ms. KOLATA: In the womb, yeah.  FLATOW: We know that with alcohol, certainly, right?  Ms. KOLATA: Yeah. Right. Yeah. So here, if you say the environment made us fat, you say, well, when and what? If you start from the womb and you go all the way on from there, what's happening and when is it happening? It's just not clear.  FLATOW: Wrong choice of word - a fertile ground for study?  Ms. KOLATA: Well, there's a lot of study.  FLATOW: Yeah. About that.  Ms. KOLATA: A lot of study. And especially in this in-the-womb stuff.  FLATOW: Yes.  Ms. KOLATA: Every time I look at my e-mail, seems like somebody else is doing an in-the-womb study, usually with animals, but they're all trying to sort of get at what could it be. Is there something that we didn't think about, some little trigger, because what many people are beginning to think is that once you start - once you've already got this little range that your body wants to be in, it's very hard to budge it. And they did discover in mice, though, that there is - a couple of critical times, one of them is in adolescence, when the brain sort of gets rewired.  FLATOW: Right.  Ms. KOLATA: And you may change it then. So maybe it's an environment thing in adolescence. Who knows? It's really a mystery.  FLATOW: So it may not just be a genetic thing is what you say.  Ms. KOLATA: Well, it probably isn't genetic, because genes didn't change that much. On the other hand, genes and environment interact.  FLATOW: Right.  Ms. KOLATA: And in the Civil War, the average height of a man was 5 feet 5. So genes didn't change, environment did. And our environment has changed but we have no - no one knows. We - I'm not a scientist. Scientists don't know what -they have lots of ideas, but they don't really know what did it.  FLATOW: Is there some are you yourself would like to, you know, as a journalist, pursue? Would this be a good. . .  Ms. KOLATA: What I like to see - I just sit there and react.  FLATOW: Well, if we have - you mentioned that you have this idea about the prenatal stage.  Ms. KOLATA: Oh, no. I'm really fascinated with that.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Ms. KOLATA: I would also love to see whether or not there really is kind of an Achilles heel to this - that's a horrible - that's like the wrong analogy. But if there's like a little weak link in this brain system that controls weight because - so there's two ideas about whether or not there'll ever be a magic pill to sort of let people lose weight. One of them is that this system is so tightly controlled with controls upon controls that if you knock one thing out, something else will take its place.  So it may be almost impossible to ever really affect it, because it's so important for survival. You know, people don't - aren't supposed to starve to death or eat themselves to death.  The other is that if you were clever enough and you knocked out a few things at once, maybe you could tweak the system and control and then, sort of, lower the bodyweight range that people have.  FLATOW: Right. I want to thank you for taking time to be with us. A fascinating book - \"Rethinking Thin: The New Science of Weight Loss - and the Myths and Realities of Dieting. \" Gina Kolata, always a pleasure.  Ms. KOLATA: Thank you. It's great being here again, Ira.  FLATOW: Thank you. Good luck with the book. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2007 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Ira Flatow. A bit later in the hour, we'll be talking about the latest stem cell research. But up first, a closer look at a research finding scientists say puts them one step closer to creating artificial life. A team of scientists, led by Craig Venter of genome sequencing fame, has taken the entire set of genes from one bacterium and transferred that set into a related one, essentially transforming the second bacterium into the first, a nifty scientific trick he believes could someday help lead to the creation of artificial life. Venter is not talking about Dr. Frankenstein here, rather artificially creating designer bacteria for the microbe factories to produce products like, well, let's say, eco-friendly fuels. The team's work is published in today's issue of the journal Science. Craig Venter joins us this hour to tell us about his research, where it's headed, and if all this talk of creating artificial life, even artificial microbial life, leaves you feeling a bit uneasy, you're not alone, bioethicist Mildred Cho is also concerned. Dr. Cho is here to advise us to think about the implications of this work from the introduction of artificial life forms into the environment to metaphysical issues, such as, what constitutes life? And since the odds are that artificial life forms will be patented, who should be able to claim ownership of these noble life forms and the process by which they are created? If these are things that are on your mind, give us a call. Our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. FLATOW: Let me introduce my guests. J. Craig Venter is the founder and president of the J. Craig Venture Institute in Rockville, Maryland. His team's synthetic genome research, as I say, is published in today's issue of the journal Science. He joins today by phone from San Diego. Welcome back to the program, Dr. Venter. Dr. J. CRAIG VENTER (Founder and President, J. Craig Venter Institute): Thank you. It's nice to be back with you. FLATOW: You're welcome. Mildred Cho is associate director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics and associate professor of pediatrics at Stanford University Medical Center in Stanford, California. She chaired a panel that examined the ethical issues surrounding Dr. Venter's research into the minimum number of genes needed to sustain life. That panel published its findings in 1999. Dr. Cho joins me today by phone from the Stanford campus. Welcome back to the program. Dr. MILDRED CHO (Associate Director, Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics): Thanks, Ira. FLATOW: Dr. Venter, can you give us a brief thumbnail of what that experiment was? I think you describe it as something like changing a Mac to a PC. Dr. VENTER: It's - that's certainly a metaphor for it. It's - I think it's much more interesting at the biological level. And we started with two somewhat closely related mycoplasmas - these are very small bacterial genomes. In fact, the reasons we started with them, we sequenced the mycoplasma genome in 1995 as our second genome, and it was and is still is the smallest genome thus far sequenced in history for a self-replicating organism. So we isolated the chromosome for one mycoplasma, made sure that it was stripped off of all its DNA and other molecules to what we call naked DNA. We wanted to make sure we had just the genetic code molecules and nothing else, because if we're making DNA synthetically that's all we would have. We then inserted that chromosome into another species of mycoplasma, and then used a standard laboratory selection method to select for cells that contain the transplanted chromosome. And after several days, when the colonies grew up to a visible size, when we looked at them in their molecular biology and biochemistry, they had only the chromosome that we transplanted in and all the characteristics of the cell (audio gap) with the transplanted chromosome. So all the characteristics that we knew this species has before all went away and it completely converted into the new species. And so, you can look at this at several levels. It certainly validates and proves that it's the genetic material that's certainly transforming all of this information. But the - it was such a complete transformation. It was a very pleasant surprise to us. FLATOW: Why would you be surprised by it? Did you not expect this to happen? Dr. VENTER: Well, as one of our reviewers of the Science paper said, this is one of those things that's very simple in concept, extremely complex in delivery. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. VENTER: So we've had to develop a wide range of new techniques and technologies to be able to even manipulate entire chromosome of cells. DNA gets very brittle when it's larger pieces, and to try and keep an intact circular chromosome and have it be in the right supercoiled form, having the right ways to get it across the membrane, all of these things, nobody has known how to do before. So in theory, in a concept that should have worked in practice, there's lots and lots of things, as we try this with different cells, that could potentially block it from happening. FLATOW: Is the endgame here to create a synthetic chromosome and put that into a cell? Dr. VENTER: It's certainly one of the goals of our research. And these all emanated from, again, characterizing these first two genomes in history in 1995 and trying to understand what would be a minimal gene complement to have for self-replicating cellular life. For the last decade or so, we've been doing various types of gene knockout experiments, trying to find out which genes were essential and which were not. But you can only take out one gene at a time. There's no way to sequentially take out one, two, 200 genes. And so that's what that led us down to synthetic chromosome path in the first place, just trying to understand basic cellular function. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. VENTER: Out of every genome that's been sequenced - and my team has done now hundreds of them - at least 25 to 40 percent of the genes we discover in each chromosome, in each cell, are of complete unknown function. This is true even for the minimal cell. A hundred out of three to four hundred genes are of unknown function. So our actual knowledge of molecular biology and cell biology is still pretty primitive. We need these techniques to really understand these genes and what constitutes basic biochemistry of a cell. FLATOW: Why is it not considered - when you do this that you're actually creating new life or creating life? Dr. VENTER: Well, we're not creating life at all. I mean, we're taking a chromosome from a living species and putting that in another living species and it's converting that second species into the first one. So we're transforming life of that cell. These are all naturally occurring organisms that are widely studied in the lab and in the environment. And even, I think, it's a technical issue as to whether - even with a synthetic chromosome doing the same operation, we don't use that word creating life with it. We're using as a vessel existing cells with existing chromosomes. What we're doing is creating a new chromosome for it out of chemical synthesized in the lab and booting up that chromosome with the cellular system. I think that's the key thing that we've shown in the Science paper is that it is now possible to take another chromosome and boot it up and have it really take over the cell. I think, ultimately, if you could take all the chemical components in a cell with the chromosome, mix them together in a nice soup and get living self-replicating cells out of it that might someday be viewed as creating life. I think we're developing new life forms out of existing life, as has been the history of biology from the beginning. FLATOW: Mildred Cho, as an ethicist, how do you view this feat? Dr. CHO: Well, I think it's a very important technological development. And I agree with Dr. Venter, and I think it's good that he's been very careful to say that what has been done here is not really creating artificial life, but to sort of mix and match different parts of existing naturally occurring species. And also, I think he's been very good to really talk about what we don't understand yet from this work and while it is a significant step forward in creating - being able to manipulate genomes and bacteria, we still don't really understand fully why it works or how it works, and what's happening to the host genome, for example. It seems not to be expressed eventually, but the mechanism of that is still not known. FLATOW: Do you think the public is uneasy when they hear these kinds of advances? Dr. CHO: Well, I think so. I think part of it has to do with perhaps the fact that scientists can very easily see what the wonderful applications that this work can lead to, but it's maybe not so obvious to the public generally. And when I look at the title, for example, of the article that was published, it's called, \"Genome Transplantation in Bacteria: Changing One Species to Another. \" And if you look at that as someone who doesn't really know much about microbial genomics, one might just ask the question, why would you want to change one species to another? I mean, what's wrong with the ones we have? So I think one thing for the scientific community to consider is to really be clear about why they're doing what they're doing and acknowledging that they have the best of intentions, but being more specific about what those intentions are to allay some of the fears that the public might have. FLATOW: You don't think they're proactive enough in it. Dr. CHO: Well, I think it could be explained a little bit more clearly, yeah, and proactively what the purposes are and what the potential beneficial applications of this research might be. FLATOW: Well, we're going to do very much of that. After we take a break, we're going to come back - take a break, come back, and talk with Mildred Cho and Craig Venter who's going to layout for us, hopefully Dr. Venter, what the purposes are? What are the potential benefits? I mentioned something before about bacteria making ecofuels for us, but bacteria - a little factory that can make all kinds of stuff, can't they? So we'll take a short break and come back and talk lot's more. Our number, 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. If you'd like to talk with J. Craig Venter and Mildred Cho about this experiment, which they were able to transplant chromosomes and create one - change one bacteria into another. We'll talk about your bacterium experience if you have one. If you have some questions for us to answer, give us a call 1-800-989-8255. We'll be right back after this break. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking about some research conducted by Craig Venter and folks in his lab, a team that he led where he has taken an entire set of genes from one bacterium and transferred them into a related one. Essentially, transforming the second bacterium into the first. Dr. Venter, what can you do now? What is - give us some of the things that Dr. Cho said that scientists need to explain to the public about why you do you do these sorts of things. Dr. Venter: And I agree with Mildred completely. I think scientists particularly with public funding have a natural obligation to explain their work to the public. And sometimes when we do that too much, we get accused of doing it too much. So it's a delicate balance. But I think this work is exciting in a very basic science level in terms of trying to understand basic cellular physiology. And I think it also helps maybe to understand some key events in evolution. For example, when we sequenced the color of genome, several scientists thought the color of genome would be indistinguishable basically from E. coli because it had some similar genes in it. When we sequenced it, we found it actually had two chromosomes, one that was, in fact, similar to E. coli and one that was dramatically different. So it's entirely possible what we have done in the lab and the Science paper. Actually, it happens occasionally in nature. You wouldn't see if it completely transformed the species. But when you get the stable chimeras where you have both chromosomes present, you get totally a new species that didn't exist before. Unfortunately, in the case of cholera, it's one that causes human disease. So maybe by understanding how these events took place, we can understand speciation and stuff a little bit better. I think the other thing that it really does is enable the field of synthetic genomics. We've been trying for sometime, as I think many people know, to try and make a synthetic mycoplasma chromosome in the laboratory. And the big question has been, number one, can we do that and if we were able to chemically make this chromosome, what would we do with it? How do you boot up a chromosome to give a living entity out of it. And we've explored a number of approaches and ideas. Initially, we thought we would have to use a ghost cell, where the chromosomes were removed and try and add a new one in. And I think it was Hannah Smith who came up with a notion why not just why not just leave the chromosome in and add the new one and use selectable markers to go in this new direction. The fact that we can now know that we can take naked DNA, a pure chromosome, we now know how to manipulate it and deal with it without it being destroyed and transplanted into these cells and that these mechanisms - and Mildred is right, we don't know exactly what happen in the cell. We have a couple of ideas - when cells divide, the chromosomes go in different directions. So maybe, even after the first division, one chromosome goes to one cell and the parent one goes another way. Also, bacterial cells have unique defense mechanisms and I think this study shows why they would need to have those restriction enzymes - restriction systems were developed in evolution to protect cells from foreign DNA coming in. And you can see if a chromosome can enter your cell and take over your whole existence and your identity, you'd want to have mechanisms to protect against that. The one cell we used didn't have a restriction enzyme in it. The chromosome we put in, we think, does have one and it's possible that that was expressed and shoot up the parent chromosome on entry. So these events took place in just such a small number of the cells, they're impossible to track right now as to the exact mechanism. But I think this is important to understand as we try this with other cellular systems. You have to overcome the restriction enzymes. FLATOW: You've said that the earliest application of this work - the earliest applications are likely to be in creating designer fuels from bacterial metabolism? Why would that be the earliest application? Dr. VENTER: Well, we think it's one of the most important applications. After myself and my colleagues finished sequencing the human genome, we started looking around to where we could apply our technology and know-how. And the biggest problem I think facing humanity is what we're doing to the environment; burning these billions of tons of fuel, where we end up with - on the order of, right now, three and a half billion tons of CO2 going into the atmosphere each year. We can't keep doing that. And the estimates - that's going to go up to 12 billion tons as population growth changes and developing countries had more and more cars and industry. We're facing potential - the end of life ultimately as we know it on this planet, if we don't change things. Certainly even the predictions of flooding in the near future could be a disaster for major populations. So I think coming up with alternatives to taking the carbon out of the ground, burning that and putting that in the atmosphere, is our most pressing issue. And I'm a believer that biology can play a key role in that, and that synthetic biology - maybe we can come up with chemical pathways to make fuels that don't currently exists. Our existing repertoire comes from altering properties of oil, we can actually make better designer renewable fuels using bacteria metabolism. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Leslie(ph) in Thomasville, Georgia. Hi, Leslie. LESLIE (Caller): Hi, Ira. How are you? FLATOW: Hi. LESLIE: My question is - and I've been following the genome project and I know a little bit about molecular biology, but I'm not a molecular biologist - is how, especially since he said that some of those genes - they may not know exactly what they do. How do we know that when we put that gene into that other bacteria that it won't create something that will come back to really bite us? And I'm just reminded of Michael Crichton's book the \"Prey,\" where there was some nano products that took over. And I'll be glad to take my answer off the phone. FLATOW: Okay. LESLIE: Off the air. Thank you. Dr. VENTER: It's a very good question. In fact, if you're a Michael Crichton fan, you can go back much earlier to \"Andromeda Strain,\" where scientists were manipulating things in the lab. So there are lots of themes in books and movies about the science fiction horrors of science. And it's something obviously that scientists need to be very careful with. We're working with systems and we've - through a year and a half to two-year long review, along with MIT, you know, a project funded by the Sloan Foundation - trying to look at laboratory practices for laboratories doing synthetic biology, synthetic genomics. One of the rules that we've set is a very absolute rule, nothing should be allowed to be made that could grow outside of the laboratory and outside the laboratory conditions. And we have 30 years of molecular biology with millions of experiments being done with those kinds of conditions and it's worked quite well. Also, we're working with gene sets from known species. And we do want to understand those unknown genes, but we also understand whether they're expressed or not in their existing cells. I think it's a caution that we need to constantly pay attention to. And I think we certainly, at the Venter Institute, set up elaborate procedures to do that. FLATOW: Dr. Cho, we're dealing with life forms and products that have never existed before. How do we use our current infrastructure - our current regulatory infrastructures or do we need to set up all new ones? Dr. CHO: Well, that's a very good question because I think our - the way our laws and regulations go, they don't handle radically new technologies very well. And so if - there isn't really a good set of processes to deal with or to evaluate the kinds of synthetic biology products that will soon be multiplying. Though we may need to rethink the way we regulate or at least evaluate new products, especially if they going to be released into the environment. Because right now, our regulatory system is very specifically focused on known toxins - like ozone, or mercury, or other hazard pesticide, radioactive materials because of their known hazards - or on things that we want to protect like air, water, wetlands, endangered species, that kind of things. So they're either focused on sort of things you want to protect or known toxins. And when you go into the area of the unknown, the regulations aren't really built to handle those very well. So we may need to really do think how we might evaluate things that eventually as we want to release bacteria, for example, into the environment, a way to evaluate, you know, what counts as an environmental risk that we want to avoid. Is that just human health? Is it risks to the whole ecosystem? And try to avoid - even if we have the best of intentions, you know, the kind of scenario that has occurred when we release organisms into new kinds of environments that have not seen that organism. And we don't want to have a, sort of, repeat of, a molecular repeat or a microbial repeat of kudzu, for example. FLATOW: Right. Dr. Venter, have you filed a patent for what you just accomplished? Dr. VENTER: Our team has filed patents on multiple steps in the process that -the normal methods that we have developed. And I think that, - at the top of the show you've mentioned that there was an issue whether you could patent synthetic life. And I think it's always been an issue even though the Supreme Court ruled that you could patent life forms, and large number of patents have been issued for naturally occurring organisms, something that I've never quiet understood how that happened. But I think it's pretty clear-cut if we're designing and synthesizing genomes from scratch that these are clearly human designed and human-made processes that should fit in the existence patent law, if naturally occurring organisms (unintelligible) this should be much more clear-cut. FLATOW: Dr. Cho? Dr. CHO: Well, it's absolutely true that our patent system does allow patenting of life forms if they have been modified in a way that such - they don't occur that way in nature. So, although a lot of people find that strange, I think that you could patent something that's a living thing. If it's something that wasn't naturally occurring, it's considered an invention, that it's patentable. I think where the public policy issues do come into play though is in the details of what is claimed in the patent. And so, what you want to try to avoid in a patent is overly broad claims that actually claim something that you haven't actually invented yet or, something that might potentially block new inventions but that are not similar to what was actually done. So for example, if you patent something that claims that you've made a new car because you've designed new wheels and an engine, what you don't want to do is have that patent be so broad that it excludes somebody else patenting or making something with very new kinds of wheels or a new kind of engines, like, you know, a fuel cell instead of a combustion engine. So the devil is really in the details of how those patents are framed. FLATOW: Talking about synthetic life forms this hour at TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Dr. Venter, where do you go from here? Dr. VENTER: Well, the, the next obvious step for us is to - once we have a completely chemically synthesized chromosome, to try these same type of experiments that we've just reported in Science with a synthetic chromosome. And I think based on these experiments we've done, there is no theoretical barriers to that at all. For example, if we made the microdius(ph) chromosome chemically, it would be indistinguishable from the naturally occurring one if we just took the genetic code and copied it. So I think it's more of a technical issue and proof of a point that you could do this with a chemically synthesized piece of DNA. I think the challenge there is the largest piece of DNA that's been reported in the literatures on the order of 35,000 base pairs. And the smallest genome that we're working with is 560,000. So it's quite a substantial different scale to be working at in terms of DNA synthesis. Once that's done, combining the two, we think, would give us certainly a living entity with a completely synthetic chromosome as it's starter material. And one of the things you can do when you're designing and making DNA chemically is we can watermark that in all kinds of interesting ways. So with the genetic code, we have four letters in it, but triplet sets of those, three letters code for the range of amino acids that we use, they'd give us ways to spell out all kinds of interesting things in the genome both for fun and for proof of principle. FLATOW: And at that point, you would be - you would consider what you've created in that case, something living? Dr. VENTER: Yes. If they \u2026 FLATOW: Something synthetically\u2026 Dr. VENTER: \u2026if it becomes like we've reported in Science, a self-replicating cell based on the synthetic chromosome as its starter material, yes, I think people would agree that it would be a, a living self-replicating entity. FLATOW: Dr. Cho, how would that - what kind of reaction would that get? Dr. CHO: Well, again, I think, it raises a lot of the same issues that we've already talked about in terms of- the safety and so forth. And - but also, as we get a greater understanding of how to manipulate species, and if we are able to indeed change one species into another, it does raise a lot of other issues even if they're not technically feasible right now. But now would be a good time to talk about some of the issues like, for example, what are the implications for human life? What if you could change one species to another? Does that mean you can take a non-human species and make it human? And when does the species become human? What do you have to change about something to make it human? And then, does that entity have human rights and responsibilities, for example? And this is way off in the future if ever possible. But I think this is one of the reasons why, if people get a little nervous about this kind of research, that they are kind of looking forward to the future and it would be good to have a more broad public discussion about that now rather than later. FLATOW: Yeah. It's not too\u2026 Dr. VENTER: I think this is one of those cases where the ethicists are willing to go a whole lot further than the scientists. We think talking about transforming or improving humans through these techniques is I think that kind of speculation that they think does make and should make people nervous, and I don't know of any scientists that are actually advocating it. And I think if we can solve with single-cell bacteria some of the world's, you know, problems with food and fuel and contaminated air, I think those are very worthwhile goals. And it's certainly not our goal to transform or synthesize new humans or to try and, you know, repeat evolution at a much larger scale. FLATOW: All right. We've run out\u2026 Dr. VENTER: I'm sorry. Go ahead. FLATOW: We've run out of time, Dr. Venter. But I think you made your point and made it very well. I want to thank you for talking time to be with us. J. Craig Venter is founder and president of J. Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland, and Mildred Cho, associate director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics. Thank you for taking time to be with us. We're going to take a break. Come back and switch gears. Don't go away. We will be right back. I'm Ira Flatow. This TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  A bit later in the hour, we'll be talking about the latest stem cell research.  But up first, a closer look at a research finding scientists say puts them one step closer to creating artificial life. A team of scientists, led by Craig Venter of genome sequencing fame, has taken the entire set of genes from one bacterium and transferred that set into a related one, essentially transforming the second bacterium into the first, a nifty scientific trick he believes could someday help lead to the creation of artificial life. Venter is not talking about Dr. Frankenstein here, rather artificially creating designer bacteria for the microbe factories to produce products like, well, let's say, eco-friendly fuels. The team's work is published in today's issue of the journal Science.  Craig Venter joins us this hour to tell us about his research, where it's headed, and if all this talk of creating artificial life, even artificial microbial life, leaves you feeling a bit uneasy, you're not alone, bioethicist Mildred Cho is also concerned. Dr. Cho is here to advise us to think about the implications of this work from the introduction of artificial life forms into the environment to metaphysical issues, such as, what constitutes life? And since the odds are that artificial life forms will be patented, who should be able to claim ownership of these noble life forms and the process by which they are created?  If these are things that are on your mind, give us a call. Our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK.  FLATOW: Let me introduce my guests. J. Craig Venter is the founder and president of the J. Craig Venture Institute in Rockville, Maryland. His team's synthetic genome research, as I say, is published in today's issue of the journal Science. He joins today by phone from San Diego. Welcome back to the program, Dr. Venter.  Dr. J. CRAIG VENTER (Founder and President, J. Craig Venter Institute): Thank you. It's nice to be back with you.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Mildred Cho is associate director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics and associate professor of pediatrics at Stanford University Medical Center in Stanford, California. She chaired a panel that examined the ethical issues surrounding Dr. Venter's research into the minimum number of genes needed to sustain life. That panel published its findings in 1999. Dr. Cho joins me today by phone from the Stanford campus. Welcome back to the program.  Dr. MILDRED CHO (Associate Director, Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics): Thanks, Ira.  FLATOW: Dr. Venter, can you give us a brief thumbnail of what that experiment was? I think you describe it as something like changing a Mac to a PC.  Dr. VENTER: It's - that's certainly a metaphor for it. It's - I think it's much more interesting at the biological level. And we started with two somewhat closely related mycoplasmas - these are very small bacterial genomes. In fact, the reasons we started with them, we sequenced the mycoplasma genome in 1995 as our second genome, and it was and is still is the smallest genome thus far sequenced in history for a self-replicating organism.  So we isolated the chromosome for one mycoplasma, made sure that it was stripped off of all its DNA and other molecules to what we call naked DNA. We wanted to make sure we had just the genetic code molecules and nothing else, because if we're making DNA synthetically that's all we would have. We then inserted that chromosome into another species of mycoplasma, and then used a standard laboratory selection method to select for cells that contain the transplanted chromosome.  And after several days, when the colonies grew up to a visible size, when we looked at them in their molecular biology and biochemistry, they had only the chromosome that we transplanted in and all the characteristics of the cell (audio gap) with the transplanted chromosome. So all the characteristics that we knew this species has before all went away and it completely converted into the new species.  And so, you can look at this at several levels. It certainly validates and proves that it's the genetic material that's certainly transforming all of this information. But the - it was such a complete transformation. It was a very pleasant surprise to us.  FLATOW: Why would you be surprised by it? Did you not expect this to happen?  Dr. VENTER: Well, as one of our reviewers of the Science paper said, this is one of those things that's very simple in concept, extremely complex in delivery.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. VENTER: So we've had to develop a wide range of new techniques and technologies to be able to even manipulate entire chromosome of cells. DNA gets very brittle when it's larger pieces, and to try and keep an intact circular chromosome and have it be in the right supercoiled form, having the right ways to get it across the membrane, all of these things, nobody has known how to do before. So in theory, in a concept that should have worked in practice, there's lots and lots of things, as we try this with different cells, that could potentially block it from happening.  FLATOW: Is the endgame here to create a synthetic chromosome and put that into a cell?  Dr. VENTER: It's certainly one of the goals of our research. And these all emanated from, again, characterizing these first two genomes in history in 1995 and trying to understand what would be a minimal gene complement to have for self-replicating cellular life. For the last decade or so, we've been doing various types of gene knockout experiments, trying to find out which genes were essential and which were not. But you can only take out one gene at a time. There's no way to sequentially take out one, two, 200 genes. And so that's what that led us down to synthetic chromosome path in the first place, just trying to understand basic cellular function.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. VENTER: Out of every genome that's been sequenced - and my team has done now hundreds of them - at least 25 to 40 percent of the genes we discover in each chromosome, in each cell, are of complete unknown function. This is true even for the minimal cell. A hundred out of three to four hundred genes are of unknown function. So our actual knowledge of molecular biology and cell biology is still pretty primitive. We need these techniques to really understand these genes and what constitutes basic biochemistry of a cell.  FLATOW: Why is it not considered - when you do this that you're actually creating new life or creating life?  Dr. VENTER: Well, we're not creating life at all. I mean, we're taking a chromosome from a living species and putting that in another living species and it's converting that second species into the first one. So we're transforming life of that cell. These are all naturally occurring organisms that are widely studied in the lab and in the environment. And even, I think, it's a technical issue as to whether - even with a synthetic chromosome doing the same operation, we don't use that word creating life with it. We're using as a vessel existing cells with existing chromosomes.  What we're doing is creating a new chromosome for it out of chemical synthesized in the lab and booting up that chromosome with the cellular system. I think that's the key thing that we've shown in the Science paper is that it is now possible to take another chromosome and boot it up and have it really take over the cell. I think, ultimately, if you could take all the chemical components in a cell with the chromosome, mix them together in a nice soup and get living self-replicating cells out of it that might someday be viewed as creating life. I think we're developing new life forms out of existing life, as has been the history of biology from the beginning.  FLATOW: Mildred Cho, as an ethicist, how do you view this feat?  Dr. CHO: Well, I think it's a very important technological development. And I agree with Dr. Venter, and I think it's good that he's been very careful to say that what has been done here is not really creating artificial life, but to sort of mix and match different parts of existing naturally occurring species. And also, I think he's been very good to really talk about what we don't understand yet from this work and while it is a significant step forward in creating - being able to manipulate genomes and bacteria, we still don't really understand fully why it works or how it works, and what's happening to the host genome, for example. It seems not to be expressed eventually, but the mechanism of that is still not known.  FLATOW: Do you think the public is uneasy when they hear these kinds of advances?  Dr. CHO: Well, I think so. I think part of it has to do with perhaps the fact that scientists can very easily see what the wonderful applications that this work can lead to, but it's maybe not so obvious to the public generally. And when I look at the title, for example, of the article that was published, it's called, \"Genome Transplantation in Bacteria: Changing One Species to Another. \" And if you look at that as someone who doesn't really know much about microbial genomics, one might just ask the question, why would you want to change one species to another? I mean, what's wrong with the ones we have?  So I think one thing for the scientific community to consider is to really be clear about why they're doing what they're doing and acknowledging that they have the best of intentions, but being more specific about what those intentions are to allay some of the fears that the public might have.  FLATOW: You don't think they're proactive enough in it.  Dr. CHO: Well, I think it could be explained a little bit more clearly, yeah, and proactively what the purposes are and what the potential beneficial applications of this research might be.  FLATOW: Well, we're going to do very much of that. After we take a break, we're going to come back - take a break, come back, and talk with Mildred Cho and Craig Venter who's going to layout for us, hopefully Dr. Venter, what the purposes are? What are the potential benefits? I mentioned something before about bacteria making ecofuels for us, but bacteria - a little factory that can make all kinds of stuff, can't they? So we'll take a short break and come back and talk lot's more.  Our number, 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. If you'd like to talk with J. Craig Venter and Mildred Cho about this experiment, which they were able to transplant chromosomes and create one - change one bacteria into another. We'll talk about your bacterium experience if you have one. If you have some questions for us to answer, give us a call 1-800-989-8255. We'll be right back after this break.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking about some research conducted by Craig Venter and folks in his lab, a team that he led where he has taken an entire set of genes from one bacterium and transferred them into a related one. Essentially, transforming the second bacterium into the first.  Dr. Venter, what can you do now? What is - give us some of the things that Dr. Cho said that scientists need to explain to the public about why you do you do these sorts of things.  Dr. Venter: And I agree with Mildred completely. I think scientists particularly with public funding have a natural obligation to explain their work to the public. And sometimes when we do that too much, we get accused of doing it too much. So it's a delicate balance. But I think this work is exciting in a very basic science level in terms of trying to understand basic cellular physiology. And I think it also helps maybe to understand some key events in evolution.  For example, when we sequenced the color of genome, several scientists thought the color of genome would be indistinguishable basically from E. coli because it had some similar genes in it. When we sequenced it, we found it actually had two chromosomes, one that was, in fact, similar to E. coli and one that was dramatically different. So it's entirely possible what we have done in the lab and the Science paper. Actually, it happens occasionally in nature. You wouldn't see if it completely transformed the species. But when you get the stable chimeras where you have both chromosomes present, you get totally a new species that didn't exist before. Unfortunately, in the case of cholera, it's one that causes human disease. So maybe by understanding how these events took place, we can understand speciation and stuff a little bit better.  I think the other thing that it really does is enable the field of synthetic genomics. We've been trying for sometime, as I think many people know, to try and make a synthetic mycoplasma chromosome in the laboratory. And the big question has been, number one, can we do that and if we were able to chemically make this chromosome, what would we do with it? How do you boot up a chromosome to give a living entity out of it. And we've explored a number of approaches and ideas. Initially, we thought we would have to use a ghost cell, where the chromosomes were removed and try and add a new one in.  And I think it was Hannah Smith who came up with a notion why not just why not just leave the chromosome in and add the new one and use selectable markers to go in this new direction. The fact that we can now know that we can take naked DNA, a pure chromosome, we now know how to manipulate it and deal with it without it being destroyed and transplanted into these cells and that these mechanisms - and Mildred is right, we don't know exactly what happen in the cell. We have a couple of ideas - when cells divide, the chromosomes go in different directions. So maybe, even after the first division, one chromosome goes to one cell and the parent one goes another way.  Also, bacterial cells have unique defense mechanisms and I think this study shows why they would need to have those restriction enzymes - restriction systems were developed in evolution to protect cells from foreign DNA coming in. And you can see if a chromosome can enter your cell and take over your whole existence and your identity, you'd want to have mechanisms to protect against that.  The one cell we used didn't have a restriction enzyme in it. The chromosome we put in, we think, does have one and it's possible that that was expressed and shoot up the parent chromosome on entry. So these events took place in just such a small number of the cells, they're impossible to track right now as to the exact mechanism. But I think this is important to understand as we try this with other cellular systems. You have to overcome the restriction enzymes.  FLATOW: You've said that the earliest application of this work - the earliest applications are likely to be in creating designer fuels from bacterial metabolism? Why would that be the earliest application?  Dr. VENTER: Well, we think it's one of the most important applications. After myself and my colleagues finished sequencing the human genome, we started looking around to where we could apply our technology and know-how. And the biggest problem I think facing humanity is what we're doing to the environment; burning these billions of tons of fuel, where we end up with - on the order of, right now, three and a half billion tons of CO2 going into the atmosphere each year.  We can't keep doing that. And the estimates - that's going to go up to 12 billion tons as population growth changes and developing countries had more and more cars and industry. We're facing potential - the end of life ultimately as we know it on this planet, if we don't change things. Certainly even the predictions of flooding in the near future could be a disaster for major populations.  So I think coming up with alternatives to taking the carbon out of the ground, burning that and putting that in the atmosphere, is our most pressing issue. And I'm a believer that biology can play a key role in that, and that synthetic biology - maybe we can come up with chemical pathways to make fuels that don't currently exists. Our existing repertoire comes from altering properties of oil, we can actually make better designer renewable fuels using bacteria metabolism.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number.

And so, what you want to try to avoid in a patent is overly broad claims that actually claim something that you haven't actually invented yet or, something that might potentially block new inventions but that are not similar to what was actually done.  So for example, if you patent something that claims that you've made a new car because you've designed new wheels and an engine, what you don't want to do is have that patent be so broad that it excludes somebody else patenting or making something with very new kinds of wheels or a new kind of engines, like, you know, a fuel cell instead of a combustion engine. So the devil is really in the details of how those patents are framed.  FLATOW: Talking about synthetic life forms this hour at TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Dr. Venter, where do you go from here?  Dr. VENTER: Well, the, the next obvious step for us is to - once we have a completely chemically synthesized chromosome, to try these same type of experiments that we've just reported in Science with a synthetic chromosome. And I think based on these experiments we've done, there is no theoretical barriers to that at all. For example, if we made the microdius(ph) chromosome chemically, it would be indistinguishable from the naturally occurring one if we just took the genetic code and copied it.  So I think it's more of a technical issue and proof of a point that you could do this with a chemically synthesized piece of DNA. I think the challenge there is the largest piece of DNA that's been reported in the literatures on the order of 35,000 base pairs. And the smallest genome that we're working with is 560,000. So it's quite a substantial different scale to be working at in terms of DNA synthesis. Once that's done, combining the two, we think, would give us certainly a living entity with a completely synthetic chromosome as it's starter material.  And one of the things you can do when you're designing and making DNA chemically is we can watermark that in all kinds of interesting ways. So with the genetic code, we have four letters in it, but triplet sets of those, three letters code for the range of amino acids that we use, they'd give us ways to spell out all kinds of interesting things in the genome both for fun and for proof of principle.  FLATOW: And at that point, you would be - you would consider what you've created in that case, something living?  Dr. VENTER: Yes. If they \u2026  FLATOW: Something synthetically\u2026  Dr. VENTER: \u2026if it becomes like we've reported in Science, a self-replicating cell based on the synthetic chromosome as its starter material, yes, I think people would agree that it would be a, a living self-replicating entity.  FLATOW: Dr. Cho, how would that - what kind of reaction would that get?  Dr. CHO: Well, again, I think, it raises a lot of the same issues that we've already talked about in terms of- the safety and so forth. And - but also, as we get a greater understanding of how to manipulate species, and if we are able to indeed change one species into another, it does raise a lot of other issues even if they're not technically feasible right now.  But now would be a good time to talk about some of the issues like, for example, what are the implications for human life? What if you could change one species to another? Does that mean you can take a non-human species and make it human? And when does the species become human? What do you have to change about something to make it human? And then, does that entity have human rights and responsibilities, for example? And this is way off in the future if ever possible.  But I think this is one of the reasons why, if people get a little nervous about this kind of research, that they are kind of looking forward to the future and it would be good to have a more broad public discussion about that now rather than later.  FLATOW: Yeah. It's not too\u2026  Dr. VENTER: I think this is one of those cases where the ethicists are willing to go a whole lot further than the scientists. We think talking about transforming or improving humans through these techniques is I think that kind of speculation that they think does make and should make people nervous, and I don't know of any scientists that are actually advocating it.  And I think if we can solve with single-cell bacteria some of the world's, you know, problems with food and fuel and contaminated air, I think those are very worthwhile goals. And it's certainly not our goal to transform or synthesize new humans or to try and, you know, repeat evolution at a much larger scale.  FLATOW: All right. We've run out\u2026  Dr. VENTER: I'm sorry. Go ahead.  FLATOW: We've run out of time, Dr. Venter. But I think you made your point and made it very well.  I want to thank you for talking time to be with us. J. Craig Venter is founder and president of J. Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland, and Mildred Cho, associate director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics. Thank you for taking time to be with us. We're going to take a break. Come back and switch gears. Don't go away. We will be right back.  I'm Ira Flatow.

The world of a human gut is mysterious. I know this may - it's lunchtime now in California. And scientists think that the thousands of bacteria living in our intestines protect us from disease as well as keeping our body healthy. But how this microscopic ecosystem works is really unknown. To answer the question, our researchers decided to go to the source. Researchers at Stanford University thought that they should start right at the beginning by looking at instant poop. Here to tell us about the study, which was published in the July issue of the Public Library of Science Biology is Chana Palmer, who used to work for PhD thesis. She's now program director at the Canary Foundation, helping to bring scientists together for cancer research. Welcome to the program, Dr. Palmer. Dr. CHANA PALMER (Program Director, Canary Foundation): Yeah. FLATOW: Hi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Can you hear me? We're having trouble. Can she hear me? Chana Palmer, are you there? Hello? Dr. PALMER: Hello. FLATOW: Hi, there. Can you hear me, doctor. . . Dr. PALMER: Yes, I can. FLATOW: Ah, good. Thanks for taking time to be with us. How did you - tell us exactly what you're doing? What is this about the baby poop that is so interesting to you? Dr. PALMER: Well, it's our first window into the bacteria that live with us for our entire life. So we are born without bacteria and we develop, eventually, a population that outnumbers our human cells by a factor of 10. And we know very little about what these bacteria do, and we figured the first step was to figure out which ones are there. FLATOW: You mean each of us have our own unique flora and fauna in our guts so to speak? Dr. PALMER: Exactly, yeah. In fact, one of the messages of the story is how unique our different bacterial populations are or the ecosystems or communities that live within us. Each baby - we had 14 babies in the study. Each of them had a unique mixture of bacteria living within them. FLATOW: Well, and so how did you go about collecting these samples? Dr. PALMER: Well, we had a lot of help from their parents actually. We recruited 13 parents around the Stanford area, which was remarkably easy. And we asked them actually to collect the stool samples at home, to scoop them immediately out of the diaper using these little vials we provided that have little spoons in the lid. And they stored them temporarily in their home freezers. Then at periodic intervals, I would come over their house and collect them and bring them back to the lab. FLATOW: Oh my goodness. Dr. PALMER: Yes. FLATOW: They had no problem with storing these frozen poop samples in the. . . Dr. PALMER: Yeah. Well. . . FLATOW: Some are next to these frozen milk samples there. Dr. PALMER: Yeah, we had them do some breast milk for us as well. We also obtain vaginal swabs from the mom, which involves me meeting them at the doctor's office right afterwards and running home to the freezer. So it was a little bit logistically complicated but we managed to pull it off. FLATOW: Hmm. And for how long did you study? Did they have to collect these samples? Dr. PALMER: These babies were followed for an entire year. And they collected much more frequently at the beginning of the year and then less frequently throughout the year. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And did you find the difference in different kinds of, let's say, delivery? Were babies who were naturally delivered different than caesarian sections? Dr. PALMER: I don't think we have enough babies to answer that question really yet. We had - we did have five babies with C-sections and the remainder were naturally delivery. One interesting thing we did notice is that there were two babies that were delivered by planned C-sections, and these happened to be a pair of twins. The interesting story there was that those twins - since it's planned C-section, those were the only babies where the baby never actually encountered the mother's vaginal canal. And it so happens that those babies were the latest to actually acquire a substantial bacterial population in their guts. FLATOW: If they're born with sterile guts, so to speak, where do they get their seed population of bacteria? Dr. PALMER: Yeah, that's a very interesting question. And when - we can start to, you know, hinted answers to that based on the samples we had here. We found that they come from a variety of different sources. We found some babies where there would seem to be a lot of similarity between the baby's early samples and the mom's vaginal sample. And another baby is that would be similar to the milk or to actually, the mom's stool sample. FLATOW: Wow. Was it hard to find moms to participate in this study? Dr. PALMER: It was remarkably easy. I think, maybe, having it in the Stanford community helped. We had a number of physicians enroll in the study, and people who are interested in science. FLATOW: Well, you know, let me just put it gently. If you're involved with moms, you have to help swab out different parts of their bodies, you're going to get pretty, you're going to bond with them, aren't you after a while? Dr. PALMER: Yeah. I definitely consider all of the families to be friends of mine now. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. PALMER: I hope they feel the same way. FLATOW: Well, what about the father? Did you test fathers or the people who come in contact with the babies, changing diapers or whatever? Dr. PALMER: Yeah, we did end up deciding, near the end of the study, to ask the fathers to provide samples. Not so much because we thought they're still would be in direct contact, but we thought we could maybe try and look at whether there was fathers who are more similar to their own baby than other babies for example. And the fathers were very obliging as well. So we had wonderful volunteers for this study. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So did you determine if the micro-ecosystems of our gut are determined by genetics or by the environment, did they got this from the environment, you know? Dr. PALMER: Yeah, well, this study wasn't designed to specifically answer that. What I can say the study told us is that the process of colonization does seem to have rules that govern it. And it would be some combination of environment and genetics. And we can say that because we had one pair of twins in the study and they were by far the most similar pair of babies. It's hard at this point to tease apart how much of that was environment and how much of it was genetics. But previous study tell us - and there are mechanistic reasons I think there could be a genetic basis. But I think we'll have to some further family studies to really tease that apart. FLATOW: Though you had those paternal twins, right? Dr. PALMER: Mm-hmm. Yeah. FLATOW: And they. . . Dr. PALMER: Yeah. That was very fortunate for us. FLATOW: Yeah. Why do we care about the microscopic organisms in our intestines? Why is this something you want to study? Dr. PALMER: Well, for one thing, there are a number of diseases where we know that the microbes in our gut are contributing. And we imagine that as we better understand these communities, we'll be able to track down bacterial causes of more and more diseases. So we need to understand in the study we're trying to contribute to the what? A healthy bacterial mixture looks like and so that eventually, you can compare different disease states and see, you know, what's going wrong. FLATOW: We're talking about baby poop this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm talking with Dr. Chana Palmer, director of the Canary Foundation. Our number 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Devin(ph) in Salt Lake. Hi Devin. DEVIN (Caller): Hello. FLATOW: Hi there. DEVIN: Hi. I'm actually calling about the previous guest but this guest is, it's a direct relation at this one. My question deals with probiotics and how the relationship between microorganisms in our gut affects the regulation of body weight and also the immune system development. Dr. PALMER: Well, yeah, there are some very interesting studies of mice that are raised with no bacterial flora, and their immune systems do not develop properly so they're currently important in that capacity. I think we don't really know yet exactly how to manipulate those populations, and if you were to give a probiotic, how long it would actually, how long that bacteria would live in the gut. We saw in our study that they actually reorganize and change considerably at fairly regular intervals, so it maybe that they would persist for awhile but not even. . . FLATOW: Right. Dr. PALMER: . . . stick around. FLATOW: You know, when you take medication, take specifically antibiotics, the doctors say you watch out, you'll get a stomachache. These antibiotics may kill the bacteria in your gut. Did you see that with these babies? Dr. PALMER: Yes. In fact, we did have one very dramatic example of a baby that got, you know, typical antibiotics, Augmentin, and there are bacteria were entirely wiped out. That baby. . . FLATOW: Wow. Dr. PALMER: . . . you know, it rebounded fairly quickly and ended up looking, you know, not distinguished, distinguishably different from the rest of them by the end of the year. But we saw that at least in some cases that it can be very dramatic and, but not in every case, though. It's varied for baby to baby about how - what the effect of the antibiotics was. FLATOW: Do you see the possibility of finding out what the best mixture of bacteria in your gut might be when you, you know. Dr. PALMER: Yeah, I think there is - there's definitely a hope for that. We'll need to develop some new tools; of some new ways to measure what a good community is so that's very interesting. We don't know what should we strive for. FLATOW: How many different kinds are there? Dr. PALMER: Well, there - so far are been at least 400 species identified living in our guts not in an single individual, but. . . FLATOW: Right. Dr. PALMER: . . . we're definitely in the hundreds. FLATOW: Right. So you might, there might be some day where they'll take a stool sample and say, you know, you don't have enough of this kind. Because we know that to be a good bacteria, we'll just give you some of that? Dr. PALMER: I think it's conceivable that we could that. As I say, it's not for sure that we can make sure it would stick around, but perhaps if we know what combination of bacteria works well together, we can make it so that it'll stick. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. At what time, you know, at what point you actually start seeing the bacteria growing in the gut? Dr. PALMER: That varies from baby to baby but it was, as early as 24 hours and for the twins who I said were the latest, it wasn't until about seven days that we had a large population. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Is there anybody else collecting baby poop besides you guys? Dr. PALMER: Yes. There are other people collecting baby poop, but they just haven't used the same tool that we've been using. FLATOW: What tool is that? Dr. PALMER: It's a microarray-based tool, which uses DNA to identify the bacteria. FLATOW: And you could do a lot of them at once then? Dr. PALMER: Yeah. The great thing about this tool is that it allows you to look at a lot of samples and then that data that you gather is both - it gets a very detailed picture of the population. FLATOW: So how do you take your research further here now that you've gotten to start? What would you - how would you like to expand it? Dr. PALMER: Yeah. Well, I think one study that's already underway in the lab is a study of antibiotics' effects, of having healthy people voluntarily take courses on antibiotics and to see how their populations change before, during and after. That's an important one. Ones that we don't have explicitly planned but we'd like to do would be more twin studies to see the, you know, to understand the contribution of genetics and environment. FLATOW: But what about we adults? Does anybody know what's going on there? Dr. PALMER: Yeah. Adults have actually been studied more than babies in this respect. And we know that adults each have a unique population and that their bacterial mixtures are quite stable over long terms and maybe even, you know, over a year, you can see not - doesn't change that much usually. FLATOW: Mm-hmm, because we know that some people take bacteria pills to increase their - the bacteria in their stomachs and intestines. Dr. PALMER: Yes, so I'm not too familiar with the probiotics area and, you know, what effects you would have, were you to take bacteria. FLATOW: All right. Well, I'm not going to ask you to speak about something you don't know about. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: But we certainly learned a lot. This certainly has been very interesting today. Dr. PALMER: Thank you. FLATOW: Thank you for taking time to talk with us and good luck to you. Dr. PALMER: Thank you. You're very welcome.

I'm Ira Flatow. And we've sort of gotten into some interesting discussion in sort of a theme of basic research, implications of basic research this hour. And up next, I want to talk about another development in basic research that will have applications beyond just the basic research. And that is a new and better embryonic stem cell, and a pair of reports in this week's issue of the journal Nature. Two researchers announced the discovery of a new type of mouse embryonic stem cell. We're not talking about a human embryonic stem cell here. We're talking about a research tool, a new mouse embryonic stem cell. The researchers say it's important because it's a closer match to human cells than mouse embryonic stem cells available now, something of a missing link, if you will, between human cells and mouse cells. And that's important, they say, because it's a better tool for understanding human stem cells and how they might be used in medicine. So for the rest of the hour, we're going to check in on the field of stem cell research, talk about what this and other new research advances mean for the clinical use of these cells and for getting a better understanding of the basic biology of the cells that give rise to all other types of cells. So if you'd like to join in, our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. Ron McKay is the lead author of one of the Nature papers. He is a stem cell scientist at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at NIH in Bethesda. He joins us by phone. Welcome to the program, Dr. McKay. Dr. RON McKAY (Stem Cell Scientist, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke): Thank you. FLATOW: Let's talk about these new stem cells and what they are. They're embryonic stem cells and they're different than ones you've been using before. Dr. McKAY: They are. They are from the mouse, as you say, and the - probably, the most interesting way of, for people to think about this is that we want to know where we come from, where all the cell types of the body are generated. And there's a lot of interest in the type of cell that's called pluripotent, which means that it makes all the cells of the body. And up until now, there's really only two completely clear pluripotent cells, it's the mouse embryonic stem cell, discovered about 20 or 30 years ago, and then less than 10 years ago, scientists reported a human embryonic stem cell, which was - could also make all the cells of the body. And - but the two cells were different. The mouse cell and the human cell were really quite different. And what we and the group in Oxford - we collaborated with the group on Oxford - and independently, a group in Cambridge in the U. K. , what we're all reporting is that actually there's a new kind of mouse cell, which is very similar to the human cell. So now we begin to understand better that there's two different kinds of pluripotent state. FLATOW: When you say there's a new one, does that mean that's newly discovered? You just missed finding it or it's really a new cell? I can't imagine it's something new. Dr. McKAY: No, it's newly discovered. FLATOW: Newly discovered. Dr. McKAY: Yeah. And the reason - I mean, it's interesting to ask why did we miss it? FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. McKAY: And the answer is that this cell exists for a very short window of development, and that - and the way we found it was by taking the mouse embryo just to the point where its implants. And that's a very difficult stage to study for most people. But our collaborators were particularly gifted in early mouse embryology. So we isolated these cells. And once you get the hang of it, these cells are easy to grow. And that - but as I say they're different from the classic mouse cell, and they are similar in some crucial ways to the human cells that have been discussed so widely. FLATOW: Well, let's talk about what are the advantages. What crucial differences are there and why we like them so much? Dr. McKAY: So - I mean, one simple way of seeing why they're so interesting is because they're the sort of - they are the cell that most immediately turns into the cells that you might be sort of more, sort of, obviously interested in, like heart cells or brain cells. So these are - this cell type, this new cell type is a cell that immediately does that. Another reason why they're interesting is that the growth conditions, the mechanisms, which are controlling their growth, are different from the earlier mouse ESL state, and they're very similar to the growth conditions, which are controlling human cells, and actually they're quite similar in general to growth conditions, which are controlling stem cells. So these mechanisms of growth control, for example, have - may have a lot to teach us about the mechanisms of cancer. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Why are they being called the missing link? Dr. McKAY: Because they represent this, sort of, step between this earlier cell that was - you know why, I think, in a way, it's sort of like, partly, it's sort of, it just sort of sounds good. But partly\u2026 FLATOW: That helps sometimes. Dr. McKAY: Sorry? FLATOW: Yeah, that helps. Dr. McKAY: It helps a lot. Sure. But, I mean, but partly, it's also that it's sort of - it's making things clear, right? Because it links this sort of mysterious thing, this embryonic stem cell, to all the cells of the body. It sort of - and it's a sort of way of just simply, sort of in a simple way, representing the advance in our thinking. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Now, what do these new cells, the newly discovered cells, as you say, which would be more properly to described. Dr. McKAY: Yeah. FLATOW: What do they allow us to do specifically, and what things can we study now that we couldn't study before? Dr. McKAY: Well, let's go back to this missing link idea as a methapor. Let's say we're in New York City. And somebody simply tells you, you've got to walk to Santa Fe, right? If those are the only instructions that you get, you know, it's going to take quite a while for you to figure out, right? As it did for the early settlers of the North America to figure out how to get to Santa Fe. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. McKAY: But if they give you a set of instructions, right? They - like Lewis and Clark - they say first go to St. Louis, right? FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. McKAY: Then, actually, you're much, much more likely to get to Santa Fe. And so that's one of the reasons I think this cell type is of interest, because it's the cell - if you go from here right out across the continent of the body, you're right - you're next to it. You can go from here, let's say, let's keep this St. Louis metaphor working. You can go to Santa Fe. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. McKAY: You can go to Phoenix. So it's - you're really there. You almost at the Pacific Ocean. FLATOW: Will this discovery allow us to study diseases in our favorite animal, the laboratory mice? Dr. McKAY: Yes. FLATOW: That we had to study, you know, they're bigger more unwieldy animals? Dr. McKAY: Well, I think what it does is it, yes - it takes this - it makes the mouse model, much more relevant to the human ES cell. Because now, we can test out some of our ideas that will be important for the, sort of, clinical value of early development in a mouse cell which is easier to manipulate and better understood. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Because there are some diseases you have to study in sheep, some diseases you have to study in other animals. Dr. McKAY: Well, there's always going to be a reason, you know. So for example, I mean, if you're interested in cardiac disease\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. McKAY: \u2026you know, a mouse is not perhaps the ultimate model. But there's many basic features of heart development and heart disease that you could study in the mouse. And so, I think the key thing about this cell type is that it is a state, which is stable, and it's a pluripotent cell. So, for example, not only we can use it then as a practical way of going from this cell to more differentiated cells, but we can ask questions that are fundamentally interesting which is, what does it mean to be pluripotent. And a few days ago, many papers - several of them also in Nature - were talking about the idea that you could reprogram an adult cell to make that pluripotent. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So essentially, in the last two weeks, they're have been something of the order of seven or eight reports all dealing with the question of pluripotency. What does it mean to have all this potential to differentiate? FLATOW: Were these cells taken from a blastocyst that was allowed to develop a little further along? Is that where they were discovered? Does that make them a little more useful in this differentiation stage? Dr. McKAY: Yup. So one of our colleagues, a guy in Oxford called Richard Gardner who's very famous in this sort of academic world. He had previously done work which showed that you could isolate single cells from a slightly later stage in the blastocyst. So the blastocyst is a stage where the cells are going to give rise to the mouse, which is about a hundred in number. And a day later, the blastocyst has developed further and it has just started to attach to the wall of the uterus. And at this point, there's, perhaps, let's say there's several hundred cells. And two days later, there will be several thousand. So these cells are just about to go through an explosion of growth. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. McKAY: And the stage that we took, and Richard and his colleagues have previously focused on this earlier stage, the stage with a blastocyst is essentially - it's like a kind of spaceship, it's a ball and inside it there's a little cluster of cells attached to the surface, those cells will become the mouse. And then when that attaches to the side of the uterus, at that point, the embryo is going to differentiate and differentiate very fast. And so we went in just to that point and showed that we could grow these cells. FLATOW: What made you decide that? You're sitting around at the bar having a beer, and say, you know, we should wait another day. I mean, what I'm trying get into is how a scientist thinks about, you know, let's try this or instead of what they try. Dr. McKAY: Well, it's - I mean, it's a nice story I think. I mean - so one of the key people in this study is a guy called Paul Tesar, who is a student at Case. And now, he's doing a PhD between NIH and Oxford. And so he's the physical link between these labs across the Atlantic. And what we wanted to know is we wanted to know why are the human cells and the mouse cells different? And we thought we should go and look in the mouse to see if we can find a mouse cell that's pluripotent that's like the human cell. And so it took us little time, but that's what we're reporting. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. But what made you think to wait that extra time, what - you know? Dr. MCKAY: Because - because previously, to - Richard is very well known. He is one of the people who first manipulated early embryos. And sort of, this is a sort of founding technology for IVF, for example. And they had shown that the standard way of making an ES cell in the mouse seem to be limited, that you couldn't do it after a particular day, 4. 5. And we thought, well, if we go in and look just a day later, maybe if we're patient enough and do things somewhat differently, we could in fact, get cells out of that point. And that's why we looked then. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. MCKAY: And in fat, what was interesting was that Paul came back to Bethesda in the summer, and he was learning with us how to grow human cells. And when he went back to Oxford and put these cells into culture, he realized immediately that they were - they looked like human cells and that they weren't growing well under the standard mass conditions. And so he switched them to the human conditions, and then they grew. And so we spent the last three years characterizing them. FLATOW: Wow. That was a big point in\u2026 Dr. MCKAY: Yeah. It's a - it's interesting. I mean, it's a nice story, actually. FLATOW: Yeah. Well, we're talking - it is a nice story. We're talking with Dr. Ron McKay this hour at TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Let's talk a little politics here for a moment. How big an impact does the ban on - the continuing American federal funding ban have on research in your field and this field? Dr. MCKAY: Well, you know, I mean, this is a - obviously, these issues are sensitive. And they're sensitive in many countries, not just in the United States. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. MCKAY: And the sort of reports that you can reprogram a fibroblast, sort of, in some ways opened up the idea that pluripotency is a state that can be accessed in many different ways. But I mean, in our case at NIH, I mean, we can grow - with federal funds - a restricted number of lines, which actually we find very interesting. And thisis a way that we can contribute to the basic biology of stem cells. And you know, I mean, as time goes on, presumably, a lot of these issues will become less contentious, I would argue, if - because it's not, I don't think that there's sort of any, sort of overwhelmingly impossible task here. In my view, we will need to understand what pluripotency is. Because it looks like cells can move there relatively easily and it's likely to be an extremely important part of our understanding of cancer. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. MCKAY: So if we have a mouse model, which helps us, that's very, very good. But I spent most of the day today talking about human cells and human stem cells in the brain in particular. You know, it's it's all highly, sort of, technobabble, but it does move us forward. I mean - there's really only basically three reports of pluripotency, right? There's the original founding report in the mouse in 1980. In the 1990s, there were two or three preliminary reports, and then a report in 1998 of a human ES cell. And then in the last few days, there's our report and there's the report from groups in Boston and Japan that you can generate pluripotency in this completely unexpected way. I mean, that, sort of, gives you a sense of both this sort of novelty and excitement in the field, but also how - I mean, science moves forward by, you know, fairly, sort of, long-term plans. FLATOW: Yeah. Do you think that you might discover a different kind of stem cell in humans also if you waited a certain amount of time? Dr. MCKAY: Well, that's one interesting question. We think this is the human cell. That's to say we think it models it. But the human ES cell is not generated from post-implantation embryos, obviously. It's generated from embryos, which were made in the laboratory by IVF. So then an interesting question arises, well, why would the human cell kind of lock in to this state? Why doesn't it look like the earlier mouse cell? I think the answer to that actually is - to do with the way a lot of animals reproduce. For example, a pregnant elephant can be pregnant for months without anybody being able to find the embryo because they have a way of arresting the very early embryo, it's a phenomenon called diapause. And many, many animals have this. Mice have it. But humans don't. And so what we think at the moment is that the human cell doesn't - can't be arrested early, and so it reaches this slightly later step. And that's the step that we've now isolated in the mouse. FLATOW: Well\u2026 Dr. MCKAY: If that's - obviously, I mean, it seems\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. MCKAY: \u2026a bit difficult to grasp. But\u2026 FLATOW: Well, it's quite interesting. And I want to thank you for taking time to share it with us. Dr. MCKAY: Yeah. No problem at all. FLATOW: Good luck to you. Dr. Ron McKay, stem cell scientist at NIH, that's -at that institute he works at the neurological disorders and stroke at NIH in Bethesda.

Why doesn't it look like the earlier mouse cell? I think the answer to that actually is - to do with the way a lot of animals reproduce.  For example, a pregnant elephant can be pregnant for months without anybody being able to find the embryo because they have a way of arresting the very early embryo, it's a phenomenon called diapause. And many, many animals have this. Mice have it. But humans don't. And so what we think at the moment is that the human cell doesn't - can't be arrested early, and so it reaches this slightly later step. And that's the step that we've now isolated in the mouse.  FLATOW: Well\u2026  Dr. MCKAY: If that's - obviously, I mean, it seems\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. MCKAY: \u2026a bit difficult to grasp. But\u2026  FLATOW: Well, it's quite interesting. And I want to thank you for taking time to share it with us.  Dr. MCKAY: Yeah. No problem at all.  FLATOW: Good luck to you.

I'm Ira Flatow. When you picture a penguin - now, you see it's surrounded by snow and ice, right? Braving that brutal polar wind to shield a single egg until it hatches -I know you've seen the movie. But not all penguins were built for the cold. And this week, scientists are reporting that they have found at least two new species and possibly one - as many as five species that once lived in the warm desert of what is now Peru, millions of years earlier than once thought, and one of them was five feet tall. Joining me now to talk more about the new find is my guest, Julia Clarke, assistant professor in the Department of Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. She's also research curator of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and a research associate at the American Museum of Natural History here in New York. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Professor JULIA CLARKE (Department of Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences Assistant Professor, North Carolina State University): Oh, thank you for having me. FLATOW: Were you surprised yourself at this discovery? Prof. CLARKE: Oh, absolutely. You know, and just the age of these new discoveries and the giant size of our 36 million-year-old species. It's really quite striking. FLATOW: So set the scene for us. Before these find in Peru, what do we know or think we knew about where penguins have lived in the past? Prof. CLARKE: Well, there had been a consensus that penguins originated in the very southern high latitude region. And it only reached low latitude equatorial regions much less than 50 million years ago, perhaps as recently as four million years ago. FLATOW: So they went from the south to the equator? Prof. CLARKE: Yes, exactly. And we thought that although, you know, we know that the earliest fossil penguin is around 61 million years - that's only four million years after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs in high latitude New Zealand - we thought that they only made their way to these equatorial regions very, very recently. FLATOW: And this now upsets that card. Prof. CLARKE: Absolutely. And the question isn't simply, you know, just pushing it back a lot further in Earth's history. It's a very different - the Earth is a very different place when we now know that these species arrived at these equatorial regions. You know, we previously thought that only close relatives of living species of penguins - and living species reached these equatorial regions during a much cooler Earth, an Earth with ice caps and overall much, much cooler than it was when these new species lived about 36 and 42 million years ago. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So these species that you discovered are able - were able to live in a warmer climate? Prof. CLARKE: Absolutely. And what we find is that in fact is striking, with our new data and data published last year, is that penguins really flourished early in our history in these much warmer conditions. These are conditions where equatorial regions and polar regions were much closer in temperature. And we have, you know, the five evidence, you know, of five species in these new deposits from Peru, and then also a considerable diversity in the poles at that time. So they were doing quite well in this much earlier period in Earth's history. FLATOW: But some of them stayed down there to become the penguins of today? Prof. CLARKE: Well, we don't really know. We don't know where - it suggested that the living diversity of penguins may have also originated in high latitudes and subsequently moved to low latitude regions. We think that, you know, I think it's important to remember that what we have today in the way of penguins it's just essentially a tiny, little twiglet of the penguin family tree. And we think, you know, what we - what certainly the fossil record has taught us is that ecology has evolved and that living penguins very much may be, and appeared to be, cold-adapted species or more cold-adapted than what we think these early species might have been. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So we shouldn't be worry about global warming then because these penguins could adapt again to warmer species - to warmer climates? Prof. CLARKE: Oh, I hope no one gets that message, you know? What we're trying to say is that, you know - what's really striking is the different relationship with global climate change we see early in the penguin lineage. But, of course, you know, species and whole lineages change through times and there are some very important recent studies on global climate and living species of penguins. But our work doesn't weigh in on that. We're interested in, you know, as paleontologist, in what's going on over millions and millions of years and major changes over that time scale. And what's going on today is happening on a considerably different time scale. So we don't - we are no way implying that the living species that may be cold adapted won't be quite negatively impacted. FLATOW: Why would a species that you have fossils of existed in a nice, warm climate want to go south, to Antarctica, to live? Prof. CLARKE: Oh, you mean you sort of. . . FLATOW: Why would - yeah, why would they choose if they could be - if they could have stay where they were in a warmer climate? Why would they go to this nightmarish dark spot and freeze their little feet, so to speak, in wintertime? Prof. CLARKE: It's a very good question. You know, as you remarked in the beginning of the conversation that it appears to be an aberrant thing in penguins that being, you know, breathing on ice. These adaptations to extremely cold conditions may be a very recent and comparatively, you know, aberrant thing for penguins. As to why, we can only speculate. You know, I don't think our evidence doesn't support that penguins, en mass, you know, that the whole diversity moved to low latitudes and then moved back to high latitudes, but that basically, there was some kind of incentive -perhaps abundant food resources or something - that drove multiple invasions of low latitudes at least twice early in their history and then once more recently. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Now I know a lot of people want to know about these new species. Tell us about these five-foot penguins. I mean I've seen in the Antarctica the four-foot, you know, emperor penguins, but I've never seen a five-foot. Prof. CLARKE: Right. Well, this form - and this is Icadyptes. This is a new species that's 36 million years old. And we did an estimate based on, you know, proportions of its bones compared to the largest known fossil giant penguins, which are from high latitude regions. And it kind of came in about the third largest yet known globally. And so it's around, you know, 4 foot 11. And if you saw it on a Peruvian shoreline or on a dark street corner, you would recognize it as a penguin, you know, for its kind of a rigid, paddle-like wings and the stance. But it has this very striking skull, the first glimpse at the skull of a giant penguin, and it's quite narrow and it's really quite well built, you know? It's a strong, pointed, narrow beak. And, you know, at first glance, it really looks very spear-like. FLATOW: Yeah, looks like a weapon and the bones. Prof. CLARKE: Yeah. FLATOW: Yeah. Prof. CLARKE: You wouldn't want to meet it necessarily on that dark street corner. FLATOW: Right. Right. And the other species? Prof. CLARKE: And the other species is a size of the second largest living penguin. So that's the king penguin. And, again, you would recognize it probably as a penguin, but you might notice some distinctions in the wing structure. And you might also - you would also notice the beak being, again, more pointed, not as elongate as the giant penguin, but still quite distinct in shape from any living penguin today. FLATOW: Well, I want to thank you very much for taking time to describe these for us. It's fascinating. Prof. CLARKE: Oh, it's been a pleasure to speak with you. FLATOW: Thank you.

I'm Robert Siegel. Imagine a bird with a wingspan of 20 feet and feathers the length of Samurai swords; give it a razor-sharp beak, extremely powerful legs, and giant talons that kill live prey. The creature you are now envisioning is known to scientists as Argentavis magnificens. It lived in Argentina six million years ago. For decades, ornithologists disagreed about whether Argentavis was the largest bird that ever flew or a bird that used its wings to help it run faster. That debate now seemed settled with a new paper in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Here's NPR's John Nielsen. JOHN NIELSEN: Europeans once believed that giant bird-like creatures known as griffins killed people on sight. Arabs tell stories of birds so big that they could pick up elephants and carry them back to their nests. And some Native Americans thought massive creatures called thunderbirds shot lightning bolts out of their talons. Sankar Chatterjee, a paleontologist at Texas Tech University, says all of these stories come to mind whenever he touches the fossilized remains of Argentavis magnificens. Dr. SANKAR CHATTERJEE (Curator of Paleontology, Texas Tech University): Big bird, frightening, darkening the sky. And it's a stuff of nightmares, you know? It's almost like, you know, we like to think of a dragon. So this is one of the, you know, dangerous dragon. NIELSEN: The fossilized skull and bones of Chatterjee's real-life dragon were discovered in an Argentine Museum back in 1980. No signs of fire breathing were discovered at the time, Chatterjee jokes. But on the other hand, it seemed quite clear from the beginning that this bird was a killer. Chatterjee says the proof of that was at the pointy end of the skull. Dr. CHATTERJEE: It has this sort of highly hooked beak, almost like modern eagle. And so there is no doubt that it was a predatory bird. NIELSEN: How this predatory bird pursued the prey it ripped up with that beak has long been far from clear, however. This is true in part because the Argentavis may have weighed 160 pounds. Many ornithologists don't think it's physically possible for a bird that heavy to get off the ground. Adam Summers, an expert on biomechanics at the University of California at Irvine, says that's because the heaviest living flying birds weigh no more than 40 pounds. Professor ADAM SUMMERS (Ecology, University of California, Irvine): This bird weighs four times that and more, right? So could this have been a flyer is a really legitimate question in view of what a big jump it is between its body size and the next nearest steady state powered flyer. NIELSEN: Skeptics think it likely that this bird chased its prey down on foot, flapping its giant wings in ways that may have helped it run much faster. But Chatterjee and a group of colleagues put that theory to the test recently. First, they studied the fossils in ways that made it possible to estimate things like feather lengths, muscle power and turning radius. And they plug that data into software developed to test the airworthiness of helicopters. What they found was that these birds could soar, well, like giant eagles. Flapping those enormous wings would have been very, very hard, says Chatterjee. But when the birds stepped off a cliff into a rising column of warm wind called a thermal, they would have been on their way. Dr. CHATTERJEE: Certainly. In fact, maybe it will raise up to two miles high without any flapping the wings. NIELSEN: Like present-day condors, these big eagles moved around by gliding back and forth between the thermals, covering up to 200 miles in a single day. All the while, presumably, they had been looking down for animals worth eating. It's hard to imagine the scene that would have followed when the prey was found. Summers of UC Irvine says it helps to start by picturing a basic four-foot-by-eight-foot sheet of plywood. Prof. SUMMERS: This bird, coming out of the sky, was like three pieces of plywood laid long end to long end, swooping down on you; three sheets of plywood whipping through the air at realistically highway speeds as it was landing. NIELSEN: Chatterjee's calculations say the monster eagles were capable of diving at up to 150 miles per hour. Summers says the roar of the wind ripping through the five foot flight feathers on the bird's wings would probably have echoed for miles. He also suspects that when the diving eagle failed to hit its prey, it rammed it down while flapping those gigantic wings. John Nielsen, NPR News, Washington.

I'm Farai Chideya. In this week's health segment, we look at men and fertility. How does a guy find out whether or not he's got a healthy sperm count? It used to mean a trip down to the fertility clinic. There you got a small canister and one of those magazines and a little private time in a room. Now there's a new kid on the market that allows men to do their own tests at home. To find out more, we turn to our health expert, Dr. Ivan Walks. Dr. IVAN WALKS (Chief Medical Officer, Washington D. C. ): I think it's been difficult. It's not something that most men like to think about. There are a lot of those issues about being macho and being able to do whatever it is we want to do. But, it is a good question. A lot of the research shows that when couples are having issues with conception that the man is the problem and not necessarily the woman. CHIDEYA: That hasn't been explored deeply. It's usually assumed that the woman is the problem. Now with women, there are all sorts of reasons for infertility. But certainly with age, women go through menopause and if you are pre-menopausal or peri-menopausal, you may not have the same fertility as you used to. What are the issues with men? Dr. WALKS: Well, the issues with men tend to be quite, quite frankly that there are not enough sperm that are made, so that they can have a chance of getting all the way through the canal and getting to the act to fertilize it. And so it's sort of a numbers game literally. And if you're not producing enough or if your sperm don't have appropriate motility, meaning they can't actually swim strongly and get to where they need to go. Those tend to be the issues. CHIDEYA: Are there any health conditions that tend to be associated with these, you know, other health conditions that might contribute to it? Dr. WALKS: Well, there are certainly a lot of health conditions that contribute to men being able to perform sexually. And so you have that as the beginning of the issue. Can you, in fact, perform in the activity that's needed to have conception, maybe(ph) the product? And so if you have issues around diabetes, high blood pressure, those kinds of things can be an issue. And then unfortunately, the medications that you take if you have a chronic illness can sometimes make performance difficult, in particular, with men around hypertension. And then, with some of the mental health challenges in some of those medications, they can definitely have a problem so men cannot perform sexually. CHIDEYA: So there is a new do-it-yourself test. What are we talking about here? Do-it-yourself test brings up, for me, images of some bad movie where the guy goes into the clinic and, you know, goes and sits around with some very blush-worthy magazines. I'm assuming that do-it-yourself is the same thing but at home? Dr. WALKS: Well, it's one of the great things about having do-it-yourself at home is that you do avoid whatever sorts of public embarrassment there may be. And things have evolved over the years, so you, you know, privacy issues and those kinds of things have been addressed. But still, this is something that most men don't want to face and don't want to think about. And so being able to have at least an indicator in the privacy of your own home is a very positive step forward. CHIDEYA: The kit that is the one that we're referencing foretell - actually, has a component for men and a component for women. Do you think that's a smart marketing move or a smart medical move or both? Dr. WALKS: Well, I think - I would say both. I think that sort of the no-we're-in-this-together is certainly the way that we would want people to look at problems with conception or challenges with conception that it is two folks in there together. And so marketing it that way, I think, is positive. However from a medical standpoint, the thing that I think is most exciting about this is that it gives you a chance to frame your questions. First of all, if you're going to use the product, you're going to go to the Web site, read about it. Learn about it. You're going to educate yourself on some of the potential challenges. And then, you come home and whatever your results are, you can take those results then with you and you can say when you go in to your doctor, this is what we did. This is what we think. And it can help guide that conversation and help people be more informed when they go to the doctor, which is always a good idea. CHIDEYA: What would you say if - just playing devil's advocate - I say this is not a black person's thing, this is a white person's thing. You read about all these white career women who reached their genetic and biological wall and then they're all upset because they've spent their time working, but this is not a black people thing. Dr. WALKS: No, this is definitely a black people thing. And we have to not pigeonhole ourselves into one kind of attitude, one kind of experience, one kind of lifestyle. More and more women are having children later of all different ethnic backgrounds. And that includes African-American women. And I've actually delivered a baby to a woman who had her first child when she was over 40. And I delivered her second child, and this was many, many years ago, and she was not a Caucasian woman. So I think that there may be a myth that, you know, only white folks do this and only black folks do that, but that is not indeed the case. CHIDEYA: All right. Well, we'll certainly keep track of where this goes. But I want to switch gears in the time we have left. You, Dr. Walks, are going to be attending the NAACP's Annual Convention in Detroit. And one of the big issues on the table is America's health care system. You're going to be speaking at their health care forum. What do you want to get out there? Dr. WALKS: Especially in light of all of the talk about health care, I've had a chance to attend the recent presidential forum where the Democratic candidates spoke and almost everyone talks about health care and about the expense of our health care system and the importance of good health policy going forward. I want to make sure that as we're talking about health policies of the country, that we don't forget health disparities and how important it is to not rush to a simple or simple-sounding answer for a very complex situation. CHIDEYA: Now, there's a new documentary, Michael Moore, always controversial. His doc, \"Sicko,\" tackles the issue. He says countries like France, Great Britain, even Cuba have better health care systems than us, the richest country in the world. You studied health care systems around the world, and what do you think of that assessment? Dr. WALKS: Well, I actually have looked at some of the other systems and actually spent some time in England looking in depth at their system and talking some of the folks over there several years ago. And I think that different places do different things better. And if you look at some of the things that we do well here, when you look at the technological advances, the significant skill that we have in handling some of the tough things, that's one of the things that we do well here. The other thing that we do here that is a little bit different is we allow people to try as hard as they can to remain alive for as long as they can. And that may not be the case in some other places where some of the medications, some of the treatment modalities that are available to extend life here may not be as readily available or just flat, may not be approved in other places. So again, very simple-sounding answer - and I have actually seen Michael Moore's film and I think he makes a great effort in making his point. And he makes his point well. It's just not the only point that needs to be made. And clearly, it's a complex situation here and a lot of conversation needs to happen before we jump up and say, wow, that's the solution, let's do what they did over there. CHIDEYA: Listening to you, it sounds like you think - and please correct me if I'm wrong - that the U. S. has some great advance medical care but doesn't always deal with simple things well. Dr. WALKS: I think, that's a very good way of saying it, and I would not argue that. I think that health education is one of the simple things, not simple to do but very simple to understand the importance of. Preventive health is, again, very simple to understand the importance of and I think we could do those things a lot better. We do a great job of taking care of you when you're sick. If you get sick, you want to get sick in America because we're going to - you're going to go to any emergency room, and if you're really very ill, they have to treat you by law and then find out later on if you can pay. But if you want to stay healthy, we have a lot of challenge with making that a priority. And we need to do better and we can do better. CHIDEYA: So when you have 40 to 50 million people who are uninsured in this country, more who are underinsured, those are the people who might not be able to get well care or be able to think ahead about their health. Dr. WALKS: Well, and I think that you - we know, we talk about the 45 to 50 million people who are uninsured, there is probably another number, at least around 50 million or so, who are underinsured. And so you have a tremendous amount of opportunity for us to do better. People that don't have insurance or don't have appropriate insurance sometimes can't get - not only the kind of general, you know, let's check your blood pressure and do a physical exam and see if you're okay, but also dental care, and then just the availability of the things that we need to stay healthy. For example, many communities across the country don't have grocery stores. Fresh produce is not available. Many children don't have breakfast in the morning, so they can't learn well at school. All - again, a very complicated set of circumstances that all need to be addressed. CHIDEYA: Well, Dr. Ivan Walks, thank you so much. Dr. WALKS: Good to be with you. Thank you. CHIDEYA: Dr. Ivan Walks is chief executive officer of Ivan Walks and Associates and the former chief health officer of the District of Columbia. He joined us from our Washington, D. C. headquarters.  FARAI CHIDEYA, host:  This is NEWS & NOTES. I'm Farai Chideya.  In this week's health segment, we look at men and fertility. How does a guy find out whether or not he's got a healthy sperm count? It used to mean a trip down to the fertility clinic. There you got a small canister and one of those magazines and a little private time in a room.  Now there's a new kid on the market that allows men to do their own tests at home. To find out more, we turn to our health expert, Dr. Ivan Walks.  Dr. IVAN WALKS (Chief Medical Officer, Washington D. C. ): I think it's been difficult. It's not something that most men like to think about. There are a lot of those issues about being macho and being able to do whatever it is we want to do. But, it is a good question. A lot of the research shows that when couples are having issues with conception that the man is the problem and not necessarily the woman.  CHIDEYA: That hasn't been explored deeply. It's usually assumed that the woman is the problem. Now with women, there are all sorts of reasons for infertility. But certainly with age, women go through menopause and if you are pre-menopausal or peri-menopausal, you may not have the same fertility as you used to. What are the issues with men?  Dr. WALKS: Well, the issues with men tend to be quite, quite frankly that there are not enough sperm that are made, so that they can have a chance of getting all the way through the canal and getting to the act to fertilize it. And so it's sort of a numbers game literally.  And if you're not producing enough or if your sperm don't have appropriate motility, meaning they can't actually swim strongly and get to where they need to go. Those tend to be the issues.  CHIDEYA: Are there any health conditions that tend to be associated with these, you know, other health conditions that might contribute to it?  Dr. WALKS: Well, there are certainly a lot of health conditions that contribute to men being able to perform sexually. And so you have that as the beginning of the issue. Can you, in fact, perform in the activity that's needed to have conception, maybe(ph) the product?  And so if you have issues around diabetes, high blood pressure, those kinds of things can be an issue. And then unfortunately, the medications that you take if you have a chronic illness can sometimes make performance difficult, in particular, with men around hypertension. And then, with some of the mental health challenges in some of those medications, they can definitely have a problem so men cannot perform sexually.  CHIDEYA: So there is a new do-it-yourself test. What are we talking about here? Do-it-yourself test brings up, for me, images of some bad movie where the guy goes into the clinic and, you know, goes and sits around with some very blush-worthy magazines. I'm assuming that do-it-yourself is the same thing but at home?  Dr. WALKS: Well, it's one of the great things about having do-it-yourself at home is that you do avoid whatever sorts of public embarrassment there may be. And things have evolved over the years, so you, you know, privacy issues and those kinds of things have been addressed. But still, this is something that most men don't want to face and don't want to think about. And so being able to have at least an indicator in the privacy of your own home is a very positive step forward.  CHIDEYA: The kit that is the one that we're referencing foretell - actually, has a component for men and a component for women. Do you think that's a smart marketing move or a smart medical move or both?  Dr. WALKS: Well, I think - I would say both. I think that sort of the no-we're-in-this-together is certainly the way that we would want people to look at problems with conception or challenges with conception that it is two folks in there together. And so marketing it that way, I think, is positive.  However from a medical standpoint, the thing that I think is most exciting about this is that it gives you a chance to frame your questions. First of all, if you're going to use the product, you're going to go to the Web site, read about it. Learn about it. You're going to educate yourself on some of the potential challenges. And then, you come home and whatever your results are, you can take those results then with you and you can say when you go in to your doctor, this is what we did. This is what we think.

I'm Ira Flatow. Up next, they look at what ancient DNA might tell us about the effects of global warming. You know, Greenland is covered with glaciers, which due to global warming are melting at a very high rate. And to turn back the clock and better understand the Greenland of thousands of years ago, scientists working there have taken ice cores from the southern part of the island. Now, as you know ice cores are sort of a time capsule stretching into the past, because embedded in the layers of ice are samples of DNA, you have water, you have air, and all off taken together. They offer us a glimpse of what was the life like at that time, what was covering the land of Greenland thousands of years ago. And an analysis of the ice cores has led to some surprising discoveries about Greenland's past. Joining me now to talk about the samples taken in Greenland and what they might tell us about what's happening on our planet today is my guest, Eske Willerslev. He is professor in evolutionary biology at the University of Copenhagen. He is the director of the Center for Ancient Genetics there and he joins us from Denmark. Thanks for taking the time to be with us tonight. Dr. ESKE WILLERSLEV (Director, Center for Ancient Genetics): Yeah, thank you very much. FLATOW: What was surprising about this ice cores from Greenland? Dr. WILLERSEV:  Well, first of all, the surprising discovery was when we went down to what is called the silty ice, it means basically the dirty part of the ice, the very close to the bedrock, and we try to obtain DNA from there. We've found, you can say, evidence of any ancient forests on Greenland, the conifer forest consisting of pine and spruce and taxus and alnus as well as some insects like butterflies and beetles and spiders. So that was, by itself, quite surprising because you don't find that kind of biological community on Greenland today. FLATOW: How long ago was that? Dr. WILLERSEV: Yeah, that was the next surprise. I mean, because most models that are, you can say, modeling the ice cap history of Greenland suggests that the southern part of the Greenland ice sheet melted away during the Eemian period for about 125,000 years ago where the temperature on Greenland was about five degrees higher than today. But what our results suggested, I would say, is that that this ice had actually persisted there in southern Greenland for a longer period of time. So the forest community probably dates back to between 450,000 and 800,000 years A. D. And this is probably the vegetation for the last time that this area of Greenland was ice-free. And this, you could say, as some implications also on our understanding on what ice caps and glaciers actually contributed to the enormous sea level rise that you saw during the Eemian period. You had a sea level rise of between, I think, three and five meters. And many people, I believe, that the southern part of the Greenland ice sheet actually contributed massively. So it completely disappeared during this period of time. But because we found this very old ice, it could suggest that, although the southern part of the Greenland ice, it contributed for sure, it might not have contributed as much to the sea level rise as people previously would thought. FLATOW: Hmm. How much\u2026 Dr. WILLERSEV: However, with the emphasis, though, that this doesn't mean - you can say that in the future when we get temperature when we get temperature increasement that we will not see as sea level rise, it's just that we have to go back and find other sources for these, you can say, for the sea level rise than just the sort of Greenland ice cap. FLATOW: Hmm. Couple of surprising results then. Dr. WILLERSEV: Yup. FLATOW: Yeah. I mean, to think that there was this forest and all that, all that wildlife there. Dr. WILLERSEV: Yeah. FLATOW: Consider what we see today. Dr. WILLERSEV: Yeah, exactly. I mean, today, this area here's covered by two kilometers of ice. And the only very interesting thing about, I think the analysis was that it's actually quite surprisingly, you know, it's 10 percent of Earth's terrestrial surface today is covered with ice caps and glaciers. And we have only very limited knowledge, you know, about what was the environment like in these areas prior to the last ice formation, and that because you can't really get access to fossils and all information because it's covered by these kilometer of thick ice. But - by the way, if you show that these ice cores that people drill in order to do climate analysis, climate studies, those can actually be used as well for reconstructing the environment. So we could see that this forest community, for example, because it contains DNA from taxus, it probably did not have temperatures in the wintertime that was colder than minus 17. And because you have spruce and pine, it probably didn't have temperatures in the summertime that was lower than about 10 degrees Celsius. So it also gives you some information about, you can say both the biology and the climate in the past. FLATOW: Well, Dr. Willerslev, I want thank you for taking time to be with us. Good luck to you.

I'm Ira Flatow. No one has ever laid eyes on the bottom of the Arctic Ocean - is how the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution begins to describe the reason that for the first time in history, robotic explorers will be sent deep below the Arctic ice. The underwater vehicles will be on the hunt for hydrothermal vents, think of them as sort of underwater geysers, super hot water spewing out of cracks in the ocean floor. And at those vents, we usually find strange life forms that survive in this hotter than boiling water, in conditions that seem too harsh to support life, no sunlight, you got a chemical brew that could kill less hearty creatures. Scientists think the organisms living at these vents may hold clues to what life might have been like on the early Earth in similar inhospitable conditions. Onboard the Swedish icebreaker, Oden, in the eastern Arctic Ocean, members of the research team - the chief scientist and the lead biologist - join us by satellite phone to talk about the challenges of getting under the ice, what they're finding so far in their search for hydrothermal vents, and about the robots themselves - they're really unique, built by the Oceanographic Institution. We'll talk about it. And if you'd like to join us, the number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. Let me introduce my guests. Rob Reves-Sohn is the chief scientist for the Arctic Seafloor Expedition 2007 and an associate scientist in the geology and geophysics department at Woods Hole. And he joins us today from the research of Oden in the Arctic Ocean. Welcome to the program. Dr. ROB REVES-SOHN (Chief Scientist, Arctic Seafloor Expedition 2007; Associate scientist, Geology and Geophysics Department, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution): Thank you very much. FLATOW: Thank you for being with us. Tim Shank is the lead biologist for the Arctic Seafloor Expedition, and he is an associate scientist at the biology department at Woods Hole. He is also talking to us from the Oden. Welcome to the program, Dr. Shank. Dr. TIM SHANK (Lead biologist, Arctic Seafloor Expedition 2007; Associate scientist, Biology Department, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution): Thank you. It's good to be here. FLATOW: You're welcome. And joining us from Woods Hole is Jeffrey Seewald. He's an associate scientist in the department of marine chemistry and geochemistry at Woods Hole. Welcome to the program, Dr. Seewald. Dr. JEFFREY SEEWALD: (Associate scientist, Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry Department, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution): Good afternoon. FLATOW: Dr. Reves-Sohn, how is it going in your search for these hydrothermal vents? Dr. REVES-SOHN: Well, we're really just getting started. We've been on our station here at 85 degrees north for about two days, and we started our search by - we raised and lowered the sensors on a long wire down to the bottom of the seafloor and back up again, and we're looking for signals in the water column of the sort of cloudy and hot water that's discharged by those vents. So far, we've (unintelligible) made about nine casts, and we found evidence for hydrothermal plume on two of those nine casts. FLATOW: And then is the plan to send down these robotic devices to explore them? Dr. REVES-SOHN: That's correct. Once we feel like we have a reasonable idea where the vent fields might be on the seafloor, we deploy the robots and let them do the rest of the hard work for us. FLATOW: Give us an idea of what it looks like in the surrounding area. If we were to be on your ship, what would be looking at? Dr. REVES-SOHN: Well, it's white, very white. We're in the middle of the Arctic icepack, and there is very little open water here, the average is probably 95 percent or more. And the Oden is able to break its way through this ice, and we have maps with us that were made by an earlier expedition, the AMORE Expedition in 2001, and we used those maps to guide our surveys, but pretty much, it's white ice as far as you can see, and a gray sky. FLATOW: Dr. Seewald, you've got a study planned for the mid-Atlantic Ridge. It goes down the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. How similar is that to the Gakkel Ridge where you are now? Dr. SEEWALD: Well, the mid-Atlantic Ridge is a slightly faster-spreading oceanic ridge, and the Gakkel Ridge, on the other hand, represents an end member of extremely slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges. And so, the interest in this environment is that the processes may be slightly different and may constrain a further end member on what we might see. There are similarities in that the composition of the crust in the two environments are very similar, but the style of circulation may be quite different. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Tim Shank, if there are hydrothermal vents in many other places on the planet, why go to all the trouble to find them under the Arctic Ocean? What's significant, biologically speaking, about this Gakkel Ridge there? Dr. SHANK: Well, 58 million years ago, when seafloor spreading started in the Arctic, the basin was largely isolated. And so, whatever animals may have (unintelligible) in these early times of hydrothermal venting in the Arctic that may have evolved in isolation. So as an evolutionary biologist, I really want to know what isolation means to the evolution of species. We've gone around the world finding over 600 species in the last 30 years, and we've seen tie-ins into their distribution. So like you might find marsupials in Australia or something else in Mongolia, you find the same thing in hydrothermal vents. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge fauna that live there (audio gap) on what see off Mexico, for example. So they could be completely different here, up in the Arctic, and that's what we actually expect. FLATOW: What's different about, Dr. Reves-Sohn, what's different about working in this icy condition? Is it much more dangerous? Is that the reason why you're using these robotics instead of the human submersibles? Dr. REVES-SOHN: That's absolutely right. In the open ocean, we would send either a man submersible or what we call a remotely operated vehicle, which is a very expensive piece of equipment on a wire, down to the bottom of the seafloor to do the exploration. But because we have almost complete ice coverage up here, it's not safe to send human beings under the ice, at least in our estimation, and it's too risky to send a $10 or $20 million (audio gap) under the ice because the ice is constantly moving and shifting, and there's a significant chance that you could snap the wire that the vehicle is on. And that is why we've designed these robots because they're able to dive through the ice and flip (audio gap) and with no connection back to the ship, which (audio gap) something on the order of half a million dollars each, which is not cheap, but much cheaper than a remotely operated vehicle. So the eventuality that we very much hope (audio gap) is not the end of the world. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So these basically swim out on their own. They have - there's no tether on them and then they find their way back. Dr. REVES-SOHN: Yeah, you were dropping out a bit. You asked if they can find their way back to the ship? FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. REVES-SOHN: So we use some acoustic systems in the same way that, you know, you have a computer modem, and some of us are still on that situation where we have to have a dial-up modem in our house. In that same way, the robots have a modem, and it communicates to the ship, the acoustic signals, and we're able to open up a little hole in the ice with the icebreaker, and then we use the modem to tell the robot where that hole is so that it can safely return to the vessel. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Jeff Seewald, once they find a hydrothermal vent, it looks like they've got a couple of possibilities, how do you study them? Do you catch the water coming out, and scoop it up and sample it and bring it back? Dr. SEEWALD: In an ideal situation, that would happen, but the technology doesn't exist to actually do that right now. But what they will be doing is collecting samples of the biology, samples of rocks and samples of vent fluids that have mixed with seawater in the water column. And those types of samples can give an enormous amount of information as to what's happening in the subsurface beneath the ridge crest. And so, there's a lot of information to be had in terms of the composition of the fluids and the style of circulation from collecting these samples. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. I'll ask anybody who might want to answer this. We keep hearing more and more now that, given the summertime in the Arctic Ocean, that the ocean, due to global warming, is becoming more and more ice-free. Would that make it easier for scientists in the future to, you know, to send robotics down there? Dr. REVES-SOHN: It would. If it - it's hard, right now, we're in the middle of the ice pack. And there's ice everywhere as far as we can see. So any effect like that certainly hasn't reached to 85 degrees north. But in principle, sure, if the ice were to melt away, that would make our lives easier. If I could just go one step further, a lot of us, our job would be easier if we could drain the ocean. So, I think there's a lot of things we wish could happen. But who knows what will happen? FLATOW: Well, that would be a one-time job, if you were draining the ocean, I'd say. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: How long is the research going to be there? How long is this study going to take? Dr. SHANKS: Well, we've been out for about a week now. We've had a total of 40 days with the icebreaker Oden. And we hope to cover this site we're sitting over right now, as well as another site. That's about a six-day or seven-day staying from here. The error we can't predict very well over this ice. It's easy to get locked up in the ice and not to break free. It can take twice as long as that. But what's interesting is on the site that we're sitting over is actually one that's what we call them peridotite. It's actually mantle rock that's exposed to the seawater. It may not exactly have the volcanism we think of the other places that are associated with hydrothermal vents, but what we do find is a different kind of chemistry that comes from that mantle rock exposed to seawater. And when we have that different chemistry, we get different animals. And that's another reason why we've stooped here at this location on our way further up the Gakkel Ridge later on in the cruise. FLATOW: So you really don't know what you're going to see when you see something? Dr. REVES-SOHN: That's true. We have no idea what we're going to find. FLATOW: That makes it even more exciting, doesn't that? Dr. REVES-SOHN: Exciting and stressful, yes. FLATOW: All right. Well, we'll let you go. And we've taken up enough time from your work. So I want to thank you for - gentlemen. And wish you all the best of luck. And hopefully, you'll come back, and we will find out later on what your results are. So, good luck to you, and we'll check in with you later. Thank you, very much. Dr. SHANKS: Thank you. Dr. REVES-SOHN: Okay. Thank you. FLATOW: You're welcome. Rob Reves-Sohn is chief scientist for the Arctic Seafloor Expedition 2007, associate scientist in the geology and geophysics department at Woods Hole, at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Tim Shanks is the lead biologist for the Arctic Seafloor Expedition and associate scientist in the biology department at Woods Hole at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Dr. Seewald, we're going to have you stay with us. Dr. SEEWALD: Sure. FLATOW: So, if you'll hang on, we have to go to a break. And we'll come back and talk lots more about the Arctic. We're going to switch gears a little bit, and talk about other stuff. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this break. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute's Arctic Seafloor Expedition. We were just talking with scientists aboard a research ship that's sort of in the ice out there in the Arctic regions trying to - we've sort of lost, we were losing satellite communications with them. We're trying to get them back now. But we still have on with us Jeffrey Seewald, who's associate scientist of the department of marine - chemistry and geochemistry at Woods Hole. Our number, 1800-989-8255. Dr. Seewald, do you wish you were out there with them? Dr. SEEWALD: I do. It sounds like a very exciting time. It's always a great experience when you can get that sort of technology together with the scientific objectives to actually try and study these systems. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And what was interesting is that we were getting into this a little bit with the scientists on board the ship, talking about, geologically speaking, they found that site to be very interesting. Why is that? Dr. SEEWALD: Well, this is a region of the mid-ocean ridge system where oceanic spreading is occurring very, very slowly. And so the mid-ocean ridge is basically a 40,000-mile-long mountain chain where new crust is created in what is geologically very rapid time. But the initial idea was that in very slow spreading ridges, there wouldn't be sufficient heat to generate hydrothermal systems. And this has actually turned out to be very wrong. And the earlier cruises to this region showed a very high abundance of hydrothermal plumes, which is indicative that there is actually a lot of activity in this particular environment. FLATOW: And these are places, describe if you would for us geologically, where the ocean is actually spreading out and new ocean is coming up out of from underneath? Dr. SEEWALD: Well, in extremely slow spreading centers, the formation of crust can occur by exhumation of pieces of the mantle, basically. And these are what, I think, Rob referred to as - or actually, it was Tim referred to as peridotites. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. SEEWALD: And these have a very unique composition, or not unique, but very different composition to other areas of the ocean crust where spreading is faster. And so, in faster spreading areas, the rock composition is what we call a basalt, which is very different and produces - when you react seawater with these rocks, produces a fluid of very different composition. FLATOW: So it's interesting to go to theses different places and find different circumstances? Dr. SEEWALD: Yes. And the big issue here is, or one of the big issues, is the different chemistry that results when you take cold alkaline seawater that contains oxygen and you react it with rocks in these environments at very high temperatures, and the chemistry changes completely. It becomes a very acidic fluid. It becomes - the oxygen is consumed. There's a lot of hydrogen sulfite. And all these - the change in chemistry is what supports the microbial and biological communities that live in these environments. So a change in chemistry can have an enormous impact on the biology that inhabits these areas. FLATOW: And how different from - let me put it this way, how far around the nation do you have to go to find different places that have these different kinds of chemistries? Dr. SEEWALD: Well, in the Pacific, for example, the spreading rate, the southeast Pacific, the spreading rate is significantly faster. The mid-Atlantic ridge is slow, what's considered to be a slow-spreading center, it's a little bit faster than the Gakkel Ridge. The mid-ocean ridge system basically is, you know, 40,000 miles long, this mountain chain. And so, it's basically in - everywhere in the ocean's basins where a new crust is being formed. So there are common features of the ocean basins. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Now, we know the National Science Foundation, the NSF, supports most ocean and polar research. But why was NASA - NASA, the space agency -interested in supporting this project? Dr. SEEWALD: Well, NASA has an interest in looking for the possibility of life on other planetary bodies, and Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter being one environment. And so Europa is a moon that is covered with ice and may have the ideas that there maybe hydrothermal activity beneath the ice in this environment. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. SEEWALD: So, NASA, the - an obvious thing to do is to see if we can perhaps find hydrothermal vents and sample them beneath the ice on Earth, which would be considerably easier as a first step than trying to do that on Europa. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. There are two robots, one is called Puma and one is called Jaguar. That - were designed by Woods Hole itself? Dr. SEEWALD: It is my understanding that Hanu Singh designed those vehicles, although I'm not absolutely sure about that. But it is - I think they were designed at Woods Hole. FLATOW: Because you don't think of Woods Hole as being in the robot business. You'd think of them as being in the undersea exploration business. Dr. SEEWALD: Well, we have actually a large engineering department here that actually has a long history of building autonomous vehicles and robotic vehicles for undersea research. So there is the - Jason is a well known vehicle\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. SEEWALD: \u2026which is a little different than these autonomous vehicles. There's been others, ABE was one of the first types of these robotic autonomous untethered vehicles. FLATOW: How long in the planning is something like this? And the reason I ask it is because we've talked about global warming and the ice-free oceans. And we're hearing from the ship there that they're almost locked in the ice. It's ice all around the place. If they had known - if we had known that there, you know, there were going to be, if you wait a little longer in the season that the ocean might be a little bit more opened up because of global warming, and we haven't known this except for the last few years, might you have waited a little later in the season to do this? Dr. SEEWALD: That certainly would make this project much easier. Sampling without the ice is something - we have a long history of sampling vents using the submersible Alvin and tethered vehicles. A lot of this project is - there's been a significant amount of technology developed with the autonomous vehicles. So I think it's still, from an engineering perspective, it's still quite challenging. But certainly, the - a lack of ice would make conducting this research much simpler. FLATOW: Let's go to the phones. Bob(ph) in Jackson. Hi, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. BOB (Caller): Well, thank you, Ira. My question, very briefly. An old high school friend, who's a doctor in Florida, was responsible for some marine life so deep that they didn't have eyesight and they didn't have oxygen. They used those plumes, and they were actually a different form of life on Earth because they took in that sulfur from the plumes. And I'm wondering does that have any connection with what some of these findings are up in the Arctic? Dr. SEEWALD: Yes. Those are exactly the types of organisms that Tim Shank is interested and other biologists are interested in studying. BOB: Oh, really? Oh, cool. Dr. SEEWALD: Yeah. When you - when you're - the reason that this life has no, didn't have any eyes was because, in the bottom of the ocean, there's no light, so there's really nothing to see. But what's drawn a lot of interest in these hydrothermal vent systems is the fact that these biological communities are living off of the chemical energy that is created when you react seawater with the ocean crust. And these communities are living completely in the absence of photosynthetic activity. And so, it's referred to as chemosynthesis, where they garner all their energy from the chemicals that are venting at these locations. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And there's some theory\u2026 BOB: A follow-up question, if I may? FLATOW: Go ahead. BOB: Does that mean that on other planets, without oxygen, there could be life? Dr. SEEWALD: Yes. That - and that gets back to this question of NASA's interest. If the idea that life can exist on Earth in the absence of oxygen and living off hydrothermal vent chemistry suggests that if similar systems exist on other planetary bodies, that there may be the possibility of life elsewhere. FLATOW: Thanks for calling, Bob. BOB: Thank you, Professor. FLATOW: Good question. And that's also the basis of thinking that, perhaps, life - that's where life stared on this planet; with the absence of light and\u2026 Dr. SEEWALD: Yeah. FLATOW: \u2026harsh environments that were here in the early planet. Dr. SEEWALD: Absolutely. You described these vent environments as being somewhat extreme earlier on in the show. But actually, for the microbes living there, it's quite comfortable. They have a constant supply of food. If they - on an early Earth, they would have been shielded from meteorite impacts, ultraviolet radiation. So it was a very nice environment in which life may have originated on an early Earth. FLATOW: Let's go back to the phones. Let's go - it's Ike(ph) in Philadelphia. Hi.  Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Huh? Try it again. Hi, are you there? IKE (Caller): Yes. Hello. FLATOW: Hi. Go ahead. IKE: Hey. I'm trying to picture your scenario. You're on an icebreaker, basically, you're on a sheet of ice. How thick is that ice before we actually contact water so that you can send your probes down, for one? And two, are we looking for medicinal value in searching so far below the surface of the Earth? Dr. SEEWALD: Yeah. I'm not actually on the ship. But my guess is the ice is several feet thick. And I think they - what they do is they - the icebreaker actually drives itself up on top of the ice and actually cracks the ice and creates an area behind the ship that is free of ice. So there's a trail, and that's where they put the instruments over the side. And there has been - I'm not a biologist, but there has been, I think there is interest in the potential medicinal value of some of the organisms living on the seafloor, although I'm not particularly familiar with that aspect. FLATOW: First you have to know what's down there, right? That's what's part of the expedition is all about. Dr. SEEWALD: Right. That's right. FLATOW: And it's surprising, I guess it's not surprising considering that the ice covers the water so much of the time, it used to be all the time that we've never explored this part of the ocean. Dr. SEEWALD: Yeah. FLATOW: But, it's also interesting that they're - we're now choosing, at this point in time, to explore it. Dr. SEEWALD: Yeah. Getting back to this origin of life issue. One of the very interesting aspects of the Gakkel Ridge is that it is composed - there's a large amount of this rock type called peridotite. And that particular rock type creates these extremely reducing or hydrogen-rich environments when it reacts with seawater. In addition, it contains minerals that are thought to be very catalytically active, so there's a lot of interest in this environment because of the potential to abiotically form organic compounds that would be necessary as precursors to life. , simple molecules that could be organized into simple primitive organisms. FLATOW: Do you have any idea how many other spots on Earth that are unexplored like this one? Dr. SEEWALD: Well, we've, I don't know the exact numbers, but we've explored a very small region of the Earth's mid-ocean ridge system. So there are lots of regions that we don't really know about. And what's exciting about doing this kind of research is that every time we go to a new area, we always find something new that we - was unexpected and, scientifically, quite interesting. FLATOW: Talking about deep explorations this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Talking with Jeff Seewald of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Can people - can we follow this on the Web anyhow, you know, students, public? Dr. SEEWALD: Yes. There are two Web sites that I am aware of. There's the Dive And Discover Web site. If you go to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Web site, which is www. whoi. edu, and then there's another Web site that you can link to from there called Polar Discovery, which I think is having a day-to-day log of the - what's going on on the ship. FLATOW: So you can keep track of it. And it's just very early on in their exploration period. We heard from - onboard the boat that they think they just had a signal from a couple of spots. Dr. SEEWALD: Yeah. This process of finding vents on the seafloor when you're doing it on open ocean is fairly time consuming. And it's not unusual to spend a week looking for vents on the seafloor before you or even - and longer. Doing this in the ice, where everything is happening, I imagine much slower than it would be in the open ocean. So it could be quite a while before they actually find something. FLATOW: 1-0800 - I think we have time for one more call, 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Philadelphia. Hi, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Unidentified Man: Hi. I was wondering if perhaps he's able tell us what the chemistry of the peridotites are and if it's similar to the other ones that are all around the world? Dr. SEEWALD: I'm not familiar with the particular chemistry of the peridotites on the Gakkel Ridge. I'm actually a water chemist. But the lack of silica in a peridotite in general, compared to a basaltic rock, which has a higher silica content, and a very high iron content that is present in peridotites allows them to create this very reducing environment when it reacts with seawater. Significantly, more reducing than you might find. FLATOW: Reducing, meaning what? Dr. SEEWALD: Reducing meaning high hydrogen, very low oxygen concentrations, and very high hydrogen concentrations, which - hydrogen is sort of a key ingredient for both maintaining life in these systems. And if abiotic or synthesis of organic compounds in the absence of life is going on, you need rather high hydrogen concentrations. FLATOW: What would be the maximum outcome of this? What's the best you could expect from a mission like this one? Dr. SEEWALD: Well, the best outcome would be that they find vents everywhere they go, and they don't lose any of their vehicles. And the - from a biological perspective, I think there's a lot to be learned in terms of the biogeography of different species. So there's a possibility that there are organisms living in this environment that are totally unique because there's been no communication due to the restriction of water flow in this rather restricted basin. So it's an opportunity to look at evolution in an environment that may be totally independent from the rest of the world's oceans. FLATOW: Because it is so isolated up there. Dr. SEEWALD: Yeah. FLATOW: Yeah. All right. I want to thank you for your taking time to be with us. Dr. SEEWALD: Great to be here. FLATOW: And good luck to you. Dr. SEEWALD: Thank you. FLATOW: Jeffrey Seewald, associate scientist in the department of marine chemistry and geochemistry at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Also, I want to thank the folks at Woods Hole, who were on the exploration ship for the satellite time they were able to give us today. We're going to take a short break. And when we come back, we're going to just change gears a little bit. We're going to stay in the Arctic Region. But we're going to onshore to - there's another Arctic mystery. These guys are down there looking for these hydrothermal vents. Well, there's a sort of a global-warming-related Arctic mystery that's happening on land about the disappearance of some pools of water, some ponds that have been around for countless years, thousands of years, they're suddenly gone. And one scientist has published a research about this and is wondering why and how, and possibly, signs of global warming. He'll be back to talk with us after the short break. Hope you'll stay with us. We'll be right back.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  No one has ever laid eyes on the bottom of the Arctic Ocean - is how the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution begins to describe the reason that for the first time in history, robotic explorers will be sent deep below the Arctic ice. The underwater vehicles will be on the hunt for hydrothermal vents, think of them as sort of underwater geysers, super hot water spewing out of cracks in the ocean floor. And at those vents, we usually find strange life forms that survive in this hotter than boiling water, in conditions that seem too harsh to support life, no sunlight, you got a chemical brew that could kill less hearty creatures. Scientists think the organisms living at these vents may hold clues to what life might have been like on the early Earth in similar inhospitable conditions.  Onboard the Swedish icebreaker, Oden, in the eastern Arctic Ocean, members of the research team - the chief scientist and the lead biologist - join us by satellite phone to talk about the challenges of getting under the ice, what they're finding so far in their search for hydrothermal vents, and about the robots themselves - they're really unique, built by the Oceanographic Institution. We'll talk about it.  And if you'd like to join us, the number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK.  Let me introduce my guests. Rob Reves-Sohn is the chief scientist for the Arctic Seafloor Expedition 2007 and an associate scientist in the geology and geophysics department at Woods Hole. And he joins us today from the research of Oden in the Arctic Ocean. Welcome to the program.  Dr. ROB REVES-SOHN (Chief Scientist, Arctic Seafloor Expedition 2007; Associate scientist, Geology and Geophysics Department, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution): Thank you very much.  FLATOW: Thank you for being with us. Tim Shank is the lead biologist for the Arctic Seafloor Expedition, and he is an associate scientist at the biology department at Woods Hole. He is also talking to us from the Oden. Welcome to the program, Dr. Shank.  Dr. TIM SHANK (Lead biologist, Arctic Seafloor Expedition 2007; Associate scientist, Biology Department, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution): Thank you. It's good to be here.  FLATOW: You're welcome. And joining us from Woods Hole is Jeffrey Seewald. He's an associate scientist in the department of marine chemistry and geochemistry at Woods Hole. Welcome to the program, Dr. Seewald.  Dr. JEFFREY SEEWALD: (Associate scientist, Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry Department, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution): Good afternoon.  FLATOW: Dr. Reves-Sohn, how is it going in your search for these hydrothermal vents?  Dr. REVES-SOHN: Well, we're really just getting started. We've been on our station here at 85 degrees north for about two days, and we started our search by - we raised and lowered the sensors on a long wire down to the bottom of the seafloor and back up again, and we're looking for signals in the water column of the sort of cloudy and hot water that's discharged by those vents. So far, we've (unintelligible) made about nine casts, and we found evidence for hydrothermal plume on two of those nine casts.  FLATOW: And then is the plan to send down these robotic devices to explore them?  Dr. REVES-SOHN: That's correct. Once we feel like we have a reasonable idea where the vent fields might be on the seafloor, we deploy the robots and let them do the rest of the hard work for us.  FLATOW: Give us an idea of what it looks like in the surrounding area. If we were to be on your ship, what would be looking at?  Dr. REVES-SOHN: Well, it's white, very white. We're in the middle of the Arctic icepack, and there is very little open water here, the average is probably 95 percent or more. And the Oden is able to break its way through this ice, and we have maps with us that were made by an earlier expedition, the AMORE Expedition in 2001, and we used those maps to guide our surveys, but pretty much, it's white ice as far as you can see, and a gray sky.  FLATOW: Dr. Seewald, you've got a study planned for the mid-Atlantic Ridge. It goes down the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. How similar is that to the Gakkel Ridge where you are now?  Dr. SEEWALD: Well, the mid-Atlantic Ridge is a slightly faster-spreading oceanic ridge, and the Gakkel Ridge, on the other hand, represents an end member of extremely slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges. And so, the interest in this environment is that the processes may be slightly different and may constrain a further end member on what we might see. There are similarities in that the composition of the crust in the two environments are very similar, but the style of circulation may be quite different.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Tim Shank, if there are hydrothermal vents in many other places on the planet, why go to all the trouble to find them under the Arctic Ocean? What's significant, biologically speaking, about this Gakkel Ridge there?  Dr. SHANK: Well, 58 million years ago, when seafloor spreading started in the Arctic, the basin was largely isolated. And so, whatever animals may have (unintelligible) in these early times of hydrothermal venting in the Arctic that may have evolved in isolation. So as an evolutionary biologist, I really want to know what isolation means to the evolution of species.  We've gone around the world finding over 600 species in the last 30 years, and we've seen tie-ins into their distribution. So like you might find marsupials in Australia or something else in Mongolia, you find the same thing in hydrothermal vents. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge fauna that live there (audio gap) on what see off Mexico, for example. So they could be completely different here, up in the Arctic, and that's what we actually expect.  FLATOW: What's different about, Dr. Reves-Sohn, what's different about working in this icy condition? Is it much more dangerous? Is that the reason why you're using these robotics instead of the human submersibles?  Dr. REVES-SOHN: That's absolutely right. In the open ocean, we would send either a man submersible or what we call a remotely operated vehicle, which is a very expensive piece of equipment on a wire, down to the bottom of the seafloor to do the exploration.  But because we have almost complete ice coverage up here, it's not safe to send human beings under the ice, at least in our estimation, and it's too risky to send a $10 or $20 million (audio gap) under the ice because the ice is constantly moving and shifting, and there's a significant chance that you could snap the wire that the vehicle is on.  And that is why we've designed these robots because they're able to dive through the ice and flip (audio gap) and with no connection back to the ship, which (audio gap) something on the order of half a million dollars each, which is not cheap, but much cheaper than a remotely operated vehicle. So the eventuality that we very much hope (audio gap) is not the end of the world.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So these basically swim out on their own. They have - there's no tether on them and then they find their way back.  Dr. REVES-SOHN: Yeah, you were dropping out a bit. You asked if they can find their way back to the ship?  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. REVES-SOHN: So we use some acoustic systems in the same way that, you know, you have a computer modem, and some of us are still on that situation where we have to have a dial-up modem in our house. In that same way, the robots have a modem, and it communicates to the ship, the acoustic signals, and we're able to open up a little hole in the ice with the icebreaker, and then we use the modem to tell the robot where that hole is so that it can safely return to the vessel.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Jeff Seewald, once they find a hydrothermal vent, it looks like they've got a couple of possibilities, how do you study them? Do you catch the water coming out, and scoop it up and sample it and bring it back?  Dr. SEEWALD: In an ideal situation, that would happen, but the technology doesn't exist to actually do that right now. But what they will be doing is collecting samples of the biology, samples of rocks and samples of vent fluids that have mixed with seawater in the water column. And those types of samples can give an enormous amount of information as to what's happening in the subsurface beneath the ridge crest. And so, there's a lot of information to be had in terms of the composition of the fluids and the style of circulation from collecting these samples.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. I'll ask anybody who might want to answer this. We keep hearing more and more now that, given the summertime in the Arctic Ocean, that the ocean, due to global warming, is becoming more and more ice-free. Would that make it easier for scientists in the future to, you know, to send robotics down there?  Dr. REVES-SOHN: It would. If it - it's hard, right now, we're in the middle of the ice pack. And there's ice everywhere as far as we can see. So any effect like that certainly hasn't reached to 85 degrees north. But in principle, sure, if the ice were to melt away, that would make our lives easier. If I could just go one step further, a lot of us, our job would be easier if we could drain the ocean. So, I think there's a lot of things we wish could happen. But who knows what will happen?  FLATOW: Well, that would be a one-time job, if you were draining the ocean, I'd say.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: How long is the research going to be there? How long is this study going to take?  Dr. SHANKS: Well, we've been out for about a week now. We've had a total of 40 days with the icebreaker Oden. And we hope to cover this site we're sitting over right now, as well as another site. That's about a six-day or seven-day staying from here. The error we can't predict very well over this ice. It's easy to get locked up in the ice and not to break free. It can take twice as long as that.  But what's interesting is on the site that we're sitting over is actually one that's what we call them peridotite. It's actually mantle rock that's exposed to the seawater. It may not exactly have the volcanism we think of the other places that are associated with hydrothermal vents, but what we do find is a different kind of chemistry that comes from that mantle rock exposed to seawater. And when we have that different chemistry, we get different animals. And that's another reason why we've stooped here at this location on our way further up the Gakkel Ridge later on in the cruise.  FLATOW: So you really don't know what you're going to see when you see something?  Dr. REVES-SOHN: That's true. We have no idea what we're going to find.  FLATOW: That makes it even more exciting, doesn't that?  Dr. REVES-SOHN: Exciting and stressful, yes.  FLATOW: All right. Well, we'll let you go. And we've taken up enough time from your work. So I want to thank you for - gentlemen. And wish you all the best of luck. And hopefully, you'll come back, and we will find out later on what your results are. So, good luck to you, and we'll check in with you later. Thank you, very much.  Dr. SHANKS: Thank you.  Dr. REVES-SOHN: Okay. Thank you.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Rob Reves-Sohn is chief scientist for the Arctic Seafloor Expedition 2007, associate scientist in the geology and geophysics department at Woods Hole, at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.  Tim Shanks is the lead biologist for the Arctic Seafloor Expedition and associate scientist in the biology department at Woods Hole at Woods Hole, Massachusetts.  Dr. Seewald, we're going to have you stay with us.  Dr. SEEWALD: Sure.  FLATOW: So, if you'll hang on, we have to go to a break. And we'll come back and talk lots more about the Arctic. We're going to switch gears a little bit, and talk about other stuff. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this break.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking this hour about the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute's Arctic Seafloor Expedition. We were just talking with scientists aboard a research ship that's sort of in the ice out there in the Arctic regions trying to - we've sort of lost, we were losing satellite communications with them. We're trying to get them back now.  But we still have on with us Jeffrey Seewald, who's associate scientist of the department of marine - chemistry and geochemistry at Woods Hole. Our number, 1800-989-8255. Dr. Seewald, do you wish you were out there with them?  Dr. SEEWALD: I do. It sounds like a very exciting time. It's always a great experience when you can get that sort of technology together with the scientific objectives to actually try and study these systems.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And what was interesting is that we were getting into this a little bit with the scientists on board the ship, talking about, geologically speaking, they found that site to be very interesting. Why is that?  Dr. SEEWALD: Well, this is a region of the mid-ocean ridge system where oceanic spreading is occurring very, very slowly. And so the mid-ocean ridge is basically a 40,000-mile-long mountain chain where new crust is created in what is geologically very rapid time.  But the initial idea was that in very slow spreading ridges, there wouldn't be sufficient heat to generate hydrothermal systems. And this has actually turned out to be very wrong. And the earlier cruises to this region showed a very high abundance of hydrothermal plumes, which is indicative that there is actually a lot of activity in this particular environment.  FLATOW: And these are places, describe if you would for us geologically, where the ocean is actually spreading out and new ocean is coming up out of from underneath?  Dr. SEEWALD: Well, in extremely slow spreading centers, the formation of crust can occur by exhumation of pieces of the mantle, basically. And these are what, I think, Rob referred to as - or actually, it was Tim referred to as peridotites.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. SEEWALD: And these have a very unique composition, or not unique, but very different composition to other areas of the ocean crust where spreading is faster. And so, in faster spreading areas, the rock composition is what we call a basalt, which is very different and produces - when you react seawater with these rocks, produces a fluid of very different composition.  FLATOW: So it's interesting to go to theses different places and find different circumstances?  Dr. SEEWALD: Yes. And the big issue here is, or one of the big issues, is the different chemistry that results when you take cold alkaline seawater that contains oxygen and you react it with rocks in these environments at very high temperatures, and the chemistry changes completely. It becomes a very acidic fluid. It becomes - the oxygen is consumed. There's a lot of hydrogen sulfite. And all these - the change in chemistry is what supports the microbial and biological communities that live in these environments. So a change in chemistry can have an enormous impact on the biology that inhabits these areas.  FLATOW: And how different from - let me put it this way, how far around the nation do you have to go to find different places that have these different kinds of chemistries?  Dr. SEEWALD: Well, in the Pacific, for example, the spreading rate, the southeast Pacific, the spreading rate is significantly faster. The mid-Atlantic ridge is slow, what's considered to be a slow-spreading center, it's a little bit faster than the Gakkel Ridge. The mid-ocean ridge system basically is, you know, 40,000 miles long, this mountain chain. And so, it's basically in - everywhere in the ocean's basins where a new crust is being formed. So there are common features of the ocean basins.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Now, we know the National Science Foundation, the NSF, supports most ocean and polar research. But why was NASA - NASA, the space agency -interested in supporting this project?  Dr. SEEWALD: Well, NASA has an interest in looking for the possibility of life on other planetary bodies, and Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter being one environment. And so Europa is a moon that is covered with ice and may have the ideas that there maybe hydrothermal activity beneath the ice in this environment.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. SEEWALD: So, NASA, the - an obvious thing to do is to see if we can perhaps find hydrothermal vents and sample them beneath the ice on Earth, which would be considerably easier as a first step than trying to do that on Europa.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255 is our number.  There are two robots, one is called Puma and one is called Jaguar. That - were designed by Woods Hole itself?  Dr. SEEWALD: It is my understanding that Hanu Singh designed those vehicles, although I'm not absolutely sure about that. But it is - I think they were designed at Woods Hole.  FLATOW: Because you don't think of Woods Hole as being in the robot business. You'd think of them as being in the undersea exploration business.  Dr. SEEWALD: Well, we have actually a large engineering department here that actually has a long history of building autonomous vehicles and robotic vehicles for undersea research. So there is the - Jason is a well known vehicle\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. SEEWALD: \u2026which is a little different than these autonomous vehicles. There's been others, ABE was one of the first types of these robotic autonomous untethered vehicles.  FLATOW: How long in the planning is something like this? And the reason I ask it is because we've talked about global warming and the ice-free oceans. And we're hearing from the ship there that they're almost locked in the ice. It's ice all around the place. If they had known - if we had known that there, you know, there were going to be, if you wait a little longer in the season that the ocean might be a little bit more opened up because of global warming, and we haven't known this except for the last few years, might you have waited a little later in the season to do this?  Dr. SEEWALD: That certainly would make this project much easier. Sampling without the ice is something - we have a long history of sampling vents using the submersible Alvin and tethered vehicles. A lot of this project is - there's been a significant amount of technology developed with the autonomous vehicles. So I think it's still, from an engineering perspective, it's still quite challenging. But certainly, the - a lack of ice would make conducting this research much simpler.  FLATOW: Let's go to the phones. Bob(ph) in Jackson. Hi, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  BOB (Caller): Well, thank you, Ira. My question, very briefly. An old high school friend, who's a doctor in Florida, was responsible for some marine life so deep that they didn't have eyesight and they didn't have oxygen. They used those plumes, and they were actually a different form of life on Earth because they took in that sulfur from the plumes. And I'm wondering does that have any connection with what some of these findings are up in the Arctic?  Dr. SEEWALD: Yes. Those are exactly the types of organisms that Tim Shank is interested and other biologists are interested in studying.  BOB: Oh, really? Oh, cool.  Dr. SEEWALD: Yeah. When you - when you're - the reason that this life has no, didn't have any eyes was because, in the bottom of the ocean, there's no light, so there's really nothing to see.  But what's drawn a lot of interest in these hydrothermal vent systems is the fact that these biological communities are living off of the chemical energy that is created when you react seawater with the ocean crust. And these communities are living completely in the absence of photosynthetic activity. And so, it's referred to as chemosynthesis, where they garner all their energy from the chemicals that are venting at these locations.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And there's some theory\u2026  BOB: A follow-up question, if I may?  FLATOW: Go ahead.  BOB: Does that mean that on other planets, without oxygen, there could be life?  Dr. SEEWALD: Yes. That - and that gets back to this question of NASA's interest. If the idea that life can exist on Earth in the absence of oxygen and living off hydrothermal vent chemistry suggests that if similar systems exist on other planetary bodies, that there may be the possibility of life elsewhere.  FLATOW: Thanks for calling, Bob.  BOB: Thank you, Professor.  FLATOW: Good question. And that's also the basis of thinking that, perhaps, life - that's where life stared on this planet; with the absence of light and\u2026  Dr. SEEWALD: Yeah.  FLATOW: \u2026harsh environments that were here in the early planet.  Dr. SEEWALD: Absolutely. You described these vent environments as being somewhat extreme earlier on in the show. But actually, for the microbes living there, it's quite comfortable. They have a constant supply of food. If they - on an early Earth, they would have been shielded from meteorite impacts, ultraviolet radiation. So it was a very nice environment in which life may have originated on an early Earth.  FLATOW: Let's go back to the phones. Let's go - it's Ike(ph) in Philadelphia. Hi.  Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Huh? Try it again. Hi, are you there?  IKE (Caller): Yes. Hello.  FLATOW: Hi. Go ahead.  IKE: Hey. I'm trying to picture your scenario. You're on an icebreaker, basically, you're on a sheet of ice. How thick is that ice before we actually contact water so that you can send your probes down, for one? And two, are we looking for medicinal value in searching so far below the surface of the Earth?  Dr. SEEWALD: Yeah. I'm not actually on the ship. But my guess is the ice is several feet thick. And I think they - what they do is they - the icebreaker actually drives itself up on top of the ice and actually cracks the ice and creates an area behind the ship that is free of ice. So there's a trail, and that's where they put the instruments over the side.  And there has been - I'm not a biologist, but there has been, I think there is interest in the potential medicinal value of some of the organisms living on the seafloor, although I'm not particularly familiar with that aspect.  FLATOW: First you have to know what's down there, right? That's what's part of the expedition is all about.  Dr. SEEWALD: Right. That's right.  FLATOW: And it's surprising, I guess it's not surprising considering that the ice covers the water so much of the time, it used to be all the time that we've never explored this part of the ocean.  Dr. SEEWALD: Yeah.  FLATOW: But, it's also interesting that they're - we're now choosing, at this point in time, to explore it.  Dr. SEEWALD: Yeah. Getting back to this origin of life issue. One of the very interesting aspects of the Gakkel Ridge is that it is composed - there's a large amount of this rock type called peridotite. And that particular rock type creates these extremely reducing or hydrogen-rich environments when it reacts with seawater.  In addition, it contains minerals that are thought to be very catalytically active, so there's a lot of interest in this environment because of the potential to abiotically form organic compounds that would be necessary as precursors to life. , simple molecules that could be organized into simple primitive organisms.  FLATOW: Do you have any idea how many other spots on Earth that are unexplored like this one?  Dr. SEEWALD: Well, we've, I don't know the exact numbers, but we've explored a very small region of the Earth's mid-ocean ridge system. So there are lots of regions that we don't really know about. And what's exciting about doing this kind of research is that every time we go to a new area, we always find something new that we - was unexpected and, scientifically, quite interesting.  FLATOW: Talking about deep explorations this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  Talking with Jeff Seewald of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  Can people - can we follow this on the Web anyhow, you know, students, public?  Dr. SEEWALD: Yes. There are two Web sites that I am aware of. There's the Dive And Discover Web site. If you go to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Web site, which is www. whoi. edu, and then there's another Web site that you can link to from there called Polar Discovery, which I think is having a day-to-day log of the - what's going on on the ship.  FLATOW: So you can keep track of it. And it's just very early on in their exploration period. We heard from - onboard the boat that they think they just had a signal from a couple of spots.  Dr. SEEWALD: Yeah. This process of finding vents on the seafloor when you're doing it on open ocean is fairly time consuming. And it's not unusual to spend a week looking for vents on the seafloor before you or even - and longer. Doing this in the ice, where everything is happening, I imagine much slower than it would be in the open ocean. So it could be quite a while before they actually find something.  FLATOW: 1-0800 - I think we have time for one more call, 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Philadelphia. Hi, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Unidentified Man: Hi. I was wondering if perhaps he's able tell us what the chemistry of the peridotites are and if it's similar to the other ones that are all around the world?  Dr. SEEWALD: I'm not familiar with the particular chemistry of the peridotites on the Gakkel Ridge. I'm actually a water chemist. But the lack of silica in a peridotite in general, compared to a basaltic rock, which has a higher silica content, and a very high iron content that is present in peridotites allows them to create this very reducing environment when it reacts with seawater. Significantly, more reducing than you might find.  FLATOW: Reducing, meaning what?  Dr. SEEWALD: Reducing meaning high hydrogen, very low oxygen concentrations, and very high hydrogen concentrations, which - hydrogen is sort of a key ingredient for both maintaining life in these systems. And if abiotic or synthesis of organic compounds in the absence of life is going on, you need rather high hydrogen concentrations.  FLATOW: What would be the maximum outcome of this? What's the best you could expect from a mission like this one?  Dr. SEEWALD: Well, the best outcome would be that they find vents everywhere they go, and they don't lose any of their vehicles.  And the - from a biological perspective, I think there's a lot to be learned in terms of the biogeography of different species. So there's a possibility that there are organisms living in this environment that are totally unique because there's been no communication due to the restriction of water flow in this rather restricted basin. So it's an opportunity to look at evolution in an environment that may be totally independent from the rest of the world's oceans.  FLATOW: Because it is so isolated up there.  Dr. SEEWALD: Yeah.  FLATOW: Yeah. All right. I want to thank you for your taking time to be with us.  Dr. SEEWALD: Great to be here.  FLATOW: And good luck to you.  Dr. SEEWALD: Thank you.  FLATOW: Jeffrey Seewald, associate scientist in the department of marine chemistry and geochemistry at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  Also, I want to thank the folks at Woods Hole, who were on the exploration ship for the satellite time they were able to give us today.  We're going to take a short break. And when we come back, we're going to just change gears a little bit. We're going to stay in the Arctic Region. But we're going to onshore to - there's another Arctic mystery. These guys are down there looking for these hydrothermal vents. Well, there's a sort of a global-warming-related Arctic mystery that's happening on land about the disappearance of some pools of water, some ponds that have been around for countless years, thousands of years, they're suddenly gone.  And one scientist has published a research about this and is wondering why and how, and possibly, signs of global warming. He'll be back to talk with us after the short break. Hope you'll stay with us. We'll be right back. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2007 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Ira Flatow. A bit later in the hour, we'll talk about earth-friendly packaging. But up first, it's been two weeks of very public and very eyebrow-raising episodes involving science and politics. An ex-surgeon general testified that the Bush administration silenced him from speaking about sensitive public health issues. And yesterday, his sentiment prompted the nominated surgeon general to say he would resign before letting politics dictate science. These events on Capitol Hill blew in on the tail winds of a storm at the National Hurricane Center in Florida, where the director was forced to resign this week after an open rebellion by his staff. Here to help us sort through the intricacies of these events is Chris Mooney, science writer, who has authored two books about science and politics. The latest is \"Storm World: Hurricanes, Politics, and the Battle Over Global Warming. \" He is Seed magazine's Washington correspondent, and joins us from Florida. Hi. Welcome back to the show, Chris. Mr. CHRIS MOONEY (Author, \"Storm World: Hurricanes, Politics, and the Battle Over Global Warming\"; Washington Correspondent, Seed Magazine): Thanks for having me back. FLATOW: While you're in Florida, let's talk about the Florida story first. Mr. MOONEY: Okay. FLATOW: What happened down there? Mr. MOONEY: Some were calling it kind of \"The Cain Mutiny. \" Bill Proenza came in and he was quickly very outspoken as the new director of the National Hurricane Center, and seemed actually heroic in his willingness to challenge his superiors about lack of investment in funding for hurricane research. But it turned out - we didn't know at first - that a lot of the senior forecasters disagreed with one of the particular arguments he was making about priorities of research. And they claimed that Proenza was exaggerating the importance of a satellite, that they actually didn't need as much for forecasting land-falling storms accurately. And they claimed that in so doing, Proenza was undermining public faith in their ability to forecast. So in essence, you could say they mutinied, about half the staff, in those statements saying he had to leave, and that pretty much made it impossible for him to continue. FLATOW: How did he alienate half of the staff in so brief a period? Mr. MOONEY: Well, we don't know exactly what was going on inside of that office, and you have to figure or assume at least some of this was friction between people. And there's some quotes from some of the forecasters in the Miami Herald, suggesting that that may well have been the case. Someone quote from Richard Pasch, who's a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center, saying of Proenza, I don't see the concept of a team player. So it may not have just been this scientific issue of the satellite and how important it is to forecast. It might have been something going on interpersonally as well. But it's hard to speculate on that. FLATOW: Let's talk about that satellite issue for people who hadn't heard about it. He basically was complaining that the satellite was not being built and was going to upset the accuracy of hurricane prediction? Mr. MOONEY: Yeah. It's a satellite known as QuikSCAT. And it's aging, languishing without a replacement being built. And what this satellite does is it measures the winds of hurricanes and other kinds of winds over the distant oceans, both their speed and their direction. And Proenza argued that if there wasn't a replacement and we lose this satellite, then the accuracy of forecast for storms would decrease 10 percent for the two-day forecast, 16 percent for a three-day forecast. The forecasters disagreed. They said that QuikScat is very important for getting information about storms out the sea. But once they get closer to the U. S. coast, they have a lot of other sources of data on them, and particularly hurricane hunter flights for the reconnaissance aircraft, which gather great data and which are essential to forecasting. So they said that losing QuikSCAT, that would be bad, but it wouldn't undermine the accuracy of their forecast. And in fact, the forecast have been getting more accurate over time. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So he was forced to step down? Mr. MOONEY: Mm-hmm. Well, he was put on leave\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. MOONEY: \u2026as I think. Yeah. FLATOW: And so he's not being replaced then? Mr. MOONEY: Well, the deputy director of the Hurricane Center is now the interim director. Ed Rappaport has been there for a long time. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And - so things are, you know, coming on the heels of another scandal that was going on down there, right? It's the second one at the National Hurricane Center? Mr. MOONEY: Well, you know, this is the second major fight in this small, relatively small community of hurricane scientists, and it's unfortunate there's been so much divisiveness in such a short period of time. I would argue that the first major fight is over the relationship between hurricanes and global warming and that really divided the community. And this is sort of episode two in the hurricane wars. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Has that weeded itself out, yet? Mr. MOONEY: No. Actually, the episode one, the hurricane-global warming battle is still not over. But episode two has quickly surged ahead of it because we're on the verge of hurricane season - we're in hurricane season, but we're in the verge of the peak months, August, September, October - and everyone wants to know and have confidence that the Hurricane Center is functioning properly, so that's why this issue surged to the front of the news. FLATOW: Is there any mark of the Bush administration on the Proenza dismissal or is it just his being in power? Mr. MOONEY: Well, it's a conflict between two groups of scientists rather than politicians versus scientists. It's Proenza on the one hand and a lot of the senior forecasters at the center, disagreeing with him and the staff disagreeing with him. That said, it's clear that the fallout was kind of sparked by an investigation from the superiors at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. I think it kind of ignited the situation. FLATOW: That brings us to the ex-Surgeon General Richard Carmona who was versed in science, but telling Congress that he struggled with the administration who didn't want to hear the truth. Mr. MOONEY: Absolutely. And you know, Richard Carmona as surgeon general -we've heard these kind of stories from many other scientists from the Bush administration. But when the nation's top doctor and top public health educator goes on the record in such a strong way, it really gets everyone's attention. I mean, it's arguable that he's the most prominent figure yet to make what others have made, the claim that there is some kind of, quote, \"war in science. \" Or Al Gore would call it assault on reason, being perpetuated by the Bush administration. And now, to hear it from him, really caught everybody's nose. FLATOW: Is it the timing - he's no longer surgeon general - is it the timing that makes this so newsworthy? Mr. MOONEY: I think it's the timing, combined with the forcefulness of the statements. He stood up there and he firmly said, in no uncertain terms that it had never been this bad for a surgeon general. So it's both of those factors. And it's also the prominence of the surgeon general. In fact, the committee hearing that he testified in was about trying to make the surgeon general more independent of political oversight, but nevertheless, the office does have incredible symbolic resonance. FLATOW: You know - yeah, but there were other surgeon generals on the stand this week - C. Everett Koop under Reagan, David Satcher under Clinton. They both said politics dictated their runs as surgeon general. Why aren't people as mad at the Clinton and Reagan administrations as they are with the Bush camp after the Carmona testimony? Mr. MOONEY: Well, to some extent, they should be. But Carmona also said in his testimony that he had talked to all the previous surgeon generals. And he said they all agreed with him that while they had had problems, it was nothing comparing to the magnitude of the problems that Carmona had faced. Carmona had said he had even blocked some - in terms of talking about embryonic stem cell research, about emergency contraception, sex ads, mental health, second-hand smoke - a whole array of issues. So he claims it's worse and apparently, they agree with him. Well, that's not to say that politics hasn't rubbed against science before this. Definitely, it does happen. FLATOW: I always wonder why they wait until after they're not in power to make the statements, you know? Mr. MOONEY: Well, some of them don't, right? C. Everett Koop was very outspoken while in office. And he certainly earned the ire of many in the Reagan administration. It did not want him speaking out about AIDS, sex ad, condoms, all these sorts of things. And he did so, anyway. You know, it might just be that Carmona has a different style when he was testifying before Congress this week. He said he got into Washington really politically naive. He wasn't even sure at first that this was outrageous behavior, or abnormal behavior. He had to talk to other surgeon generals and sort of assess what their experiences were. It might just be different temperaments. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Obviously, the Carmona testimony before the House committee was bound to get pressed, but was there any way that the Hurricane Center shenanigans could have been settled internally? Mr. MOONEY: You know, I don't know because a lot of people didn't really realized how much there were sort of - apparent smoldering discontent at that center until it all kind of exploded. So I guess if there had been someone monitoring and mediating behind the scenes, that might have helped. But it all kind of took us by surprise. I don't think there's anyone trying to do that. FLATOW: You know, with NASA and global warming and the Hurricane Center and FEMA and the surgeon general, it feels like they're - you're constantly hearing more and more federal agency affairs being thrust in the public eye even if - and the blatancy of these political agendas are just being uncovered. Mr. MOONEY: Yeah. You know, I think it's partly the Bush administration, its record on the integrity of science issues has been exposed as very problematic again and again and again. People like NASA's James Hansen spoken out about it. Richard Carmona is just the latest in the long line of people. But there's something else going on here, too, which is that scientific information which the federal agencies often specialize in is so incredibly relevant, the policy, that it keeps getting pulled into political fight. And then, you have scientists come in saying somebody twisted the data, because this is a strong incentive to do so, politically at this time. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Does this battle - as you call it, hurricane wars episode two: attack of the forecasters - is this going to affect the center's ability to lead us through the hurricane season? Should the public still have full faith in the National Hurricane Center's ability to come together and predict storms accurately? Mr. MOONEY: Yeah. These are the best forecasters in the world, the people who work at the National Hurricane Center. They're really national heroes. I mean, these are the guys who've forecast, very accurately, Katrina's track days in advance, giving everybody else plenty of time to prepare. And so we should have confidence in them. We want them to be working in a good work environment. And that needs to be restored, so we need a quick detente and a quick resolution. Proenza has been put on leave. I think that that was what had to happen - given the high-profile criticism of him - because we needed every one on the same page going to the season. FLATOW: Let's go to the phones. I see, we have Micah Holtern(ph) on the phone. Hi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Mr. MICAH HOLTERN (Caller): Hi, there. FLATOW: Hi, there. Mr. HOLTERN: I'm working with the unit of concerned scientists on this issue. And I think it's important to point out that the Republican Congress didn't really hold any oversight hearings into political interference in science, so we haven't seen that until this year. It's also important to note that the truth is, that when federal government scientists are heard from - or when they're asked to compromise their integrity, it's not easy for them to speak up. Whistleblower protections currently do not protect scientists, and they risk their jobs when they do so. FLATOW: Now, you could, what? You could be protected as surgeon general, one would think. Mr. HOLTERN: Well, they know - sent generally - some of - a lot of these scientists come forward and say I can be very effective in what I do. I can be, you know, at least I'm 75 percent effective in the role that I'm playing right now. And if someone else comes along, they might be even more easily manipulated and distorted. So, you know, we find that scientists are staying in federal agencies and staying in their positions in trying to do the best they can. FLATOW: All right. Thanks for calling. Any final comments? Mr. MOONEY: Well, I'll just say that that's definitely right. Henry Waxman, who is with all the investigations were airing a lot more of the abuses about misuse of science. I think the surgeon general - if he stands up and speaks out - it's pretty hard for the administration to fire him, though. FLATOW: Thanks a lot, Chris. Mr. MOONEY: Thanks for having me. FLATOW: Good luck. Chris Mooney is the author of \"Storm World: Hurricanes, Politics, and the Battle Over Global Warming,\" just out from Harcourt. He's the Washington correspondent for Seed magazine. We're going to take a break. And when we come back, we're going to talk about the green packaging. Well, last week, we saw, you know, we had all this music talking about live - what you could do to save the Earth? Well, what are you doing? How about green packaging? Maybe you're recycling more, maybe you're thinking about what choice should I make between paper and plastic. Well, for the next - rest of the hour, we're going to talk about helping you make those choices, talk about some new products, you know. There's so much packaging going out there, what kinds of new products do we have that are being developed, thought about by packaging companies. We're going to talk to some people across the pond over - in Europe, where, you know, green has been at the top of the list on people's minds for a long time. They have already developed all kinds of new kinds of packaging. We'll get some expertise from them. We'll talk about how even cities - cities are taking the lead in banning water bottles. Some of the city councils around the country, you can't drink a bottle of water anymore. Is that a good idea? We'll talk about it. Stay with us, we'll be right back after this short break. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  A bit later in the hour, we'll talk about earth-friendly packaging.  But up first, it's been two weeks of very public and very eyebrow-raising episodes involving science and politics. An ex-surgeon general testified that the Bush administration silenced him from speaking about sensitive public health issues. And yesterday, his sentiment prompted the nominated surgeon general to say he would resign before letting politics dictate science.  These events on Capitol Hill blew in on the tail winds of a storm at the National Hurricane Center in Florida, where the director was forced to resign this week after an open rebellion by his staff.  Here to help us sort through the intricacies of these events is Chris Mooney, science writer, who has authored two books about science and politics. The latest is \"Storm World: Hurricanes, Politics, and the Battle Over Global Warming. \" He is Seed magazine's Washington correspondent, and joins us from Florida. Hi. Welcome back to the show, Chris.  Mr. CHRIS MOONEY (Author, \"Storm World: Hurricanes, Politics, and the Battle Over Global Warming\"; Washington Correspondent, Seed Magazine): Thanks for having me back.  FLATOW: While you're in Florida, let's talk about the Florida story first.  Mr. MOONEY: Okay.  FLATOW: What happened down there?  Mr. MOONEY: Some were calling it kind of \"The Cain Mutiny. \" Bill Proenza came in and he was quickly very outspoken as the new director of the National Hurricane Center, and seemed actually heroic in his willingness to challenge his superiors about lack of investment in funding for hurricane research. But it turned out - we didn't know at first - that a lot of the senior forecasters disagreed with one of the particular arguments he was making about priorities of research.  And they claimed that Proenza was exaggerating the importance of a satellite, that they actually didn't need as much for forecasting land-falling storms accurately. And they claimed that in so doing, Proenza was undermining public faith in their ability to forecast. So in essence, you could say they mutinied, about half the staff, in those statements saying he had to leave, and that pretty much made it impossible for him to continue.  FLATOW: How did he alienate half of the staff in so brief a period?  Mr. MOONEY: Well, we don't know exactly what was going on inside of that office, and you have to figure or assume at least some of this was friction between people. And there's some quotes from some of the forecasters in the Miami Herald, suggesting that that may well have been the case. Someone quote from Richard Pasch, who's a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center, saying of Proenza, I don't see the concept of a team player.  So it may not have just been this scientific issue of the satellite and how important it is to forecast. It might have been something going on interpersonally as well. But it's hard to speculate on that.  FLATOW: Let's talk about that satellite issue for people who hadn't heard about it. He basically was complaining that the satellite was not being built and was going to upset the accuracy of hurricane prediction?  Mr. MOONEY: Yeah. It's a satellite known as QuikSCAT. And it's aging, languishing without a replacement being built. And what this satellite does is it measures the winds of hurricanes and other kinds of winds over the distant oceans, both their speed and their direction. And Proenza argued that if there wasn't a replacement and we lose this satellite, then the accuracy of forecast for storms would decrease 10 percent for the two-day forecast, 16 percent for a three-day forecast. The forecasters disagreed.  They said that QuikScat is very important for getting information about storms out the sea. But once they get closer to the U. S. coast, they have a lot of other sources of data on them, and particularly hurricane hunter flights for the reconnaissance aircraft, which gather great data and which are essential to forecasting. So they said that losing QuikSCAT, that would be bad, but it wouldn't undermine the accuracy of their forecast. And in fact, the forecast have been getting more accurate over time.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So he was forced to step down?  Mr. MOONEY: Mm-hmm. Well, he was put on leave\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  Mr. MOONEY: \u2026as I think. Yeah.  FLATOW: And so he's not being replaced then?  Mr. MOONEY: Well, the deputy director of the Hurricane Center is now the interim director. Ed Rappaport has been there for a long time.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And - so things are, you know, coming on the heels of another scandal that was going on down there, right? It's the second one at the National Hurricane Center?  Mr. MOONEY: Well, you know, this is the second major fight in this small, relatively small community of hurricane scientists, and it's unfortunate there's been so much divisiveness in such a short period of time. I would argue that the first major fight is over the relationship between hurricanes and global warming and that really divided the community. And this is sort of episode two in the hurricane wars.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Has that weeded itself out, yet?  Mr. MOONEY: No. Actually, the episode one, the hurricane-global warming battle is still not over. But episode two has quickly surged ahead of it because we're on the verge of hurricane season - we're in hurricane season, but we're in the verge of the peak months, August, September, October - and everyone wants to know and have confidence that the Hurricane Center is functioning properly, so that's why this issue surged to the front of the news.  FLATOW: Is there any mark of the Bush administration on the Proenza dismissal or is it just his being in power?  Mr. MOONEY: Well, it's a conflict between two groups of scientists rather than politicians versus scientists. It's Proenza on the one hand and a lot of the senior forecasters at the center, disagreeing with him and the staff disagreeing with him. That said, it's clear that the fallout was kind of sparked by an investigation from the superiors at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. I think it kind of ignited the situation.  FLATOW: That brings us to the ex-Surgeon General Richard Carmona who was versed in science, but telling Congress that he struggled with the administration who didn't want to hear the truth.  Mr. MOONEY: Absolutely. And you know, Richard Carmona as surgeon general -we've heard these kind of stories from many other scientists from the Bush administration. But when the nation's top doctor and top public health educator goes on the record in such a strong way, it really gets everyone's attention.  I mean, it's arguable that he's the most prominent figure yet to make what others have made, the claim that there is some kind of, quote, \"war in science. \" Or Al Gore would call it assault on reason, being perpetuated by the Bush administration. And now, to hear it from him, really caught everybody's nose.  FLATOW: Is it the timing - he's no longer surgeon general - is it the timing that makes this so newsworthy?  Mr. MOONEY: I think it's the timing, combined with the forcefulness of the statements. He stood up there and he firmly said, in no uncertain terms that it had never been this bad for a surgeon general. So it's both of those factors. And it's also the prominence of the surgeon general. In fact, the committee hearing that he testified in was about trying to make the surgeon general more independent of political oversight, but nevertheless, the office does have incredible symbolic resonance.  FLATOW: You know - yeah, but there were other surgeon generals on the stand this week - C. Everett Koop under Reagan, David Satcher under Clinton. They both said politics dictated their runs as surgeon general. Why aren't people as mad at the Clinton and Reagan administrations as they are with the Bush camp after the Carmona testimony?  Mr. MOONEY: Well, to some extent, they should be. But Carmona also said in his testimony that he had talked to all the previous surgeon generals. And he said they all agreed with him that while they had had problems, it was nothing comparing to the magnitude of the problems that Carmona had faced. Carmona had said he had even blocked some - in terms of talking about embryonic stem cell research, about emergency contraception, sex ads, mental health, second-hand smoke - a whole array of issues.  So he claims it's worse and apparently, they agree with him. Well, that's not to say that politics hasn't rubbed against science before this. Definitely, it does happen.  FLATOW: I always wonder why they wait until after they're not in power to make the statements, you know?  Mr. MOONEY: Well, some of them don't, right? C. Everett Koop was very outspoken while in office. And he certainly earned the ire of many in the Reagan administration. It did not want him speaking out about AIDS, sex ad, condoms, all these sorts of things. And he did so, anyway. You know, it might just be that Carmona has a different style when he was testifying before Congress this week.  He said he got into Washington really politically naive. He wasn't even sure at first that this was outrageous behavior, or abnormal behavior. He had to talk to other surgeon generals and sort of assess what their experiences were. It might just be different temperaments.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Obviously, the Carmona testimony before the House committee was bound to get pressed, but was there any way that the Hurricane Center shenanigans could have been settled internally?  Mr. MOONEY: You know, I don't know because a lot of people didn't really realized how much there were sort of - apparent smoldering discontent at that center until it all kind of exploded. So I guess if there had been someone monitoring and mediating behind the scenes, that might have helped. But it all kind of took us by surprise. I don't think there's anyone trying to do that.  FLATOW: You know, with NASA and global warming and the Hurricane Center and FEMA and the surgeon general, it feels like they're - you're constantly hearing more and more federal agency affairs being thrust in the public eye even if - and the blatancy of these political agendas are just being uncovered.  Mr. MOONEY: Yeah. You know, I think it's partly the Bush administration, its record on the integrity of science issues has been exposed as very problematic again and again and again. People like NASA's James Hansen spoken out about it. Richard Carmona is just the latest in the long line of people. But there's something else going on here, too, which is that scientific information which the federal agencies often specialize in is so incredibly relevant, the policy, that it keeps getting pulled into political fight. And then, you have scientists come in saying somebody twisted the data, because this is a strong incentive to do so, politically at this time.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Does this battle - as you call it, hurricane wars episode two: attack of the forecasters - is this going to affect the center's ability to lead us through the hurricane season? Should the public still have full faith in the National Hurricane Center's ability to come together and predict storms accurately?  Mr. MOONEY: Yeah. These are the best forecasters in the world, the people who work at the National Hurricane Center. They're really national heroes. I mean, these are the guys who've forecast, very accurately, Katrina's track days in advance, giving everybody else plenty of time to prepare. And so we should have confidence in them. We want them to be working in a good work environment. And that needs to be restored, so we need a quick detente and a quick resolution. Proenza has been put on leave. I think that that was what had to happen - given the high-profile criticism of him - because we needed every one on the same page going to the season.  FLATOW: Let's go to the phones. I see, we have Micah Holtern(ph) on the phone. Hi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Mr. MICAH HOLTERN (Caller): Hi, there.  FLATOW: Hi, there.

MANDALIT DEL BARCO: Inside a large aviary, Matthew Simmons gently coaxes a green and yellow Amazon parrot named Joey(ph) to say a few words. Mr. MATTHEW SIMMONS (Patient, Veterans Affairs, California): Joey. (Soundbite of whistling) Mr. SIMMONS: Tweety bird - say hello. PARROT: Hello. Mr. SIMMONS: Good boy.

He had nightmares and one night, he says, he got into a fight. Mr. SIMMONS: I hit this gentleman in the head and he was pretty seriously injured. And I spent about two years behind bars in a six-by-nine. You know, it was torture; I was in a confined space. I came out for 10 minutes every other day. I had a very limited amount of people that I interacted with. I didn't trust. . . DEL BARCO: As part of his drug and alcohol rehabilitation, Simmons has been working at the parrot sanctuary in a peaceful garden on the grounds of L. A. 's Veterans Affairs headquarters. Here he hand feeds Joey and two baby Amazonian parrots, a couple of macaws and six ring-necked parrots. Mr. SIMMONS: This is a rescue sanctuary, so a lot of the birds come from like traumatic environments where they have either been abused or hurt in such a way that they don't function necessarily at a high level. When they first get here, they're scared, they isolate. And they act like I did when I got here, and that's kind of where the similarity comes in.

It snaps detailed images of the groove cut into the disc. HABER: And by taking these pictures, it essentially just unwinds the record into a big long stripe. BOYCE: The picture appears on Haber's computer screen. It looks like a black and white photo of a tire tread. HABER: Here's the break. Now you can see, there's a little piece of dust, little scratch marks on it. BOYCE: The computer ignores all of these flaws. And at the click of a mouse, it uses the image to reconstruct the sound. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BOYCE: Peter Alyea works to preserve these records. To play them, he says, you need technicians who are trained to do things like choose the proper needle. But if IRENE lives up to its potential, anyone could make a copy. PETER ALYEA: They don't have to worry about any of the technical aspects. They simply can stick a disc on it and get some sound out of it. BOYCE: Alyea says it's like a photocopy machine for sound. ALYEA: It brings the possibility of automation much closer to reality for these kinds of materials. BOYCE: That could help the library digitize its vast collection and make it more widely available. But how good are those photocopies? (SOUNDBITE OF BEEPING SOUND)BOYCE: But luckily, audio engineer George Horn still makes these records at his studio in California. GEORGE HORN: And he cuts them for DJs, who want to use them for the, you know, chuck-chuck thing that they do, I guess. BOYCE: Horn cut this disc with a series of well-defined tones. Haber says IRENE can reproduce the tones precisely. HABER: The machine is not adding its own color. It's not adding anything of its own nature. BOYCE: IRENE may not add things, but Haber says IRENE does take some things away. HABER: So this is a lovely recording of the song \"Johnny was the Boy for Me. \"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"JOHNNY IS THE BOY FOR ME\")MARY FORD: (Singing) Johnny is the boy for me. Always knew that he would be. HABER: Recorded by Les Paul and Mary Ford in 1953. BOYCE: On a regular turntable, the beat-up record skipped. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"JOHNNY IS THE BOY FOR ME\")FORD: (Singing) So I love - and I told my eager heart. . . BOYCE: But IRENE skips over the skip like it's not even there. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"JOHNNY IS THE BOY FOR ME\")FORD: (Singing) So I love him from the start and I told my eager heart, Johnny is the boy for me. BOYCE: And here's another worn-out old record. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HEMLOCK BLUES\"): I got me some blues. BOYCE: It's owned by a collector who says it's so damaged, he doesn't even try to play it with a regular needle. But IRENE scanned it and got some sound. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HEMLOCK BLUES\")BOYCE: Unidentified Man: (Singing) (unintelligible)(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BOYCE: Haber says it's amazing to hear these voices from the past.

NELL BOYCE: I'm in a small, white room with bright red carpet, and Carl Haber is about to play me a record from around 1930. It's a recording of Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Iolanthe. \" And the thing is, this record is broken. CARL HABER: If you look, there's a little piece - it looks like somebody just got hungry and took a bite out of it. BOYCE: The record is sitting on a turntable. Haber has fitted the broken piece back into place, like it's a jigsaw puzzle. HABER: If we spun this thing fast, the piece would come flying off, you know, and maybe hit somebody.

Well, in our neighborhood, there are plenty this week. The American Veterinary Medical Association is meeting at the Washington Convention Center, which I can see right out my office window. But from what we hear, someday, you may not find a vet in the house because the number of applications to vet schools is not growing, not keeping pace with demand for vets. Dr. Gregory Hammer is the newly elected president of the AVMA and joins us in the studio. Welcome. Dr. GREGORY HAMMER (President, American Veterinary Medical Association): Thank you very much for inviting me. SIEGEL: First, I want you to give us some measure that you know of declining student interest in becoming a vet. Or, what do the numbers tell you that are in any way disconcerting? Dr. HAMMER: For the last few years, we've had a relatively flat applicant pool. We're getting a population across the country that is raised further and further from the farm, no less and less about farm animals, and are somewhat uncomfortable with applying to veterinary school, even though we have an extreme shortage in food-supply veterinarians. SIEGEL: I've read articles, which say that the shortage is in large-animal veterinarians and people who are working on the food supply, as opposed to small-animal vets who would be treating mostly pets. Dr. HAMMER: It is. We've had a change in the demographics in veterinary medicine over the last few years. There's been a much higher percentage of female veterinarian graduates. They are more comfortable, in most cases, with companion animal, dogs, pets, cats, small pocket pets, things like that, And they are less likely to be interested in large animals, particularly the food supply, cows, horses and things like that. SIEGEL: Now, I've seen the figures, 77 percent female registration and. . . Dr. HAMMER: Right. And just this past May, with the graduating classes in May, we became 50 percent female, 50 percent male active veterinarians out there in the United States right now. SIEGEL: But as of now, for example, are you filling the slots, do you think, in those schools? That is, are all the schools still graduating, whatever it is, it's about 2500 vets a year? And are the applicants who are entering vet school just less competitive than they used to be? Or are places going vacant and jobs not being filled? Dr. HAMMER: No, they're not going vacant at all. We do - you're correct. We graduate about 2500 a year from the 28 veterinary schools in the United States. It's just that perhaps, we don't have as much competition for those slots as we used to. It was very common in 20, 25 years ago to have a one-to-eleven acceptance; 11 people would apply and one would get in. SIEGEL: It was that competitive to get into vet school. Well, a problem that also results in the shortage of large-animal vets is that they're just fewer people, I gather, coming out of rural areas and becoming vets. Dr. HAMMER: It is really an acute shortage. We've recently done a mapping study to show where food animals are and where the food animal veterinarians are. And there was one particular area in Kansas that have 25,000 food animals to treat and there were no veterinarians at all within quite a few miles. SIEGEL: What does the job pay to be a vet in such an area, do you think? Dr. HAMMER: I would say you're probably talking in the sixty to a hundred thousand dollar range depending on whether it was a multi-person practice or on their own. But I think that's a pretty accurate figure. SIEGEL: But why do you think young people aren't attracted to that kind of work? Dr. HAMMER: I think one of the reasons are we've been our worst own advocate. We say too many hours, too large a debt, too low a salary. They go to school for eight years. They come out with a hundred thousand dollar debt. The average starting salary is a little over 50,000. A hundred thousand dollar mortgage is a pretty tough one to start with. SIEGEL: So what are you going to do to try to turn this around as the new president of the American Veterinary Medical Association? Dr. HAMMER: Well, one of the things that we're trying to do is improve the infrastructures in the veterinary schools by supporting a bill in the national Congress called the Public Health Workforce Veterinary Expansion Act, and that's Senate Bill 746. And by getting that passed, we're hoping to improve the infrastructures that haven't changed in over 30 years in most of the vet schools, and attract students to those - for public health, food safety, bio-terrorism and so forth. SIEGEL: There is a bill proposed in - at least proposed, I don't know if it was passed - in Wisconsin, you've told me in Kansas, as well, where if a veterinary student went into large-animal veterinary medicine, there would be a significant forgiveness of student loans. Dr. HAMMER: I'm more familiar with the Kansas bill than I am the Wisconsin one. It was one of the first that was passed. And what they have proposed and passed is a reduction in tuition by as much as half if that student will agree to, when they graduate from veterinary school, agree to go to a rural area and work in food supply and medicine. And I think it's going to definitely encourage students to go into that part of veterinary medicine we are having such an acute shortage in. SIEGEL: Well, Dr. Hammer, thank you very much for talking with us. Dr. HAMMER: Thank you very much. SIEGEL: That's Gregory Hammer, who is the newly elected president of the American Veterinary Medical Association.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  Is there an animal doctor in the house?

I'm Joe Palca. Ira Flatow is away. Coming up, we'll talk to a computer scientist who solved checkers. But first, a look at the genetics of disease. Just this week, new research links slight variations in people's DNA to possibility that they'll get diabetes, restless legs syndrome, or a rampant HIV infection. These new studies are something called genome-wide association studies. Scientists aren't looking for a particular gene, but for variations in nucleotides. You know, those are the single letters and the three billion letters of DNA that make up your genome. These variations are called SNPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms. And scientists are finding that some SNPs match up with diseases like cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Sometimes, SNPs are located in genes, but not always, raising interesting questions about the function of the DNA between genes. These newly discovered associations also makes scientists wonder whether we should keep better track of our SNPs, so that we know if we're more likely to get a disease. The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine is addressing some of the questions posed by this new research at their 48th Annual Short Course on Medical and Experimental Mammalian Genetics. And joining me from the Jackson Lab in Bar Harbor is David Valle, he is the director of the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine and professor of pediatrics, ophthalmology, and molecular biology and genetics, at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. David, welcome to the show. Dr. DAVID VALLE (Director, McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine; Professor, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine): Thank you, Joe. Welcome. PALCA: Boy, that's a lot of departments to have appointments in. Well, we'll talk about that. And also joining us from Bar Harbor is Lawrence Brody, he's a senior investigator at the National Human Genome Research Institute. Welcome. Dr. LAWRENCE BRODY (Senior Investigator, National Human Genome Research Institute): Hi, Joe. PALCA: And also, Aravinda Chakravarti, he's the director of the Center for Complex Disease Genomics at the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, and professor of medicine, pediatrics, molecular biology and genetics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. So we hope you'll join us this hour as we talk about these really remarkable new tools that have been brought to bear on genetics, and in truth, how the whole world of what we used to talk about in terms of the genetics of disease is shifting. So give us a call. Our number is 800-989-8255, that's 1-800-989-TALK. And if you want more information about what we'll be talking about this hour, go to our Web site at www. sciencefriday. com, where you'll find links to our topic. So, Aravinda, maybe I could start with you. I mean, I don't want to get too technical here, but what are these new studies about? Why is it important to look at these SNPs? Dr. ARAVINDA CHAKRAVARTI (Director, Center for Complex Disease Genomics, McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine): Well, we've known for quite a long time that genetic factors are important in probably each and every disease, and all of the evidence for this has existed for some time. The evidence has often been quite indirect. And we really come into a confluence of a number of, you know, different advancements. As many of your listeners would know, 2003 was the culmination of - the completion of the human genome and, in some sense, one phase of the Human Genome Project. Two years ago, many investigators around the world, including ourselves, participated in a map of genetic variations, the SNPs that you talked about. And the current stage is that we have over four million such identified positions in the DNA sequence, specific letters of the alphabet, that are different between different individuals. We know where they are, we don't know exactly what they all do, but at least we have a good accounting of their frequencies in different populations. The third thing that's really happened because of this is that many groups around the world, and clearly in the U. S. , that we have assembled fairly large cohorts of patients and appropriate control for these individuals who are free from disease. And so what we can now do is, based on these findings of genetic variations in the human sequence and by comparing these SNPs in very novel kinds of assays and technologies that could look at literally half a million such sites of the genome at any one time, in a large collections of patients and controls, that we can sift through the genomes, if you will, and identify specific sites that mark the genomes of those who have the particular illness. And in fact, these sites are quite different in frequency than those that have not. So what that allows to do, in some sense, you know, very much like panning for gold, is in one box, we can identify a collection of SNPs that give a profile of what the disease may look like, and in fact that profile is distinguished from the profile of those that are free from disease.  So SNPs have been tremendously useful and the technologies for looking at them are now sufficiently robust that we can do these studies in a compelling way. And once we have a finding, we have sufficient numbers of additional patients where we can replicate that finding and be sure that the finding is correct. And this summer has been really. . . PALCA: Well, it's. . . Dr. CHAKRAVARTI: Go ahead. PALCA: Oh, no, I'm just saying it's been stunning. There has been one or more studies a week. It's really been remarkable. Larry Brody, I just - before we get to you, I want to remind people that they're welcome to call with their questions at 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK. And Larry Brody, if I can turn to you for a second, I mean, you've worked in the genetics of breast cancer. How is this study of SNPs, these whole genome association studies, going to add to what we know about the genetics of breast cancer? Dr. BRODY: It already has, in the papers that came out just a couple of weeks ago, identified additional genes that are responsible for breast cancer, at least contribute to breast cancer risk. I think what's pretty important to emphasize is that breast cancer genetics that we learned about 10 years ago, that variants in BRCA1 and 2 gene are relatively potent risk factors and that they sometimes increase a woman's risk almost eight times for breast cancer. The new factors that we're just learning about over the next - over this summer and ongoing are relatively mild risk factors, that they just increase the risk a little bit. They still have major importance, because breast cancer is a disease, for the most part, that we don't understand the mechanism yet. And by using the clues from these genes that are showing up in these large single nucleotide polymorphism-type screening, we should be able to better understand what makes the breast cell become a cancer, so mechanism of the disease. PALCA: All right. Dr. BRODY: There're really two flavors of breast cancer gene now that the relatively strong risk factors that we knew about 10 years ago, and these new crop of genes that are coming out of these large genome-wide association studies. PALCA: Well, David Valle, maybe I can ask you. If these risk factors that are turning up with these whole genome association studies are, you know, relatively small compared to some of these other genes that have been discovered, why is there an importance here clinically? What's the value for a physician, let's say? Dr. VALLE: Well, I think that's a question that we are all very interested in thinking about and taking advantage of this new information. The risk of any one of these may be very small, and we're now in this phase where we have to investigate how we can combine these risks and look at several risk factors and see what happens for the - for a person in terms of combinations of risk factors, in terms of understanding the absolute risk for any given individual patient, which - for getting breast cancer. The second point builds on what Larry Brody just said and that is that even for these variants that identify a small risk, they also identify a particular biological system that may explain something about, in the case of breast cancer, the behavior of the breast cells and which cells - what happens to cells when they develop malignancy. So that they give us greater insights into the biology of the disease, and thereby this deeper understanding we hope will translate into better ways of prevention and or treatment. PALCA: Okay. We're talking with Larry Brody, David Valle and Aravinda Chakravarti, three genetics research scientists and also people with an interest in treatment. And we're interested in taking your calls at 800-989-8255. And let's take a call now from Tom(ph) in Boston. Tom, welcome to the program. TOM (Caller): Thank you for having me. I'm curious what the doctors see as - do they see additional roadblocks now, say a product comes out for, you know, purely looking at the gene, gene therapy type of thing, will the FDA be likely to draw things out, saying that we need further studies because now we have a more advanced outlook of the whole system, or will just-in-time therapies be still allowed for, like, terminal diseases. PALCA: Okay. That sounds interesting. And, David, maybe I can - David Valle, maybe you can address that? Dr. VALLE: Well, I think for many of the discoveries that are coming out right now, they are not - they have not identified - they will not lead immediately to the development of new therapy. And certainly they will not lead, I don't think, to new genes therapy. On the other hand, they open new areas of biology, and sometimes, one of the most immediate kinds of therapies, and we've seen this for other generic disorders, is that we may, by having a deeper appreciation of the biological basis, we may recognize that drugs that are already out on the market for some other purpose, already gone through the FDA process, may become applicable or useful or at least worth investigation in new disease - in different diseases that we didn't really realize that those drugs were appropriate for. PALCA: Mm-hmm. Larry Brody, I just wonder if I can ask you, is that a concern at all that people say, oh, I have this particular SNP and it's associated with breast cancer and I'm doomed. Are you worried that people are going to get the wrong message from these studies? Dr. BRODY: Well, I would be worried if we had a lot of information. At this point, we don't know how to employ these more mild risk factors in a way to have people either be worried or reassured. And we don't think it's necessarily time to start testing people, potentially left and right, for these variants. So there's potential outcomes of risk assessment if you find out you're not at risk and that should be a good thing, or could be a bad thing, because you'll take additional risk behaviors, or you could find out that you are at risk, and that could be a good thing in that you'd try to do risk reduction. Or you could think that you're doomed because of your gene and go on and do bad behaviors. And we don't know how people will deal with this information yet. So I think the real need here is to try to figure out how people process and handle this information. PALCA: Yeah. Sounds like some social science research lies ahead. Well, anyway, we have to take a short break, and we'll continue our discussion about these new whole genome-wide associations. We'd like to hear from you. Our number is 800-989-8255. Stay with us. We'll be back. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) PALCA: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca. We're talking this hour about the genetics of disease. My guests are Larry Brody, he's a senior investigator at the National Human Genome Research Institute, and David Valle and Aravinda Chakravarti, who are both at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine with many departmental affiliations so we'll just - we'll save those for the end and tell you about those later. But we'd also like to hear from you. We're talking about genetics. And our number is 800-989-8255. And let's take a call now from Gary(ph) in New Hampshire. Gary, welcome to the program. GARY (Caller): Hello. It's an honor to ask the question. Thank you very much. PALCA: Sure. GARY: My question is, currently there is an over-the-counter gene SNP testing kit that allows you to do a cotton swab within your cheeks of your mouth, and you send it back into the lab and it gives you a report back of possible predetermined diseases, anything from bone density issues to cardiovascular and such. And I'm wondering, if you've heard of those, and second, if you have, how accurate they could be? PALCA: Whoa. Where did you get this? Just in a drugstore, a grocery store? GARY: There are different doctors I've seen online advertise it on their Web site, also companies like nutrimetics. com. And I heard about this initially in a Newsweek article back, I apologize, I believe it's 2006. PALCA: All right. That's all right. Let me ask Aravinda Chakravarti, maybe you have some knowledge of this? Dr. CHAKRAVARTI: Yes. I mean, there are now actually a number of companies that are engaged in what's called direct-to-consumer, you know, advertising and testing for various kinds of genetic influences. Without getting into the details of any of these companies and the tests that they provide, I think it's fair to say that these are early days where any single such test may be unlikely to provide a significant benefit to any given individual. If you look at, you know, what's really known up until now, it's quite clear that for the major common disorders of our time that affect human beings all over the world, it's not any one genetic alteration, but rather numerous genetic alterations in many different diseases, or many different genes rather, together with specific environmental combinations that puts us at the ultimate risk that leads to the onset of a disease. We're in the beginning stages of understanding it. And there may come a point in time where specific testing would help, you know, vast numbers of people. At this point in time, genetic testing is best done in those few mutations and a limited number of diseases where the risks to specific individuals are actually fairly high. And the benefits of testing at this current time is really very much up in the air. But it's completely conceivable that some time in the future, we might be able to, you know, adjust somebody's both behavior and treatment, as well as management of an individual depending on their genetic profile. But we've got a lot of work to do, very interesting work, but a lot of work to do before we get there. PALCA: So Gary, it sounds to me as if there's quite a bit more work before you can be certain that you'll be getting some value from your expense of whatever they cost to do this. GARY: Sure. PALCA: So, Larry Brody, can I ask you? Did I characterize that correctly?  I mean, is there - is it worth buying these things yet? Dr. BRODY: I think as learning more information about yourself, you can't argue that we should prevent people from doing that. But as far as the conveyed benefit and what you should do based on your genotype, we don't have a lot of information about that. I additionally would worry about those - and again, without specifics - offering genetic testing that is linked to telling you subsequent products based on your genotype. We don't have enough evidence to know whether buying these products will improve your health or not. PALCA: Mm-hmm. Well, that is sort of the goal, I guess. Dr. BRODY: Yes. No, we would like to get there. PALCA: Yeah. Dr. VALLE: Joe, this is Dave Valle. If I could comment on one thing. PALCA: All right. Sure. Dr. VALLE: The one exception where the evidence is pretty clear is in certain areas of individual response to certain medicine, so called pharmacogenetics, where there the risks are sometimes quite major, and we know - physicians know of more than 20 different drugs in which there is individual variation in the ability to metabolize those drugs or respond to those drugs. And I think in those instances, that genetic information can be translated into how physicians manage individual patients. But I think rather than dealing with direct-to-consumer kinds of tests, the individual should discuss it with their physician. . . PALCA: Right. Dr. VALLE: . . . and ask about whether if they need that medicine, ask whether or not that testing is merited in their case. PALCA: Right. Right. I can see you'd get into trouble trying to manage all your over-the-counter medications with a bunch of tests for your genetic susceptibility to responding to aspirin or something like that. Dr. VALLE: Right. Absolutely. PALCA: Okay. Let's take another call now and go to Neal(ph) in Cleveland. Neal, welcome to the program. NEAL (Caller): Thanks. My question is, are there any examples of genes or SNPs identified by genome-wide association studies that have actually led to either effective drugs without terrible side effects, or have elucidated the disease pathogenesis in a given case. And the reason I ask is because in my field of histocompatibility, the association between a particular gene called B27, and a disease called ankylosing spondylitis, is much stronger than almost any of the associations being mentioned in this program. PALCA: Ah, you know, it's an interesting. . . NEAL: Can I add to that? PALCA: Yeah. Go ahead. NEAL: In spite of that, there isn't a single drug nor is there any complete consensus on the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis. And that association has been known since 1973. I think that helps to put. . . PALCA: Well, I - no, it's a fair question. NEAL: . . . these findings, as interesting as they are, into perspective. PALCA: Right. And - okay. Well, thanks Neal. David Valle, maybe you would like to comment on that. Dr. VALLE: Yeah. I would like to. Certainly I recognize the difficulty that people have had in getting to the bottom of ankylosing spondylitis. But there are now increasing examples of the kinds of insights and therapeutic implication from these SNPs, and I would mention two. The first is that the age-related macular degeneration, which I guess now - three years ago, we recognized Jacqueline Ho(ph) and her colleagues pointed out an association with a kind of innate immune - with a variant in an innate immune system called the complement system. And we now know that insight into the pathophysiology of age-related macular degeneration really has completely revised how we think about that disorder and opens the possibility for treating individuals at risk for age-related macular degeneration with anti-inflammatory agents and so forth. And then the second example is this very strong, variant TCF7L2, which is -increases risk for type 2 diabetes. And I think we're just hearing in the last week or two of papers coming out showing how patients with this genotype, depending on your genotype at this locus, not only increases your risk for diabetes but also your response to standard drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes, such as sulfonylurea. So I think those are two examples, one providing insight into pathophysiology and the other providing insight into treatment. PALCA: Right. So in other words, finding the association doesn't guarantee anything, but it certainly gives you some options for where to look. Dr. VALLE: Right. Dr. CHAKRAVARTI: Well, Joe, this organizes. . . PALCA: Go ahead, Aravinda. Dr. CHAKRAVARTI: I think it's fair to say, in almost every case where there are convincing results from genome-wide association studies, it is now leading down a path in understanding pathophysiology that, not that it was incorrect in the past, but it's clarified one of several directions that we could have taken, and that itself is of great importance. PALCA: All right. Dr. CHAKRAVARTI: Let me give you, sort of, two quick examples. PALCA: Okay. Dr. CHAKRAVARTI: The question of type 2 diabetes was brought up, and I think all of the recent studies in type 2 diabetes have, sort of, reemphasized the importance that many of the genetic variants involved in fact control into insulin secretion rather than, you know, peripheral resistance. So this is a very, very important idea that was suggested from early genetic studies of rarer forms of diabetes. And the fact that this is coming to prominence, in fact, leads us to investigate questions in that direction that frankly speaking, we had not done in the last decade. The second, I'd point at something from our own work. We've looked at many features of the EKG that, in fact, predispose some individuals to sudden cardiac death. And we've known for a long time many of the genes that are involved in rare forms of a sudden death syndrome. But many of those genes that were known that are in channels and drugs that are - ion channels, in fact, have proved largely ineffective, and in fact, have led to more side effects than any positive benefit in adult patients with sudden death. And now, genome-wide association studies have shown the importance of a completely new pathway. This is on nitric oxide signaling that in fact explains why previous treatments, in fact, have not proved any benefit and gives us new drugs and treatments and other directions to pursue that really, we couldn't have imagined. So the great excitement that you hear from many people about genome-wide association studies is giving us much more certain handle, and in fact, often multiple handles for a given disease as to what we should look for specifically. PALCA: Well, my next guest may have some insight to share with us just on that very topic. We've talking mostly about how these genome-wide association studies have mostly been applied to illnesses. But this week, for the first time, a study applies the methodology to infectious disease, in this case, HIV infection or AIDS. Tremendous variation exists between how people's bodies respond to HIV. This study out in the journal Science this week suggests that genetic variation plays a significant role in the ability of our immune system to fight the virus. Here to talk about that study is David Goldstein, a professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at the Institute for Genome Sciences and Policy at Duke University and the senior author on the paper. Welcome to the program. Dr. DAVID GOLDSTEIN (Professor of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Institute for Genome Sciences and Policy, Duke University): Thank you. PALCA: So which kind of - I mean, what were you looking to use these genome-association studies to predict about the course of HIV infection? Dr. GOLDSTEIN: Well, the starting point for our work was the well-known observation that individuals vary, as you were already saying just a moment ago, they vary importantly in their vulnerability to the virus that causes AIDS. Some individuals we know are largely resistant to becoming infected in the first place. And we understand some of that, but not all of it. And even for those individuals that do become infected, we know that the majority of them without treatment will eventually progress to AIDS. But it turns out that something like 10 percent of people that are infected, so far as we know, are, in fact, not bothered by the virus at all. They will not progress to AIDS. They are asymptomatic and in other words their immune systems are able to effectively control the virus. And what we set out to do is use the new technologies that you're discussing on this program to try to identify genetic correlates and hopefully ultimately information about the causes for why some individuals are able to control the virus that well. And ultimately the hope would be, that if you understood that better, you'd use that information to help other people to be able to control the virus better. PALCA: So, but you are looking at people who were infected, not just to -because I was wondering if you would compare these - the people we've been talking about, the scientists have been talking about, so far, had been people who are infected and people who are not infected, but your whole population are people who are infected. So you're not looking at people to see why some people get infected and others don't? Dr. GOLDSTEIN: That's exactly right. Our focus was on what happens after individuals become infected. So in a typical course, after infection, the virus will shoot up to a peak level. And after that point, a degree of immune control is established and the virus is pushed back down to a stable level that's maintained often for years, and that level is referred to as a set point for the virus. But that amount of virus during that period varies by a huge amount across individuals. So some individuals, if you look in a milliliter of their blood, they may have as many as a million copies of the virus, whereas other individuals may have only 50 or, in fact, undetectable levels. So that indicates tremendous variation in how well, without any treatment at all, the immune systems of individuals are able to control the virus right to the point that some individuals can control it effectively enough not to become sick. PALCA: Oh. We're talking with Dr. David Goldstein about his new paper in Science this week about how certain genetic variations predict or help predict whether or not someone will have a large infection with HIV or a relatively small one. I'm Joe Palca. And this TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. So is there, I mean, is there a simple answer that you can point to and say, aha, it's this? And if you've got this, you're in good shape, and if you don't, you don't? Dr. GOLDSTEIN: It's not one simple answer. But we've certainly taken a few steps towards understanding why some people can control the virus better. So we have found three genetic differences amongst people. One of them was one that was already known before, but we may have some new ideas about how it works. All together, these three genetic differences, if you consider them collectively, on average, make the difference between having something like 50,000 copies of the virus per milliliter of blood versus only 1,000. And they also make the difference between progressing to AIDS more rapidly or less rapidly. So this gives us some ability to predict who would progress more rapidly to AIDS, to predict who would control the virus better. But that really isn't the main importance of this sort of work, as you were discussing earlier. The main importance from these sorts of genetic studies is to provide pointers to a better understanding of what's going on in the body, and then to make use of that better understanding therapeutically. And so here, what we're excited about is that the genetic research has pointed towards new mechanisms that the body naturally uses to combat HIV. PALCA: All right. I mean, what's the next step? Now, that you've shown this, what specific thing do you do to follow this up? Dr. GOLDSTEIN: Well, one - there's a series of directions that we are now following. But one of them is that we've got a new pointer in terms of a vaccine strategy emerging from this work. So one of the ways that the immune system fights an infection like HIV is that the immune system successfully flags infected cells for destruction. And the way that it does that is by presenting bits of the invading infectious agent on the surface. And the genes that are responsible for encoding the machinery, that presents those foreign fragments - those genes can be interfered with by HIV. And the ones that were known previously to be important are known to be interfered with by HIV. In this study, we've implicated a new one that people did not know was important in the control of HIV. And what's critical here is that HIV doesn't appear to be able to do anything to it. PALCA: Right. Dr. GOLDSTEIN: So this suggests that a vaccine strategy that focused on this particular part of the immune system might prove more effective than ones that have been tried before. And so. . . PALCA: Okay. Well, I'm afraid, Dr. Goldstein, we're going to have to leave it there. We wish you luck. . . Dr. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. PALCA: . . . with the future of that vaccine strategy. And hopefully, we'll be able to ask you back when there's something to report on that. Dr. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you. PALCA: Dr. David Goldstein is a professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at the Institute for Genome Sciences and Policy at Duke University. Stay with us. We're talking with some geneticists who are at the Jackson Lab this week, and we're talking about whole genome-wide association studies. And we'll be back to talk some more of that in just a minute, so stick around. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) PALCA: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca. Coming up, we'll be talking about checkers. Yes, you can finally guarantee yourself not to be able to beat a computer at checkers. But we will talk about that in just a minute. Right now, we're talking about the genetics of disease. And my guests are Larry Brody, he's a senior investigator at the National Human Genome Research Institute. David Valle, he's the director of the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine and Aravinda Chakravarti, he is also at the Institute of Genetic Medicine, and they're both at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. And I'd like to go back to the phones now and get some more questions on that. So let's go to Jim(ph) in Chicago. Jim, welcome to the program. JIM (Caller): Hi. Thanks. PALCA: Sure. JIM: I know all these guys' work and that it's really wonderful. But I do and write about nutritional genomics, so the question is, we know that diet and lifestyle are going to affect disease incidence, and yet the genome-wide association studies typically don't assess that. And I'm wondering whether you guys can give us an idea of, if you were to put that data in, to assess it accurately, what the risk factors might do? And then, a related one has to do with the populations you look at. And I looked very carefully at the diabetes papers that came out in Science about, in May, all of those were done in European ancestry or people who were at European ancestors. So the question is, do you expect to find the same set in other ancestral groups? PALCA: Well, that's a good question. Jim, thanks. Aravinda, maybe we could start with the ancestral question. I mean, are we explaining things for rich, white people again or have we got a more diversified genetic population to do these studies on? Dr. CHAKRAVARTI: Yeah. So Jim's question, in fact, on both counts are quite pertinent. I think the studies that have gone on have largely just taken use of many of the cohorts that really do exist, and there's no doubt that the vast majority of the cohorts are with individuals of European descent. That is not to say that at least one other major group have not been studied, and these are African-Americans. And I largely am aware of what's going on within the U. S. , where - a number of studies and primarily, say, on the cardiovascular disease arena, but also, say, for age-related macular degeneration that was talked about and for diabetes, that these kinds of same genetic variants are being looked at, as well as completely independent screens to see whether there are other new genes that can be identified with these groups. And there's -undoubtedly, there will be both, you know, some reemphasis of the genes that we found as well as many new genes. One of the aspects that this brings up - and in fact, there's a lot of work going on - is to take into account the fact that individuals who are of African descent essentially arise from a population that is much, much older than other human populations in the world. And so they have much more genetic variation, and the sampling of the genetic variation that we've done, even for people of African descent, in fact, is much more limiting compared to the total amount of variation that they have. So the two things are going on, of everything that we know to try and test in the groups that we have samples on, as well as trying to increase the repertoire of variations that we can study in African-American groups. And this is going on as we speak. And I am quite convinced that the early studies show that for some of these genes, the same genes have an effect and that'll be different effect in African-Americans. But for many of them, that they don't have an effect, and we have to increase this variation aspect. One quick example, and this really relates to prostate cancer, where there is absolutely no doubt that some of the genetic variants that have been found explained the high risk of prostate cancer at least in African-American studies that have been done. PALCA: Okay. Dr. BRODY: Can I just jump in? PALCA: Is that David? Dr. BRODY: This is Larry. PALCA: Larry. Larry Brody, go ahead. Dr. BRODY: I think Jim probably knows this, but your listener should understand that these variants that we find associated with risk, that the actual variants are present in all population. There are very few variants out of the millions in the genome that are only found in one population. So Jim's question is somewhat nuanced, as to whether they have the same risk in a different population. But the variants will be present across the world. PALCA: Larry Brody, I wonder if I could just ask you now, since we seem to be at this point. You are working on a project called the multiplex initiative that's trying to weigh the advantages of personalized risk assessment. How is that going to work? Dr. BRODY: So these projects that we're doing - it's a collaboration between my group and Colleen McBride's group of behavioral scientists - really is to get at some of the very, very early questions about what happens when you give people personalized risk assessment. It's not a study that has enough individuals to decide whether it helps them prevent disease and whether they're healthier in the long run. It's really a study on how to start delivering this information. And we're enrolling and we'll start returning information in the next couple of weeks, select individuals of who are in Detroit and members of the Henry Ford Health System, it's the third collaborator in this project. But it really is a study aimed to answer questions about how to deliver this information, whether people find it useful, what they do with it. We need to do many, many more studies going forward to figure out whether or not knowing your personal risk variant will actually improve your health. And that's going to take a long time. So we're just taking some small steps forward in this current study that we mentioned for the multiplex study. PALCA: Okay. David Valle, I'm going to give you the last word on this segment. And the question I want to ask you is: these papers, these whole genome-wide association studies are coming out, you know, at a furious rate. Are scientists really as excited as all that? Or - I know that my editors are already beginning to roll their eyes, it's one a week or two a week or three a week. I can't get anybody to, you know, want to talk about these anymore. Is it too much for the scientists, too? Or is it just a bonanza? Dr. VALLE: No. I definitely think it's a bonanza. We are very excited. We're here at the Jackson Labs having this 48th Annual Short Course, as you said, and I can tell you that we're packed to the overflow with students. And the students and the professors alike are super excited about this work that's going on. And as I sit here looking out over the spruce forest and hearing about this, if I could sort of encapsulate it for the listeners, it's as if biomedical research has been going down a particular path, focused in on some disease, and we follow this path and - but we get, sort of, committed to one particular path. And these studies provide a new strategy that looks over the whole forest. And all of a sudden they say, oh, here's another path over here that's actually much more direct and much more effective. And so we're sort of taking this broad view and finding new insights into disease that have tremendous promise for both understanding the disease, developing therapies, and ultimately we hope helping people, inform people about their individualized risk, so that they can - instead of giving them average risks, we give them individualized risks and they can take advantage of this and improve their health. PALCA: Okay. Well, I guess the trick will be not to get lost as you go down these new paths. Dr. VALLE: Right. PALCA: But I'll count on you to do that. Dr. VALLE: Okay. PALCA: Right. I'd like to thank my guests, Lawrence Brody. Well, that was David Valle you were just hearing from. He's the director of McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine and professor of pediatrics, ophthalmology, and molecular biology and genetics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. We also spoke with Larry Brody. He's a senior investigator at the National Human Genome Research Institute. And Aravinda Chakravarti, director of the Center for Complex Disease Genomics at the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine and professor of medicine, pediatrics, molecular biology and genetics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Thanks to you all.  JOE PALCA, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Joe Palca. Ira Flatow is away. Coming up, we'll talk to a computer scientist who solved checkers. But first, a look at the genetics of disease. Just this week, new research links slight variations in people's DNA to possibility that they'll get diabetes, restless legs syndrome, or a rampant HIV infection.  These new studies are something called genome-wide association studies. Scientists aren't looking for a particular gene, but for variations in nucleotides. You know, those are the single letters and the three billion letters of DNA that make up your genome. These variations are called SNPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms. And scientists are finding that some SNPs match up with diseases like cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Sometimes, SNPs are located in genes, but not always, raising interesting questions about the function of the DNA between genes. These newly discovered associations also makes scientists wonder whether we should keep better track of our SNPs, so that we know if we're more likely to get a disease.  The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine is addressing some of the questions posed by this new research at their 48th Annual Short Course on Medical and Experimental Mammalian Genetics. And joining me from the Jackson Lab in Bar Harbor is David Valle, he is the director of the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine and professor of pediatrics, ophthalmology, and molecular biology and genetics, at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. David, welcome to the show.  Dr. DAVID VALLE (Director, McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine; Professor, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine): Thank you, Joe. Welcome.  PALCA: Boy, that's a lot of departments to have appointments in. Well, we'll talk about that. And also joining us from Bar Harbor is Lawrence Brody, he's a senior investigator at the National Human Genome Research Institute. Welcome.  Dr. LAWRENCE BRODY (Senior Investigator, National Human Genome Research Institute): Hi, Joe.  PALCA: And also, Aravinda Chakravarti, he's the director of the Center for Complex Disease Genomics at the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, and professor of medicine, pediatrics, molecular biology and genetics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  So we hope you'll join us this hour as we talk about these really remarkable new tools that have been brought to bear on genetics, and in truth, how the whole world of what we used to talk about in terms of the genetics of disease is shifting. So give us a call. Our number is 800-989-8255, that's 1-800-989-TALK. And if you want more information about what we'll be talking about this hour, go to our Web site at www. sciencefriday. com, where you'll find links to our topic.  So, Aravinda, maybe I could start with you. I mean, I don't want to get too technical here, but what are these new studies about? Why is it important to look at these SNPs?  Dr. ARAVINDA CHAKRAVARTI (Director, Center for Complex Disease Genomics, McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine): Well, we've known for quite a long time that genetic factors are important in probably each and every disease, and all of the evidence for this has existed for some time. The evidence has often been quite indirect.  And we really come into a confluence of a number of, you know, different advancements. As many of your listeners would know, 2003 was the culmination of - the completion of the human genome and, in some sense, one phase of the Human Genome Project. Two years ago, many investigators around the world, including ourselves, participated in a map of genetic variations, the SNPs that you talked about. And the current stage is that we have over four million such identified positions in the DNA sequence, specific letters of the alphabet, that are different between different individuals. We know where they are, we don't know exactly what they all do, but at least we have a good accounting of their frequencies in different populations.  The third thing that's really happened because of this is that many groups around the world, and clearly in the U. S. , that we have assembled fairly large cohorts of patients and appropriate control for these individuals who are free from disease. And so what we can now do is, based on these findings of genetic variations in the human sequence and by comparing these SNPs in very novel kinds of assays and technologies that could look at literally half a million such sites of the genome at any one time, in a large collections of patients and controls, that we can sift through the genomes, if you will, and identify specific sites that mark the genomes of those who have the particular illness. And in fact, these sites are quite different in frequency than those that have not.  So what that allows to do, in some sense, you know, very much like panning for gold, is in one box, we can identify a collection of SNPs that give a profile of what the disease may look like, and in fact that profile is distinguished from the profile of those that are free from disease.  So SNPs have been tremendously useful and the technologies for looking at them are now sufficiently robust that we can do these studies in a compelling way. And once we have a finding, we have sufficient numbers of additional patients where we can replicate that finding and be sure that the finding is correct. And this summer has been really. . .  PALCA: Well, it's. . .  Dr. CHAKRAVARTI: Go ahead.  PALCA: Oh, no, I'm just saying it's been stunning. There has been one or more studies a week. It's really been remarkable. Larry Brody, I just - before we get to you, I want to remind people that they're welcome to call with their questions at 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK. And Larry Brody, if I can turn to you for a second, I mean, you've worked in the genetics of breast cancer. How is this study of SNPs, these whole genome association studies, going to add to what we know about the genetics of breast cancer?  Dr. BRODY: It already has, in the papers that came out just a couple of weeks ago, identified additional genes that are responsible for breast cancer, at least contribute to breast cancer risk. I think what's pretty important to emphasize is that breast cancer genetics that we learned about 10 years ago, that variants in BRCA1 and 2 gene are relatively potent risk factors and that they sometimes increase a woman's risk almost eight times for breast cancer.  The new factors that we're just learning about over the next - over this summer and ongoing are relatively mild risk factors, that they just increase the risk a little bit. They still have major importance, because breast cancer is a disease, for the most part, that we don't understand the mechanism yet. And by using the clues from these genes that are showing up in these large single nucleotide polymorphism-type screening, we should be able to better understand what makes the breast cell become a cancer, so mechanism of the disease.  PALCA: All right.  Dr. BRODY: There're really two flavors of breast cancer gene now that the relatively strong risk factors that we knew about 10 years ago, and these new crop of genes that are coming out of these large genome-wide association studies.  PALCA: Well, David Valle, maybe I can ask you. If these risk factors that are turning up with these whole genome association studies are, you know, relatively small compared to some of these other genes that have been discovered, why is there an importance here clinically? What's the value for a physician, let's say?  Dr. VALLE: Well, I think that's a question that we are all very interested in thinking about and taking advantage of this new information. The risk of any one of these may be very small, and we're now in this phase where we have to investigate how we can combine these risks and look at several risk factors and see what happens for the - for a person in terms of combinations of risk factors, in terms of understanding the absolute risk for any given individual patient, which - for getting breast cancer. The second point builds on what Larry Brody just said and that is that even for these variants that identify a small risk, they also identify a particular biological system that may explain something about, in the case of breast cancer, the behavior of the breast cells and which cells - what happens to cells when they develop malignancy. So that they give us greater insights into the biology of the disease, and thereby this deeper understanding we hope will translate into better ways of prevention and or treatment.  PALCA: Okay. We're talking with Larry Brody, David Valle and Aravinda Chakravarti, three genetics research scientists and also people with an interest in treatment. And we're interested in taking your calls at 800-989-8255.  And let's take a call now from Tom(ph) in Boston. Tom, welcome to the program.  TOM (Caller): Thank you for having me. I'm curious what the doctors see as - do they see additional roadblocks now, say a product comes out for, you know, purely looking at the gene, gene therapy type of thing, will the FDA be likely to draw things out, saying that we need further studies because now we have a more advanced outlook of the whole system, or will just-in-time therapies be still allowed for, like, terminal diseases.  PALCA: Okay. That sounds interesting. And, David, maybe I can - David Valle, maybe you can address that?  Dr. VALLE: Well, I think for many of the discoveries that are coming out right now, they are not - they have not identified - they will not lead immediately to the development of new therapy. And certainly they will not lead, I don't think, to new genes therapy. On the other hand, they open new areas of biology, and sometimes, one of the most immediate kinds of therapies, and we've seen this for other generic disorders, is that we may, by having a deeper appreciation of the biological basis, we may recognize that drugs that are already out on the market for some other purpose, already gone through the FDA process, may become applicable or useful or at least worth investigation in new disease - in different diseases that we didn't really realize that those drugs were appropriate for.  PALCA: Mm-hmm. Larry Brody, I just wonder if I can ask you, is that a concern at all that people say, oh, I have this particular SNP and it's associated with breast cancer and I'm doomed. Are you worried that people are going to get the wrong message from these studies?  Dr. BRODY: Well, I would be worried if we had a lot of information. At this point, we don't know how to employ these more mild risk factors in a way to have people either be worried or reassured. And we don't think it's necessarily time to start testing people, potentially left and right, for these variants. So there's potential outcomes of risk assessment if you find out you're not at risk and that should be a good thing, or could be a bad thing, because you'll take additional risk behaviors, or you could find out that you are at risk, and that could be a good thing in that you'd try to do risk reduction. Or you could think that you're doomed because of your gene and go on and do bad behaviors. And we don't know how people will deal with this information yet. So I think the real need here is to try to figure out how people process and handle this information.  PALCA: Yeah. Sounds like some social science research lies ahead.  Well, anyway, we have to take a short break, and we'll continue our discussion about these new whole genome-wide associations. We'd like to hear from you. Our number is 800-989-8255.  Stay with us. We'll be back.  This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  PALCA: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca.  We're talking this hour about the genetics of disease. My guests are Larry Brody, he's a senior investigator at the National Human Genome Research Institute, and David Valle and Aravinda Chakravarti, who are both at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine with many departmental affiliations so we'll just - we'll save those for the end and tell you about those later.  But we'd also like to hear from you. We're talking about genetics. And our number is 800-989-8255.  And let's take a call now from Gary(ph) in New Hampshire. Gary, welcome to the program.  GARY (Caller): Hello. It's an honor to ask the question. Thank you very much.  PALCA: Sure.  GARY: My question is, currently there is an over-the-counter gene SNP testing kit that allows you to do a cotton swab within your cheeks of your mouth, and you send it back into the lab and it gives you a report back of possible predetermined diseases, anything from bone density issues to cardiovascular and such. And I'm wondering, if you've heard of those, and second, if you have, how accurate they could be?  PALCA: Whoa. Where did you get this? Just in a drugstore, a grocery store?  GARY: There are different doctors I've seen online advertise it on their Web site, also companies like nutrimetics. com. And I heard about this initially in a Newsweek article back, I apologize, I believe it's 2006.  PALCA: All right. That's all right. Let me ask Aravinda Chakravarti, maybe you have some knowledge of this?  Dr. CHAKRAVARTI: Yes. I mean, there are now actually a number of companies that are engaged in what's called direct-to-consumer, you know, advertising and testing for various kinds of genetic influences. Without getting into the details of any of these companies and the tests that they provide, I think it's fair to say that these are early days where any single such test may be unlikely to provide a significant benefit to any given individual.  If you look at, you know, what's really known up until now, it's quite clear that for the major common disorders of our time that affect human beings all over the world, it's not any one genetic alteration, but rather numerous genetic alterations in many different diseases, or many different genes rather, together with specific environmental combinations that puts us at the ultimate risk that leads to the onset of a disease.  We're in the beginning stages of understanding it. And there may come a point in time where specific testing would help, you know, vast numbers of people. At this point in time, genetic testing is best done in those few mutations and a limited number of diseases where the risks to specific individuals are actually fairly high. And the benefits of testing at this current time is really very much up in the air.  But it's completely conceivable that some time in the future, we might be able to, you know, adjust somebody's both behavior and treatment, as well as management of an individual depending on their genetic profile. But we've got a lot of work to do, very interesting work, but a lot of work to do before we get there.  PALCA: So Gary, it sounds to me as if there's quite a bit more work before you can be certain that you'll be getting some value from your expense of whatever they cost to do this.  GARY: Sure.  PALCA: So, Larry Brody, can I ask you? Did I characterize that correctly?  I mean, is there - is it worth buying these things yet?  Dr. BRODY: I think as learning more information about yourself, you can't argue that we should prevent people from doing that. But as far as the conveyed benefit and what you should do based on your genotype, we don't have a lot of information about that. I additionally would worry about those - and again, without specifics - offering genetic testing that is linked to telling you subsequent products based on your genotype. We don't have enough evidence to know whether buying these products will improve your health or not.  PALCA: Mm-hmm. Well, that is sort of the goal, I guess.  Dr. BRODY: Yes. No, we would like to get there.  PALCA: Yeah.  Dr. VALLE: Joe, this is Dave Valle. If I could comment on one thing.  PALCA: All right. Sure.  Dr. VALLE: The one exception where the evidence is pretty clear is in certain areas of individual response to certain medicine, so called pharmacogenetics, where there the risks are sometimes quite major, and we know - physicians know of more than 20 different drugs in which there is individual variation in the ability to metabolize those drugs or respond to those drugs. And I think in those instances, that genetic information can be translated into how physicians manage individual patients. But I think rather than dealing with direct-to-consumer kinds of tests, the individual should discuss it with their physician. . .  PALCA: Right.  Dr. VALLE: . . . and ask about whether if they need that medicine, ask whether or not that testing is merited in their case.  PALCA: Right. Right. I can see you'd get into trouble trying to manage all your over-the-counter medications with a bunch of tests for your genetic susceptibility to responding to aspirin or something like that.  Dr. VALLE: Right. Absolutely.  PALCA: Okay. Let's take another call now and go to Neal(ph) in Cleveland. Neal, welcome to the program.  NEAL (Caller): Thanks. My question is, are there any examples of genes or SNPs identified by genome-wide association studies that have actually led to either effective drugs without terrible side effects, or have elucidated the disease pathogenesis in a given case. And the reason I ask is because in my field of histocompatibility, the association between a particular gene called B27, and a disease called ankylosing spondylitis, is much stronger than almost any of the associations being mentioned in this program.  PALCA: Ah, you know, it's an interesting. . .  NEAL: Can I add to that?  PALCA: Yeah. Go ahead.  NEAL: In spite of that, there isn't a single drug nor is there any complete consensus on the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis. And that association has been known since 1973. I think that helps to put. . .  PALCA: Well, I - no, it's a fair question.  NEAL: . . . these findings, as interesting as they are, into perspective.  PALCA: Right. And - okay. Well, thanks Neal.  David Valle, maybe you would like to comment on that.  Dr. VALLE: Yeah. I would like to. Certainly I recognize the difficulty that people have had in getting to the bottom of ankylosing spondylitis. But there are now increasing examples of the kinds of insights and therapeutic implication from these SNPs, and I would mention two. The first is that the age-related macular degeneration, which I guess now - three years ago, we recognized Jacqueline Ho(ph) and her colleagues pointed out an association with a kind of innate immune - with a variant in an innate immune system called the complement system. And we now know that insight into the pathophysiology of age-related macular degeneration really has completely revised how we think about that disorder and opens the possibility for treating individuals at risk for age-related macular degeneration with anti-inflammatory agents and so forth.  And then the second example is this very strong, variant TCF7L2, which is -increases risk for type 2 diabetes. And I think we're just hearing in the last week or two of papers coming out showing how patients with this genotype, depending on your genotype at this locus, not only increases your risk for diabetes but also your response to standard drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes, such as sulfonylurea. So I think those are two examples, one providing insight into pathophysiology and the other providing insight into treatment.  PALCA: Right. So in other words, finding the association doesn't guarantee anything, but it certainly gives you some options for where to look.  Dr. VALLE: Right.  Dr. CHAKRAVARTI: Well, Joe, this organizes. . .  PALCA: Go ahead, Aravinda.  Dr. CHAKRAVARTI: I think it's fair to say, in almost every case where there are convincing results from genome-wide association studies, it is now leading down a path in understanding pathophysiology that, not that it was incorrect in the past, but it's clarified one of several directions that we could have taken, and that itself is of great importance.  PALCA: All right.  Dr. CHAKRAVARTI: Let me give you, sort of, two quick examples.  PALCA: Okay.  Dr. CHAKRAVARTI: The question of type 2 diabetes was brought up, and I think all of the recent studies in type 2 diabetes have, sort of, reemphasized the importance that many of the genetic variants involved in fact control into insulin secretion rather than, you know, peripheral resistance. So this is a very, very important idea that was suggested from early genetic studies of rarer forms of diabetes. And the fact that this is coming to prominence, in fact, leads us to investigate questions in that direction that frankly speaking, we had not done in the last decade.  The second, I'd point at something from our own work. We've looked at many features of the EKG that, in fact, predispose some individuals to sudden cardiac death. And we've known for a long time many of the genes that are involved in rare forms of a sudden death syndrome. But many of those genes that were known that are in channels and drugs that are - ion channels, in fact, have proved largely ineffective, and in fact, have led to more side effects than any positive benefit in adult patients with sudden death. And now, genome-wide association studies have shown the importance of a completely new pathway. This is on nitric oxide signaling that in fact explains why previous treatments, in fact, have not proved any benefit and gives us new drugs and treatments and other directions to pursue that really, we couldn't have imagined.  So the great excitement that you hear from many people about genome-wide association studies is giving us much more certain handle, and in fact, often multiple handles for a given disease as to what we should look for specifically.  PALCA: Well, my next guest may have some insight to share with us just on that very topic. We've talking mostly about how these genome-wide association studies have mostly been applied to illnesses.  But this week, for the first time, a study applies the methodology to infectious disease, in this case, HIV infection or AIDS. Tremendous variation exists between how people's bodies respond to HIV. This study out in the journal Science this week suggests that genetic variation plays a significant role in the ability of our immune system to fight the virus.  Here to talk about that study is David Goldstein, a professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at the Institute for Genome Sciences and Policy at Duke University and the senior author on the paper. Welcome to the program.  Dr. DAVID GOLDSTEIN (Professor of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Institute for Genome Sciences and Policy, Duke University): Thank you.  PALCA: So which kind of - I mean, what were you looking to use these genome-association studies to predict about the course of HIV infection?  Dr. GOLDSTEIN: Well, the starting point for our work was the well-known observation that individuals vary, as you were already saying just a moment ago, they vary importantly in their vulnerability to the virus that causes AIDS. Some individuals we know are largely resistant to becoming infected in the first place. And we understand some of that, but not all of it. And even for those individuals that do become infected, we know that the majority of them without treatment will eventually progress to AIDS. But it turns out that something like 10 percent of people that are infected, so far as we know, are, in fact, not bothered by the virus at all. They will not progress to AIDS. They are asymptomatic and in other words their immune systems are able to effectively control the virus.  And what we set out to do is use the new technologies that you're discussing on this program to try to identify genetic correlates and hopefully ultimately information about the causes for why some individuals are able to control the virus that well. And ultimately the hope would be, that if you understood that better, you'd use that information to help other people to be able to control the virus better.  PALCA: So, but you are looking at people who were infected, not just to -because I was wondering if you would compare these - the people we've been talking about, the scientists have been talking about, so far, had been people who are infected and people who are not infected, but your whole population are people who are infected. So you're not looking at people to see why some people get infected and others don't?  Dr. GOLDSTEIN: That's exactly right. Our focus was on what happens after individuals become infected. So in a typical course, after infection, the virus will shoot up to a peak level. And after that point, a degree of immune control is established and the virus is pushed back down to a stable level that's maintained often for years, and that level is referred to as a set point for the virus. But that amount of virus during that period varies by a huge amount across individuals. So some individuals, if you look in a milliliter of their blood, they may have as many as a million copies of the virus, whereas other individuals may have only 50 or, in fact, undetectable levels. So that indicates tremendous variation in how well, without any treatment at all, the immune systems of individuals are able to control the virus right to the point that some individuals can control it effectively enough not to become sick.  PALCA: Oh. We're talking with Dr. David Goldstein about his new paper in Science this week about how certain genetic variations predict or help predict whether or not someone will have a large infection with HIV or a relatively small one.  I'm Joe Palca. And this TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  So is there, I mean, is there a simple answer that you can point to and say, aha, it's this? And if you've got this, you're in good shape, and if you don't, you don't?  Dr. GOLDSTEIN: It's not one simple answer. But we've certainly taken a few steps towards understanding why some people can control the virus better. So we have found three genetic differences amongst people. One of them was one that was already known before, but we may have some new ideas about how it works. All together, these three genetic differences, if you consider them collectively, on average, make the difference between having something like 50,000 copies of the virus per milliliter of blood versus only 1,000. And they also make the difference between progressing to AIDS more rapidly or less rapidly. So this gives us some ability to predict who would progress more rapidly to AIDS, to predict who would control the virus better.  But that really isn't the main importance of this sort of work, as you were discussing earlier. The main importance from these sorts of genetic studies is to provide pointers to a better understanding of what's going on in the body, and then to make use of that better understanding therapeutically. And so here, what we're excited about is that the genetic research has pointed towards new mechanisms that the body naturally uses to combat HIV.  PALCA: All right. I mean, what's the next step? Now, that you've shown this, what specific thing do you do to follow this up?  Dr. GOLDSTEIN: Well, one - there's a series of directions that we are now following. But one of them is that we've got a new pointer in terms of a vaccine strategy emerging from this work. So one of the ways that the immune system fights an infection like HIV is that the immune system successfully flags infected cells for destruction. And the way that it does that is by presenting bits of the invading infectious agent on the surface. And the genes that are responsible for encoding the machinery, that presents those foreign fragments - those genes can be interfered with by HIV. And the ones that were known previously to be important are known to be interfered with by HIV.  In this study, we've implicated a new one that people did not know was important in the control of HIV. And what's critical here is that HIV doesn't appear to be able to do anything to it.  PALCA: Right.  Dr. GOLDSTEIN: So this suggests that a vaccine strategy that focused on this particular part of the immune system might prove more effective than ones that have been tried before. And so. . .  PALCA: Okay. Well, I'm afraid, Dr. Goldstein, we're going to have to leave it there. We wish you luck. . .  Dr. GOLDSTEIN: Okay.  PALCA: . . . with the future of that vaccine strategy. And hopefully, we'll be able to ask you back when there's something to report on that.  Dr. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you.  PALCA: Dr. David Goldstein is a professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at the Institute for Genome Sciences and Policy at Duke University. Stay with us. We're talking with some geneticists who are at the Jackson Lab this week, and we're talking about whole genome-wide association studies. And we'll be back to talk some more of that in just a minute, so stick around.  This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  PALCA: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca.  Coming up, we'll be talking about checkers. Yes, you can finally guarantee yourself not to be able to beat a computer at checkers. But we will talk about that in just a minute.  Right now, we're talking about the genetics of disease. And my guests are Larry Brody, he's a senior investigator at the National Human Genome Research Institute. David Valle, he's the director of the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine and Aravinda Chakravarti, he is also at the Institute of Genetic Medicine, and they're both at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  And I'd like to go back to the phones now and get some more questions on that. So let's go to Jim(ph) in Chicago. Jim, welcome to the program.  JIM (Caller): Hi. Thanks.  PALCA: Sure.  JIM: I know all these guys' work and that it's really wonderful. But I do and write about nutritional genomics, so the question is, we know that diet and lifestyle are going to affect disease incidence, and yet the genome-wide association studies typically don't assess that. And I'm wondering whether you guys can give us an idea of, if you were to put that data in, to assess it accurately, what the risk factors might do? And then, a related one has to do with the populations you look at. And I looked very carefully at the diabetes papers that came out in Science about, in May, all of those were done in European ancestry or people who were at European ancestors. So the question is, do you expect to find the same set in other ancestral groups?  PALCA: Well, that's a good question. Jim, thanks. Aravinda, maybe we could start with the ancestral question. I mean, are we explaining things for rich, white people again or have we got a more diversified genetic population to do these studies on?  Dr. CHAKRAVARTI: Yeah. So Jim's question, in fact, on both counts are quite pertinent. I think the studies that have gone on have largely just taken use of many of the cohorts that really do exist, and there's no doubt that the vast majority of the cohorts are with individuals of European descent. That is not to say that at least one other major group have not been studied, and these are African-Americans. And I largely am aware of what's going on within the U. S. , where - a number of studies and primarily, say, on the cardiovascular disease arena, but also, say, for age-related macular degeneration that was talked about and for diabetes, that these kinds of same genetic variants are being looked at, as well as completely independent screens to see whether there are other new genes that can be identified with these groups. And there's -undoubtedly, there will be both, you know, some reemphasis of the genes that we found as well as many new genes.  One of the aspects that this brings up - and in fact, there's a lot of work going on - is to take into account the fact that individuals who are of African descent essentially arise from a population that is much, much older than other human populations in the world. And so they have much more genetic variation, and the sampling of the genetic variation that we've done, even for people of African descent, in fact, is much more limiting compared to the total amount of variation that they have.  So the two things are going on, of everything that we know to try and test in the groups that we have samples on, as well as trying to increase the repertoire of variations that we can study in African-American groups. And this is going on as we speak. And I am quite convinced that the early studies show that for some of these genes, the same genes have an effect and that'll be different effect in African-Americans. But for many of them, that they don't have an effect, and we have to increase this variation aspect. One quick example, and this really relates to prostate cancer, where there is absolutely no doubt that some of the genetic variants that have been found explained the high risk of prostate cancer at least in African-American studies that have been done.  PALCA: Okay.  Dr. BRODY: Can I just jump in?  PALCA: Is that David?  Dr. BRODY: This is Larry.  PALCA: Larry. Larry Brody, go ahead.  Dr. BRODY: I think Jim probably knows this, but your listener should understand that these variants that we find associated with risk, that the actual variants are present in all population. There are very few variants out of the millions in the genome that are only found in one population. So Jim's question is somewhat nuanced, as to whether they have the same risk in a different population. But the variants will be present across the world.  PALCA: Larry Brody, I wonder if I could just ask you now, since we seem to be at this point. You are working on a project called the multiplex initiative that's trying to weigh the advantages of personalized risk assessment. How is that going to work?  Dr. BRODY: So these projects that we're doing - it's a collaboration between my group and Colleen McBride's group of behavioral scientists - really is to get at some of the very, very early questions about what happens when you give people personalized risk assessment. It's not a study that has enough individuals to decide whether it helps them prevent disease and whether they're healthier in the long run.  It's really a study on how to start delivering this information. And we're enrolling and we'll start returning information in the next couple of weeks, select individuals of who are in Detroit and members of the Henry Ford Health System, it's the third collaborator in this project. But it really is a study aimed to answer questions about how to deliver this information, whether people find it useful, what they do with it. We need to do many, many more studies going forward to figure out whether or not knowing your personal risk variant will actually improve your health. And that's going to take a long time. So we're just taking some small steps forward in this current study that we mentioned for the multiplex study.  PALCA: Okay. David Valle, I'm going to give you the last word on this segment. And the question I want to ask you is: these papers, these whole genome-wide association studies are coming out, you know, at a furious rate. Are scientists really as excited as all that? Or - I know that my editors are already beginning to roll their eyes, it's one a week or two a week or three a week. I can't get anybody to, you know, want to talk about these anymore. Is it too much for the scientists, too? Or is it just a bonanza?  Dr. VALLE: No. I definitely think it's a bonanza. We are very excited. We're here at the Jackson Labs having this 48th Annual Short Course, as you said, and I can tell you that we're packed to the overflow with students. And the students and the professors alike are super excited about this work that's going on. And as I sit here looking out over the spruce forest and hearing about this, if I could sort of encapsulate it for the listeners, it's as if biomedical research has been going down a particular path, focused in on some disease, and we follow this path and - but we get, sort of, committed to one particular path.  And these studies provide a new strategy that looks over the whole forest. And all of a sudden they say, oh, here's another path over here that's actually much more direct and much more effective. And so we're sort of taking this broad view and finding new insights into disease that have tremendous promise for both understanding the disease, developing therapies, and ultimately we hope helping people, inform people about their individualized risk, so that they can - instead of giving them average risks, we give them individualized risks and they can take advantage of this and improve their health.  PALCA: Okay. Well, I guess the trick will be not to get lost as you go down these new paths.  Dr. VALLE: Right.  PALCA: But I'll count on you to do that.  Dr. VALLE: Okay.  PALCA: Right. I'd like to thank my guests, Lawrence Brody. Well, that was David Valle you were just hearing from. He's the director of McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine and professor of pediatrics, ophthalmology, and molecular biology and genetics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. We also spoke with Larry Brody. He's a senior investigator at the National Human Genome Research Institute. And Aravinda Chakravarti, director of the Center for Complex Disease Genomics at the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine and professor of medicine, pediatrics, molecular biology and genetics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

I'm Lynn Neary in Washington. Neal Conan is away. Some 100,000 Americans undergo electroconvulsive therapy every year. In the treatment, psychiatrists use a controlled electrical current to induce small seizures in the brain. Though no one knows exactly how it works, it is effective for many patients - and in many cases - where prescription drugs have not helped. Critics of the procedure say that electroconvulsive therapy has been overprescribed, the doctors have underplayed the risk of post-therapy memory loss, and that the procedure is barbaric. Have you or has someone you know undergone electroconvulsive therapy? Did it work? Were you happy with the results? Or, have you suffered from memory loss or other unexpected complications? Our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. And our e-mail address is talk@npr. org. And you can comment on our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation. Later in the program, can the U. S. military take lessons from Madison Avenue to help win over the Iraqi and Afghan people? But first, electroconvulsive therapy. We're joined by Kitty Dukakis, the wife of former Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate Michael Dukakis. She first underwent electroconvulsive therapy in 2001 and she continues to use the procedure to treat her depression. Kitty Dukakis has written about her treatment in \"Shock: The Healing Power of Electroconvulsive Therapy. \" She joins us now by phone from her home in Massachusetts. Kitty Dukakis, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION. Ms. KITTY DUKAKIS (Co-author, \"Shock: The Healing Power of Electroconvulsive Therapy\"): Thank you so much. It's good to be with you. NEARY: What made you decide to undergo electroconvulsive therapy? What led up to that decision? Ms. DUKAKIS: I had suffered for close to 17 years with clinical depressions. And they had been cyclical and came about every nine or 10 months, and were unbearable, really. They lasted for four months, and antidepressants just didn't work. They - if they did work at all, it was for very brief periods of time. And so I was really looking for an alternative, something that would work to heal these periods of frightful depression. NEARY: What had you heard about this treatment? Did you have negative ideas about it? Ms. DUKAKIS: Oh, I had, very initially. I certainly did. I had seen the movie \"One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest\" and had pictures of that with Jack Lemmon in my own mind. Fortunately, I had a wonderful doctor who was able to describe what in fact happened with the ECT, with electroconvulsive therapy, and was able to view a film and then did a great deal of reading about it. And at that particular point in my life, my depression happened to lift, and I said if it came back again, I certainly would try it. And it did come back about a year later. And six years ago, in June, I had my first treatment. NEARY: When you say you did a lot of research and, obviously, relied upon your doctor, what assurances did you get from him and that made you go ahead, and in your own research that made you go ahead? What\u2026 Ms. DUKAKIS: Right. That it worked in a good 75 to 85 percent of the cases in which it was used. That the side effect of some memory loss was different with every individual, that I might suffer with some of that. And I was willing to take that risk. And I have had some memory loss. It is - I consider it minor, though I have some periods in my life that are at total blank right now. But cognitively and in every other way, intellectually, my memory has not affected my life. And I consider it a tradeoff, a very fair tradeoff. And I have my life back again. And it works for me. When depression hits, I know that this particular therapy is going to work. NEARY: Let me - did you know it immediately after the first treatment? Ms. DUKAKIS: Well, I was one of those unusual cases. Normally, it takes people several treatments. There are usually six treatments in a series. And most people would take two or three treatments before they begin to notice the difference. I felt it off immediately and I was very fortunate. I happen to have - for my very first treatment, I happen to have ECT on Michael and my anniversary, and had told him before I went in for a treatment that I was sure I wouldn't feel like going out to celebrate. And on the way home from treatment, in the car, I turned to him and said I'm ready, I want to go out for dinner tonight. And he noticed the difference as I woke up from the treatment that I had a smile on my face. I didn't ever have a smile on my face during those periods of depression. NEARY: But you have to continue these treatments. It's not like you get one round of it and it's done. Ms. DUKAKIS: Right. It depends on the individual. There are people who are fortunate enough to have one series of treatments. And I've met many of them when my book was published. And they never have to have them again. They've, in a way, just have been cured of their depression or bipolar disease or whatever else is a problem. I'm not one of those people. I usually cycle every nine or 10 months. The beauty of this treatment is that I know it works. And I don't worry about the other shoe dropping. I know that there is a treatment that is going to make me feel better. NEARY: Let me ask you a little bit more about the memory loss because this is, of course, in the minds of many people, a huge drawback to this treatment. And yet, you said that you think it's a fair tradeoff and that it's kind of minor. But what kinds of things have you forgotten? Ms. DUKAKIS: Well, we had - soon after my first treatment, we had - I had been with Michael to Paris for the first time many weeks before my first treatment. And I have no memory of that first trip. We went back again. We stayed at the same hotel - I have no memory of the first trip. I saw a movie a year ago, and it was at the time of treatment, which just happens very often that one's memory is disturbed. And I saw the movie a second time a year later - I had no memory of the first time I've seen that movie. NEARY: I have to say, I don't think I'd forget a trip to Paris, but I might forget a movie I had seen. Ms. DUKAKIS: Well, the trip to Paris, you know, it's one of those things. I just - it's gone. We went back. I was fortunate in having a husband who was - so he could still go back with me and to go back to the same hotel. I tell the story about my sister being with me on the second trip and knocking on the door and saying - greeting me and saying, how could you have come back to this crummy hotel? And I said - looked at her and said, I don't remember. So I didn't remember going the first time. And the hotel was very - the rooms were very tiny. And we have joked about this as being a part of the memory that just wasn't there. NEARY: Yeah. One other thing, in preparing for the procedure - it means do you have to get ready for this procedure? Is there anything\u2026 Ms. DUKAKIS: I mean, one should never drink and one doesn't eat the day of, you know, right before going under because there is anesthetic, so that most treatments take place in the morning. And I, usually, am the first patient and I go in very early at 7:30 in the morning or 7 o'clock, I guess it is. And I am out usually by 8:30, and I'm my way home. And sometimes, I'm tired that first day and I'll take a nap, and other times, I have spoken in the evening of the day I've had surgery. NEARY: And one other thing, do you follow this up with other kinds of therapy or other medications as well? Or\u2026 Ms. DUKAKIS: Many people do. I had such unpleasant experiences with antidepressant's side effects. And I continued for a very short period of time, and some of those side effects came back. And a decision was made in concert with my doctor that I would not continue with them. So I have not been on antidepressants since, basically since I started ECT. NEARY: Your struggles with depression and your addiction to alcohol has become very public. But did you have any hesitation about going public with this? Was this\u2026 Ms. DUKAKIS: Not at all. I tell you, I felt so strongly that one - that the stigma needed to be removed from this treatment that is so successful with so many people - that so many were out there suffering; that there were huge numbers of suicides that could have been helped with this treatment; that women, who are pregnant, who don't wish to take antidepressants, can use this treatment; that elderly, who are having difficult times with depression and not able to get out of bed, find this treatment very successful. So that I wanted to talk about this, and was fortunate in having a superb co-writer in Larry Tye, who was able to talk about the history and all of the technical sides to the treatment, and wanted very much to write the book. NEARY: Well, thanks so much for being with us, Mrs. Dukakis. Ms. DUKAKIS: Thank you. NEARY: Kitty Dukakis is the wife of former Massachusetts governor and former presidential candidate Michael Dukakis. She joined us by telephone from her home in Massachusetts. And joining us now is Larry Tye. He's a medical journalist and the co-author, with Kitty Dukakis, of \"Shock: The Healing Power of Electroconvulsive Therapy. \" And he joins us by phone from Boston. Welcome to the show. Mr. LARRY TYE (Co-Author, \"Shock: The Healing Power of Electroconvulsive Therapy\"): Nice to be with you. NEARY: All right. We just have a couple of minutes before we go on a brief break. We're going to hold you over after that break. But quickly, if you can, just give us a little sense the early days of electroconvulsive therapy, when it was known as electroshock therapy. Who came up with this idea? Mr. TYE: It was originated in Rome by a physician there who had tried it. He had noticed an effect when they were analyzing the brains of schizophrenics, and have noticed that schizophrenics who had had convulsive - convulsions, naturally occurring epileptic convulsions, it seemed to have an effect on alleviating schizophrenia. And it was first tried in Italy in the late 1930s. Throughout the 1940s and '50s, it became the treatment of choice in psychiatric hospitals all around the world. And it was largely because there was nothing else available. It was used widely. It was used - probably overused in more hospitals than not, at too many dozes, too high a frequency. That was the only things that was available then. This is in the days before psycho-pharmaceuticals. So throughout the 1940s and '50s, it was the most widely used psychiatric treatment around the world. NEARY: And it was thought to be a cure-all of\u2026 Mr. TYE: It was thought to be a cure. Today, we're much - we do it in a different way and with a far greater sense of its potential possibilities and limits. NEARY: We're talking about electroconvulsive therapy. And we're going to continue our discussion with Larry Tye after a short break. We'll get a view from inside the medical community as well. You can join us at 800-989-TALK and you can send us an e-mail, the address is talk@npr. org. I'm Lynn Neary. It's TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) NEARY: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Lynn Neary in Washington, filling in for Neal Conan. We're talking today about shock therapy, known medically as electroconvulsive therapy. The treatment has come a long way from the days of \"One Flew Over of the Cuckoo's Nest,\" but there are still critics. They say it's used too often or the risks aren't made clear to patients. We'll talk with a psychiatrist about that in a moment. Right now, Larry Tye is with us. He's co-author of the book \"Shock: The Healing Power of Electroconvulsive Therapy. \" If you or someone you know has undergone electroconvulsive therapy, we'd like to hear from you. Let us know, did it work? Were there any side effects? Give us a call at 800-989-8255. Larry Tye, at some point - you were describing before the break that at a certain point, this was thought to be a cure-all. It was the most widely used psychiatric treatment. But the tide turned. What happened? Why did the tide go against this? People really started to think of it as a bad thing after a certain point. Mr. TYE: Sure. Two things happened. One is that psycho-pharmaceuticals - all the antidepressants and the anti-psychotic drugs - came out, so much easier for anybody to contemplate popping a pill than going in and getting a surgical procedure of having electricity zapped into their brain. So much more appealing and easier process with drugs - the other thing that happened was, partly because of actual overuse and misuse of the procedure, and partly because of the way the media and more importantly books and movies portrayed it, it came to be seen as a brutal form of torture. And the movie that most captured that image was \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" based on Ken Kesey's book. And the movie, starring Jack Nicholson, showed a very dramatic image of people being levitated off of the table and really given some sort of brain damage by having electroconvulsive therapy. NEARY: Pretty much stigmatized it for many, many years. Mr. TYE: Did stigmatize it. There's an irony, though, about the movie. First, the fact that Ken Kesey - if anybody should have known what ECT was really all about, then it was Ken Kesey, who wrote the book that the movie was based on, and had worked in a California psychiatric hospital, and had helped - as an orderly - had helped administer ECT. So he knew that even at that early phase, it was being administered with muscle relaxant that would prevent the kind of body jolting procedure that was portrayed in the book and the movie, and it was not being done with anesthesia and with oxygen to protect the brain against damage. So it was being done in a more benign way even at the time that the movie was portraying a torturous form of treatment. NEARY: Larry, I know you have to catch a plane. Do you have some time to stay with us a little bit and take some calls? Mr. TYE: I do. NEARY: Okay. I'm going to bring in Sarah Lisanby into the conversation now, Dr. Sarah Lisanby. She is the chief of the Brain Stimulation and Neuromodulation Division at Columbia University. She is also the chairperson of the American Psychiatric Association's Committee on ECT and Related Electromagnetic Therapies. Dr. Lisanby is with us from a studio at New York Presbyterian Hospital. Thanks so much for being with us, Dr. Lisanby. Dr. SARAH LISANBY (Brain Stimulation and Neuromodulation Division Chief, Columbia University): Thank you for having me. NEARY: Let me ask, is this procedure for everybody or should it be used as an absolute last resort? Dr. LISANBY: Well, there are particular indications that we look for in deciding whether ECT is right for each particular person, so I would say it's not for everybody, but it is a treatment that does help a significant proportion of people as even when other treatments like psychotherapy or medications may be failing. One of the great excitements about ECT, that it can offer hope when these other less invasive treatments fail. NEARY: Did this treatment go through something similar within the medical community, as happened in the larger culture, that is it fell out of favor and is now being looked on slightly differently again, or? Dr. LISANBY: Well, I think that's a good parallel. I mean, the medical community is part of the larger culture, isn't it? And so there's a bit of a parallel process when psychotropic medications became available, as Larry Tye mentioned. The medical community began to realize that actually, antipsychotic medications are much more effective for schizophrenia than ECT is. And in the case of schizophrenia, ECT is really used later on in the course of illness when the condition is refractory to most medications. But it was discovered in the medical community that depression responded much more readily to ECT than did schizophrenia. And that took several decades to figure out and that helped to refine what we now consider the indications for ECT. And now, the leading indication for ECT is depression. NEARY: We're talking about electroconvulsive therapy. If you'd like to join the discussion, our number is 800-989-8255. Let's go to a call now from Jenny. She is in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Hi, Jenny. JENNY (Caller): Hi. NEARY: Go ahead. JENNY: I just wanted to comment. I started having ECT back in October of '06 and it did worked really well for me. It really helped. I was at a point where I had to check myself into a hospital. And - but now, I'm to a point I go once a month and the recovery process has just become so exhausting that I don't feel that I can keep it up. NEARY: What do you mean by that? Maybe you could explain what\u2026 JENNY: I don't wake up from it well. Coming out of the anesthesia, my mom will hear me screaming quite a bit in recovery. And I have to be given additional, like Ativan, something to calm me down. NEARY: So it started to work, but now it's not working? I wonder, Dr. Lisanby, if you can comment on that? Or, if you - if this is a common kind of thing to happen? Dr. LISANBY: Well, what you seem to be describing might be called postictal agitation, which is a phenomenon that we occasionally see when a person is waking up from the anesthesia, right after the ECT. And before you're fully awake, there may be some disorientation or agitation, and we call that postictal agitation. And that is usually treated by giving Ativan or some medication at that immediate recovery period. But that doesn't necessarily mean that the treatment isn't working. I think the question is whether the treatment is helping keep the depression at bay, and what your describing is\u2026 JENNY: It is doing that. It's just I'm getting to a point where it seems the side effects are greater than the effects of not having the depression. NEARY: So we heard earlier - we heard from Kitty Dukakis earlier saying, for instance, with the memory loss that it was - what she got from ECT seemed to benefit her more, so that she was willing to take on the side effects of memory loss. It wasn't - didn't seem so bad. But you're saying it seems to be going in the other direction for you. JENNY: Right, right. And I've kind of been seeking out some more alternative means, looking at some more holistic approaches. NEARY: Okay. Well, thank you for your comments, Jenny. And I don't know if there's anything more you can say about that, Dr. Lisanby, while Jenny is still on the line. Dr. LISANBY: Well, you know, it's difficult to know without knowing the exact medical details. But I can say that in cases that we've seen with postictal agitation, sometimes this can be effectively treated by changing the dosages of the anesthesia so that the recovery period is more smooth, and so that you wake up more smoothly without having that period of agitation. But again, it's hard to comment without knowing the details for each individual person. NEARY: All right. Thanks so much for your call, Jenny. JENNY: Thank you. NEARY: Appreciate it. Larry Tye, we were talking earlier with you about sort of this sort of cultural attitudes towards this. I'm curious - what got you interested in this, and looking at it again, perhaps, from a different perspective yourself? Mr. TYE: Sure. Lynn, I think that journalists assume - particularly, if they have a specialty like medicine - that they know the trends going on in the medical world. And I was really surprised when Kitty came to me and was looking for a partner, and bring the book. I wasn't interested originally. And then, I started looking into some things about ECT and found that it had made this extraordinary, subterranean comeback. ECT today is as common as a hysterectomy and twice as common as knee replacement(ph) in America. And yet, as somebody who was covering medicine fulltime at that time for the Boston Globe, I had no idea that it was back and was being used as widely. I also had no idea that all the leading medical authorities, from the surgeon general to the American Psychiatric Association, seem to be saying that this was the singly most effective treatment in psychiatry. And my image of it was as a brutal form of treatment that had gone out with the \"Cuckoo's Nest. \" When I found out that it wasn't, I wanted to know why and why a stigma remained that caused the treatment to be underused. And of course, most importantly, we're not - we didn't write the book, saying that people should be getting ECT. We said that it ought to be available if they wanted it and it shouldn't be a treatment where the stigma of the treatment was even worse than the stigma of the disease that was underlying it. So that people - what Kitty is coming out and doing is saying, if you're getting it and if it's working for you, you shouldn't be embarrassed to acknowledge that you're getting it. And it will work to some people. It has side effects that seem overwhelming for others, and everybody who's got to make the personal decision of whether to use it or not. But the idea that it is out there and available and being used by people, to me, was intriguing. NEARY: All right. Well, thanks so much for being with us today, Larry. Mr. TYE: Thank you. NEARY: Larry Tye is the co-author of \"Shock: The Healing Power of Electroconvulsive Therapy. \" And Dr. Lisanby, we've talked about memory loss being one of the side effects. We just heard a caller talk about the fact that she has some problems when she comes out of the actual procedure. Are there other medical risks associated with this? Dr. LISANBY: Yes. The risks can be divided into those that come from the anesthesia itself and those that come from the seizure that's induced by the ECT. And - going under general anesthesia has risks that are well known and they're the same as for brief surgical procedure. But the parts of the risks that are specific for ECT have to do with the seizure. And the seizure can cause the heart rate to go up. It can increase the blood pressure. These effects are short lived. But if a person had serious heart disease such as having heart attack or myocardial infarction within a few weeks prior to the procedure, that would be an issue. So before anyone goes through ECT, they receive a full medical evaluation to look and find out if they have any medical risk factors for complications from the treatment - and cardiac is one of the areas that we pay a close attention, too. Common side effects from ECT besides memory loss can include headache. You can get some muscle soreness after the treatment. You can feel fatigued. You can have some nausea, which often happens after you have anesthesia. Most of those are short-lived side effects, but the side effect that seems to be most concerning for people receiving ECT is the memory loss. NEARY: Let's take another call now from Robin(ph). She is calling from Oakland, California. Hi, Robin. Go ahead. ROBIN (Caller): Hi. How are you? NEARY: Good. ROBIN: Thank you very much for letting me contribute to this discussion. I'm really thankful that somebody like Kitty Dukakis has come forward and talked about her experience with ECT. I, myself, am 45 years old and have had major depressions for the last 20 years of my life. I went through about three major depressions. And on the last one, the antidepressants that I had been taking no longer worked. And I really was up against what was going to be next. And the only option that seems like it would work would be ECT. Then, it was an agonizing decision to make because I was scared and had only had, you know, the - sort of the description of it from a movie like \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. \" But I finally decided to make it and it was something that works very well for me. NEARY: And do you still - are you continuing with the treatments now? ROBIN: No. No. I only had it once. And thankfully, I've not had to revisit that. It doesn't mean that I won't. You know, you're always sort of vigilant about those things. But I do want to say that I think, probably, the people who are most vehemently opposed to ECT are people who have never in their life experienced the kind of sadness and the kind of hopelessness that clinical depression brings upon someone. And without having experienced that, I don't think you can really be in the position to say people shouldn't\u2026 NEARY: Yeah. And I think that we heard the same thing from Kitty Dukakis that this is a lifelong problem she was dealing with, and that finding something that could help her made it possible to do something that she was afraid of. And maybe Dr. Lisanby, you can talk a little bit about that. Who best - is it only people who are suffering from depression that this can be useful for or are there other mental illnesses or emotional illnesses as well? And Robin, I want to thank you, by the way, for participating in, for your call. ROBIN: Thank you very much. NEARY: Okay. And I just want to remind our listeners that you are listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Dr. Lisanby? Dr. LISANBY: So to answer your question, depression is the primary indication for ECT, but it can also be used in other conditions and is used on other conditions. For example, bipolar disorder also called manic depression, when a person has periods of depression, but also has periods of mania where their mood is very elevated. They have excessive energy. And ECT can be effective in treating the depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. And also, if the manic episodes don't respond to medications, ECT can be effective there as well. We talked about schizophrenia earlier, and ECT is still used in schizophrenia, though, less commonly. It's more used when most of the medications are not working for severe schizophrenia. But it can be helpful there. ECT is even used in other conditions on occasion, for example, Parkinson's disease. The neurological disorder that causes tremor sometimes is not effectively treated with medications alone. And ECT can induce pretty dramatic improvements in the tremor of Parkinson's disease. Sometimes, people with Parkinson's also are susceptible to depression. And in those cases, ECT can be helpful with both conditions. NEARY: Is this covered by insurance, by the way? Dr. LISANBY: Most insurances do cover ECT. Medicare does cover ECT. NEARY: Okay. And I was also wondering - are you still there, Doctor? Dr. LISANBY: Yes. NEARY: Okay. I was also wondering, Dr. Lisanby, I was curious about in terms of the memory loss, can it affect you later in life when you're older? Can that memory loss become worse? I mean, we know that older people have problems with short-term memory, things like that. If you have ECT when you're younger, could it come back to haunt you later on in some way? Dr. LISANBY: Well, that's a very interesting question. The pattern of memory loss and recovery from memory goes on the opposite direction from what you're suggesting. So, let's say someone has ECT when they're 25. Then, in the weeks to months to years after their course of ECT, the memory tends to improve, so it doesn't go in the opposite direction. It doesn't get worse with time. It tends to improve the further you are out from when the ECT was given. I think your question is whether having it earlier in life could affect later life risk for memory disorders. There is no evidence of that. But I would say that if you receive ECT later in life in the presence of an already existing memory problem such as dementia, or age-related memory loss, evidence suggests that if you already have some memory loss from dementia, you may be more at risk for some of these cognitive side effects of ECT. That being said, however, later in life, depression does occur and it can happen in people with dementia. And in some cases, if medications aren't effective, ECT can be used in those situations. NEARY: Thanks very much, Dr. Lisanby. Dr. Sarah Lisanby is the chairperson of the American Psychiatric Association's Committee on ECT and Related Electromagnetic Therapies. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Lynn Neary.  LYNN NEARY, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Lynn Neary in Washington. Neal Conan is away.  Some 100,000 Americans undergo electroconvulsive therapy every year. In the treatment, psychiatrists use a controlled electrical current to induce small seizures in the brain. Though no one knows exactly how it works, it is effective for many patients - and in many cases - where prescription drugs have not helped.  Critics of the procedure say that electroconvulsive therapy has been overprescribed, the doctors have underplayed the risk of post-therapy memory loss, and that the procedure is barbaric.  Have you or has someone you know undergone electroconvulsive therapy? Did it work? Were you happy with the results? Or, have you suffered from memory loss or other unexpected complications? Our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. And our e-mail address is talk@npr. org. And you can comment on our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation.  Later in the program, can the U. S. military take lessons from Madison Avenue to help win over the Iraqi and Afghan people?  But first, electroconvulsive therapy. We're joined by Kitty Dukakis, the wife of former Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate Michael Dukakis. She first underwent electroconvulsive therapy in 2001 and she continues to use the procedure to treat her depression. Kitty Dukakis has written about her treatment in \"Shock: The Healing Power of Electroconvulsive Therapy. \" She joins us now by phone from her home in Massachusetts. Kitty Dukakis, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.  Ms. KITTY DUKAKIS (Co-author, \"Shock: The Healing Power of Electroconvulsive Therapy\"): Thank you so much. It's good to be with you.  NEARY: What made you decide to undergo electroconvulsive therapy? What led up to that decision?  Ms. DUKAKIS: I had suffered for close to 17 years with clinical depressions. And they had been cyclical and came about every nine or 10 months, and were unbearable, really. They lasted for four months, and antidepressants just didn't work. They - if they did work at all, it was for very brief periods of time. And so I was really looking for an alternative, something that would work to heal these periods of frightful depression.  NEARY: What had you heard about this treatment? Did you have negative ideas about it?  Ms. DUKAKIS: Oh, I had, very initially. I certainly did. I had seen the movie \"One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest\" and had pictures of that with Jack Lemmon in my own mind. Fortunately, I had a wonderful doctor who was able to describe what in fact happened with the ECT, with electroconvulsive therapy, and was able to view a film and then did a great deal of reading about it.  And at that particular point in my life, my depression happened to lift, and I said if it came back again, I certainly would try it. And it did come back about a year later. And six years ago, in June, I had my first treatment.  NEARY: When you say you did a lot of research and, obviously, relied upon your doctor, what assurances did you get from him and that made you go ahead, and in your own research that made you go ahead? What\u2026  Ms. DUKAKIS: Right. That it worked in a good 75 to 85 percent of the cases in which it was used. That the side effect of some memory loss was different with every individual, that I might suffer with some of that. And I was willing to take that risk. And I have had some memory loss. It is - I consider it minor, though I have some periods in my life that are at total blank right now. But cognitively and in every other way, intellectually, my memory has not affected my life.  And I consider it a tradeoff, a very fair tradeoff. And I have my life back again. And it works for me. When depression hits, I know that this particular therapy is going to work.  NEARY: Let me - did you know it immediately after the first treatment?  Ms. DUKAKIS: Well, I was one of those unusual cases. Normally, it takes people several treatments. There are usually six treatments in a series. And most people would take two or three treatments before they begin to notice the difference. I felt it off immediately and I was very fortunate. I happen to have - for my very first treatment, I happen to have ECT on Michael and my anniversary, and had told him before I went in for a treatment that I was sure I wouldn't feel like going out to celebrate.  And on the way home from treatment, in the car, I turned to him and said I'm ready, I want to go out for dinner tonight. And he noticed the difference as I woke up from the treatment that I had a smile on my face. I didn't ever have a smile on my face during those periods of depression.  NEARY: But you have to continue these treatments. It's not like you get one round of it and it's done.  Ms. DUKAKIS: Right. It depends on the individual. There are people who are fortunate enough to have one series of treatments. And I've met many of them when my book was published. And they never have to have them again. They've, in a way, just have been cured of their depression or bipolar disease or whatever else is a problem. I'm not one of those people. I usually cycle every nine or 10 months.  The beauty of this treatment is that I know it works. And I don't worry about the other shoe dropping. I know that there is a treatment that is going to make me feel better.  NEARY: Let me ask you a little bit more about the memory loss because this is, of course, in the minds of many people, a huge drawback to this treatment. And yet, you said that you think it's a fair tradeoff and that it's kind of minor. But what kinds of things have you forgotten?  Ms. DUKAKIS: Well, we had - soon after my first treatment, we had - I had been with Michael to Paris for the first time many weeks before my first treatment. And I have no memory of that first trip. We went back again. We stayed at the same hotel - I have no memory of the first trip. I saw a movie a year ago, and it was at the time of treatment, which just happens very often that one's memory is disturbed. And I saw the movie a second time a year later - I had no memory of the first time I've seen that movie.  NEARY: I have to say, I don't think I'd forget a trip to Paris, but I might forget a movie I had seen.  Ms. DUKAKIS: Well, the trip to Paris, you know, it's one of those things. I just - it's gone. We went back. I was fortunate in having a husband who was - so he could still go back with me and to go back to the same hotel. I tell the story about my sister being with me on the second trip and knocking on the door and saying - greeting me and saying, how could you have come back to this crummy hotel?  And I said - looked at her and said, I don't remember. So I didn't remember going the first time. And the hotel was very - the rooms were very tiny. And we have joked about this as being a part of the memory that just wasn't there.  NEARY: Yeah. One other thing, in preparing for the procedure - it means do you have to get ready for this procedure? Is there anything\u2026  Ms. DUKAKIS: I mean, one should never drink and one doesn't eat the day of, you know, right before going under because there is anesthetic, so that most treatments take place in the morning. And I, usually, am the first patient and I go in very early at 7:30 in the morning or 7 o'clock, I guess it is. And I am out usually by 8:30, and I'm my way home. And sometimes, I'm tired that first day and I'll take a nap, and other times, I have spoken in the evening of the day I've had surgery.  NEARY: And one other thing, do you follow this up with other kinds of therapy or other medications as well? Or\u2026  Ms. DUKAKIS: Many people do. I had such unpleasant experiences with antidepressant's side effects. And I continued for a very short period of time, and some of those side effects came back. And a decision was made in concert with my doctor that I would not continue with them. So I have not been on antidepressants since, basically since I started ECT.  NEARY: Your struggles with depression and your addiction to alcohol has become very public. But did you have any hesitation about going public with this? Was this\u2026  Ms. DUKAKIS: Not at all. I tell you, I felt so strongly that one - that the stigma needed to be removed from this treatment that is so successful with so many people - that so many were out there suffering; that there were huge numbers of suicides that could have been helped with this treatment; that women, who are pregnant, who don't wish to take antidepressants, can use this treatment; that elderly, who are having difficult times with depression and not able to get out of bed, find this treatment very successful.  So that I wanted to talk about this, and was fortunate in having a superb co-writer in Larry Tye, who was able to talk about the history and all of the technical sides to the treatment, and wanted very much to write the book.  NEARY: Well, thanks so much for being with us, Mrs. Dukakis.  Ms. DUKAKIS: Thank you.  NEARY: Kitty Dukakis is the wife of former Massachusetts governor and former presidential candidate Michael Dukakis. She joined us by telephone from her home in Massachusetts.  And joining us now is Larry Tye. He's a medical journalist and the co-author, with Kitty Dukakis, of \"Shock: The Healing Power of Electroconvulsive Therapy. \" And he joins us by phone from Boston. Welcome to the show.  Mr. LARRY TYE (Co-Author, \"Shock: The Healing Power of Electroconvulsive Therapy\"): Nice to be with you.  NEARY: All right. We just have a couple of minutes before we go on a brief break. We're going to hold you over after that break. But quickly, if you can, just give us a little sense the early days of electroconvulsive therapy, when it was known as electroshock therapy. Who came up with this idea?  Mr. TYE: It was originated in Rome by a physician there who had tried it. He had noticed an effect when they were analyzing the brains of schizophrenics, and have noticed that schizophrenics who had had convulsive - convulsions, naturally occurring epileptic convulsions, it seemed to have an effect on alleviating schizophrenia. And it was first tried in Italy in the late 1930s.  Throughout the 1940s and '50s, it became the treatment of choice in psychiatric hospitals all around the world. And it was largely because there was nothing else available. It was used widely. It was used - probably overused in more hospitals than not, at too many dozes, too high a frequency. That was the only things that was available then. This is in the days before psycho-pharmaceuticals. So throughout the 1940s and '50s, it was the most widely used psychiatric treatment around the world.  NEARY: And it was thought to be a cure-all of\u2026  Mr. TYE: It was thought to be a cure. Today, we're much - we do it in a different way and with a far greater sense of its potential possibilities and limits.  NEARY: We're talking about electroconvulsive therapy. And we're going to continue our discussion with Larry Tye after a short break. We'll get a view from inside the medical community as well. You can join us at 800-989-TALK and you can send us an e-mail, the address is talk@npr. org.  I'm Lynn Neary. It's TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  NEARY: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Lynn Neary in Washington, filling in for Neal Conan. We're talking today about shock therapy, known medically as electroconvulsive therapy. The treatment has come a long way from the days of \"One Flew Over of the Cuckoo's Nest,\" but there are still critics. They say it's used too often or the risks aren't made clear to patients. We'll talk with a psychiatrist about that in a moment.  Right now, Larry Tye is with us. He's co-author of the book \"Shock: The Healing Power of Electroconvulsive Therapy. \" If you or someone you know has undergone electroconvulsive therapy, we'd like to hear from you. Let us know, did it work? Were there any side effects? Give us a call at 800-989-8255.  Larry Tye, at some point - you were describing before the break that at a certain point, this was thought to be a cure-all. It was the most widely used psychiatric treatment. But the tide turned. What happened? Why did the tide go against this? People really started to think of it as a bad thing after a certain point.  Mr. TYE: Sure. Two things happened. One is that psycho-pharmaceuticals - all the antidepressants and the anti-psychotic drugs - came out, so much easier for anybody to contemplate popping a pill than going in and getting a surgical procedure of having electricity zapped into their brain. So much more appealing and easier process with drugs - the other thing that happened was, partly because of actual overuse and misuse of the procedure, and partly because of the way the media and more importantly books and movies portrayed it, it came to be seen as a brutal form of torture.  And the movie that most captured that image was \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" based on Ken Kesey's book. And the movie, starring Jack Nicholson, showed a very dramatic image of people being levitated off of the table and really given some sort of brain damage by having electroconvulsive therapy.  NEARY: Pretty much stigmatized it for many, many years.  Mr. TYE: Did stigmatize it. There's an irony, though, about the movie. First, the fact that Ken Kesey - if anybody should have known what ECT was really all about, then it was Ken Kesey, who wrote the book that the movie was based on, and had worked in a California psychiatric hospital, and had helped - as an orderly - had helped administer ECT. So he knew that even at that early phase, it was being administered with muscle relaxant that would prevent the kind of body jolting procedure that was portrayed in the book and the movie, and it was not being done with anesthesia and with oxygen to protect the brain against damage. So it was being done in a more benign way even at the time that the movie was portraying a torturous form of treatment.  NEARY: Larry, I know you have to catch a plane. Do you have some time to stay with us a little bit and take some calls?  Mr. TYE: I do.  NEARY: Okay. I'm going to bring in Sarah Lisanby into the conversation now, Dr. Sarah Lisanby. She is the chief of the Brain Stimulation and Neuromodulation Division at Columbia University. She is also the chairperson of the American Psychiatric Association's Committee on ECT and Related Electromagnetic Therapies. Dr. Lisanby is with us from a studio at New York Presbyterian Hospital. Thanks so much for being with us, Dr. Lisanby.  Dr. SARAH LISANBY (Brain Stimulation and Neuromodulation Division Chief, Columbia University): Thank you for having me.  NEARY: Let me ask, is this procedure for everybody or should it be used as an absolute last resort?  Dr. LISANBY: Well, there are particular indications that we look for in deciding whether ECT is right for each particular person, so I would say it's not for everybody, but it is a treatment that does help a significant proportion of people as even when other treatments like psychotherapy or medications may be failing. One of the great excitements about ECT, that it can offer hope when these other less invasive treatments fail.  NEARY: Did this treatment go through something similar within the medical community, as happened in the larger culture, that is it fell out of favor and is now being looked on slightly differently again, or?  Dr. LISANBY: Well, I think that's a good parallel. I mean, the medical community is part of the larger culture, isn't it? And so there's a bit of a parallel process when psychotropic medications became available, as Larry Tye mentioned. The medical community began to realize that actually, antipsychotic medications are much more effective for schizophrenia than ECT is.  And in the case of schizophrenia, ECT is really used later on in the course of illness when the condition is refractory to most medications. But it was discovered in the medical community that depression responded much more readily to ECT than did schizophrenia. And that took several decades to figure out and that helped to refine what we now consider the indications for ECT. And now, the leading indication for ECT is depression.  NEARY: We're talking about electroconvulsive therapy. If you'd like to join the discussion, our number is 800-989-8255. Let's go to a call now from Jenny. She is in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Hi, Jenny.  JENNY (Caller): Hi.  NEARY: Go ahead.  JENNY: I just wanted to comment. I started having ECT back in October of '06 and it did worked really well for me. It really helped. I was at a point where I had to check myself into a hospital. And - but now, I'm to a point I go once a month and the recovery process has just become so exhausting that I don't feel that I can keep it up.  NEARY: What do you mean by that? Maybe you could explain what\u2026  JENNY: I don't wake up from it well. Coming out of the anesthesia, my mom will hear me screaming quite a bit in recovery. And I have to be given additional, like Ativan, something to calm me down.  NEARY: So it started to work, but now it's not working? I wonder, Dr. Lisanby, if you can comment on that? Or, if you - if this is a common kind of thing to happen?  Dr. LISANBY: Well, what you seem to be describing might be called postictal agitation, which is a phenomenon that we occasionally see when a person is waking up from the anesthesia, right after the ECT. And before you're fully awake, there may be some disorientation or agitation, and we call that postictal agitation. And that is usually treated by giving Ativan or some medication at that immediate recovery period. But that doesn't necessarily mean that the treatment isn't working. I think the question is whether the treatment is helping keep the depression at bay, and what your describing is\u2026  JENNY: It is doing that. It's just I'm getting to a point where it seems the side effects are greater than the effects of not having the depression.  NEARY: So we heard earlier - we heard from Kitty Dukakis earlier saying, for instance, with the memory loss that it was - what she got from ECT seemed to benefit her more, so that she was willing to take on the side effects of memory loss. It wasn't - didn't seem so bad. But you're saying it seems to be going in the other direction for you.  JENNY: Right, right. And I've kind of been seeking out some more alternative means, looking at some more holistic approaches.  NEARY: Okay. Well, thank you for your comments, Jenny. And I don't know if there's anything more you can say about that, Dr. Lisanby, while Jenny is still on the line.  Dr. LISANBY: Well, you know, it's difficult to know without knowing the exact medical details. But I can say that in cases that we've seen with postictal agitation, sometimes this can be effectively treated by changing the dosages of the anesthesia so that the recovery period is more smooth, and so that you wake up more smoothly without having that period of agitation. But again, it's hard to comment without knowing the details for each individual person.  NEARY: All right. Thanks so much for your call, Jenny.  JENNY: Thank you.  NEARY: Appreciate it. Larry Tye, we were talking earlier with you about sort of this sort of cultural attitudes towards this. I'm curious - what got you interested in this, and looking at it again, perhaps, from a different perspective yourself?  Mr. TYE: Sure. Lynn, I think that journalists assume - particularly, if they have a specialty like medicine - that they know the trends going on in the medical world. And I was really surprised when Kitty came to me and was looking for a partner, and bring the book. I wasn't interested originally. And then, I started looking into some things about ECT and found that it had made this extraordinary, subterranean comeback.  ECT today is as common as a hysterectomy and twice as common as knee replacement(ph) in America. And yet, as somebody who was covering medicine fulltime at that time for the Boston Globe, I had no idea that it was back and was being used as widely. I also had no idea that all the leading medical authorities, from the surgeon general to the American Psychiatric Association, seem to be saying that this was the singly most effective treatment in psychiatry.  And my image of it was as a brutal form of treatment that had gone out with the \"Cuckoo's Nest. \" When I found out that it wasn't, I wanted to know why and why a stigma remained that caused the treatment to be underused.  And of course, most importantly, we're not - we didn't write the book, saying that people should be getting ECT. We said that it ought to be available if they wanted it and it shouldn't be a treatment where the stigma of the treatment was even worse than the stigma of the disease that was underlying it. So that people - what Kitty is coming out and doing is saying, if you're getting it and if it's working for you, you shouldn't be embarrassed to acknowledge that you're getting it. And it will work to some people. It has side effects that seem overwhelming for others, and everybody who's got to make the personal decision of whether to use it or not. But the idea that it is out there and available and being used by people, to me, was intriguing.  NEARY: All right. Well, thanks so much for being with us today, Larry.  Mr. TYE: Thank you.  NEARY: Larry Tye is the co-author of \"Shock: The Healing Power of Electroconvulsive Therapy. \" And Dr. Lisanby, we've talked about memory loss being one of the side effects. We just heard a caller talk about the fact that she has some problems when she comes out of the actual procedure. Are there other medical risks associated with this?  Dr. LISANBY: Yes. The risks can be divided into those that come from the anesthesia itself and those that come from the seizure that's induced by the ECT. And - going under general anesthesia has risks that are well known and they're the same as for brief surgical procedure.  But the parts of the risks that are specific for ECT have to do with the seizure. And the seizure can cause the heart rate to go up. It can increase the blood pressure. These effects are short lived. But if a person had serious heart disease such as having heart attack or myocardial infarction within a few weeks prior to the procedure, that would be an issue.  So before anyone goes through ECT, they receive a full medical evaluation to look and find out if they have any medical risk factors for complications from the treatment - and cardiac is one of the areas that we pay a close attention, too.  Common side effects from ECT besides memory loss can include headache. You can get some muscle soreness after the treatment. You can feel fatigued. You can have some nausea, which often happens after you have anesthesia. Most of those are short-lived side effects, but the side effect that seems to be most concerning for people receiving ECT is the memory loss.  NEARY: Let's take another call now from Robin(ph). She is calling from Oakland, California. Hi, Robin. Go ahead.  ROBIN (Caller): Hi. How are you?  NEARY: Good.  ROBIN: Thank you very much for letting me contribute to this discussion. I'm really thankful that somebody like Kitty Dukakis has come forward and talked about her experience with ECT. I, myself, am 45 years old and have had major depressions for the last 20 years of my life. I went through about three major depressions. And on the last one, the antidepressants that I had been taking no longer worked. And I really was up against what was going to be next.  And the only option that seems like it would work would be ECT. Then, it was an agonizing decision to make because I was scared and had only had, you know, the - sort of the description of it from a movie like \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. \" But I finally decided to make it and it was something that works very well for me.  NEARY: And do you still - are you continuing with the treatments now?  ROBIN: No. No. I only had it once. And thankfully, I've not had to revisit that. It doesn't mean that I won't. You know, you're always sort of vigilant about those things. But I do want to say that I think, probably, the people who are most vehemently opposed to ECT are people who have never in their life experienced the kind of sadness and the kind of hopelessness that clinical depression brings upon someone. And without having experienced that, I don't think you can really be in the position to say people shouldn't\u2026  NEARY: Yeah. And I think that we heard the same thing from Kitty Dukakis that this is a lifelong problem she was dealing with, and that finding something that could help her made it possible to do something that she was afraid of. And maybe Dr. Lisanby, you can talk a little bit about that. Who best - is it only people who are suffering from depression that this can be useful for or are there other mental illnesses or emotional illnesses as well? And Robin, I want to thank you, by the way, for participating in, for your call.  ROBIN: Thank you very much.  NEARY: Okay. And I just want to remind our listeners that you are listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Dr. Lisanby?  Dr. LISANBY: So to answer your question, depression is the primary indication for ECT, but it can also be used in other conditions and is used on other conditions. For example, bipolar disorder also called manic depression, when a person has periods of depression, but also has periods of mania where their mood is very elevated. They have excessive energy. And ECT can be effective in treating the depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. And also, if the manic episodes don't respond to medications, ECT can be effective there as well.  We talked about schizophrenia earlier, and ECT is still used in schizophrenia, though, less commonly. It's more used when most of the medications are not working for severe schizophrenia. But it can be helpful there.  ECT is even used in other conditions on occasion, for example, Parkinson's disease. The neurological disorder that causes tremor sometimes is not effectively treated with medications alone. And ECT can induce pretty dramatic improvements in the tremor of Parkinson's disease. Sometimes, people with Parkinson's also are susceptible to depression. And in those cases, ECT can be helpful with both conditions.  NEARY: Is this covered by insurance, by the way?  Dr. LISANBY: Most insurances do cover ECT. Medicare does cover ECT.  NEARY: Okay. And I was also wondering - are you still there, Doctor?  Dr. LISANBY: Yes.  NEARY: Okay. I was also wondering, Dr. Lisanby, I was curious about in terms of the memory loss, can it affect you later in life when you're older? Can that memory loss become worse? I mean, we know that older people have problems with short-term memory, things like that. If you have ECT when you're younger, could it come back to haunt you later on in some way?  Dr. LISANBY: Well, that's a very interesting question. The pattern of memory loss and recovery from memory goes on the opposite direction from what you're suggesting. So, let's say someone has ECT when they're 25. Then, in the weeks to months to years after their course of ECT, the memory tends to improve, so it doesn't go in the opposite direction. It doesn't get worse with time. It tends to improve the further you are out from when the ECT was given.  I think your question is whether having it earlier in life could affect later life risk for memory disorders. There is no evidence of that. But I would say that if you receive ECT later in life in the presence of an already existing memory problem such as dementia, or age-related memory loss, evidence suggests that if you already have some memory loss from dementia, you may be more at risk for some of these cognitive side effects of ECT.  That being said, however, later in life, depression does occur and it can happen in people with dementia. And in some cases, if medications aren't effective, ECT can be used in those situations.  NEARY: Thanks very much, Dr. Lisanby. Dr. Sarah Lisanby is the chairperson of the American Psychiatric Association's Committee on ECT and Related Electromagnetic Therapies.

And to put that in context, the Mules and More tells us that when the Romans wanted to say the equivalent of that'll happen when hell freezes over, they would say, in Latin, of course, that'll happen when a mule foals, in other words, when the sterile hybrid offspring of a female horse and a male donkey gives birth. It's just not supposed to happen. There are accounts of it happening every few years everywhere from Albania to Morocco to Nebraska, and now it has happened in Colbran, Colorado. That's where Laura Amos and her husband, Larry, owned Winterhawk Outfitters and where they owned many mules.

LAURA AMOS: We could tell visually there was no doubt that this mare mule had just given birth because we knew there will - would be skeptics and we knew that it was, you know, such a rare event. We had hair samples sent to the University of Kentucky that verified that this was a parent and offspring, and then we also had blood work sent to University of California at Davis, which also verified that it was a mule and her offspring. SIEGEL: Well, it's not supposed to happen from whatever at the number of chromosomes that a mule comes away with from its parents, a horse and a donkey, should not permit fertilization - successful fertilization. So what kind of explanations have you had from people as to why this has happened? AMOS: I'm waiting for an explanation. Yes, you're right. Mules are hybrid animals. They are the result of breeding a mare horse to a donkey. Horses, as you probably know, have 64 chromosomes and donkeys have 62. The resulting hybrid offspring - a mule - has 63 and they are infertile. I think that further genetic testing will give us more certainty as to how this happened. But, I guess, there are a couple distant theories, and it would depend on what genetic information the mother passed on. This baby could perhaps be a mule. It could be a 63-chromosome animal. It could be a donkey or it could be what's known as a chimera. And that's an animal that has genetic bits and pieces, from my understanding, from other species. SIEGEL: But whatever - and it's a he, yes? This is a. . . AMOS: Yeah, it's a john mule. SIEGEL: A john mule. Whatever he is, he's pretty rare. AMOS: He's very, very rare. Yes.

I'm Joe Palca. Ira Flatow is away. Ketamine is an interesting drug. Veterinarians used it as an anesthetic, and it's a popular street drug for its hallucinogenic properties. And remarkably, now, it appears to be effective in treating the symptoms of depression. It works in hours while most antidepressants take weeks. It's also effective in people who are resistant to other drugs. Now, ketamine's side effects like those hallucinations I just mentioned will likely keep it off your drugstore or out of your drugstore. But if researchers can understand why ketamine works so quickly, they may be able to develop similar fast-acting drugs. A study published this week in the journal Biological Psychiatry looks at what ketamine does in the in the brain and why it might be effective. Joining me in the studio to talk about the study and what it means for treatment is Thomas Insel. He's the director of the National Institute of Mental Heath, a branch of the National Institutes of Health. Welcome. And if you'd like to talk about this question, give us a call. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. If you want more information about what we'll be talking about this hour, go to our Web site, at www. sciencefriday. com, where you'll find links to our topic. And, so, Dr. Insel, I guess the first question that comes to mind here is whose idea was it in the first place to try using this hallucinogenic anesthetic on patients with depression? Dr. THOMAS INSEL: (Director, the National Institute of Mental Heath): There had been some anecdotes about people being treated with this drug for chronic pain syndromes who've seem to have a relief of depression, but no one really had a very good sense of what that was about. Much of the interest in this came about actually from another side. It was trying to understand the biology of depression and trying to figure out how all the other medications that we knew about worked. We know that many of these antidepressants start off in difference places, affecting different receptors or different brain systems. But there must be some final common pathway for which all of them are able to relieve despair, hopelessness, depression. And the question was is there a final target, is there a common target that one could come up with. And one of those is actually a target that this drug ketamine works on. And so the idea had come about partly from what we knew based on animal neuropharmacology that this may be worth trying out. And then, there have been now two studies that have looked in a fairly careful way, both small and both - at this point - highly experimental. But indeed, just as you said, it looks as if at least in one of these studies with about 18 subjects, that people who had not responded to other antidepressants, hadn't responded to ECT - electroconvulsive therapy - remained severely depressed and ill, responded now within hours to the infusion of ketamine. PALCA: And when you talk about a target, what does that mean in this case? What do you - what kind of a thing would you target with a drug for a behavioral disease? Dr. INSEL: We're at a point now where we can begin to understand the molecules that seem to be most important, not only for the illnesses themselves, but at this point for how some of the treatments are working. In this case, the particular molecular target is something called the NMDA receptor. It's a receptor we've known about for well, maybe two, almost three decades now and it's mostly been understood in studies of learning and memory; a little bit in terms of the ischemia and stroke as well - a lot of interests in how this might be a useful target for relieving some of the cell death that occurs with ischemic injury. But in this case, it was partly taking this on ramp of learning and memory and thinking, gosh, is there something there that might tell us about how we can get people with depression better more quickly? PALCA: Mm-hmm. So what's this new study tell us that we didn't know before? Dr. INSEL: It adds a little bit to this puzzle, and I need to be very clear with you that no one here is recommending that ketamine be used as an antidepressant. This is what we would call a proof of principle. It just - essentially for us, it moves the goalpost. All of the studies of antidepressants up until now have said if these drugs are effective, we can hope to see effects within four, six, maybe eight weeks. Now, for the first time, we're talking about effects in two, four, six hours. That's a very different discussion, so ketamine has been important in that sense. It's changed the debate. It's changed the - really, where we want to put the goalpost. But one shouldn't, for a moment, think that this is going to be the endgame or the drug that people will actually use. What the new study does, it helps us to understand that the effects of ketamine and of related compounds all go through a common step, as they may bind to the NMDA receptor. But that's actually not the active ingredient here. It appears to be something even downstream from that receptor, something called the AMPA receptor, and it appears that what's really important here is increasing what we call the throughput of AMPA signaling. It's just a complicated way of saying how information is going through the cell so that you can get signals through more quickly. And it must be happening at just the places at the right time. This may be a final common pathway for all of these drugs. But what ketamine and these other compounds may be doing is leapfrogging over lots of other steps and going right to the active ingredient. PALCA: Well, let's invite our listeners to join this conversation. We're talking with Dr. Thomas Insel of the National Institute of Mental Health about some recent studies suggesting that the drug ketamine can have a dramatic effect on depression, not that it would become a drug for depression, but it might point the way to developing new drugs for depression. So let's go to David in Naples. I take it Naples, Florida, David? DAVID (Caller): Hi, there. Dr. Insel, I have one quick question and that is one of the things that people are looking at these days with reference in how the SSRI antidepressant work seems to be that it's dependent upon some sort of trophic event occurring in the hippocampus. In other words, up-regulation of brain drive neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus, at least in experimental animals and possibly in humans as being one of the reasons ultimately that permits the SSRI to actually do their job. First, I'd like to know, do you feel that the way ketamine might be working, might be along that pathway, which happens, interestingly, enough to be how purportedly ECT may actually work. And secondly, could there be downsides if in fact, the NMDA receptor is the focal point\u2026 Dr. INSEL: Right. DAVID: \u2026in terms of calcium influx. PALCA: Hey, David, you're asking a question that's a little more than a basic lay audience might be able to capture. So, let me see if I can ask Thomas Insel to translate your question and then take a stab at answering it. How's that? Dr. INSEL: Sure. Let's jump in. So the SSRIs that David is talking about are the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, drugs like Prozac, Paxil - now there are six of them that are available. And what all of them do is to block the reuptake of serotonin. There was a time when we thought that was really the essential story in depression, and we thought that there was the sort of chemical imbalance. The problem with that idea is that these drugs block the reuptake of serotonin within minutes. And yet, as we said before, it take sometimes six to eight weeks for them to really lift depression or to have any significant antidepressant effect. So as David says, there are a number of other effects of these compounds that have been now described, and one of them, remarkably is the birth of new neurons, new brain cells in a part of the brain that's important for learning and memory. Now, we don't know yet whether that is really the critical event and we don't know yet exactly how that interacts with whatever ketamine is doing, but it does seem clear that both that effect, which is a late effect of these drugs, and what ketamine is doing, which happens very quickly, are probably way downstream in this cascade of events that are necessary for someone with this terrible illness to begin to feel better. PALCA: Thanks for that call. Let's take another call now from Robert in Columbus, Ohio. Robert, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. ROBERT (Caller): Oh, thanks, man. I never miss this show. PALCA: Great. ROBERT: Just quick. I'll try to make it concise. I'm a special population -person. I'm a HIV positive and taking Atripla. And it has its own side effects and kind of wild strange dreams as well. But I also have depressive issues and mainly a high anxiety. And I'm a treatment-resistant to antidepressants because I have paradoxical responses to them. So I'm wondering - I mean, this sounds like a perfect thing for me. And I'm connected with doctors that really do research and clinical experimental stuff. And I'm wondering will this available and has it been studied on HIV population. PALCA: Interesting. Thanks for the call, Robert. Dr. INSEL: Well, Robert, thanks. It has not been studied in people who are HIV positive. It's an interesting question. The - but it is important to stress that this is really not something we're recommending to anybody to try. Ketamine is not only drug of abuse, but it's a drug that probably has such significant toxicity. We wouldn't want anybody to take it. The real challenge for us is to come up with compounds that hit some of the same sites, particularly something called the NR2B subunit, which we think is the active site here. And there are now compounds that are in experimental testing that do just that. That should be able to give us the benefit of ketamine without the risk that seems to go with this drug of abuse. PALCA: You know, hearing you describe the specific pathways or biochemical pathways in the brain - since I've got you in my clutches in a live radio program, I want to ask a question that's always bothered me, which is behavior is such a complex social, learned and environmental genetic phenomenon. And the myriad of chemicals going through our brain at any time is so complex. Isn't it always - I've always thought it's a little simple minded to think that if you tweak one little receptor or one little pathway, you're going to make somebody better. Dr. INSEL: Well, that's the - I think the lesson in all of these is you never tweak one little receptor. This is such a complex system that whatever you poke affects a thousand downstream molecules and receptors. We don't know that whole cascade, but it's a piece to gateway in, to begin to try to identify what may be the most important downstream effects that will count. You're right, though, this whole issue of trying to take neurochemistry, which is by itself so complicated, and link it to changes in behavior, it's a huge challenge. The good news is we have better tools to do that than we've ever had before. And I think for listeners, what's important is to not oversimplify this. I mean, we have, for a long time, told people that this, you know, depression is just a chemical imbalance. If you have depression, you're a quart low in serotonin. It just doesn't hold up. It's far more complicated than that. But we do believe, strongly, that this is a brain disorder, very much like Parkinson's and other brain disorders. We just haven't quite found a lesion or all of the lesions. There are probably multiple things involved, multiple brain areas. PALCA: Okay. Well, we have to leave it there. Dr. Thomas Insel, thank you so much for coming in. Dr. INSEL: My pleasure. Thank you. PALCA: Dr. Insel is director of the National Institute of Mental Health. We have to take a short break. But when we come back, we'll be talking about another brain activity, which is how we learn language. So stick around.  JOE PALCA, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Joe Palca. Ira Flatow is away.  Ketamine is an interesting drug. Veterinarians used it as an anesthetic, and it's a popular street drug for its hallucinogenic properties. And remarkably, now, it appears to be effective in treating the symptoms of depression. It works in hours while most antidepressants take weeks. It's also effective in people who are resistant to other drugs. Now, ketamine's side effects like those hallucinations I just mentioned will likely keep it off your drugstore or out of your drugstore. But if researchers can understand why ketamine works so quickly, they may be able to develop similar fast-acting drugs.  A study published this week in the journal Biological Psychiatry looks at what ketamine does in the in the brain and why it might be effective. Joining me in the studio to talk about the study and what it means for treatment is Thomas Insel. He's the director of the National Institute of Mental Heath, a branch of the National Institutes of Health. Welcome.  And if you'd like to talk about this question, give us a call. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. If you want more information about what we'll be talking about this hour, go to our Web site, at www. sciencefriday. com, where you'll find links to our topic.  And, so, Dr. Insel, I guess the first question that comes to mind here is whose idea was it in the first place to try using this hallucinogenic anesthetic on patients with depression?  Dr. THOMAS INSEL: (Director, the National Institute of Mental Heath): There had been some anecdotes about people being treated with this drug for chronic pain syndromes who've seem to have a relief of depression, but no one really had a very good sense of what that was about. Much of the interest in this came about actually from another side. It was trying to understand the biology of depression and trying to figure out how all the other medications that we knew about worked. We know that many of these antidepressants start off in difference places, affecting different receptors or different brain systems. But there must be some final common pathway for which all of them are able to relieve despair, hopelessness, depression.  And the question was is there a final target, is there a common target that one could come up with. And one of those is actually a target that this drug ketamine works on. And so the idea had come about partly from what we knew based on animal neuropharmacology that this may be worth trying out. And then, there have been now two studies that have looked in a fairly careful way, both small and both - at this point - highly experimental. But indeed, just as you said, it looks as if at least in one of these studies with about 18 subjects, that people who had not responded to other antidepressants, hadn't responded to ECT - electroconvulsive therapy - remained severely depressed and ill, responded now within hours to the infusion of ketamine.  PALCA: And when you talk about a target, what does that mean in this case? What do you - what kind of a thing would you target with a drug for a behavioral disease?  Dr. INSEL: We're at a point now where we can begin to understand the molecules that seem to be most important, not only for the illnesses themselves, but at this point for how some of the treatments are working. In this case, the particular molecular target is something called the NMDA receptor. It's a receptor we've known about for well, maybe two, almost three decades now and it's mostly been understood in studies of learning and memory; a little bit in terms of the ischemia and stroke as well - a lot of interests in how this might be a useful target for relieving some of the cell death that occurs with ischemic injury.

I'm Joe Palca. For the rest of this hour, a look at science and politics. Last week, the Fish and Wildlife Service announced that it will review eight decisions on endangered species made by Julie MacDonald. MacDonald resigned from the agency in May amid charges that she tampered with the science behind those decisions. Critics say the dust up at the Fish and Wildlife Service is just the latest example of how the Bush administration has been playing fast and loose with science. The Union of Concerned Scientists is one group that's been particularly vocal in its criticism. They have accused the administration of squelching data about global warming and filling advisory panels with people willing to tow the Republican Party line. But, you know, is the current administration doing anything all that different from previous administrations? Richard Nixon reportedly had an enemies list that included scientists. Bill Clinton is accused of delaying scientific reports on Mercury. Well, someone who has watched political - Washington administrations come and go and watch the strange way they deal with science or don't is Dan Greenberg -Daniel Greenberg actually. He's a science journalist and the author of \"Science, Money, and Politics: Political Triumph and Ethical Erosion. \" And, oh, he has a new book coming out, which is called, \"Science For Sale: The Perils, Rewards, and Delusions of Campus Capitalism. \" That'll be out next month from the University of Chicago Press. And he joins me here in the NPR studios in Washington. Welcome back, Dan. Mr. DANIEL GREENBERG (Science Journalist; Author, \"Science For Sale: The Perils, Rewards, and Delusions of Campus Capitalism\"): Thank you, Joe. Glad to be here. PALCA: And if you'd like to talk with Dan or me, or talk about this topic, give us a call. The number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. So, I mean, I don't know. We don't have to deal specifically with the Fish and Wildlife Service, but is this just another example of an administration that just doesn't care at all about science or is this business as usual for Washington? Mr. GREENBERG: Indeed, it is part of a pattern. But I think, if you want to look at the relations of this administration to science, you have to look at two areas, and that's where all the action is taking place and where this administration has been able to offend the scientific community to a degree I've never seen before. One is anything related to reproductive biology, and that is stem cells, contraception, things of that sort. In cracking down the area of reproductive biology, the administration is pandering to the evangelical religious fundamentalist right. The other involves matters that concern the business and corporate community. For example, (unintelligible) or ACCORD, would've put heavy financial burden, at least initially, on American industry, and the administration therefore wouldn't go along with that global change, anything of that sort. On environmental matters; wetland restrictions for example. Real estate people don't like that, and the administration kowtows to the real industry. So where they have a chance there to go against the science and show these two constituencies - two or three constituencies that we're really with you, they do it at the cost of offending the scientific community. PALCA: And what is the cause of offending the scientific community? And did it - as the editor of \"Nature\" used to say, do they do so at their peril or is it just who cares? Mr. GREENBERG: Well, there is really no two great peril except one thing that really, I think, is has sort of blown up in their face, is the stem cell issue. Because that has grabbed the imagination of the American people in terms of expectation of medical miracles. And Nancy Reagan even signed on to that and won against this administration. Generally, these are kind of, you know, back burner issues that the public doesn't pay much attention to and the press doesn't either. But stem cells and medical miracles and NIH, and cure of dread disease, prevention and so forth is an issue that is easily exploited in the imagination of the public. And I think that has happened now. I think that every survey that's been made shows that the public is really quite annoyed, offended, and feels threatened by the administration policies and restricting federal funds for stem cell research. PALCA: Hmm. But, you know, I am thinking back to the Clinton administration where, if you have scientists today, they'll talk about that as the good all days when people - they were revered. But it was the Clinton administration that pushed through the International Space Station, which scientists, by and large, said this is a terrible waste of money, and we don't want anything to do with it. And he doesn't take a hit for that. Mr. GREENBERG: Well, man in space has always been an issue with the scientists. The basic scientists from the universities feel that this is coming out of their budget, and it really has no scientific value. But there are other constituencies; industry, the imagine of the public, and a few others, that say we have to have man in space, and the next natural step is the International Space Station, and then Moon and Mars. But you will find, generally, a continuing thread going back to the early days of the space program that says that we should minimize man in space and put the money into planetary research. So they - the International Space Station is just a continuation of that old story. PALCA: So where does this Fish and Wildlife story fit into this picture? I mean, is it again be - would you argue a financial interest that might cause an animal to be taken off or put on endangered species list? I mean, that - there were big issues with this stickleback, I think. It's been recalled dozens of years ago where nuclear generators were being held up. Mr. GREENBERG: Spotted owl. PALCA: Spotted owl, yes, as well as the poster child, wasn't it? Mr. GREENBERG: Well, say anything endangered species can often entails some kind of economic consequences for various interests particularly the timbering interest. You can't go into that forest and cut down the trees because the spotted owl will be endangered. So I think that there, once again, this theme comes through of pandering to a particular economic interest that is part of the basic political core. PALCA: Okay. We're talking with Dan Greenberg about science and politics, and how White House and administrations past and present have modified or accepted the message that scientists have to offer. Our number is 800-989-8255. And let's take a call now from Nathan(ph) in Ann Arbor. Nathan, welcome to the program. Hello? NATHAN (Caller): Hi. I'm on the air? PALCA: Yes, you are. Go ahead. Welcome to the program. NATHAN: Thank you. One of the things that I'm curious about is the fact that scientists are - and inherent interest group within these controversies, especially - I was reading about stem cells and various other matters. And when you think about scientists giving advice to politicians in terms of policy issues, I think it's difficult for us to be able to actually - as much as we want to depoliticize science and perhaps think about the democratization of science, that in fact, scientists starting interest group and the way in which they influence policy actually is directly reflected of the fact that they have a desire for certain elements of science to actually move forward, especially looking at the human embryonic stem cell controversy. So I'm wondering if you could just comment on the fact that when politicians are seeking advice from scientists, how is it possible for us to actually separate the interest that scientists have and being able to actually extricate sort of this democratize position when it comes to policy making? Mr. GREENBERG: My observation over many years is that when politicians seek scientific advice, they're not looking for wisdom. They're looking for support for their preconceptions. They know where they want to go. They've made their decision, and they're very happy to have scientists with the proper credentials and say, yeah, you're right. That's really what we should do. They don't go in there with a blank saying, oh, this is a problem. Can you guys please suggest some kind of answer for it? PALCA: Okay. Nathan, thanks for very much for that call. Let's try Michael(ph) in Raleigh, North Carolina. MICHAEL (Caller): Hello. PALCA: Michael, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. MICHAEL: Can you hear me? PALCA: Yes, we can. MICHAEL: Well, I just want to comment on how the - most of the scientific community, at least in North Carolina has turned for its profits and not towards science. My mother works for a research trial(ph) institute. An institution that used to be incredibly well respected, huge government contract. But now, (unintelligible) savor's profit over, you know, scientific integrity (unintelligible) comments on how that scientific community sometimes now is leaning towards profit not for science. PALCA: Okay. Michael, thanks for that. I think we found one person who is going to go out and buy your new book, Dan. That sounds like any (unintelligible). Mr. GREENBERG: Go do it. Right. Commercialization is a very popular matter in the world of science today. Every university has a technology transfer office, has patent lawyers and they're looking to make money from what's going on their laboratories. And I think very interestingly, if that delegations coming over from countries all around the world saying show us how to do it, too. That is one of the facts - bedrock(ph) facts to modern science. It's an economic - has great economic value. And people who want to capture some of it for themselves or for their organization. PALCA: All right. Thanks for that call. Let's now - let's go now to Mary(ph) in Providence, Rhode Island. Mary, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. MARY (Caller): Hi. Thanks for having me on. PALCA: Sure. MARY: My question is this. From my perspective, I see that global warming has captured the public imagination in much the same way or even more so than the stem cell research and the promise of the medical miracle. And I'm just wondering how you see that playing out in the coming years, possibly the upcoming elections, and I'd see a lot of influence obviously in the younger generation in their response to environmental issues. So I'm just wondering if you see that as something that is may turn the public interest and public imagination may turn the administration around a little bit or drive electoral politic? Mr. GREENBERG: I think you're right. Global warming has grabbed the public imagination and has evoked enormous responses, evoked enormous support. Al Gore has been resurrected as a national figure on the global warming issue. And I think the administration's response finger to the wind, if I may say, has relented a bit on its hard line stand that concerning measures to stop or reduce global warming. It's another one of those issues that the scientific community, I think, has exploited successfully to some extent. But scientists really are not very political. They don't organize. They don't vote as a block. But the issue does have a lot of glamour and interest and fear to it, and the public gets latched on to it. PALCA: And but why? What changed? I mean, it feels like it had in four years ago or three years ago or two years ago, even now, it has. What - do you have a sense of what changed? Mr. GREENBERG: I think a lot of these dramatic pictures of the mountainside that was once covered with snow and now it's just, you know, plain rock has had some effect on public understanding. And then, I think there's accumulate of effect year after year aside. Al Gore took up this issue. I remember going to a hearing in the mid-70s. Nobody paid any attention to all. There was no audience. No one cared about it - virtually no press coverage. But as you pound on it year after year, and the summers are very hot, and you do see that the glaciers are melting away, I think the public at last says there maybe some problem there. PALCA: Mary, thanks very much for that call. MARY: Thank you. Thanks for the answer. PALCA: You bet. We're talking with Dan Greenberg about how politics - politics and science sometimes get along and sometimes don't. I'm Joe Palca and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Let's take another call now. Let's go to - I don't see the right number here. Greg in Spokane, Washington. Welcome to the program. GREG (Caller): I'm glad to get through. I love your show. It's my favorite. PALCA: Great. GREG: I'm not going to support the Bush administration in everything they do by any means, but giving them the blames for the Kyoto Protocol and for reduce - not allowing full stem cell funding isn't quite fair because until Bush don't allow it, there was no federal funding for stem cell research. And the Congress refused to ratify Kyoto, so Bush backing out of it really wasn't that much of his decision. PALCA: Hmm. Interesting point, Greg. What about that, Dan? Mr. GREENBERG: I think he's absolutely right there. There has not been any great enthusiasm in American politics or in the American economy to implement any of the Kyoto accords or long-term goals. And also, the political sensitivity about anything with stem cells and reproductive biology, contraception, and things like that, of course, long preceded George Bush. So we can't - he doesn't take the whole raps for these. It wouldn't be fair. PALCA: Yeah. It's always struck me as interesting that - I don't know what would have happened if President Clinton had moved more rapidly. But he certainly - he instigated the notion that it might be okay for the federal government to spend research dollars on embryonic stem cells - making the distinction that embryonic stem cells weren't embryos, which that was a fight he didn't want to have. But he let things languish so that by the time they got around to funding, he was out of office. So it was actually, I think, to some degree ironic that it was President Bush -George W. Bush, who actually was the first president to fund embryonic stem cell research with federal dollars. Mr. GREENBERG: Well, he split the difference in sort of interesting ways saying that the existing cell lines could be used and federal funds would be available for a research on them, but no more could be created. But as a matter of fact, the country is large and resilient and diverse and a great deal of stem cell research is going on with state funds, philanthropic and foundation funds. PALCA: What about this issue about - the current administration has come under a lot of heat for some of its appointment to advisory committees, where they take people with very strong ideologic positions and put them on advisory panels. For example, there was someone who is opposed to contraception on the FDA's panel that was making judgments about reproductive drugs. Is this unusual or is this business as usual? Mr. GREENBERG: Well, some of the appointments really have been appalling. I mean, people who were preset have rather prehistoric views on the uses - uses of modern science and social issues. I think actually if you cramp up the number of them relative to the number of slots on the advisory committees, turns out to be relatively small number. I think also something is quite important, and we haven't mentioned yet, is that Bush's appointments to head the major research agencies such as Dr. Zerhouni at NIH, for example. These are the mainstream appointments, I mean, they could just as well had been made by Bill Clinton. The people out of university background like the head of the undersecretary for Science and the Department of Energy previously was the chancellor at UC Riverside. The president's science advisor, John Marburger, he's probably the least influential of all of the science advisors going back 50 years. But he has served long than any of them. He says he is nominally a Democrat. And he comes out of that same mainstream background university presidency. He once headed a big government laboratory. So all the appointments haven't been too bad. But every once in a while, when an advisor or physician opens up, again, pandering the evangelical, fundamentalist right or the business community, they'll put somebody in there who'd create just great outrage. PALCA: All right. Well, Dan, that's where we're going to leave at this hour. Thanks very much for coming in. Mr. GREENBERG: Thank you very much, Joe. PALCA: Dan Greenberg is a science journalist. His new book is called \"Science for Sale: The Perils, Rewards and Delusions of Campus Capitalism. \" It'll be out in September from the University of Chicago Press.  JOE PALCA, host:  From NPR News, this is THIS TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca.  For the rest of this hour, a look at science and politics.  Last week, the Fish and Wildlife Service announced that it will review eight decisions on endangered species made by Julie MacDonald. MacDonald resigned from the agency in May amid charges that she tampered with the science behind those decisions. Critics say the dust up at the Fish and Wildlife Service is just the latest example of how the Bush administration has been playing fast and loose with science.  The Union of Concerned Scientists is one group that's been particularly vocal in its criticism. They have accused the administration of squelching data about global warming and filling advisory panels with people willing to tow the Republican Party line.  But, you know, is the current administration doing anything all that different from previous administrations? Richard Nixon reportedly had an enemies list that included scientists. Bill Clinton is accused of delaying scientific reports on Mercury.  Well, someone who has watched political - Washington administrations come and go and watch the strange way they deal with science or don't is Dan Greenberg -Daniel Greenberg actually. He's a science journalist and the author of \"Science, Money, and Politics: Political Triumph and Ethical Erosion. \" And, oh, he has a new book coming out, which is called, \"Science For Sale: The Perils, Rewards, and Delusions of Campus Capitalism. \" That'll be out next month from the University of Chicago Press. And he joins me here in the NPR studios in Washington. Welcome back, Dan.  Mr. DANIEL GREENBERG (Science Journalist; Author, \"Science For Sale: The Perils, Rewards, and Delusions of Campus Capitalism\"): Thank you, Joe. Glad to be here.  PALCA: And if you'd like to talk with Dan or me, or talk about this topic, give us a call. The number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK.  So, I mean, I don't know. We don't have to deal specifically with the Fish and Wildlife Service, but is this just another example of an administration that just doesn't care at all about science or is this business as usual for Washington?  Mr. GREENBERG: Indeed, it is part of a pattern. But I think, if you want to look at the relations of this administration to science, you have to look at two areas, and that's where all the action is taking place and where this administration has been able to offend the scientific community to a degree I've never seen before. One is anything related to reproductive biology, and that is stem cells, contraception, things of that sort. In cracking down the area of reproductive biology, the administration is pandering to the evangelical religious fundamentalist right.  The other involves matters that concern the business and corporate community. For example, (unintelligible) or ACCORD, would've put heavy financial burden, at least initially, on American industry, and the administration therefore wouldn't go along with that global change, anything of that sort.  On environmental matters; wetland restrictions for example. Real estate people don't like that, and the administration kowtows to the real industry.  So where they have a chance there to go against the science and show these two constituencies - two or three constituencies that we're really with you, they do it at the cost of offending the scientific community.  PALCA: And what is the cause of offending the scientific community? And did it - as the editor of \"Nature\" used to say, do they do so at their peril or is it just who cares?  Mr. GREENBERG: Well, there is really no two great peril except one thing that really, I think, is has sort of blown up in their face, is the stem cell issue. Because that has grabbed the imagination of the American people in terms of expectation of medical miracles. And Nancy Reagan even signed on to that and won against this administration.  Generally, these are kind of, you know, back burner issues that the public doesn't pay much attention to and the press doesn't either. But stem cells and medical miracles and NIH, and cure of dread disease, prevention and so forth is an issue that is easily exploited in the imagination of the public. And I think that has happened now. I think that every survey that's been made shows that the public is really quite annoyed, offended, and feels threatened by the administration policies and restricting federal funds for stem cell research.  PALCA: Hmm. But, you know, I am thinking back to the Clinton administration where, if you have scientists today, they'll talk about that as the good all days when people - they were revered. But it was the Clinton administration that pushed through the International Space Station, which scientists, by and large, said this is a terrible waste of money, and we don't want anything to do with it. And he doesn't take a hit for that.  Mr. GREENBERG: Well, man in space has always been an issue with the scientists. The basic scientists from the universities feel that this is coming out of their budget, and it really has no scientific value. But there are other constituencies; industry, the imagine of the public, and a few others, that say we have to have man in space, and the next natural step is the International Space Station, and then Moon and Mars. But you will find, generally, a continuing thread going back to the early days of the space program that says that we should minimize man in space and put the money into planetary research. So they - the International Space Station is just a continuation of that old story.  PALCA: So where does this Fish and Wildlife story fit into this picture? I mean, is it again be - would you argue a financial interest that might cause an animal to be taken off or put on endangered species list? I mean, that - there were big issues with this stickleback, I think. It's been recalled dozens of years ago where nuclear generators were being held up.  Mr. GREENBERG: Spotted owl.  PALCA: Spotted owl, yes, as well as the poster child, wasn't it?  Mr. GREENBERG: Well, say anything endangered species can often entails some kind of economic consequences for various interests particularly the timbering interest. You can't go into that forest and cut down the trees because the spotted owl will be endangered.  So I think that there, once again, this theme comes through of pandering to a particular economic interest that is part of the basic political core.  PALCA: Okay. We're talking with Dan Greenberg about science and politics, and how White House and administrations past and present have modified or accepted the message that scientists have to offer. Our number is 800-989-8255. And let's take a call now from Nathan(ph) in Ann Arbor. Nathan, welcome to the program. Hello?  NATHAN (Caller): Hi. I'm on the air?  PALCA: Yes, you are. Go ahead. Welcome to the program.  NATHAN: Thank you. One of the things that I'm curious about is the fact that scientists are - and inherent interest group within these controversies, especially - I was reading about stem cells and various other matters. And when you think about scientists giving advice to politicians in terms of policy issues, I think it's difficult for us to be able to actually - as much as we want to depoliticize science and perhaps think about the democratization of science, that in fact, scientists starting interest group and the way in which they influence policy actually is directly reflected of the fact that they have a desire for certain elements of science to actually move forward, especially looking at the human embryonic stem cell controversy.  So I'm wondering if you could just comment on the fact that when politicians are seeking advice from scientists, how is it possible for us to actually separate the interest that scientists have and being able to actually extricate sort of this democratize position when it comes to policy making?  Mr. GREENBERG: My observation over many years is that when politicians seek scientific advice, they're not looking for wisdom. They're looking for support for their preconceptions. They know where they want to go. They've made their decision, and they're very happy to have scientists with the proper credentials and say, yeah, you're right. That's really what we should do. They don't go in there with a blank saying, oh, this is a problem. Can you guys please suggest some kind of answer for it?  PALCA: Okay. Nathan, thanks for very much for that call. Let's try Michael(ph) in Raleigh, North Carolina.  MICHAEL (Caller): Hello.  PALCA: Michael, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  MICHAEL: Can you hear me?  PALCA: Yes, we can.  MICHAEL: Well, I just want to comment on how the - most of the scientific community, at least in North Carolina has turned for its profits and not towards science. My mother works for a research trial(ph) institute. An institution that used to be incredibly well respected, huge government contract. But now, (unintelligible) savor's profit over, you know, scientific integrity (unintelligible) comments on how that scientific community sometimes now is leaning towards profit not for science.  PALCA: Okay. Michael, thanks for that. I think we found one person who is going to go out and buy your new book, Dan. That sounds like any (unintelligible).  Mr. GREENBERG: Go do it. Right. Commercialization is a very popular matter in the world of science today. Every university has a technology transfer office, has patent lawyers and they're looking to make money from what's going on their laboratories. And I think very interestingly, if that delegations coming over from countries all around the world saying show us how to do it, too. That is one of the facts - bedrock(ph) facts to modern science. It's an economic - has great economic value. And people who want to capture some of it for themselves or for their organization.  PALCA: All right. Thanks for that call. Let's now - let's go now to Mary(ph) in Providence, Rhode Island. Mary, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  MARY (Caller): Hi. Thanks for having me on.  PALCA: Sure.  MARY: My question is this. From my perspective, I see that global warming has captured the public imagination in much the same way or even more so than the stem cell research and the promise of the medical miracle. And I'm just wondering how you see that playing out in the coming years, possibly the upcoming elections, and I'd see a lot of influence obviously in the younger generation in their response to environmental issues.  So I'm just wondering if you see that as something that is may turn the public interest and public imagination may turn the administration around a little bit or drive electoral politic?  Mr. GREENBERG: I think you're right. Global warming has grabbed the public imagination and has evoked enormous responses, evoked enormous support. Al Gore has been resurrected as a national figure on the global warming issue. And I think the administration's response finger to the wind, if I may say, has relented a bit on its hard line stand that concerning measures to stop or reduce global warming.  It's another one of those issues that the scientific community, I think, has exploited successfully to some extent. But scientists really are not very political. They don't organize. They don't vote as a block. But the issue does have a lot of glamour and interest and fear to it, and the public gets latched on to it.  PALCA: And but why? What changed? I mean, it feels like it had in four years ago or three years ago or two years ago, even now, it has. What - do you have a sense of what changed?  Mr. GREENBERG: I think a lot of these dramatic pictures of the mountainside that was once covered with snow and now it's just, you know, plain rock has had some effect on public understanding. And then, I think there's accumulate of effect year after year aside.  Al Gore took up this issue. I remember going to a hearing in the mid-70s. Nobody paid any attention to all. There was no audience. No one cared about it - virtually no press coverage.  But as you pound on it year after year, and the summers are very hot, and you do see that the glaciers are melting away, I think the public at last says there maybe some problem there.  PALCA: Mary, thanks very much for that call.  MARY: Thank you. Thanks for the answer.  PALCA: You bet. We're talking with Dan Greenberg about how politics - politics and science sometimes get along and sometimes don't. I'm Joe Palca and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.

I'm Melissa Block. Russian explorers are in the midst of a bold mission. They want to plant a Russian flag two and a half miles under the sea on the Arctic seabed directly beneath the North Pole. That Russian flag will be a symbol or Russia's desire to claim hundreds of thousands of square miles of the Arctic shelf and its untapped oil and gas deposits, which are estimated to be huge. As the polar icecap shrinks, interest in tapping these resources is growing. Deep-sea submersibles have been making test dives in the waters near the North Pole. And Max Delaney with the Moscow Times joins us to tell us about how the mission is going. I understand that these test dives have been going on, but the flag is not planted yet. Is that right? Mr. MAX DELANEY (Staff Writer, The Moscow Times): Yeah, no. These test dives have been happening. We got confirmation that they went to the test dives yesterday quite successfully. But as yet, these were only to depths of one and a half thousand meters. Eventually, they're going to dive to 4,000 meters. And that will be, hopefully, in the next few days, according to the latest reports coming from the ships. BLOCK: So they think they can do it? Mr. DELANEY: I think they're pretty confident about it. I don't think they would have publicized it quite so impressively had they been less than confident that they could achieve it. Although having said that, there have been a few hitches so far. One of the ships ran into engine trouble just after it had left the north of Russia, but they mended it. And they're all back on course and slightly delayed, but they should make the dive. BLOCK: The idea here is that they're trying to map the bottom of the ocean floor here. They're looking for geologic evidence that the seabed is part of Russia, so they can claim it. Mr. DELANEY: Yeah. Russia has to, before a U. N. commission, offer the proof that the mainland is connected to this underwater shelf. It's a very, very complex geological exploration that has to go on. BLOCK: And there are a lot of competing interests here. Countries that were saying, you know, not so fast, Russia. Mr. DELANEY: Yeah. The part of land that Russia was saying is connected to the mainland actually runs all the way across the North Pole underwater to a point somewhere between Canada and Greenland, Greenland being governed by Denmark. And then you've got the U. S. via Alaska and Norway. They are the two Arctic nations, which supposedly have some sort of claims. BLOCK: And the idea is that with the polar icecap shrinking, that this area is becoming somewhat more accessible. Mr. DELANEY: Yeah, particularly from the north of Russia, I think. That's a particular point of melt - of the ice breaking up. So possibly, that's an area where Russia will be looking at. And with the technology improving, with oil prices rising to make it economically viable to drill for oil in these more expensive, more far-off and difficult to reach locations, people are seriously - countries, companies are seriously eyeing out the Arctic.

I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. Chief Justice John Roberts is resuming his vacation at his summer home in Maine today. He's back from the hospital after experiencing what his doctors called a benign idiopathic seizure. NPR's Joanne Silberner tells us what this condition is and what seizures can mean for people who have them. JOANNE SILBERNER: Benign means it's not a tumor that's the problem. Doctors have ruled that out. And idiopathic? That means of unknown cause. No one really knows what's causing the seizures. Nonetheless, such episodes are surprisingly common, says Dr. Elson So. He's a neurologist with the Mayo Clinic. Dr. ELSON SO (Neurologist, Mayo Clinic): Eight to nine percent of the population in a lifespan of about 70 to 80 years may experience at least one seizure. About third of those may experience a recurrent or second seizure. SILBERNER: Seizures can be dramatic, but some people don't even know they've had one. Most last from seconds to maybe a couple of minutes. Dr. So says people who've experienced a seizure should get to a doctor who will check for infections, fever, tumor, strokes or other conditions that can cause them. If you've had two unexplained seizures, doctors are ready to say you have epilepsy. Dr. SO: The reason is because the chance of having a third seizure would come up to close to 80 percent, which some scientific studies had shown. SILBERNER: Doctors will usually prescribe medication for most of those people. And that safely and effectively eliminates or at least minimizes the episodes. Dr. SO: This condition is not expected to affect a person's general function or ability to work or enjoy life. SILBERNER: He says seizures certainly don't harm the ability to think. Epilepsy experts recommend that if you see someone having a seizure, help him or her lie down and maybe put something soft under the head to protect it. There is no risk that they'll swallow their tongue - that's an old myth. Former California Congressman Tony Coelho has firsthand experience with that. He has epilepsy. Mr. TONY COELHO (Former California Congressman): My wife, one time, put her finger in my mouth and I bit it. She still has a scar from it. That was about 20 years ago. SILBERNER: Coelho has had epilepsy since he was child, though his parents didn't tell him the diagnosis. As a young man in the early 1960s, he tried to join the priesthood. His application to the seminary was rejected because at the time, the Catholic Church wouldn't allow men with seizure conditions to become priests. Coelho says some gains have been made since then. But people who have seizures still face a lot of stigma. Mr. COELHO: There's nothing contagious. There's nothing they're going to do to you. They're not possessed. It's just a matter - the motor functions of the body are going through some contractions and so forth. They are fine. Once they complete seizing - and we're not dangerous to anybody during that process. SILBERNER: Coelho has been on anti-seizure medication for more than 40 years, but he still has occasional seizures. Afterwards, he's briefly tired and takes some nap. Then, he goes back to whatever he was doing, he says, like nothing ever happened. Joanne Silberner, NPR News.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block.

Epilepsy experts recommend that if you see someone having a seizure, help him or her lie down and maybe put something soft under the head to protect it. There is no risk that they'll swallow their tongue - that's an old myth.  Former California Congressman Tony Coelho has firsthand experience with that. He has epilepsy.  Mr. TONY COELHO (Former California Congressman): My wife, one time, put her finger in my mouth and I bit it. She still has a scar from it. That was about 20 years ago.  SILBERNER: Coelho has had epilepsy since he was child, though his parents didn't tell him the diagnosis. As a young man in the early 1960s, he tried to join the priesthood. His application to the seminary was rejected because at the time, the Catholic Church wouldn't allow men with seizure conditions to become priests. Coelho says some gains have been made since then. But people who have seizures still face a lot of stigma.  Mr. COELHO: There's nothing contagious. There's nothing they're going to do to you. They're not possessed. It's just a matter - the motor functions of the body are going through some contractions and so forth. They are fine. Once they complete seizing - and we're not dangerous to anybody during that process.  SILBERNER: Coelho has been on anti-seizure medication for more than 40 years, but he still has occasional seizures. Afterwards, he's briefly tired and takes some nap. Then, he goes back to whatever he was doing, he says, like nothing ever happened.  Joanne Silberner, NPR News. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2007 NPR.

Well, that changed, as NPR's Nell Boyce reports, after doctors implanted electrodes in his brain. NELL BOYCE: The man's mother didn't want to give her name, but in a press conference today she explained what happened eight years ago to her son. Unidentified Woman: He was robbed. He was beaten. He was kicked about in his head. His skull was completely crushed in. BOYCE: He had emergency surgery and then his mother met with a doctor. Unidentified Woman: He said - I'm going to tell you this, he said. If your son pulls out of this, he will be a vegetable the rest of his life. BOYCE: The doctor wasn't quite right. Her son did not end up in what's called a persistent vegetative state - that means no signs that a person is aware of their surroundings; no responses to the outside world. Instead, her son was minimally conscious. He sometimes seemed like he was trying to communicate. He might nod his head or mouth a word. But mostly, he barely moved and kept his eyes closed. He spent years like this. Unidentified Woman: And each time I visited my son in the nursing home, and on my way home - excuse me - I would cry, because it was just so hard for a mother to see her child like that, and I prayed for a miracle. BOYCE: Then, she was contacted by a team of doctors. They wanted to test a new treatment. It's a device sort of like a pacemaker. Joseph Giacino works at the JFK Johnson Rehabilitation Institute in New Jersey. He says the device has a box that goes in the chest and wires that go to the brain. Dr. JOSEPH GIACINO (Associate Director of Neuropsychology, JFK Johnson Rehabilitation Institute): And at the end of those wires are the electrodes.

The scientists hope that by prodding it, they could boost the activity of other parts of the brain. Giacino says they did the surgery over a year ago. Dr. GIACINO: We immediately saw some changes, this was within, literally, within the first day. BOYCE: The man's eyes opened. He would turn his head to look at people who were speaking. Now, he can drink from a cup and chew so he doesn't need a feeding tube. What's more, he talks. If you ask him to complete sentences like, I eat my dinner with a, he'll say, fork. He remembers things, like the Pledge of Allegiance. But Giacino says he can't seem to form new memories. Dr. GIACINO: What he has learned is that he's in a hospital. He knows that. But he - if you ask him why, he just sort of, you know, shrugs his shoulders or he'll say, I don't know. BOYCE: His mother is overwhelmed by these changes. Unidentified Woman: He can express pain, he can cry, and he can laugh. The most important part is he can say mommy and pop. He can say I love you, mommy. BOYCE: The researchers say the man's progress is encouraging, but they're not jumping to any conclusions. Dr. GIACINO: For this particular person, they were improved by this, and that's great. But we don't know until we do the research whether anybody else will improve. BOYCE: Nicholas Schiff was part of the research team. He works at the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York.

He's medical director of the Brain Injury Association of America. One thing he liked is how the researchers first used advanced brain scans to confirm that their subject had hidden but functioning brain pathways. Dr. GREGORY O'SHANICK (National Medical Director, Brain Injury Association of America): Those were almost like the screening test to see if this was going to work. And with that kind of precision, it had incredible results. BOYCE: Researchers say that kind of hidden brain activity doesn't exist in people in persistent vegetative states, so this approach would not be expected to help them. For example, a similar brain implant did not help Terry Schiavo, the Florida woman whose condition sparked a national debate two years ago. Nell Boyce, NPR News.

I'm Ira Flatow. Nanotechnology is arguably one of the hottest, if not the hottest fields of technology research today. And it's yielding a bonanza of products that you can buy - hundreds of products, from clothing to cosmetics to car wax. And in many of these products, they use tiny, microscopic particles, nanoparticles, tiny enough up to get into your skin or into your bloodstream. Just how safe are these particles? How much do we know about how they react once you inhale them or breathe them in or put - get into your skin or put them on a cream? And that really is a topic up for debate these days. And yesterday, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency held a public hearing in Virginia, where anyone could comment on the agency's new Nanoscale Materials Stewardship Program. That's a program that the agency is proposing to make sure nanotech won't harm us, or the environment, getting out there into the wildlife. Right now, the agency is classifying nanotech under the Toxic Substances Control Act. That law passed before nanotech products appeared and it covers pollutants that are bigger than nanoparticles. And the EPA is also proposing that companies voluntarily tell the EPA what their nanotech products involve, what safety steps they're taking to protect workers, customers and the environment. Will these approaches work? Our guests today both testified at yesterday's hearings and they have slightly opposing views on the issue. Charles Auer is technical director of the EPA's Nanoscale Materials Stewardship Program. He joins us by phone from his office at EPA headquarters in Washington. Welcome to the program. Dr. CHARLES AUER (Technical director, Environmental Protection Agency Nanoscale Materials Stewardship Program): Thank you, Ira, for having me on your show today. FLATOW: You're welcome. Dr. Terry Davies was assistant administrator for policy planning and the environment at the EPA under the first Bush administration. He's now senior advisor to the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies at the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars in Washington, where he published a report last May called, \"EPA and Nanotechnology: Oversight in the 21st Century. \" He joins us from our NPR studios in Washington. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Davies. Dr. TERRY DAVIES (Senior Advisor, Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies, Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars): Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: Now, I promised the EPA that Dr. Auer could go on first, so I'm going to keep my promise. You're on, Dr. Auer. Dr. AUER: Indeed. Thank you, Ira. At EPA, our foremost and primary concern is to protect people and the environment, including protecting them from any potential risks from emerging technologies like nanotechnology. We recognize that nanotechnology has tremendous potential to produce innovative and less polluting products. But these and other benefits from this new technology can only be realized if there's proper scientific and regulatory oversight to protect the people and the environment. Our oversight on nanoscale materials is well under way under the Toxic Substances Control Act, which is the law that regulates industrial chemicals in the U. S. We're consulting with leading experts on this topic and getting their advice on how best to do this, and we're also proceeding in an open and transparent manner. We've had a long history at EPA of successfully addressing emerging science issues. And to provide appropriate oversight on nanoscale materials, we're doing four things. We've developed and are implementing a white paper that outlines our research strategy to develop the science needed to assess these materials. All new chemical nanoscale materials are subject to a regulatory requirement that they be notified to EPA and be reviewed by EPA before their introduction into commerce. We can then take necessary regulatory actions to control those new chemical nanoscale materials. Then, to complement the new chemicals program, we are bringing forward for comment the Nanoscale Materials Stewardship Program, the subject of the public meeting, from yesterday. We hope to, through this effort, to develop a sound strategy to provide a firm scientific foundation for oversight on existing chemical nanoscale materials. The program will develop key scientific information and allow EPA to engage with companies to assess and take any appropriate risk-management actions on these existing chemical nanoscale materials. We think this approach will enable responsible development of this important technology. We expect to have this program development completed this year, and participation initiated in 2008. FLATOW: All right. I got to have to break in here because I haven't got all that time to finish your statement. Dr. AUER: Well, finally - I'm almost done. FLATOW: Okay. Good. Dr. AUER: Finally, we're working with our international colleagues towards common approaches, as well as shared efforts to develop the test data needed to establish a sound scientific understanding. FLATOW: Okay. Sounds interesting. What - Dr. Davies, you wrote in a Boston Globe editorial, co-authored with William Ruckelshaus, the first EPA administrator, if I remember correctly, under the Nixon administration. . . Dr. DAVIES: That is correct. FLATOW: . . . that you don't think these are adequate enough of measures. Dr. DAVIES: No, I don't. And a lot of the things that Charlie outlined are necessary and useful. And EPA, for example, on the international level, has been one of the leaders in dealing with nanotechnology. And I think they're to be congratulated on that. But in terms - if you look at yesterday's meeting, there were in fact two papers that EPA issued. One was on the stewardship program, which Charlie mentioned, which is a purely voluntary program and involves simply people submitting information to EPA. EPA is not going to do anything with that information. It's purely a way of educating EPA, if you want, about nanotechnology. That's a useful step, but it's hardly providing any protection for the American public. More importantly, the second paper that the agency issued dealt with this question of new chemicals. And to understand the context, one has to understand that the Toxic Substances Act only reviews new chemicals for their health and safety. It has some authorities to deal with existing chemicals, but most of those are not usable. They've been struck down by the courts, certainly, were very weak to begin with. The second paper that EPA issued yesterday said that they will not take size into account when they're defining new chemicals. Now, as you know, size is what defines nanomaterials. So, in effect, the agency has said, when we get a new chemical notification, we don't know, much less care, whether it's nanomaterial or it isn't nanomaterial. And how you can build an adequate regulatory program when you don't take the size of the particle into account -the size of what you're regulating -  mystifies me. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Charles Auer, does the EPA have enough scientists to actually evaluate what gets - the paperwork that gets - the research that gets handed in there? Dr. AUER: Yes. Our plan, I think, is very clear in the stewardship papers that we put forward that we would review the information submitted and work with the companies to have them undertake any needed risk management measures. One of the other components of our stewardship program is to have the companies agree in advance to adhere to a basic set of risk management practices as they commercialize these materials. FLATOW: Dr. Davies. What's wrong with that? Dr. DAVIES: What's wrong with it is that if you have a purely voluntary program and all you're trying to do is encourage firms to take adequate measures of oversight, it's the bad guys - it's the guys who won't volunteer, who don't get into a voluntary program - that you're concerned about. And that's the reason why voluntary programs don't work in situations like this. Dr. AUER: If I can comment. . . FLATOW: Sure. Dr. AUER: I think Dr. Davies underestimates the significance of policy paper on new versus existing chemicals. Under this approach, many of the important nanomaterials, such as fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, would be new chemicals and would be therefore subject to regulatory controls. We are applying the current legal framework that exists in the U. S. under the Toxic Substances Control Act. And we think under that framework that metal oxides, such as titanium dioxide that are made at nanoscale, may in fact be existing chemicals. However, we do take the crystal structure of those materials into consideration. And if the crystal structure that the manufacturer intends to commercialize is not on the inventory, that would make it a new chemical. In addition, any derivatized or functionalized or coded nanoparticles, be they organic or inorganic, those would be subject to new chemical requirements as long as there's a chemical reaction involved in the coding or the derivatization. FLATOW: Will the EPA do any studies into the risks, environmental risks, posed by nanoparticles? Dr. AUER: We have a very active research effort, which is growing every year. Our research effort is focused on the environment effects and the environmental fate of nanomaterials. We also, under the stewardship program, have a so-called in-depth component, where we will be working with industry and other stakeholders to develop a testing and research program to provide the scientific understanding needed to deal with these materials. Dr. DAVIES: I think it's important to point out in this context that of all the money being spent by the federal government on nanotechnology, something between one and three percent is being spent on health and safety studies. FLATOW: And you write. . . Dr. DAVIES: That's not enough. FLATOW: Yeah, you say we don't have enough knowledge of how they affect, not only the environment but people. Dr. DAVIES: That's right. You need to do a whole lot more research than is being done. And if I can just return to Charlie's previous comment, nobody knows, because since you don't have to identify whether something is or is not a nanomaterial when you submit it under the Toxic Substances Act, but by my calculation, I think of 15 notices that probably were nanomaterials, 14 of them were decided - and this is in the last couple of years - 14 of them, the agency decided, were existing chemicals and therefore not subject to review. Dr. AUER: Well, no. Actually, you've got the statistics a little off there. Dr. DAVIES: I'd welcome. . . Dr. AUER: Sure. Dr. DAVIES: . . . but since you don't know what are nanomaterials. . . Dr. AUER: But we do. We do, Terry. We do. Any time we receive a new chemical notification on a material that appears to be nanosized, we ask the notifier a series of questions so we can understand the size range, the presence of novel properties and so forth. Now, in our new chemicals experience, there was one notification for a nanoscale material, which clearly exhibited unique properties. For the other materials that were nanosized, they clearly were nanoscale materials, but they did not exhibit any unique properties. Dr. DAVIES: We get to the key point here, because the question is what do you mean by properties. If we're talking about biological effects or how they're distributed in the environment, I do not believe that you can say that a nanosized piece of silver, let's say, behaves the same as an ingot of silver. The biological differences are significant and that means that the agency has to review it. FLATOW: Mr. Davies, hang on, I'll give you a chance to reply. I have to just remind everybody that I'm Ira Flatow and this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Dr. AUER: Those are good points, Terry. And the size of the materials is certainly critical in assessing the exposure and the effects. The point that I was making is essentially recognizing that nanoscale materials have been around for millennia. There's a published paper where the carbonaceous material in Damascus swords was actually carbon nanotubes from whatever 2,000 years ago. The point I'm making is that there are a number of things that are small in size. We've been using them in technology for many years. Fumed silica is an example of that. We assess those materials, considering them to be more common to traditional chemicals than to something which embodies all of the elements of nanotechnology. We are particularly alert to any nanoscale materials that demonstrate an ability to exhibit unusual or novel properties and would then ask the appropriate questions to understand those materials as needed. FLATOW: You know, lead has been around forever, but the Romans had no idea it was going to kill them. Dr. DAVIES: Exactly. Dr. AUER: Well, that is true. But a lot of understanding has developed over time. And I think the research efforts which are growing, the in-depth program which will develop basic and detailed information on these materials, as well as an international collaboration to develop a foundation data set on representative nanomaterials, I believe, will speed the development of the data which are necessary to provide for a sound, scientific assessment basis. FLATOW: I have a - just a couple of minutes. Dr. Davies, you say that the voluntary program is not adequate. What would be an alternative to volunteer? Dr. DAVIES: An alternative would be to use the Toxic Substances Control Act to require that nanomaterials be submitted under the new chemical provisions of the act. And I think you can do that, and have EPA review nanomaterials for their health and safety effects before you can put them on the market. FLATOW: Any problem? Mr. Auer, any problem with that? I'm waiting for you react. I guess I have to prod you a little bit. Dr. AUER: Well, I think the approach that we've outlined provides a thoughtful and expeditious approach to develop the understanding and obtain needed oversight. If we were to attempt to do this under regulatory measures only, I think it would take number of years to develop and implement those measures. We actually lack the kind of understanding which is needed to provide a thoughtful and informed approach. The stewardship program plus the other work will provide that understanding. And if regulatory measures are needed in the future, we will take those acts. FLATOW: I gave Mr. Auer first words. Dr. Davies, you get the last word. I have 30 seconds. Dr. DAVIES: Okay. I think that nanotechnology is a wonderfully promising technology. And, in part, to guarantee that the public doesn't react against it, we need a regulatory oversight system. We need something that protects the American public from any potential health or environmental effects, and you're not going to do that on a voluntary basis. FLATOW: All right. Well, hopefully, big technology. We will continue watching this story. Thank you, Dr. Terry Davies, senior advisor to the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies at Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Charles Auer, technical director of the Nanoscale Materials Stewardship Program at the EPA in Washington. Thank you for taking time to be with us. Dr. DAVIES: Thank you, Ira. Dr. AUER: Thank you for this opportunity. FLATOW: You're welcome. Have a good weekend.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  Nanotechnology is arguably one of the hottest, if not the hottest fields of technology research today. And it's yielding a bonanza of products that you can buy - hundreds of products, from clothing to cosmetics to car wax. And in many of these products, they use tiny, microscopic particles, nanoparticles, tiny enough up to get into your skin or into your bloodstream.  Just how safe are these particles? How much do we know about how they react once you inhale them or breathe them in or put - get into your skin or put them on a cream?  And that really is a topic up for debate these days. And yesterday, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency held a public hearing in Virginia, where anyone could comment on the agency's new Nanoscale Materials Stewardship Program. That's a program that the agency is proposing to make sure nanotech won't harm us, or the environment, getting out there into the wildlife.  Right now, the agency is classifying nanotech under the Toxic Substances Control Act. That law passed before nanotech products appeared and it covers pollutants that are bigger than nanoparticles. And the EPA is also proposing that companies voluntarily tell the EPA what their nanotech products involve, what safety steps they're taking to protect workers, customers and the environment. Will these approaches work?  Our guests today both testified at yesterday's hearings and they have slightly opposing views on the issue. Charles Auer is technical director of the EPA's Nanoscale Materials Stewardship Program. He joins us by phone from his office at EPA headquarters in Washington. Welcome to the program.  Dr. CHARLES AUER (Technical director, Environmental Protection Agency Nanoscale Materials Stewardship Program): Thank you, Ira, for having me on your show today.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Dr. Terry Davies was assistant administrator for policy planning and the environment at the EPA under the first Bush administration. He's now senior advisor to the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies at the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars in Washington, where he published a report last May called, \"EPA and Nanotechnology: Oversight in the 21st Century. \" He joins us from our NPR studios in Washington. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Davies.  Dr. TERRY DAVIES (Senior Advisor, Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies, Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars): Thank you, Ira.  FLATOW: Now, I promised the EPA that Dr. Auer could go on first, so I'm going to keep my promise. You're on, Dr. Auer.  Dr. AUER: Indeed. Thank you, Ira. At EPA, our foremost and primary concern is to protect people and the environment, including protecting them from any potential risks from emerging technologies like nanotechnology. We recognize that nanotechnology has tremendous potential to produce innovative and less polluting products.  But these and other benefits from this new technology can only be realized if there's proper scientific and regulatory oversight to protect the people and the environment. Our oversight on nanoscale materials is well under way under the Toxic Substances Control Act, which is the law that regulates industrial chemicals in the U. S.  We're consulting with leading experts on this topic and getting their advice on how best to do this, and we're also proceeding in an open and transparent manner. We've had a long history at EPA of successfully addressing emerging science issues. And to provide appropriate oversight on nanoscale materials, we're doing four things.  We've developed and are implementing a white paper that outlines our research strategy to develop the science needed to assess these materials. All new chemical nanoscale materials are subject to a regulatory requirement that they be notified to EPA and be reviewed by EPA before their introduction into commerce.  We can then take necessary regulatory actions to control those new chemical nanoscale materials. Then, to complement the new chemicals program, we are bringing forward for comment the Nanoscale Materials Stewardship Program, the subject of the public meeting, from yesterday. We hope to, through this effort, to develop a sound strategy to provide a firm scientific foundation for oversight on existing chemical nanoscale materials.  The program will develop key scientific information and allow EPA to engage with companies to assess and take any appropriate risk-management actions on these existing chemical nanoscale materials.  We think this approach will enable responsible development of this important technology. We expect to have this program development completed this year, and participation initiated in 2008.  FLATOW: All right. I got to have to break in here because I haven't got all that time to finish your statement.  Dr. AUER: Well, finally - I'm almost done.  FLATOW: Okay. Good.  Dr. AUER: Finally, we're working with our international colleagues towards common approaches, as well as shared efforts to develop the test data needed to establish a sound scientific understanding.  FLATOW: Okay. Sounds interesting. What - Dr. Davies, you wrote in a Boston Globe editorial, co-authored with William Ruckelshaus, the first EPA administrator, if I remember correctly, under the Nixon administration. . .  Dr. DAVIES: That is correct.  FLATOW: . . . that you don't think these are adequate enough of measures.  Dr. DAVIES: No, I don't. And a lot of the things that Charlie outlined are necessary and useful. And EPA, for example, on the international level, has been one of the leaders in dealing with nanotechnology. And I think they're to be congratulated on that. But in terms - if you look at yesterday's meeting, there were in fact two papers that EPA issued. One was on the stewardship program, which Charlie mentioned, which is a purely voluntary program and involves simply people submitting information to EPA. EPA is not going to do anything with that information. It's purely a way of educating EPA, if you want, about nanotechnology. That's a useful step, but it's hardly providing any protection for the American public.  More importantly, the second paper that the agency issued dealt with this question of new chemicals. And to understand the context, one has to understand that the Toxic Substances Act only reviews new chemicals for their health and safety. It has some authorities to deal with existing chemicals, but most of those are not usable. They've been struck down by the courts, certainly, were very weak to begin with.  The second paper that EPA issued yesterday said that they will not take size into account when they're defining new chemicals. Now, as you know, size is what defines nanomaterials. So, in effect, the agency has said, when we get a new chemical notification, we don't know, much less care, whether it's nanomaterial or it isn't nanomaterial. And how you can build an adequate regulatory program when you don't take the size of the particle into account -the size of what you're regulating -  mystifies me.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Charles Auer, does the EPA have enough scientists to actually evaluate what gets - the paperwork that gets - the research that gets handed in there?  Dr. AUER: Yes. Our plan, I think, is very clear in the stewardship papers that we put forward that we would review the information submitted and work with the companies to have them undertake any needed risk management measures. One of the other components of our stewardship program is to have the companies agree in advance to adhere to a basic set of risk management practices as they commercialize these materials.  FLATOW: Dr. Davies. What's wrong with that?  Dr. DAVIES: What's wrong with it is that if you have a purely voluntary program and all you're trying to do is encourage firms to take adequate measures of oversight, it's the bad guys - it's the guys who won't volunteer, who don't get into a voluntary program - that you're concerned about. And that's the reason why voluntary programs don't work in situations like this.  Dr. AUER: If I can comment. . .  FLATOW: Sure.  Dr. AUER: I think Dr. Davies underestimates the significance of policy paper on new versus existing chemicals. Under this approach, many of the important nanomaterials, such as fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, would be new chemicals and would be therefore subject to regulatory controls. We are applying the current legal framework that exists in the U. S. under the Toxic Substances Control Act. And we think under that framework that metal oxides, such as titanium dioxide that are made at nanoscale, may in fact be existing chemicals. However, we do take the crystal structure of those materials into consideration. And if the crystal structure that the manufacturer intends to commercialize is not on the inventory, that would make it a new chemical.  In addition, any derivatized or functionalized or coded nanoparticles, be they organic or inorganic, those would be subject to new chemical requirements as long as there's a chemical reaction involved in the coding or the derivatization.  FLATOW: Will the EPA do any studies into the risks, environmental risks, posed by nanoparticles?  Dr. AUER: We have a very active research effort, which is growing every year. Our research effort is focused on the environment effects and the environmental fate of nanomaterials. We also, under the stewardship program, have a so-called in-depth component, where we will be working with industry and other stakeholders to develop a testing and research program to provide the scientific understanding needed to deal with these materials.  Dr. DAVIES: I think it's important to point out in this context that of all the money being spent by the federal government on nanotechnology, something between one and three percent is being spent on health and safety studies.  FLATOW: And you write. . .  Dr. DAVIES: That's not enough.  FLATOW: Yeah, you say we don't have enough knowledge of how they affect, not only the environment but people.  Dr. DAVIES: That's right. You need to do a whole lot more research than is being done. And if I can just return to Charlie's previous comment, nobody knows, because since you don't have to identify whether something is or is not a nanomaterial when you submit it under the Toxic Substances Act, but by my calculation, I think of 15 notices that probably were nanomaterials, 14 of them were decided - and this is in the last couple of years - 14 of them, the agency decided, were existing chemicals and therefore not subject to review.  Dr. AUER: Well, no. Actually, you've got the statistics a little off there.  Dr. DAVIES: I'd welcome. . .  Dr. AUER: Sure.  Dr. DAVIES: . . . but since you don't know what are nanomaterials. . .  Dr. AUER: But we do. We do, Terry. We do. Any time we receive a new chemical notification on a material that appears to be nanosized, we ask the notifier a series of questions so we can understand the size range, the presence of novel properties and so forth. Now, in our new chemicals experience, there was one notification for a nanoscale material, which clearly exhibited unique properties. For the other materials that were nanosized, they clearly were nanoscale materials, but they did not exhibit any unique properties.  Dr. DAVIES: We get to the key point here, because the question is what do you mean by properties. If we're talking about biological effects or how they're distributed in the environment, I do not believe that you can say that a nanosized piece of silver, let's say, behaves the same as an ingot of silver. The biological differences are significant and that means that the agency has to review it.  FLATOW: Mr. Davies, hang on, I'll give you a chance to reply. I have to just remind everybody that I'm Ira Flatow and this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  Dr. AUER: Those are good points, Terry. And the size of the materials is certainly critical in assessing the exposure and the effects. The point that I was making is essentially recognizing that nanoscale materials have been around for millennia. There's a published paper where the carbonaceous material in Damascus swords was actually carbon nanotubes from whatever 2,000 years ago.  The point I'm making is that there are a number of things that are small in size. We've been using them in technology for many years. Fumed silica is an example of that. We assess those materials, considering them to be more common to traditional chemicals than to something which embodies all of the elements of nanotechnology.

Just ahead, we're going to continue our criminal justice series by taking a look at how ex-offenders fare when they try to reenter the workforce. The results might surprise you about what is really seems - I'm sorry - about what really seems to be holding them back. But first, World Breastfeeding Week wraps up today. A hundred and 20 countries across the world observe the week to promote breastfeeding as the best choice for infant nutrition. And in conjunction, New York City hospitals removed free formula samples from their new mother gift bags. The packages are still available to new mothers upon request. Sure, everybody says breast is best, but is it really that simple? Joining us to talk about the politics of breast versus formula feeding is Faye Wattleton. She is the president of the Center for the Advancement of Women. Also with us is Kim Gandy, the president of NOW, the National Organization for Women. She joins us here in the studio. Welcome to the program. Ms. KIM GANDY (President, National Organization for Women): Thank you. Ms. FAYE WATTLETON (Co-founder and President, Center for the Advancement of Women): Hi, Michel. MARTIN: Kim, why don't you start? What do you think about this initiative? Ms. GANDY: Well, you know, it's interesting that they think that they can affect what is a huge public policy issue with something simple like taking free coupons out of the swag bag. It really is not going to make a difference. The reason that so many women don't choose to breastfeed for very long is that it's not a choice. MARTIN: Why isn't it a choice? Ms. GANDY: They get to work, that - we know that women don't have much family leave to begin with, or much maternity leave. So when they get back to work, it's made impossible for them by their employers. You know, I hear from women who talk about crouching in the porcelain corner of the bathroom at work, which is the only place they can plug in their pump, trying to pump because they have no place to do it privately, and then getting in trouble because they took more than 15 minutes to do it. MARTIN: Faye Wattleton, what about you? What do you think about this? Ms. WATTLETON: Well, my view is that this is an enormously complex issue that has cultural socioeconomic dimensions. And it's the sexual connotation that trumps its real fundamental purpose, which is the feeding of the young. Yes, I think there are many ways in which society can support women breastfeeding. But their partners very often object to their breastfeeding as well. So it's a multilayered issue. MARTIN: Faye, you're a former nurse. Isn't that right? Ms. WATTLETON: I have two degrees in nursing, and one of them in midwifery. But, you know, this is a 20-year debate. We had this debate back on the '80s. MARTIN: So that was going to be my question. Sure. Hasn't this been (unintelligible) around a long time. Ms. WATTLETON: Yes. It's been for a long time. The Nestle Company was providing samples in the delivery and exit packages for women in developing countries. And what we see - particularly because low-income women tend not to breastfeed at a high, as at as a high prevalence as their affluent sisters - is that women will try, when they don't have other means, will try to stretch the samples. And the children end up malnourished. MARTIN: Why wouldn't it make sense to not send a double message? I mean, breastfeeding is free. Right? Ms. WATTLETON: Well, that's true. And that's, I think, what the WHO, the World Health Organization, and the International Alliance for Breastfeeding are all coming together to try to promote it and looking at the many facets that impose upon a woman in considering breastfeeding. And, of course, the education dimension is very important. Ms. GANDY: And, in fact, I think that we are making the need for breastfeeding, or the advantages clear. Three-quarters of new moms start out breastfeeding. MARTIN: Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Three-quarters of new mothers start out breastfeeding\u2026 Ms. GANDY: (unintelligible) MARTIN: \u2026but by six months, less than 20 percent are still nursing. Why do you think that is? Ms. GANDY: Well, it's actually 11 percent in six months, and the reason is because it is made so difficult. Sometimes their partners don't want them to do it. But the hardest thing is going back to work. If you work on a line job, you work in a factory, you don't have enough breaks to be able to pump. If you work in a cubicle, you don't have a private place to go to and pump. MARTIN: Oh, how about if you travel, and the airlines won't allow you to take liquids\u2026 Ms. GANDY: Exactly. Ms. WATTLETON: Well, that's a whole new one. MARTIN: (unintelligible) unless you are - I mean, I guess what I'm saying is it's not just the low-income problem. It's also for, you know, elite women, presumably, who are trying to go back to work, and you cannot take liquids on the airlines unless you have a small child with you. So what are you supposed to do with your supply? Ms. GANDY: Well, and you can't. And you can't. They've made it difficult to impossible. And so if those, like Mayor Bloomberg, really want to do something to make this more possible for women, then they need to make it public policy that lactating moms have enough breaks to be able to pump breast milk at work, that there's a private place for them to do it, that the equipment is there for them to do it. And of course we need to continue with the public education that it's good for the babies and it's good for the moms. It has benefits for mom as well. But you can't just put a guilt trip on women and say you're a bad mom because you're not doing this when, in fact, it's been made difficult or impossible for her to do it by her employer. What I'm\u2026 MARTIN: Faye, do you have any concern that the part of the message this sends is that, you know, you're a bad mother if you don't breastfeed, and that it lays, as Kim put it, a guilt trip on women? Ms. WATTLETON: In our enthusiasm to encourage women, we should be careful and sensitive that it may be perceived by women, well, if I'm not doing what everyone says I should do, I must not be the mother that I want to be. And that's not the intention here. And that's why the education part of it is so important. But we really cannot overlook the cultural dimensions of this, which are enormous. I would submit to you there - they really are stronger and more powerful than the public policy issues. I think that public policies can support and encourage the mentality and the attitudes about this whole area. MARTIN: Talk to me more about this, Faye. You're saying that you think the cultural factors are even more important than the whole question of break time and the sort of the physical circumstances. Well, what do you mean and what makes you so sure? Ms. WATTLETON: What I mean by that is how many women feel comfortable taking their breast out of their brassieres and breastfeeding in public? Because there has been such an enormous amount of attention to breast as sexual objects. The whole privacy issue is really a reflection of, you know, we need to go in a closed door to breastfeed our children - one of the most natural acts that a woman can perform. Just look at the behavior around it. MARTIN: But isn't that partly a matter of public policy? You know, there was a story earlier this year, we have a woman - a family getting kicked off of a small flight up in Vermont because she wanted to breastfeed her child upon takeoff, and a lot of people will tell you that's the absolutely the right thing to do because it balances out the air pressure in the child's ears and has a calming effect. And this family was ejected from the flight. Isn't part of the cultural problem a public policy problem? Ms. WATTLETON: That's not a public policy. I don't know of any airline that requires by policy a woman to be ejected from an airplane. I breastfed my child on airplanes for the reasons that you described. But obviously, there were people in the plane that were uncomfortable with that action. And so these are deeply embedded, deeply rooted attitudes about human behavior and the purpose of a woman's breast. And we really should be attacking what this means in terms of the way society views women in a completely natural, important to her health, important to her child's health behavior. MARTIN: Data shows that African-American women are less likely to breastfeed, while Hispanics have higher breastfeeding rates. And, of course, Faye, you made the point earlier that the rate of breastfeeding increases with education, income and age. Any thoughts about why that might be? Ms. WATTLETON: Well, I think we certainly know that among African-Americans, that we are disproportionately low income, and therefore fall into a category where probably the socioeconomic factor influences the behavior. We are more likely in as such to depend on public health services - that is public hospitals and public clinics - where there's very little time given to supporting low-income women in their efforts to breastfeed and are more likely to be simply given formula because that's the easy thing to do when a health system is trying to cope with numbers that it is not designed to care for. MARTIN: Hmm. Okay. And finally, I want to ask each of you, what would you - since both of you support, obviously, breastfeeding and feel that these kind of Band Aid gestures are not very adequate - what would you recommend? And, you know, Faye, you made the point that this is a deeply rooted, these are deeply rooted sort of cultural issues. what do you do? Ms. WATTLETON: This is a multi-layered cultural tradition, public policy-laden issue, and women still do not have the recognition and the status in this society that we deserve. And while there are people all about who do not - who seem to want to interfere with a woman's choice about childbearing, they seemed not to understand that after birth, there is an important public policy issue that can support her capacity to be a healthy mother and her child to grow into a healthy - into healthy childhood. MARTIN: Kim Gandy, final thought about what you would do to support breastfeeding. Ms. GANDY: I agree absolutely with Faye, that it is multi-faceted. But I think we can start with public policy. Other countries have passed legislation that treats breastfeeding as a protected activity under their sex discrimination laws and makes it unlawful to, say, arrest a woman in the mall for breastfeeding her child or throw her off of an airplane. That would be a start. It would send an important public policy symbol to the country that this is something that's good, and it's not something that's obscene. MARTIN: Oh, I'm so hesitate to open a can of worms because we have just a couple of minutes left, but I want to go back to the point you made. Faye, obviously, you're pro-choice and believe in choice and, Kim, as do you. But I think there might be some who would argue that abortion is one of the reasons that this country devalues motherhood. That as a society, if we were less permissive about abortion, that it would perhaps elevate - the status of motherhood and perhaps there would be more support for the function for women in their role as mothers as opposed to a sexual object. Ms. GANDY: I think it's quite the opposite. Ms. WATTLETON: I think it is. I agree with you, (unintelligible). Ms. GANDY: It's totally the opposite, because if anybody can become a mother simply by getting pregnant, in fact, even being forced into motherhood. If motherhood is something that we choose - as I chose with my two daughters -I nursed both of them, I chose motherhood - it elevates motherhood. If it's a choice, if the women who were mothers made that conscious decision, I want to be a mother and I want to do it well. Ms. WATTLETON: And I, too, chose motherhood, breastfed my child for 10 months. I, in the earlier part of my adulthood, had an unintended pregnancy and chose to terminate that pregnancy. But that in no way undermined my desire to be a mother and to be a good mother, which I believe that I have been. And the value of breastfeeding for me was enormous for both my personal relationship with my child, as well as getting her off to a very healthy start. MARTIN: All right. We'll have to leave it there. It is a complicated topic, as you've both said. And I thank you both for coming in to talk with us. Faye Wattleton is the president of The Center for the Advancement of Women. She joined us from our bureau in New York. And Kim Gandy is the president of N. O. W. , the National Organization of Women.

Ms. WATTLETON: I have two degrees in nursing, and one of them in midwifery. But, you know, this is a 20-year debate. We had this debate back on the '80s.  MARTIN: So that was going to be my question. Sure. Hasn't this been (unintelligible) around a long time.  Ms. WATTLETON: Yes. It's been for a long time. The Nestle Company was providing samples in the delivery and exit packages for women in developing countries. And what we see - particularly because low-income women tend not to breastfeed at a high, as at as a high prevalence as their affluent sisters - is that women will try, when they don't have other means, will try to stretch the samples. And the children end up malnourished.  MARTIN: Why wouldn't it make sense to not send a double message? I mean, breastfeeding is free. Right?  Ms. WATTLETON: Well, that's true. And that's, I think, what the WHO, the World Health Organization, and the International Alliance for Breastfeeding are all coming together to try to promote it and looking at the many facets that impose upon a woman in considering breastfeeding. And, of course, the education dimension is very important.  Ms. GANDY: And, in fact, I think that we are making the need for breastfeeding, or the advantages clear. Three-quarters of new moms start out breastfeeding.  MARTIN: Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Three-quarters of new mothers start out breastfeeding\u2026  Ms. GANDY: (unintelligible)  MARTIN: \u2026but by six months, less than 20 percent are still nursing. Why do you think that is?  Ms. GANDY: Well, it's actually 11 percent in six months, and the reason is because it is made so difficult. Sometimes their partners don't want them to do it. But the hardest thing is going back to work. If you work on a line job, you work in a factory, you don't have enough breaks to be able to pump. If you work in a cubicle, you don't have a private place to go to and pump.  MARTIN: Oh, how about if you travel, and the airlines won't allow you to take liquids\u2026  Ms. GANDY: Exactly.  Ms. WATTLETON: Well, that's a whole new one.  MARTIN: (unintelligible) unless you are - I mean, I guess what I'm saying is it's not just the low-income problem. It's also for, you know, elite women, presumably, who are trying to go back to work, and you cannot take liquids on the airlines unless you have a small child with you. So what are you supposed to do with your supply?  Ms. GANDY: Well, and you can't. And you can't. They've made it difficult to impossible. And so if those, like Mayor Bloomberg, really want to do something to make this more possible for women, then they need to make it public policy that lactating moms have enough breaks to be able to pump breast milk at work, that there's a private place for them to do it, that the equipment is there for them to do it.  And of course we need to continue with the public education that it's good for the babies and it's good for the moms. It has benefits for mom as well. But you can't just put a guilt trip on women and say you're a bad mom because you're not doing this when, in fact, it's been made difficult or impossible for her to do it by her employer. What I'm\u2026  MARTIN: Faye, do you have any concern that the part of the message this sends is that, you know, you're a bad mother if you don't breastfeed, and that it lays, as Kim put it, a guilt trip on women?  Ms. WATTLETON: In our enthusiasm to encourage women, we should be careful and sensitive that it may be perceived by women, well, if I'm not doing what everyone says I should do, I must not be the mother that I want to be. And that's not the intention here. And that's why the education part of it is so important.  But we really cannot overlook the cultural dimensions of this, which are enormous. I would submit to you there - they really are stronger and more powerful than the public policy issues. I think that public policies can support and encourage the mentality and the attitudes about this whole area.  MARTIN: Talk to me more about this, Faye. You're saying that you think the cultural factors are even more important than the whole question of break time and the sort of the physical circumstances. Well, what do you mean and what makes you so sure?  Ms. WATTLETON: What I mean by that is how many women feel comfortable taking their breast out of their brassieres and breastfeeding in public? Because there has been such an enormous amount of attention to breast as sexual objects. The whole privacy issue is really a reflection of, you know, we need to go in a closed door to breastfeed our children - one of the most natural acts that a woman can perform. Just look at the behavior around it.  MARTIN: But isn't that partly a matter of public policy? You know, there was a story earlier this year, we have a woman - a family getting kicked off of a small flight up in Vermont because she wanted to breastfeed her child upon takeoff, and a lot of people will tell you that's the absolutely the right thing to do because it balances out the air pressure in the child's ears and has a calming effect. And this family was ejected from the flight. Isn't part of the cultural problem a public policy problem?  Ms. WATTLETON: That's not a public policy. I don't know of any airline that requires by policy a woman to be ejected from an airplane. I breastfed my child on airplanes for the reasons that you described. But obviously, there were people in the plane that were uncomfortable with that action. And so these are deeply embedded, deeply rooted attitudes about human behavior and the purpose of a woman's breast. And we really should be attacking what this means in terms of the way society views women in a completely natural, important to her health, important to her child's health behavior.  MARTIN: Data shows that African-American women are less likely to breastfeed, while Hispanics have higher breastfeeding rates. And, of course, Faye, you made the point earlier that the rate of breastfeeding increases with education, income and age. Any thoughts about why that might be?  Ms. WATTLETON: Well, I think we certainly know that among African-Americans, that we are disproportionately low income, and therefore fall into a category where probably the socioeconomic factor influences the behavior. We are more likely in as such to depend on public health services - that is public hospitals and public clinics - where there's very little time given to supporting low-income women in their efforts to breastfeed and are more likely to be simply given formula because that's the easy thing to do when a health system is trying to cope with numbers that it is not designed to care for.  MARTIN: Hmm. Okay. And finally, I want to ask each of you, what would you - since both of you support, obviously, breastfeeding and feel that these kind of Band Aid gestures are not very adequate - what would you recommend? And, you know, Faye, you made the point that this is a deeply rooted, these are deeply rooted sort of cultural issues. what do you do?  Ms. WATTLETON: This is a multi-layered cultural tradition, public policy-laden issue, and women still do not have the recognition and the status in this society that we deserve. And while there are people all about who do not - who seem to want to interfere with a woman's choice about childbearing, they seemed not to understand that after birth, there is an important public policy issue that can support her capacity to be a healthy mother and her child to grow into a healthy - into healthy childhood.  MARTIN: Kim Gandy, final thought about what you would do to support breastfeeding.  Ms. GANDY: I agree absolutely with Faye, that it is multi-faceted. But I think we can start with public policy. Other countries have passed legislation that treats breastfeeding as a protected activity under their sex discrimination laws and makes it unlawful to, say, arrest a woman in the mall for breastfeeding her child or throw her off of an airplane.  That would be a start. It would send an important public policy symbol to the country that this is something that's good, and it's not something that's obscene.  MARTIN: Oh, I'm so hesitate to open a can of worms because we have just a couple of minutes left, but I want to go back to the point you made. Faye, obviously, you're pro-choice and believe in choice and, Kim, as do you. But I think there might be some who would argue that abortion is one of the reasons that this country devalues motherhood.  That as a society, if we were less permissive about abortion, that it would perhaps elevate - the status of motherhood and perhaps there would be more support for the function for women in their role as mothers as opposed to a sexual object.  Ms. GANDY: I think it's quite the opposite.  Ms. WATTLETON: I think it is. I agree with you, (unintelligible).  Ms. GANDY: It's totally the opposite, because if anybody can become a mother simply by getting pregnant, in fact, even being forced into motherhood. If motherhood is something that we choose - as I chose with my two daughters -I nursed both of them, I chose motherhood - it elevates motherhood. If it's a choice, if the women who were mothers made that conscious decision, I want to be a mother and I want to do it well.  Ms. WATTLETON: And I, too, chose motherhood, breastfed my child for 10 months. I, in the earlier part of my adulthood, had an unintended pregnancy and chose to terminate that pregnancy. But that in no way undermined my desire to be a mother and to be a good mother, which I believe that I have been. And the value of breastfeeding for me was enormous for both my personal relationship with my child, as well as getting her off to a very healthy start.  MARTIN: All right. We'll have to leave it there. It is a complicated topic, as you've both said. And I thank you both for coming in to talk with us. Faye Wattleton is the president of The Center for the Advancement of Women. She joined us from our bureau in New York. And Kim Gandy is the president of N. O. W. , the National Organization of Women. She joined us here in our studio in Washington. Thank you both so much.  Ms. GANDY: Thanks, Michel.  Ms. WATTLETON: Thank you for having us.

I'm Andrea Seabrook. MICHELE NORRIS, Host: And I'm Michele Norris. It's been a week of festivities in Beijing, the start of the one-year countdown to the 2008 Olympics. Despite the extravaganza, the president of the International Olympic Committee had cautionary words. He warned that some events next August may have to be postponed if the city can't improve its air quality. Chinese cities such as Beijing are notoriously polluted. And we may soon get a clear indication of the air quality for athletes next month when the Women's World Cup of Soccer begins. Earlier this year, the Canadian national soccer team trained in Beijing and found that breathing was not easy. Greg Anderson is the Canadian team's exercise physiologist, and he went on that trip to China. He joins us now. Welcome Dr. Anderson. GREG ANDERSON: Thank you. NORRIS: So the team was in China in April and May to train, and I understand that the air there was quite different than what they're accustomed to in Canada. How did it affect the players? ANDERSON: Well, about four days in, they ended up with a low-grade inflammation at the back of their throat. The mucus was being produced to try and trap all the particulate matter in the air, which is very high. And. . . NORRIS: Particulate matter. So you could actually feel the grit? ANDERSON: Yeah. Absolutely. And the grit builds up and you have to try and spit it out and get it - clear the back of your throat five, six days in. NORRIS: Well, this is difficult. I mean, soccer is a real endurance sport. There's no chance to stop and rest, 45-minute halfs. The air quality will make quite a difference in the quality of play. ANDERSON: Absolutely. And the particulate matter is sort of happens on a day-to-day living issue. And then once you play and you start to have high airflows in and out of your lungs, the really high ozone levels in Beijing cause a real burning sensation in your lungs. And so when they were playing and doing some of the high intensity drills we were doing over there, they started to really feel this burning sensation in their lungs as well, which was sort of startling to them. NORRIS: Now, I know that athletes will often go high-altitude training destinations in order to get ready for a game. How do you prep for something like this? ANDERSON: Well, there's no prepping for the pollution. Really, what you need to do is you need to get them acclimatized to the heat and humidity and the time zone. So lots of teams, for example, have already rented facilities in Indonesia or somewhere down in Thailand, Singapore, in the time zone, has the same heat and humidity. You really want to keep them out of the pollution until the day that they're going to compete. NORRIS: You don't want to - you wouldn't find the biggest smoke stack in town and try to run wingspans(ph) beneath it. ANDERSON: No. No. You'll really try to keep the lungs as healthy as possible, right up to the minute that we can go and compete. NORRIS: I imagine you could wear mask or anything like that. ANDERSON: We could wear masks for the daily living. NORRIS: But not on the field? ANDERSON: No, but not on the field. NORRIS: Now, how worried are about this? After your visit to China, do you think that pollution could really interfere with the Summer Games in 2008? ANDERSON: Well, it's quite startling actually because when we were there, the pollution index was rather high, extremely high. The best day that we saw on either side of the girls being there with about 170. The worst day would have a pollution index at 240. And to put that into perspective, Washington, D. C. , probably sits 30 to 40 on a daily basis. Health warnings would come in at about 60 for heart disease and respiratory disease. And at 90, they would tell everybody to stay inside than had any potential health problems. NORRIS: What do you do immediately after a game if you've been playing in all that grit? ANDERSON: Really, there's not a whole lot you can do to counteract the pollution effects other than get them hydrated and create some mucus and spit some of the stuff out, and trying to get it to move out of your lungs and. . . NORRIS: Pardon me, this is a rather indelicate question. But can you spit on a soccer field? (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)ANDERSON: Oh, it's really funny because when we were there, the Chinese government was trying to stop spitting in public. And I'm going, that's the only thing that's keeping them alive. I don't think you should be stopping the spittings of your population. NORRIS: So if you can't spit on the street, can you spit on a soccer field? ANDERSON: Well, as long as you're not spitting at somebody, I'm sure it would be okay. NORRIS: Well, Dr. Anderson, all the best to you and your team. Thanks so much for talking to us. ANDERSON: Thank you. NORRIS: That was Greg Anderson.

I'm Alex Chadwick. MADELEINE BRAND, host: I'm Madeleine Brand.  Big family news for all of us - distant relatives, mind you - ancestors, actually. CHADWICK: That'll be uncle homo erectus and cousin homo habilis. BRAND: Who? Those two earlier species of human ancestors were thought to have evolved in succession. CHADWICK: New fossil discoveries in Kenya prove they didn't. They coexisted. The research was published yesterday in the journal Nature. Dr. Susan Anton is a co-author along with Meave and Louise Leaky and Fred Spoor of University College London. Dr. Anton, welcome, and tell us about these bones. How old are they? Dr. SUSAN ANTON (New York University): Well, the homo habilis is the youngest specimen that has been found so far and it's about 1. 44 million years old. The homo erectus specimen that we're talking about is about 1. 5 million years old. CHADWICK: And what is it that's surprising to you, to find out that these two ancestors lived at the same time? Dr. ANTON: It has been previously thought that there was a unilineal or single line relationship with homo habilis, slowly giving rise to homo erectus, that then slowly gave rise to us. This would imply that homo habilis had gone extinct through most of the history of homo erectus, and so to find the two of them co-existing for nearly half a million years was not what had been predicted. CHADWICK: When you say that they co-existed, would they have interbred perhaps? Dr. ANTON: Well, we can feel pretty certain that they, in fact, didn't interbreed because otherwise their gene pools would have mixed and then anatomically they would have ended up looking very similar to one another, and we wouldn't be able to talk about separating the fossils into two groups: homo habilis versus homo erectus. However, it is possible that they did live somewhat side-by-side in the same environment at the same time, dividing that environment up in different ways, maybe eating slightly different things in each group, and maybe behaving slightly differently to keep themselves separate. CHADWICK: Is this pretty big news in the world of anthropology? I mean, it sounds as though you're substantially rearranging the history of human development. Dr. ANTON: Well, I think what we're doing is we're adding some complexity to that history and that's something that in a field that is dependent on new fossils being found you always make your best hypotheses and then something new comes along and kind of turns that on its head. So nobody had quite anticipated that we would have homo habilis lasting this long, nor had we quite anticipated that we would have homo erectus being this small in size - usually we had thought of homo habilis as really tiny, homo erectus getting bigger in body and more like ourselves. And this new skull that we're talking about is really tiny. You can think about it as maybe the size of about a grape fruit, I would never do this but I could palm it, you know, much like a basketball - and I don't have particularly big hands. So it's very - it's tiny. And that's one of the things that is very important about it, is that it has all the characteristics of homo erectus and yet it is a very, very tiny head compared to what we normally think about homo erectus as. And that means there was a lot of size variation within homo erectus. CHADWICK: Maybe it was child? Dr. ANTON: Well, maybe it was. And that was one of our first thoughts, and we carefully looked at that using CT scans and other things, and it actually turns out that in terms of all the developmental indicators, the things that tell us whether an individual is finished growing, that this individual was at the very end of its growth. So if you were thinking in human terms, maybe about 18, 19 years old. And by that time humans are completely grown in terms of the size of their cranium, at least. CHADWICK: When you first started discussing this with your colleagues, what's been the reaction? Dr. ANTON: You know, it's been a predictable, I think, range of reactions. People are very excited about the fossils. The new homo erectus skull is very, very complete - more complete than anything we've had before and very, very tiny, and it depends a little bit on how people think about species and how to divide things up into species, whether they want to call this something completely new or whether they want to call this all one species or not. So  there's been a range, and it always takes us a little while to assimilate new information and to see what, you know, sort of the main line is going to be coming out of it.

Well, chances are, you do care about whether your food tastes good, maybe you really love groceries from your local green market; or maybe you shop in a supermarket, you do care about your health. You want to be sure the food you're buying is wholesome. The food industry has so much influence on government, farm and food policy, not just in the U. S. but around the world, that some people say the farm bill should really be called the food bill. That's what my next guest says. Michael Pollan is Knight professor of journalism and director of the program in science and environmental journalism at University of California at Berkeley, in Berkeley. He - four books and articles and magazines. He's been - he just writes all over the place. He's a contributing writer. He's exploring food and farming and is also talking about the farm bill, calling it the food bill. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Michael. Professor MICHAEL POLLAN (Knight Professor in Journalism, University of California Berkeley): Thank you, Ira. Good to be back. FLATOW: Thank you. Dr. Marion Nestle has also written extensively about food. She is Paulette Goddard professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. Her latest book is called \"What to Eat. \" And she says that's what people are always asking her, what should I eat, right? Dr. MARION NESTLE (Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health, New York University): Yeah. Eat. It's a good thing to do. Hi, Michael. Prof. POLLAN: Hey, Marion. FLATOW: Well, let's talk about the bill - let me start off, Michael, about the farm bill. Why is this bill so important? Why, you know, it flies under the radar screen as you write, and people don't pay attention to it but we should be paying attention to it? Prof. POLLAN: Well, they don't pay attention to it because, as you suggest, they think it's a parochial piece of legislation involving special interest called farmers. But in fact, the farm bill is - really constitutes the set of rules for the entire U. S. food system. And it really determines what's in your supermarket, how accessible organic produce is, how accessible local farmers markets are, and really the difference in price between junk food and good food. You know, you can find the cause of that in the crops we choose to subsidize in the farm bill. So it has an enormous impact on all of us. And once the rest of us who eat start paying attention, we might actually get a farm bill that gives us the kind of food system we could be proud of and that would make us a lot healthier and happier as well. FLATOW: Let me dig into what you've said a little bit. The farm bill subsidizes just a few bunch of crops, does it not? Prof. POLLAN: Yes, five crops. Commodity crops are the main recipients of the billions and billions of subsidies. And those are corn and soybeans, wheat, rice and cotton; four of the five, obviously, are foods. These are - they're called storable commodities, and one of the reasons they've always been subsidized is they can be stored. And they are, really, the building blocks of the food system, and increasingly so. What's missing from that list, obviously, are any kind of fresh fruits and vegetables. Those crops that are subsidized are the ones that you can kind of break down into the building blocks of processed food. And corn and soybeans, which dominate snack foods and junk foods and sodas, those are the ones that we're supporting, with the result that some of the least healthy calories in the supermarket are the ones we're subsidizing the most. And the sorts of foods that, you know, public health authorities are always telling us we should eat more of, like fresh fruits and vegetables, we're doing nothing to help, or very little. There are indirect subsidies to those crops, through subsidized water and things like that. And I'm not saying we should necessarily subsidize fruits and vegetables - that may not be the solution. But making these unhealthy calories so cheap is one of the reasons that we're as fat as we are. FLATOW: You write in one of your commentaries that that's why Twinkies are less expensive than carrots. Prof. POLLAN: Yeah, which, when you think about it, is amazing. I mean, Twinkie is an incredibly complicated product, with 37 ingredients and, you know, elaborate industrial processes. I mean, here is this miracle of food science that I want on my shelf, you know? Two years later, it's still soft. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. POLLAN: And how is it that you can sell that more cheaply than a bunch of carrots? Well, because most of the ingredients in that Twinkie are getting government help. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. NESTLE: Well, don't you think that the issue here is that the farm bill itself is so hopelessly obfuscated nobody can understand it, it's enormous complex, and that even advocates for good food policy are at odds with each other over some of its provisions? I think what needs to be done is to break it down into much smaller pieces so that people understand what the issues are, but it's very, very difficult to do that. Prof. POLLAN: Well, I don't think there's, you know, I think you're absolutely right, Marion. But I don't there's a whole lot of interest on the part of the beneficiaries of this bill or the congressmen most involved, in making it any easier to understand. Dr. NESTLE: No, I think it's deliberately obfuscating. Prof. POLLAN: Yeah, exactly. And in fact, there was a quote in the Chronicle by Collin Peterson, the head of the Ag Committee in the House, who was getting kind of annoyed that people like Marion Nestle was paying attention to her - to his bill, who said, you know, these city people don't know what they're talking about when they start talking about the farm bill. They don't even want us to have this conversation. FLATOW: Hmm. Dr. NESTLE: I think not, because if once you start having a conversation, you start looking at all of the issues and thinking, what on Earth is going on here and how on Earth are we going to do anything to fix it? FLATOW: How did it start out? It didn't start out this way, Michael, right? The farm bill was a totally different animal when it started? Prof. POLLAN: Well, you know, we started supporting farmers in a serious way during the Depression. We had a situation in the early '30s, where basically the price of agricultural commodities had fallen almost to zero. There was a great oversupply of commodities. We had kind of cranked up production during World War I. And there was too much food being produced on farms and not enough people with enough cash to buy it. So to help the farmers who we, you know, we want to keep in business because we need to eat, the government started supporting them through a very different system of price supports. Essentially, the government would guarantee a certain price for corn or - well, not soybeans at the time - but corn and wheat and rice. And when the price dipped below that target price, which was really based on the cost of producing, the government would loan farmers the difference, would loan farmers the cost of their - the price of their crops, so they didn't have to sell it into a weak market. And they would keep the crop back. Prices would rise because supply had gone down. And then when prices went up, the farmers would either sell then and pay back the loan, or if prices didn't go up, the government would simply buy their crop, so they didn't have to pay back the loan. And they would then put the storable commodities in the grain reserve. The government operated a grain reserve right into the '70s, and the beauty of that was - it was sort of like the strategic petroleum reserve we have now for oil. When prices were too high - as, by the way, they are now in corn - the government could sell a little bit to even out the market. And when prices were too low, essentially, they would buy more from farmers. So you had the government participating in the market in a way that guaranteed the good price to farmers, stabilized crop prices for consumers, and, you know, the system wasn't half bad. In most years, it cost the government nothing because they were getting paid back, and there were actually years when the government was making money from farm policy. Now, they drop, you know, what this bill is $278 billion over five years. So why we got away from that system is an interesting story. It really happened in the '70s because of the spike in food prices during the Nixon administration. Dr. NESTLE: And also, the general coziness between the Department of Agriculture and food producers. Prof. POLLAN: Well, exactly. And the people who\u2026 Dr. NESTLE: And Congress. Prof. POLLAN: \u2026buy agricultural commodities, you know, Cargill, ADM, Coca-Cola, Kellogg's, they didn't like the system because it kept prices high. And they wanted a system, where essentially the government would just cut a check to the farmers, allow them to sell into a weak market and essentially allow prices to steadily fall, which is what's happened. FLATOW:  Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255. And of course, now there's an impact with -because corn growers are growing energy, making ethanol, there's - and impacts the farms also. Prof. POLLAN: Well, you know, ethanol is the big new wrinkle in the farm world right now. Since two years ago in the State of the Union Address, Bush decided to get behind ethanol and the government has started subsidizing it and requiring 10 percent of our gas be ethanol. The price of corn has actually skyrocketed. I think it's over three or four dollars a bushel right now. And this is going to have an enormous impact on the food system. And, you know, there's a real question whether mixing up energy and food is such a good idea. I happen to think it's not. I think ethanol is really a bad idea for many, many reasons. But one of which is that it's putting enormous pressure on the food system. And I just don't want us to, you know, be devoting our arable land to feeding our SUVs rather than our people. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Hi, Rebecca in Ithaca, New York. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. REBECCA (Caller): Hi. I'm a small vegetable grower. We have a CSA, community-supported agriculture enterprise in Ithaca. And I'm just really interested in how the farm bill seems to be - it's like a nexus of so many issues in our culture, from the use - overuse of petroleum, over-reliance on petroleum, to obesity and diabetes in our kids. It seems like we're always subsidizing corporations rather than the little guy. FLATOW: Isn't there something in the farm bill that will stimulate local farmers\u2026 Dr. NESTLE: Peanuts. FLATOW: \u2026establishing direct markets to consumers? Dr. NESTLE: Yes, small amounts of money. FLATOW: Small amounts. Dr. NESTLE: Really small. FLATOW: Michael? Prof. POLLAN: Well, there are. There are - you know, there's some very positive programs that get slipped into the House bill. And as Marion says, the numbers are very small, but the pressure from activists was such that the bill did move a little bit, so that there's money to convert to organic agriculture. There's now - there used to be a rule that school lunch programs had to just simply take the cheapest food available. Now, they can favor local producers. That's a very important provision. Dr. NESTLE: That's terrific. Prof. POLLAN: So there's some good into there\u2026 Dr. NESTLE: Let's hope it lasts. Prof. POLLAN: \u2026it's a real Christmas tree bill, though. I mean, the way Pelosi got it through was she really wanted lots of money for the conventional farm programs and - but in order to get that, she had to buy off some activists and buy off the hunger lobby, as it's horribly called, with some extra food stamp money, and that's really the history of this bill is, you know, cobbled together a coalition to get it through. But it must be said that, you know, it passed with fewer votes than normal and there was more pressure for reform this year than they have felt in decades. And that's very encouraging because when the Senate takes it up, I think we may see a very different and possibly more progressive bill. FLATOW: Right. We're going to take a short break and come back and talk lots more with Dr. Marion Nestle, who is - latest book - her latest book is \"What to Eat. \" We'll talk about how to choose what to eat, and how do you know where the food is grown - a lot of people are concerned of finding out on the label where the food is grown. Sometimes, you can look at an orange and see it comes from Chile or something. But what about these processed foods and what's going on with them, and people worried about eating Chinese-produced foods and things like that. We'll talk more about that with Dr. Nestle. Also, Michael Pollen will be back and we're also going to bring on a gentleman who wrote \"The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved: Inside America's Underground Food Movements. \" Maybe you belong to that food movement. We'd like to hear about it. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking about food, nutrition, farm bill, what to eat, with Marion Nestle, and she's with us with Michael Pollen. Let me ask, before I bring on my next guest, Marion, should people be concerned where their food comes from? Dr. NESTLE: Absolutely. Without any question. One of the things you want to know is how far it travels because you can guess that if it's traveled a long distance, it probably doesn't taste as good. It's not going to be as fresh. And it may be something that was grown in a place where you're not quite sure that the safety standards were as high as you might like them to be. And of course, the recent Chinese incidents have played right into that. FLATOW: Right. Dr. NESTLE: Congress passed a country-of-origin-labeling bill a few years ago and then in its infinite wisdom, has postponed and postponed and postponed it\u2026 FLATOW: Is that right? Yeah. Dr. NESTLE: \u2026except for fish in supermarkets, which is supposed to be labeled. But they're not. FLATOW: So can you ask your grocer? You can ask\u2026 Dr. NESTLE: Oh, you can ask that is - you know, it's one of the nasty things I like to do when I'm in a provocative mood is to go in and ask the grocer where stuff comes from. They don't have a clue. FLATOW: But a lot of it, if it's off, say, out of season, it's got to be coming from\u2026 Dr. NESTLE: Has to\u2026 FLATOW: \u2026right. Dr. NESTLE: \u2026it has to come from a place where it's in season. FLATOW: Right. Dr. NESTLE: So, you can, you know, they very proudly say that blueberries in November come from Patagonia. That's one of my favorite ones. FLATOW: Patagonia? Dr. NESTLE: Patagonia grows blueberries, apparently, in December or in January and November. And apples from New Zealand are another one that I find extremely amusing. We don't grow apples in this country? Well, I guess we don't in the off season. FLATOW: Is there any way to protect our selves from, you know, the E. coli or the other kinds of things that could spread on the farms? Dr. NESTLE: Yeah. Cook your foods. That'll do it. I mean, that's one of the great advantages of cooking is it kills bacteria. Otherwise, you depend on regulatory agencies to enforce a system of food safety, or you depend on the industry itself to do it voluntarily, which I have to say is quite iffy. FLATOW: Iffy? Dr. NESTLE: Iffy. FLATOW: If you're going to be that worried, you're not going to be eating out then because you have lost control of the track? Dr. NESTLE: Or you just make sure you cook everything; everything is cooked. FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah. Dr. NESTLE: I mean, the spinach episode was a very good example of what happens\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. NESTLE: \u2026and what's part of our industrialized food system. These things are going to happen more and more often if we don't have a better regulatory system in my view. FLATOW: Why can't we just irradiate the foods? Dr. NESTLE: It doesn't taste good afterwards. I mean, for a lot of foods, you just can't. And also, it's what I call a late-stage techno fix. What you're doing is irradiating dirty food. And as Carol Tucker Foreman, a former assistant secretary for agriculture, is quoted as saying sterilized poop is still poop. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Michael, you want to weigh in on any of this? (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. POLLAN: Yeah\u2026. FLATOW: I didn't mean to bring you in on that comment. Prof. POLLAN: I - no, not on that particular comment. I think it's true, though. It's the classic pattern of the industrial food system is that whenever it creates a problem, it comes up with an industrial solution, a new business to make more money over the mess that's been created rather than trying to go back to the origin and fix the problem. I mean, E. coli, 15787 - the bug we're really worried about - is appears to be a, you know, a bug that evolved in feedlot cattle. And when you feed cattle something they shouldn't be eating, which is to say huge rations of corn, it acidifies their gut in a way that makes it hospitable to the evolution of this particular bug. And now, we have this bug and now we're going to make money irradiating this poop we've created. It seems to me, you know, how much better it would be to kind of fix the feedlot system so that the animals do not harbor this bug. When you put the animals on - back on grass and hay, they're - the amount of E. coli in their gut diminishes something like 60 or 80 percent. Now, the bug is here and it's out and it's in, you know, lots of cattle and now we have to deal with them, the food system. But knowing where your food comes from, I think, is vitally important. And the fact that we don't is that our food chain is so long and opaque that people have to guess, and it just seems like shameful. It's very simple information. We're entitled to information about our food. And any producer that wants to hide details about where the food came from or how it was produced is not a producer you want to patronize. Dr. NESTLE: Well, the really scary part is they don't know\u2026 Prof. POLLAN: Well, that's true. Dr. NESTLE: You know, I've been dealing a lot - because I'm working on this book about pet food, and I've been dealing a lot with pet food manufacturers about where they get their ingredients. They don't know. Prof. POLLAN: There was a wonderful article in the Times about a loaf of bread that Sara Lee had invented and it had something like, I don't know, 40 or 50 ingredients, which is a story in itself, you know. Bread can be made with flour\u2026 Dr. NESTLE: Five. Prof. POLLAN: \u2026water and\u2026 Dr. NESTLE: Five ingredients. Prof. POLLAN: \u2026salt and yeast. But it's gotten a lot more complicated. And they listed how many of those ingredients were from overseas and how far they had come from. I mean, essentially right now, something like ascorbic acid, Vitamin C, which is in lots of foods because it's an antioxidant, you know, is controlled by the Chinese. They control something like 80 percent of the market for that food. So I think it's true. I think the food chain is long and global and a lot of people lose track of where things come from. And that is a problem because you can't count on - certainly in China, you cannot count on the regulatory regime in China - the real questions about the food coming from China, particularly the so-called organic food coming from China, which is now all over the supermarket, and there are real questions as to, you know, in what sense is it organic if at all. FLATOW: Well, let me bring on my next guest, who has solved all of those problems by growing his own food, knowing where it comes from, and is the author of the book, \"The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved: Inside America's Underground Food Movements. \" Maybe he didn't realize there was an underground food movement or movements? Dr. NESTLE: I didn't think it was underground\u2026 FLATOW: Well, not literally. But here to talk about it is Sandor Ellix Katz, who practices, I say, what he preaches, growing his own food organically, of course, in rural Tennessee. He is a food activist and author of that book. He joins us from Nashville. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Mr. SANDOR ELLIX KATZ (Author, \"The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved: Inside America's Underground Food Movements\"): Pleasure to be with you today. FLATOW: It's funny that Michael is talking about bread because you have a really interesting part in your book. You talk about a growing but secret kind of club, a new way to produce, buy and eat food called the Bread Club. Tell us about this underground club. Mr. KATZ: Well, I mean, I wouldn't call it a new way of producing food. I mean, it's actually a very old way of producing food. The Bread Club is a fellow who I met who lives on the West Coast in a city that I can't identify without potentially endangering what he's doing. But he built himself a really beautiful wood-fired brick oven, and every two weeks, he bakes about 100 loaves of bread and sells it to people in his town in the place - and what's illegal about it is that he does not have a licensed, code kitchen. In the United States, we've created a regulatory system which has made traditional small-scale cottage industry food production virtually impossible. And, you know, the regulations are certainly appropriate to mass production, but they're applied to all food productions so that his, you know, pretty much made it, you know, impossible or very difficult for small-scale producers to exist. So he has gone underground in the sense that he is producing something which does not conform to the regulatory codes. FLATOW: Why isn't he shut down? Mr. KATZ: Well, I mean, he's producing something that actually is incredibly safe. I mean, you know, bread is baked in an oven. A wood-fired oven like that is, you know, 600 and some degrees when he breaks - bakes the bread, so that's actually a very intrinsically safe food. But, you know, it does not conform to the letter of the codes. And, you know, the codes all dictate what types of surfaces, that it can't be in a kitchen in which, you know, a household prepares its daily food. But he is part of a, you know, a movement of people who are trying to produce food, really, in accordance with traditional methods and sell them and, you know, enjoy them in their local areas. I mean, he's really actually carrying on an ancient tradition and not doing anything that's particularly new at all except for the fact that it violates the law. Prof. POLLAN: You know, this is going on all over the place, what Sandor's describing. And I was in a farm stand today - and I won't name where, but - on Martha's Vineyard - and I was offered - I was buying tomatoes - hey, we've got some raw milk in the back, which is, you know, I don't know whether it's legal or not to sell off the farm, but it's illegal to sell in stores in the state of Massachusetts. And there is a growing underground food movement that Sandor documents really beautifully in his book. But they're different levels of safety involved, though, obviously, and I think bread is probably a very different product than raw milk. FLATOW: Sandor, you do believe in raw milk, too, right? Mr. KATZ: Well, yeah. I mean, I - this morning, I milked our goats before I came here to the studio. So I've been raising goats for the past 14 years and have had access to wonderful raw milk and I did not get into raw milk sort of through the underground movement, but I have definitely become aware of the underground movement, and it's such a huge movement. I mean, it relates to some issues that you all were talking about a little bit earlier, and that is like do we use the techno fixes to, you know, make dirty food safer? Or do we create food that is of good quality in the first place? And I think that that's really, you know, at the core of this whole question of raw milk versus pasteurized milk. Certainly, the milk that's produced by the methods of factory farming, we definitely need to pasteurize that because that milk is dangerous to consume and the pasteurization renders it safe. But what the pasteurization can't do is endow it with the qualities that the milk of healthy animals possesses. FLATOW: Well, you know, I've seen this - I've seen the raw milk stories done on the local - on the media network news now, and people who drink raw milk just sing the praises of how much better tasting, whatever it is\u2026 Prof. POLLAN: It's wonderful stuff. I mean, I - you know, when I've had a good source of it from somebody I trusted, I have indulged. And it's terrific. It does taste better. Dr. NESTLE: And you lived to tell the tale. Prof. POLLAN: And I lived to tell the tale. FLATOW: And, Marion, there's got to be some legitimate concerns. Dr. NESTLE: There are legitimate concerns, but there are legitimate concerns largely over industrialized milk or the milk that's produced. I mean, the main place where raw milk gets into trouble is in queso fresco, the Mexican soft cheeses. And they get contaminated with Listeria and it's - if they're not made well and if the processing isn't done right. And there are - have there been many, many examples of very severe illnesses due to contaminated raw milk. And so - but, you know, I'm now blogging these days on whattoeatbook. com, and I blogged about raw milk this week. The responses that I've gotten to it have been some of the most thoughtful discussions of the issue that I've ever seen. I mean, I'm really kind of blown away by how thoughtful people are about this issue. And one of them pointed out, you know, we have laws in this country that allow tobacco to be sold, why is everybody worried about raw milk, you know? And in the greater scheme of things, this seems like something that could be a matter of personal choice as long as it's labeled properly so that people make their own decisions about it, and the society isn't picking up the results of some terrible problem. It does cause problems. Prof. POLLAN: But, you know, this\u2026 FLATOW: Well, I\u2026 Prof. POLLAN: This issue of regulating small farms and artisanal production that Sandor is addressing, I think, is really a key issue. And holding these small operations to the same standards that you're going to hold a huge meat packer or milk producer is having the effect of killing off what could be a very important revival of local food systems. You know, when you talk to farmers, and you say what do you need to thrive -you know, people selling local food and raising local grass-fed meats and things like that - they're not looking for handouts. They're looking for some regulatory relief, you know? If you want to slaughter your own animals, you know, you've got to - you have to have a USDA-approved, you know, bathroom for the inspectors and\u2026 Dr. NESTLE: One for men and women. Prof. POLLAN: Yeah, one for men and women. And it's, you know, and this kind of - these scale-neutral regulations, as they're called, are absolutely killing this local revival. The farmer that I profiled in my book, Joe Salatin, just came out with a new book called - he's a wonderful meat producer and struggles with the regulators all the time to do what he's doing. He feeds about twelve hundred people in Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. His - the title of his new book is \"Everything I Want To Do Is Illegal. \" (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. NESTLE: Or fattening, I guess. FLATOW: Hang on, Michael. I have to pay the bills. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Talking with Michael Pollan, Sandor Katz and also Marion Nestle. I'm sorry. Who did I interrupt first? Mr. KATZ: Well, I just wanted to sort of throw in another absurd example of this, which is a couple of summers ago, a health - agriculture department inspector showed up at a farmers market here in Tennessee and they targeted the people who were selling - the farmers who were selling products like zucchini breads and jams and basically shut them down, and said that they couldn't sell those things without creating a special, code kitchen. I mean, these are the types of products called value-added products that have really enabled farmers to survive - small-scale, diversified operations. And, you know, I think that, you know, as a society, we have big choices to make. I mean, do we want further concentration? Do we want bigger and bigger operations, monoculture, factory-style farming? Or do we want to create the possibility for a revival of local food production and getting more people involved in farming, which is really what we need to do? We don't need to be dependent on huge corporations for our food. We're all inherently capable of creating our own food, and we - and we're all more than consumers. Human beings are more than consumers, and more of us need to be food producers. FLATOW: Let me - I have to go take a break, but let me get the call in from Gary in Minnesota. Hi, Gary. GARY (Caller): Hi. Hi. I'm an organic vegetable farmer here in the heart of corn country. And what I've seen - we've been here now for five years, and what I see is I can probably count the number of small families on, maybe one hand, that are our neighbors. I can probably count the number of bachelor farmers on my two hands. And what I see, like, our farm being a CSA - we're a 200-member CSA - we're really trying of be a hope in this darkness. I mean, this is - there isn't much hope in a rural economy. And these farms, you know, just keep on getting bigger and bigger, and this aspect of our communities, we've lost. It's dying. And, yeah, that's all I have to say. But I also wanted to thank Michael for bringing these perspectives into the mainstream press because it's really important for small producers like ourselves to hear those voices and to get those voices out there. FLATOW: Do you have to pay a fee to be a certified organic farmer there? GARY: We do. It's kind of interesting. I mean, we pay close to - I think, this year, it will be close to fifteen hundred, maybe $2,000, in order to prove that we're doing all the things that we're doing. Whereas, my neighbor, you know, next door, he owns hundreds of acres, you know, he gets these subsidies. I mean, I talked to him a couple of weeks ago and he was saying about how this new farm bill, he'll get, you know, close to $75,000 for virtually doing nothing. And so there's great inequalities. And Collin Peterson, you know, I'm in his district\u2026 Dr. NESTLE: Oh, dear. GARY: \u2026and I voiced my concerns loud and loud and loud, and he did one exciting thing. He did have a local food dinner a few months ago, but, you know, I hear a lot of talk but not a lot of action. FLATOW: All right. GARY: And this is the - this new farm bill just shows that there isn't a lot of action on any of the congresspeople. FLATOW: All right, Gary. Thanks for calling. GARY: Thanks. FLATOW: We have to take a short break. We'll come back and take lots more of your calls. Talking about nutrition, local farming and the farm bill - all interesting and relevant to us talking about food this hour, so stay with us. We'll be right back. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about food, farming and nutrition with my guests, journalist Michael Pollan; nutritionist Dr. Marion Nestle, author of \"What To Eat,\" also out with a special edition of Scientific American this month called - an article called, \"Eating Made Simple. \" So you might want to pick that article up. Sandor Ellix Katz, author of \"The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved: Inside America's Underground Food Movements. \" Michael Pollan, did I leave out a book of yours you want to talk about? Prof. POLLAN: Well, my last book on food was called the \"Omnivore's Dilemma. \" (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. POLLAN: Thanks for mentioning it. FLATOW: That was a great book. It's a great book. So I want to give everybody equal time. Dr. NESTLE: I'm using your book and Sandor's book in my class this fall. FLATOW: You all have so many books out at the same time, so I don't know which book, you know - I only get one out every few years so\u2026 And I have one coming out in September also. Give us a call. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Although, I haven't figured out how to interview myself yet\u2026 Dr. NESTLE: Well, I'll help you. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: 1-800-989-TALK - yes? Go ahead, Sandor. Mr. KATZ: I would just love to sort of follow up on something that the farmer who called earlier was talking about. But I just like to point out to people that, you know, when you spend a dollar on food at the supermarket of - an average of 19 cents of that dollar goes to farmers, and the other 81 cents, the USDA groups together as marketing, you know, which includes transportation and processing and all those other things that, you know, happen to most of the food before it ends up at the supermarket. But this is one of the things that makes small-scale farming operations not sustainable. When you buy directly from a farmer, they get the whole dollar, and that makes farming a much more viable profession. So if you're interested in, you know, supporting the growth of local foods and supporting farmers in your area, find ways to spend your money directly with the farmers. Go to farmers markets. Join CSA, community-supported agriculture, which is farms by subscriptions, and these are all ways that you can help support local food production by spending your money directly with the farmers so they get the whole dollar and not just 19 cents on the dollar. FLATOW: Let's go to Mike(ph) in Kansas. Hi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. MIKE (Caller): Hi. Thanks. I, you know, I think growing your own food and patronizing local growers is a wonderful thing, but I just - being affiliated - having been affiliated with agriculture, I have a hard time seeing that feasible on any large scale. And I also think that, you know, given our goal should be to move people away from the Twinkie to the carrot as one of your panelists have said, you know, I think a more common sense thing to do is to be, maybe, focus on something like irradiation that takes a relatively safe product and eliminates a moderate amount of danger and allow this to take whole food and natural food and move it through the chain a little more safely, a little more efficiently. FLATOW: Marion Nestle? Dr. NESTLE: Yeah. I think most of the - I've heard that argument a lot about the productivity issue. And there've been some studies of it, and those studies show that growing things organically and sustainably can be almost as productive and really marginally different than conventional agriculture, but leaving the soil in much better shape, and the environment in much better shape. And maybe we ought to be looking at multiplying the amount of land that we're using for growing food, but doing it in smaller batches so that we're not talking about thousands of thousands of acres, but talking about lots more people doing smaller numbers of acres. And I don't see that as being utopian or necessarily idealistic. I think there's a big science base that backs up the effectiveness of doing that sort of thing. And I think it would do a lot for rural America. I'm very struck, driving and flying in and out of the Midwest at how dead those small towns are. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Sandor, I'd like to\u2026 Prof. POLLAN: And by the way, the - you know, the farm bill has a lot to do with that. I mean, the way we're - the fact that we're supporting, you know, these small handful of crops and the way we're supporting it, is leading to consolidation of all those farms. And it also leads directly to the emptying of the - of animals from these farms and onto feedlots. Because if you're subsidizing the price of corn and soy, you're making it cheaper for a feedlot operator to fatten cattle or pigs than it is for a farmer. So you see how it's all connected. And, you know - and it doesn't have to be this way. And the idea of local agriculture and its limitations - you know, it was only 50 years ago, by and large, that most regions fed themselves. You know, that New Jersey was called the Garden State because it fed New York. And it, really, the rise of California as the vegetable and fruit basket is a fairly new development. And we assume this food system, this globalized and national food system, is inevitable and has always been this way. But of course, it isn't. It's a creation of very specific policies that could be changed. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. KATZ: I'd also like to just address the issue of what is efficiency. Is efficiency the maximum production per hour of labor, which I think that, you know, the current system really does maximize production per unit of labor? But the other way of thinking of efficiency is maximizing production per acre of land. And most of the studies that I've seen have come to the conclusion that labor-intensive cultivation of land with polycultures - growing many different types of plants in succession on the same land - actually produces much more then monoculturing the same amount of land. So, you know, what type of efficiency are we looking for? And frankly, you know, land is the limited - is the fixed, you know. The amount of people to work the land would certainly change the equations of the cost of food. But if we're seriously talking about how do we maximize production on limited amount of land, labor-intensive methods absolutely can produce more food. FLATOW: Well, Sandor, you have your own farm. You tell us you milked your goats this morning before you got here. What's your advice to someone who wants the freshest food but doesn't know anything about organic farming or tending goats or any of that stuff - but they still want that good fresh food. Mr. KATZ: Well, let me, first of all, say that I'm not a farmer. I'm a gardener. I'm not attempting to sell the food that I'm producing to anybody. And I think that that's important distinction. FLATOW: Is that the definition if a farmer? You sell stuff? Mr. KATZ: Well, I mean, I would say that's one of the distinctions between a farmer and a gardener. FLATOW: Okay. Mr. KATZ: However, I mean, I would say that, you know, anybody can start to grow some of their own food. If you live in an apartment in the city, you know, in a window, you can grow some herbs. On the, you know, in pots on the roof, you could grow some tomatoes. Dr. NESTLE: I've got tomatoes on my terrace. Mr. KATZ: Okay. Okay, great. But, I mean, you don't have to, you know, people sometimes are intimidated by the idea of, you know, growing all of their own food. Well, you know, nobody can just sort of start growing all of their own food. And I'm not even sure that it's desirable to aspire to total self-sufficiency. But, you know, the place to start is where you're at, and just learning how to grow something. And if you - and, you know, the next year, grow a little bit more. There's a learning curve to all of this. Nobody starts out being an expert in all of this. But there are community gardening programs in, you know, pretty much every city. There are lots of, you know, public institutions there devoting space to community gardening. You can, you know, ask somebody you know who has some land, if you can grow some food on their land. There are lots of possibilities. But, you know, don't wait for everything to be perfect. Just start growing something. The only place to start is where you are at. FLATOW: Karen(ph) in Sacramento. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. KAREN (Caller): Hello. Hello. FLATOW: Hello. I didn't mean to scare you there. KAREN: I live in (unintelligible) about three blocks from the capitol building. You actually answered my question. And it's part of what I belong to - is buying from the farmer direct. And we have drop-off points every week to pick up the vegetables and fruits and things that we bought. And they're always seasonal. So you adapt based on the vegetables (unintelligible) that you get. And it's been wonderful. And basically, the other thing you already addressed was being personally responsible for your diet and what you take in, and what you purchase and that. So, just thank you so much for this. Because if I can live in a city like Sacramento and - just so you know, we're really not the fruit-vegetable capital because half the things I go and buy, I go to the regular store. You know, like - when I mean regular, it's not the coop where it's organic. There are foods from Chile, I mean, fruits - oranges, apples -from every place but California. So we too are importing. So anyway, thank you very much for just the whole topic. FLATOW: Thanks for calling. KAREN: I appreciate it. FLATOW. You're welcome. Prof. POLLAN: You know, in fact, California exports tomatoes to Mexico and imports tomatoes from Mexico. I mean, there are a lot of absurdities in the system, where we're moving food around the country, you know, and around the world, sort of pointlessly. I mean, it makes an economic sense. Herman Daly, the economist had a great line about this. He said, you know, we export sugar cookies to Denmark. We import sugar cookies from Denmark. Wouldn't it make more sense to just swap recipes? FLATOW: But there's also another aspect to this. And that's\u2026 Dr. NESTLE: The butter is different. FLATOW: \u2026the increasing the cost of moving the food energy wise. Prof. POLLAN: Yeah. It's temporary. I mean, I don't think that this globalized food system, you know, when it meets up with the end of cheap oil, will survive. And that's one of the reasons it's critically important to preserve our ability to grow food, both nationally and regionally, because we're not going to be able to move it around the way we have been doing. You know, Sandor talked rightly about this, you know, our obsession with efficiency. But there's a second term that's just as important, and that's resiliency. And if a system doesn't have resiliency, it's very brittle and very dangerous. And that's the problem with a globalized monoculture-based agriculture. It will not respond very well when shocks come along, whether those shocks are, you know, the end of oil - cheap oil - or disease or whatever. And the way you have a resilient system is many, many sources of production, many, many crops on each acre. And then you have a measure of safety that you can't get any other way. FLATOW: Sandor, what other underground movements - you talked about that bread store. What other things like that going? Mr. KATZ: Well, sure. I mean, I think that there are a lot of different food movements, not all of them are underground. And I mean I don't mean to sort of glorify the idea of things that are not legal. But, you know, to give you another example of an underground movement, you know, according to some estimates, as much as half of the food that's produced in the United States goes to waste. And, you know, our whole system of, you know, sort of so many different foods being available at any different time sort of hinges on, you know, throwing away the excess. And there's a huge movement of, you know, people mining the food that's in dumpsters and, you know, and recycling those wasted food resources, you know, and to feed people who are hungry. You know, we have, you know, all of this excess and it gets thrown in dumpsters and then at the same time, we have all these people who are hungry and don't have access to food. So, you know, there are all these people digging through dumpsters, trying to recycle that. And, you know, and frankly, actually last year, there was a case in Colorado where a fellow got sentenced to six months in jail for going into a dumpster and, you know, taking out food that had been discarded by a retail establishment. Dr. NESTLE: Shades of \"Les Miserables. \" FLATOW: Taking about food this hour in TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Let's see if we can get a phone call or two in before we have to go. Let's go to Ken(ph) in Greenville, California. Hi. KEN (Caller): Hello. Thank you very much for covering this subject, which is probably one of the core issues of our society today. Thank you so very much. And for bringing the people together, that you have discussing it. My concern is specifically about what we, as individual consumers, as individual citizens, do to help this situation - I'm part of an organization. I do things myself. I'd be happy to describe some of those things, but also I'm most interested in what your guests have to say about that question. Dr. NESTLE: Oh, join organizations that are working on issues that you care about. There are lots and lots of issues in the food movement. KEN: Such as\u2026 Dr. NESTLE: There's the community food security movement, there's the marketing - the anti-marketing to kids movement. There's the school food movement. There's the fix the farm bill movement. And there are many organizations that are working on these. You pick your issue and work on it. They are all part of the food movement today. Prof. POLLAN: You know, the other thing I would just point out is compared to so many of the issues we confront in the world today, and the problems we have, this one is a lot more amenable to the individual doing something today. I mean, you get three votes every day - actually, four now. We're up to four eating occasions a day - I've just read. But to vote with your fork, essentially, for a different kind of food system and where you spend your money, we have seen, has a very powerful effect. We've seen the organic movement, which was essentially created by consumers and farmers connecting with one another. The grass-fed beef and poultry movement also, you know, created with no help from any institutions. So that, you know, this is something - you know, you have this fundamental political power, which is what you're going to take into your body and what you're not going to take into your body and where you're going to spend your food dollars. So it is an issue all of us can start on tonight. FLATOW: Are we going to see any real movements in this farm bill as it moves through the Senate? Prof. POLLAN: I think we will. I think that Harkin - Tom Harkin, who's going to write the farm bill in the Senate, is determined to write a more progressive bill and to put some real limits on subsidies. And put money into something called the conservation security program, which will reward farmers for being good stewards of the land for growing sustainably rather than cutting them checks for, you know, for every bushel of corn they can grow. So, you know, he's going to have to then negotiate his bill with Collin Peterson's in the House. The history of farm bill is they get written behind closed doors in conference committee. So it's really important that citizens keep up the pressure, and simply by writing your representative and your senator. You know, I talked to a lot of people in Washington and, believe it or not, that quaint practice really works. It really can silence the lobbying dollars when they actually hear from citizens, because they hear from them so seldom. And especially when these urban and coastal representative hear from people about the farm bill, they will stop doing what they've been doing, which is essentially trading their vote away, you know, for something else that they care more about. They have to realize that, you know, that eaters have a stake in this bill. And when they do, we'll get a better farm bill. FLATOW: All right. Dr. NESTLE: And it's really easy to lobby Congress. All you have to do is Google Contact Congress and up it pops. You don't even have to know anything. You could just send an e-mail and they really do count them. FLATOW: All right. We've ran out of time. I want to thank my guests. Michael Pollan, Knight professor of journalism, University of California at Berkeley; Dr. Marion Nestle, author of \"What to Eat,\" professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University here in New York; Sandor Elliz Katz is farmer - no, he's a gardener - sorry Sandor\u2026 (Soundbite of laughing) FLATOW: \u2026author of \"The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved: Inside America's Underground Food Movements,\" a very interesting book. Thank you all for taking time to be with us today.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  The 2007 farm bill passed the House in late July, and now the Senate will vote on it sometime around October. Well, if you're not a farmer, why should you care? Well, chances are, you do care about whether your food tastes good, maybe you really love groceries from your local green market; or maybe you shop in a supermarket, you do care about your health. You want to be sure the food you're buying is wholesome.  The food industry has so much influence on government, farm and food policy, not just in the U. S. but around the world, that some people say the farm bill should really be called the food bill.  That's what my next guest says. Michael Pollan is Knight professor of journalism and director of the program in science and environmental journalism at University of California at Berkeley, in Berkeley. He - four books and articles and magazines. He's been - he just writes all over the place. He's a contributing writer. He's exploring food and farming and is also talking about the farm bill, calling it the food bill.  Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Michael.  Professor MICHAEL POLLAN (Knight Professor in Journalism, University of California Berkeley): Thank you, Ira. Good to be back.  FLATOW: Thank you.  Dr. Marion Nestle has also written extensively about food. She is Paulette Goddard professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. Her latest book is called \"What to Eat. \" And she says that's what people are always asking her, what should I eat, right?  Dr. MARION NESTLE (Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health, New York University): Yeah. Eat. It's a good thing to do. Hi, Michael.  Prof. POLLAN: Hey, Marion.  FLATOW: Well, let's talk about the bill - let me start off, Michael, about the farm bill. Why is this bill so important? Why, you know, it flies under the radar screen as you write, and people don't pay attention to it but we should be paying attention to it?  Prof. POLLAN: Well, they don't pay attention to it because, as you suggest, they think it's a parochial piece of legislation involving special interest called farmers. But in fact, the farm bill is - really constitutes the set of rules for the entire U. S. food system. And it really determines what's in your supermarket, how accessible organic produce is, how accessible local farmers markets are, and really the difference in price between junk food and good food. You know, you can find the cause of that in the crops we choose to subsidize in the farm bill.  So it has an enormous impact on all of us. And once the rest of us who eat start paying attention, we might actually get a farm bill that gives us the kind of food system we could be proud of and that would make us a lot healthier and happier as well.  FLATOW: Let me dig into what you've said a little bit. The farm bill subsidizes just a few bunch of crops, does it not?  Prof. POLLAN: Yes, five crops. Commodity crops are the main recipients of the billions and billions of subsidies. And those are corn and soybeans, wheat, rice and cotton; four of the five, obviously, are foods. These are - they're called storable commodities, and one of the reasons they've always been subsidized is they can be stored. And they are, really, the building blocks of the food system, and increasingly so.  What's missing from that list, obviously, are any kind of fresh fruits and vegetables. Those crops that are subsidized are the ones that you can kind of break down into the building blocks of processed food. And corn and soybeans, which dominate snack foods and junk foods and sodas, those are the ones that we're supporting, with the result that some of the least healthy calories in the supermarket are the ones we're subsidizing the most. And the sorts of foods that, you know, public health authorities are always telling us we should eat more of, like fresh fruits and vegetables, we're doing nothing to help, or very little.  There are indirect subsidies to those crops, through subsidized water and things like that. And I'm not saying we should necessarily subsidize fruits and vegetables - that may not be the solution. But making these unhealthy calories so cheap is one of the reasons that we're as fat as we are.  FLATOW: You write in one of your commentaries that that's why Twinkies are less expensive than carrots.  Prof. POLLAN: Yeah, which, when you think about it, is amazing. I mean, Twinkie is an incredibly complicated product, with 37 ingredients and, you know, elaborate industrial processes. I mean, here is this miracle of food science that I want on my shelf, you know? Two years later, it's still soft.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Prof. POLLAN: And how is it that you can sell that more cheaply than a bunch of carrots? Well, because most of the ingredients in that Twinkie are getting government help.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. NESTLE: Well, don't you think that the issue here is that the farm bill itself is so hopelessly obfuscated nobody can understand it, it's enormous complex, and that even advocates for good food policy are at odds with each other over some of its provisions? I think what needs to be done is to break it down into much smaller pieces so that people understand what the issues are, but it's very, very difficult to do that.  Prof. POLLAN: Well, I don't think there's, you know, I think you're absolutely right, Marion. But I don't there's a whole lot of interest on the part of the beneficiaries of this bill or the congressmen most involved, in making it any easier to understand.  Dr. NESTLE: No, I think it's deliberately obfuscating.  Prof. POLLAN: Yeah, exactly. And in fact, there was a quote in the Chronicle by Collin Peterson, the head of the Ag Committee in the House, who was getting kind of annoyed that people like Marion Nestle was paying attention to her - to his bill, who said, you know, these city people don't know what they're talking about when they start talking about the farm bill. They don't even want us to have this conversation.  FLATOW: Hmm.  Dr. NESTLE: I think not, because if once you start having a conversation, you start looking at all of the issues and thinking, what on Earth is going on here and how on Earth are we going to do anything to fix it?  FLATOW: How did it start out? It didn't start out this way, Michael, right? The farm bill was a totally different animal when it started?  Prof. POLLAN: Well, you know, we started supporting farmers in a serious way during the Depression. We had a situation in the early '30s, where basically the price of agricultural commodities had fallen almost to zero. There was a great oversupply of commodities. We had kind of cranked up production during World War I. And there was too much food being produced on farms and not enough people with enough cash to buy it.  So to help the farmers who we, you know, we want to keep in business because we need to eat, the government started supporting them through a very different system of price supports. Essentially, the government would guarantee a certain price for corn or - well, not soybeans at the time - but corn and wheat and rice. And when the price dipped below that target price, which was really based on the cost of producing, the government would loan farmers the difference, would loan farmers the cost of their - the price of their crops, so they didn't have to sell it into a weak market. And they would keep the crop back. Prices would rise because supply had gone down. And then when prices went up, the farmers would either sell then and pay back the loan, or if prices didn't go up, the government would simply buy their crop, so they didn't have to pay back the loan. And they would then put the storable commodities in the grain reserve.  The government operated a grain reserve right into the '70s, and the beauty of that was - it was sort of like the strategic petroleum reserve we have now for oil. When prices were too high - as, by the way, they are now in corn - the government could sell a little bit to even out the market. And when prices were too low, essentially, they would buy more from farmers.  So you had the government participating in the market in a way that guaranteed the good price to farmers, stabilized crop prices for consumers, and, you know, the system wasn't half bad. In most years, it cost the government nothing because they were getting paid back, and there were actually years when the government was making money from farm policy. Now, they drop, you know, what this bill is $278 billion over five years.  So why we got away from that system is an interesting story. It really happened in the '70s because of the spike in food prices during the Nixon administration.  Dr. NESTLE: And also, the general coziness between the Department of Agriculture and food producers.  Prof. POLLAN: Well, exactly. And the people who\u2026  Dr. NESTLE: And Congress.  Prof. POLLAN: \u2026buy agricultural commodities, you know, Cargill, ADM, Coca-Cola, Kellogg's, they didn't like the system because it kept prices high. And they wanted a system, where essentially the government would just cut a check to the farmers, allow them to sell into a weak market and essentially allow prices to steadily fall, which is what's happened.  FLATOW:  Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255. And of course, now there's an impact with -because corn growers are growing energy, making ethanol, there's - and impacts the farms also.  Prof. POLLAN: Well, you know, ethanol is the big new wrinkle in the farm world right now. Since two years ago in the State of the Union Address, Bush decided to get behind ethanol and the government has started subsidizing it and requiring 10 percent of our gas be ethanol. The price of corn has actually skyrocketed. I think it's over three or four dollars a bushel right now. And this is going to have an enormous impact on the food system.  And, you know, there's a real question whether mixing up energy and food is such a good idea. I happen to think it's not. I think ethanol is really a bad idea for many, many reasons. But one of which is that it's putting enormous pressure on the food system. And I just don't want us to, you know, be devoting our arable land to feeding our SUVs rather than our people.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Hi, Rebecca in Ithaca, New York. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  REBECCA (Caller): Hi. I'm a small vegetable grower. We have a CSA, community-supported agriculture enterprise in Ithaca. And I'm just really interested in how the farm bill seems to be - it's like a nexus of so many issues in our culture, from the use - overuse of petroleum, over-reliance on petroleum, to obesity and diabetes in our kids. It seems like we're always subsidizing corporations rather than the little guy.  FLATOW: Isn't there something in the farm bill that will stimulate local farmers\u2026  Dr. NESTLE: Peanuts.  FLATOW: \u2026establishing direct markets to consumers?  Dr. NESTLE: Yes, small amounts of money.  FLATOW: Small amounts.  Dr. NESTLE: Really small.  FLATOW: Michael?  Prof. POLLAN: Well, there are. There are - you know, there's some very positive programs that get slipped into the House bill. And as Marion says, the numbers are very small, but the pressure from activists was such that the bill did move a little bit, so that there's money to convert to organic agriculture. There's now - there used to be a rule that school lunch programs had to just simply take the cheapest food available. Now, they can favor local producers. That's a very important provision.  Dr. NESTLE: That's terrific.  Prof. POLLAN: So there's some good into there\u2026  Dr. NESTLE: Let's hope it lasts.  Prof. POLLAN: \u2026it's a real Christmas tree bill, though. I mean, the way Pelosi got it through was she really wanted lots of money for the conventional farm programs and - but in order to get that, she had to buy off some activists and buy off the hunger lobby, as it's horribly called, with some extra food stamp money, and that's really the history of this bill is, you know, cobbled together a coalition to get it through.  But it must be said that, you know, it passed with fewer votes than normal and there was more pressure for reform this year than they have felt in decades. And that's very encouraging because when the Senate takes it up, I think we may see a very different and possibly more progressive bill.  FLATOW: Right. We're going to take a short break and come back and talk lots more with Dr. Marion Nestle, who is - latest book - her latest book is \"What to Eat. \" We'll talk about how to choose what to eat, and how do you know where the food is grown - a lot of people are concerned of finding out on the label where the food is grown. Sometimes, you can look at an orange and see it comes from Chile or something. But what about these processed foods and what's going on with them, and people worried about eating Chinese-produced foods and things like that.  We'll talk more about that with Dr. Nestle. Also, Michael Pollen will be back and we're also going to bring on a gentleman who wrote \"The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved: Inside America's Underground Food Movements. \" Maybe you belong to that food movement. We'd like to hear about it. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break.  I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking about food, nutrition, farm bill, what to eat, with Marion Nestle, and she's with us with Michael Pollen. Let me ask, before I bring on my next guest, Marion, should people be concerned where their food comes from?  Dr. NESTLE: Absolutely. Without any question. One of the things you want to know is how far it travels because you can guess that if it's traveled a long distance, it probably doesn't taste as good. It's not going to be as fresh. And it may be something that was grown in a place where you're not quite sure that the safety standards were as high as you might like them to be. And of course, the recent Chinese incidents have played right into that.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. NESTLE: Congress passed a country-of-origin-labeling bill a few years ago and then in its infinite wisdom, has postponed and postponed and postponed it\u2026  FLATOW: Is that right? Yeah.  Dr. NESTLE: \u2026except for fish in supermarkets, which is supposed to be labeled. But they're not.  FLATOW: So can you ask your grocer? You can ask\u2026  Dr. NESTLE: Oh, you can ask that is - you know, it's one of the nasty things I like to do when I'm in a provocative mood is to go in and ask the grocer where stuff comes from. They don't have a clue.  FLATOW: But a lot of it, if it's off, say, out of season, it's got to be coming from\u2026  Dr. NESTLE: Has to\u2026  FLATOW: \u2026right.  Dr. NESTLE: \u2026it has to come from a place where it's in season.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. NESTLE: So, you can, you know, they very proudly say that blueberries in November come from Patagonia. That's one of my favorite ones.  FLATOW: Patagonia?  Dr. NESTLE: Patagonia grows blueberries, apparently, in December or in January and November. And apples from New Zealand are another one that I find extremely amusing. We don't grow apples in this country? Well, I guess we don't in the off season.  FLATOW: Is there any way to protect our selves from, you know, the E. coli or the other kinds of things that could spread on the farms?  Dr. NESTLE: Yeah. Cook your foods. That'll do it. I mean, that's one of the great advantages of cooking is it kills bacteria. Otherwise, you depend on regulatory agencies to enforce a system of food safety, or you depend on the industry itself to do it voluntarily, which I have to say is quite iffy.  FLATOW: Iffy?  Dr. NESTLE: Iffy.  FLATOW: If you're going to be that worried, you're not going to be eating out then because you have lost control of the track?  Dr. NESTLE: Or you just make sure you cook everything; everything is cooked.  FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah.  Dr. NESTLE: I mean, the spinach episode was a very good example of what happens\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. NESTLE: \u2026and what's part of our industrialized food system. These things are going to happen more and more often if we don't have a better regulatory system in my view.  FLATOW: Why can't we just irradiate the foods?  Dr. NESTLE: It doesn't taste good afterwards. I mean, for a lot of foods, you just can't. And also, it's what I call a late-stage techno fix. What you're doing is irradiating dirty food. And as Carol Tucker Foreman, a former assistant secretary for agriculture, is quoted as saying sterilized poop is still poop.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Michael, you want to weigh in on any of this?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Prof. POLLAN: Yeah\u2026.  FLATOW: I didn't mean to bring you in on that comment.  Prof. POLLAN: I - no, not on that particular comment. I think it's true, though. It's the classic pattern of the industrial food system is that whenever it creates a problem, it comes up with an industrial solution, a new business to make more money over the mess that's been created rather than trying to go back to the origin and fix the problem.  I mean, E. coli, 15787 - the bug we're really worried about - is appears to be a, you know, a bug that evolved in feedlot cattle. And when you feed cattle something they shouldn't be eating, which is to say huge rations of corn, it acidifies their gut in a way that makes it hospitable to the evolution of this particular bug. And now, we have this bug and now we're going to make money irradiating this poop we've created.  It seems to me, you know, how much better it would be to kind of fix the feedlot system so that the animals do not harbor this bug. When you put the animals on - back on grass and hay, they're - the amount of E. coli in their gut diminishes something like 60 or 80 percent. Now, the bug is here and it's out and it's in, you know, lots of cattle and now we have to deal with them, the food system.  But knowing where your food comes from, I think, is vitally important. And the fact that we don't is that our food chain is so long and opaque that people have to guess, and it just seems like shameful. It's very simple information. We're entitled to information about our food. And any producer that wants to hide details about where the food came from or how it was produced is not a producer you want to patronize.  Dr. NESTLE: Well, the really scary part is they don't know\u2026  Prof. POLLAN: Well, that's true.  Dr. NESTLE: You know, I've been dealing a lot - because I'm working on this book about pet food, and I've been dealing a lot with pet food manufacturers about where they get their ingredients. They don't know.  Prof. POLLAN: There was a wonderful article in the Times about a loaf of bread that Sara Lee had invented and it had something like, I don't know, 40 or 50 ingredients, which is a story in itself, you know. Bread can be made with flour\u2026  Dr. NESTLE: Five.  Prof. POLLAN: \u2026water and\u2026  Dr. NESTLE: Five ingredients.  Prof. POLLAN: \u2026salt and yeast. But it's gotten a lot more complicated. And they listed how many of those ingredients were from overseas and how far they had come from. I mean, essentially right now, something like ascorbic acid, Vitamin C, which is in lots of foods because it's an antioxidant, you know, is controlled by the Chinese. They control something like 80 percent of the market for that food.  So I think it's true. I think the food chain is long and global and a lot of people lose track of where things come from. And that is a problem because you can't count on - certainly in China, you cannot count on the regulatory regime in China - the real questions about the food coming from China, particularly the so-called organic food coming from China, which is now all over the supermarket, and there are real questions as to, you know, in what sense is it organic if at all.  FLATOW: Well, let me bring on my next guest, who has solved all of those problems by growing his own food, knowing where it comes from, and is the author of the book, \"The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved: Inside America's Underground Food Movements. \" Maybe he didn't realize there was an underground food movement or movements?  Dr. NESTLE: I didn't think it was underground\u2026  FLATOW: Well, not literally. But here to talk about it is Sandor Ellix Katz, who practices, I say, what he preaches, growing his own food organically, of course, in rural Tennessee. He is a food activist and author of that book. He joins us from Nashville. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Mr. SANDOR ELLIX KATZ (Author, \"The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved: Inside America's Underground Food Movements\"): Pleasure to be with you today.  FLATOW: It's funny that Michael is talking about bread because you have a really interesting part in your book. You talk about a growing but secret kind of club, a new way to produce, buy and eat food called the Bread Club. Tell us about this underground club.  Mr. KATZ: Well, I mean, I wouldn't call it a new way of producing food. I mean, it's actually a very old way of producing food. The Bread Club is a fellow who I met who lives on the West Coast in a city that I can't identify without potentially endangering what he's doing. But he built himself a really beautiful wood-fired brick oven, and every two weeks, he bakes about 100 loaves of bread and sells it to people in his town in the place - and what's illegal about it is that he does not have a licensed, code kitchen. In the United States, we've created a regulatory system which has made traditional small-scale cottage industry food production virtually impossible.  And, you know, the regulations are certainly appropriate to mass production, but they're applied to all food productions so that his, you know, pretty much made it, you know, impossible or very difficult for small-scale producers to exist. So he has gone underground in the sense that he is producing something which does not conform to the regulatory codes.  FLATOW: Why isn't he shut down?  Mr. KATZ: Well, I mean, he's producing something that actually is incredibly safe. I mean, you know, bread is baked in an oven. A wood-fired oven like that is, you know, 600 and some degrees when he breaks - bakes the bread, so that's actually a very intrinsically safe food. But, you know, it does not conform to the letter of the codes. And, you know, the codes all dictate what types of surfaces, that it can't be in a kitchen in which, you know, a household prepares its daily food.  But he is part of a, you know, a movement of people who are trying to produce food, really, in accordance with traditional methods and sell them and, you know, enjoy them in their local areas. I mean, he's really actually carrying on an ancient tradition and not doing anything that's particularly new at all except for the fact that it violates the law.  Prof. POLLAN: You know, this is going on all over the place, what Sandor's describing. And I was in a farm stand today - and I won't name where, but - on Martha's Vineyard - and I was offered - I was buying tomatoes - hey, we've got some raw milk in the back, which is, you know, I don't know whether it's legal or not to sell off the farm, but it's illegal to sell in stores in the state of Massachusetts.  And there is a growing underground food movement that Sandor documents really beautifully in his book. But they're different levels of safety involved, though, obviously, and I think bread is probably a very different product than raw milk.  FLATOW: Sandor, you do believe in raw milk, too, right?  Mr. KATZ: Well, yeah. I mean, I - this morning, I milked our goats before I came here to the studio. So I've been raising goats for the past 14 years and have had access to wonderful raw milk and I did not get into raw milk sort of through the underground movement, but I have definitely become aware of the underground movement, and it's such a huge movement.  I mean, it relates to some issues that you all were talking about a little bit earlier, and that is like do we use the techno fixes to, you know, make dirty food safer? Or do we create food that is of good quality in the first place? And I think that that's really, you know, at the core of this whole question of raw milk versus pasteurized milk.  Certainly, the milk that's produced by the methods of factory farming, we definitely need to pasteurize that because that milk is dangerous to consume and the pasteurization renders it safe. But what the pasteurization can't do is endow it with the qualities that the milk of healthy animals possesses.  FLATOW: Well, you know, I've seen this - I've seen the raw milk stories done on the local - on the media network news now, and people who drink raw milk just sing the praises of how much better tasting, whatever it is\u2026  Prof. POLLAN: It's wonderful stuff. I mean, I - you know, when I've had a good source of it from somebody I trusted, I have indulged. And it's terrific. It does taste better.  Dr. NESTLE: And you lived to tell the tale.  Prof. POLLAN: And I lived to tell the tale.  FLATOW: And, Marion, there's got to be some legitimate concerns.  Dr. NESTLE: There are legitimate concerns, but there are legitimate concerns largely over industrialized milk or the milk that's produced. I mean, the main place where raw milk gets into trouble is in queso fresco, the Mexican soft cheeses. And they get contaminated with Listeria and it's - if they're not made well and if the processing isn't done right. And there are - have there been many, many examples of very severe illnesses due to contaminated raw milk.  And so - but, you know, I'm now blogging these days on whattoeatbook. com, and I blogged about raw milk this week. The responses that I've gotten to it have been some of the most thoughtful discussions of the issue that I've ever seen. I mean, I'm really kind of blown away by how thoughtful people are about this issue.  And one of them pointed out, you know, we have laws in this country that allow tobacco to be sold, why is everybody worried about raw milk, you know? And in the greater scheme of things, this seems like something that could be a matter of personal choice as long as it's labeled properly so that people make their own decisions about it, and the society isn't picking up the results of some terrible problem. It does cause problems.  Prof. POLLAN: But, you know, this\u2026  FLATOW: Well, I\u2026  Prof. POLLAN: This issue of regulating small farms and artisanal production that Sandor is addressing, I think, is really a key issue. And holding these small operations to the same standards that you're going to hold a huge meat packer or milk producer is having the effect of killing off what could be a very important revival of local food systems.  You know, when you talk to farmers, and you say what do you need to thrive -you know, people selling local food and raising local grass-fed meats and things like that - they're not looking for handouts. They're looking for some regulatory relief, you know? If you want to slaughter your own animals, you know, you've got to - you have to have a USDA-approved, you know, bathroom for the inspectors and\u2026  Dr. NESTLE: One for men and women.  Prof. POLLAN: Yeah, one for men and women. And it's, you know, and this kind of - these scale-neutral regulations, as they're called, are absolutely killing this local revival. The farmer that I profiled in my book, Joe Salatin, just came out with a new book called - he's a wonderful meat producer and struggles with the regulators all the time to do what he's doing. He feeds about twelve hundred people in Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. His - the title of his new book is \"Everything I Want To Do Is Illegal. \"  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. NESTLE: Or fattening, I guess.  FLATOW: Hang on, Michael. I have to pay the bills. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Talking with Michael Pollan, Sandor Katz and also Marion Nestle. I'm sorry. Who did I interrupt first?  Mr. KATZ: Well, I just wanted to sort of throw in another absurd example of this, which is a couple of summers ago, a health - agriculture department inspector showed up at a farmers market here in Tennessee and they targeted the people who were selling - the farmers who were selling products like zucchini breads and jams and basically shut them down, and said that they couldn't sell those things without creating a special, code kitchen. I mean, these are the types of products called value-added products that have really enabled farmers to survive - small-scale, diversified operations.  And, you know, I think that, you know, as a society, we have big choices to make. I mean, do we want further concentration? Do we want bigger and bigger operations, monoculture, factory-style farming? Or do we want to create the possibility for a revival of local food production and getting more people involved in farming, which is really what we need to do? We don't need to be dependent on huge corporations for our food. We're all inherently capable of creating our own food, and we - and we're all more than consumers. Human beings are more than consumers, and more of us need to be food producers.  FLATOW: Let me - I have to go take a break, but let me get the call in from Gary in Minnesota. Hi, Gary.  GARY (Caller): Hi. Hi. I'm an organic vegetable farmer here in the heart of corn country. And what I've seen - we've been here now for five years, and what I see is I can probably count the number of small families on, maybe one hand, that are our neighbors. I can probably count the number of bachelor farmers on my two hands. And what I see, like, our farm being a CSA - we're a 200-member CSA - we're really trying of be a hope in this darkness. I mean, this is - there isn't much hope in a rural economy.  And these farms, you know, just keep on getting bigger and bigger, and this aspect of our communities, we've lost. It's dying. And, yeah, that's all I have to say. But I also wanted to thank Michael for bringing these perspectives into the mainstream press because it's really important for small producers like ourselves to hear those voices and to get those voices out there.  FLATOW: Do you have to pay a fee to be a certified organic farmer there?  GARY: We do. It's kind of interesting. I mean, we pay close to - I think, this year, it will be close to fifteen hundred, maybe $2,000, in order to prove that we're doing all the things that we're doing. Whereas, my neighbor, you know, next door, he owns hundreds of acres, you know, he gets these subsidies. I mean, I talked to him a couple of weeks ago and he was saying about how this new farm bill, he'll get, you know, close to $75,000 for virtually doing nothing. And so there's great inequalities. And Collin Peterson, you know, I'm in his district\u2026  Dr. NESTLE: Oh, dear.  GARY: \u2026and I voiced my concerns loud and loud and loud, and he did one exciting thing. He did have a local food dinner a few months ago, but, you know, I hear a lot of talk but not a lot of action.  FLATOW: All right.  GARY: And this is the - this new farm bill just shows that there isn't a lot of action on any of the congresspeople.  FLATOW: All right, Gary. Thanks for calling.  GARY: Thanks.  FLATOW: We have to take a short break. We'll come back and take lots more of your calls. Talking about nutrition, local farming and the farm bill - all interesting and relevant to us talking about food this hour, so stay with us. We'll be right back.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking this hour about food, farming and nutrition with my guests, journalist Michael Pollan; nutritionist Dr. Marion Nestle, author of \"What To Eat,\" also out with a special edition of Scientific American this month called - an article called, \"Eating Made Simple. \" So you might want to pick that article up. Sandor Ellix Katz, author of \"The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved: Inside America's Underground Food Movements. \"  Michael Pollan, did I leave out a book of yours you want to talk about?  Prof. POLLAN: Well, my last book on food was called the \"Omnivore's Dilemma. \"  (Soundbite of laughter)  Prof. POLLAN: Thanks for mentioning it.  FLATOW: That was a great book. It's a great book. So I want to give everybody equal time.  Dr. NESTLE: I'm using your book and Sandor's book in my class this fall.  FLATOW: You all have so many books out at the same time, so I don't know which book, you know - I only get one out every few years so\u2026 And I have one coming out in September also.  Give us a call. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Although, I haven't figured out how to interview myself yet\u2026  Dr. NESTLE: Well, I'll help you.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: 1-800-989-TALK - yes? Go ahead, Sandor.  Mr. KATZ: I would just love to sort of follow up on something that the farmer who called earlier was talking about. But I just like to point out to people that, you know, when you spend a dollar on food at the supermarket of - an average of 19 cents of that dollar goes to farmers, and the other 81 cents, the USDA groups together as marketing, you know, which includes transportation and processing and all those other things that, you know, happen to most of the food before it ends up at the supermarket.  But this is one of the things that makes small-scale farming operations not sustainable. When you buy directly from a farmer, they get the whole dollar, and that makes farming a much more viable profession. So if you're interested in, you know, supporting the growth of local foods and supporting farmers in your area, find ways to spend your money directly with the farmers. Go to farmers markets. Join CSA, community-supported agriculture, which is farms by subscriptions, and these are all ways that you can help support local food production by spending your money directly with the farmers so they get the whole dollar and not just 19 cents on the dollar.  FLATOW: Let's go to Mike(ph) in Kansas. Hi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  MIKE (Caller): Hi. Thanks. I, you know, I think growing your own food and patronizing local growers is a wonderful thing, but I just - being affiliated - having been affiliated with agriculture, I have a hard time seeing that feasible on any large scale. And I also think that, you know, given our goal should be to move people away from the Twinkie to the carrot as one of your panelists have said, you know, I think a more common sense thing to do is to be, maybe, focus on something like irradiation that takes a relatively safe product and eliminates a moderate amount of danger and allow this to take whole food and natural food and move it through the chain a little more safely, a little more efficiently.  FLATOW: Marion Nestle?  Dr. NESTLE: Yeah. I think most of the - I've heard that argument a lot about the productivity issue. And there've been some studies of it, and those studies show that growing things organically and sustainably can be almost as productive and really marginally different than conventional agriculture, but leaving the soil in much better shape, and the environment in much better shape. And maybe we ought to be looking at multiplying the amount of land that we're using for growing food, but doing it in smaller batches so that we're not talking about thousands of thousands of acres, but talking about lots more people doing smaller numbers of acres.  And I don't see that as being utopian or necessarily idealistic. I think there's a big science base that backs up the effectiveness of doing that sort of thing. And I think it would do a lot for rural America. I'm very struck, driving and flying in and out of the Midwest at how dead those small towns are.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Sandor, I'd like to\u2026  Prof. POLLAN: And by the way, the - you know, the farm bill has a lot to do with that. I mean, the way we're - the fact that we're supporting, you know, these small handful of crops and the way we're supporting it, is leading to consolidation of all those farms. And it also leads directly to the emptying of the - of animals from these farms and onto feedlots. Because if you're subsidizing the price of corn and soy, you're making it cheaper for a feedlot operator to fatten cattle or pigs than it is for a farmer.  So you see how it's all connected. And, you know - and it doesn't have to be this way. And the idea of local agriculture and its limitations - you know, it was only 50 years ago, by and large, that most regions fed themselves. You know, that New Jersey was called the Garden State because it fed New York. And it, really, the rise of California as the vegetable and fruit basket is a fairly new development. And we assume this food system, this globalized and national food system, is inevitable and has always been this way. But of course, it isn't. It's a creation of very specific policies that could be changed.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Mr. KATZ: I'd also like to just address the issue of what is efficiency. Is efficiency the maximum production per hour of labor, which I think that, you know, the current system really does maximize production per unit of labor? But the other way of thinking of efficiency is maximizing production per acre of land. And most of the studies that I've seen have come to the conclusion that labor-intensive cultivation of land with polycultures - growing many different types of plants in succession on the same land - actually produces much more then monoculturing the same amount of land. So, you know, what type of efficiency are we looking for? And frankly, you know, land is the limited - is the fixed, you know. The amount of people to work the land would certainly change the equations of the cost of food. But if we're seriously talking about how do we maximize production on limited amount of land, labor-intensive methods absolutely can produce more food.  FLATOW: Well, Sandor, you have your own farm. You tell us you milked your goats this morning before you got here. What's your advice to someone who wants the freshest food but doesn't know anything about organic farming or tending goats or any of that stuff - but they still want that good fresh food.  Mr. KATZ: Well, let me, first of all, say that I'm not a farmer. I'm a gardener. I'm not attempting to sell the food that I'm producing to anybody. And I think that that's important distinction.  FLATOW: Is that the definition if a farmer? You sell stuff?  Mr. KATZ: Well, I mean, I would say that's one of the distinctions between a farmer and a gardener.  FLATOW: Okay.  Mr. KATZ: However, I mean, I would say that, you know, anybody can start to grow some of their own food. If you live in an apartment in the city, you know, in a window, you can grow some herbs. On the, you know, in pots on the roof, you could grow some tomatoes.  Dr. NESTLE: I've got tomatoes on my terrace.  Mr. KATZ: Okay. Okay, great. But, I mean, you don't have to, you know, people sometimes are intimidated by the idea of, you know, growing all of their own food. Well, you know, nobody can just sort of start growing all of their own food. And I'm not even sure that it's desirable to aspire to total self-sufficiency. But, you know, the place to start is where you're at, and just learning how to grow something. And if you - and, you know, the next year, grow a little bit more.  There's a learning curve to all of this. Nobody starts out being an expert in all of this. But there are community gardening programs in, you know, pretty much every city. There are lots of, you know, public institutions there devoting space to community gardening. You can, you know, ask somebody you know who has some land, if you can grow some food on their land. There are lots of possibilities. But, you know, don't wait for everything to be perfect. Just start growing something. The only place to start is where you are at.  FLATOW: Karen(ph) in Sacramento. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  KAREN (Caller): Hello. Hello.  FLATOW: Hello. I didn't mean to scare you there.  KAREN: I live in (unintelligible) about three blocks from the capitol building. You actually answered my question. And it's part of what I belong to - is buying from the farmer direct. And we have drop-off points every week to pick up the vegetables and fruits and things that we bought. And they're always seasonal. So you adapt based on the vegetables (unintelligible) that you get. And it's been wonderful. And basically, the other thing you already addressed was being personally responsible for your diet and what you take in, and what you purchase and that. So, just thank you so much for this. Because if I can live in a city like Sacramento and - just so you know, we're really not the fruit-vegetable capital because half the things I go and buy, I go to the regular store. You know, like - when I mean regular, it's not the coop where it's organic. There are foods from Chile, I mean, fruits - oranges, apples -from every place but California. So we too are importing. So anyway, thank you very much for just the whole topic.  FLATOW: Thanks for calling.  KAREN: I appreciate it.  FLATOW. You're welcome.  Prof. POLLAN: You know, in fact, California exports tomatoes to Mexico and imports tomatoes from Mexico. I mean, there are a lot of absurdities in the system, where we're moving food around the country, you know, and around the world, sort of pointlessly. I mean, it makes an economic sense.  Herman Daly, the economist had a great line about this. He said, you know, we export sugar cookies to Denmark. We import sugar cookies from Denmark. Wouldn't it make more sense to just swap recipes?  FLATOW: But there's also another aspect to this. And that's\u2026  Dr. NESTLE: The butter is different.  FLATOW: \u2026the increasing the cost of moving the food energy wise.  Prof. POLLAN: Yeah. It's temporary. I mean, I don't think that this globalized food system, you know, when it meets up with the end of cheap oil, will survive. And that's one of the reasons it's critically important to preserve our ability to grow food, both nationally and regionally, because we're not going to be able to move it around the way we have been doing.  You know, Sandor talked rightly about this, you know, our obsession with efficiency. But there's a second term that's just as important, and that's resiliency. And if a system doesn't have resiliency, it's very brittle and very dangerous. And that's the problem with a globalized monoculture-based agriculture. It will not respond very well when shocks come along, whether those shocks are, you know, the end of oil - cheap oil - or disease or whatever. And the way you have a resilient system is many, many sources of production, many, many crops on each acre. And then you have a measure of safety that you can't get any other way.  FLATOW: Sandor, what other underground movements - you talked about that bread store. What other things like that going?  Mr. KATZ: Well, sure. I mean, I think that there are a lot of different food movements, not all of them are underground. And I mean I don't mean to sort of glorify the idea of things that are not legal. But, you know, to give you another example of an underground movement, you know, according to some estimates, as much as half of the food that's produced in the United States goes to waste. And, you know, our whole system of, you know, sort of so many different foods being available at any different time sort of hinges on, you know, throwing away the excess. And there's a huge movement of, you know, people mining the food that's in dumpsters and, you know, and recycling those wasted food resources, you know, and to feed people who are hungry.  You know, we have, you know, all of this excess and it gets thrown in dumpsters and then at the same time, we have all these people who are hungry and don't have access to food. So, you know, there are all these people digging through dumpsters, trying to recycle that. And, you know, and frankly, actually last year, there was a case in Colorado where a fellow got sentenced to six months in jail for going into a dumpster and, you know, taking out food that had been discarded by a retail establishment.  Dr. NESTLE: Shades of \"Les Miserables. \"  FLATOW: Taking about food this hour in TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  Let's see if we can get a phone call or two in before we have to go. Let's go to Ken(ph) in Greenville, California. Hi.  KEN (Caller): Hello. Thank you very much for covering this subject, which is probably one of the core issues of our society today. Thank you so very much. And for bringing the people together, that you have discussing it.  My concern is specifically about what we, as individual consumers, as individual citizens, do to help this situation - I'm part of an organization. I do things myself. I'd be happy to describe some of those things, but also I'm most interested in what your guests have to say about that question.  Dr. NESTLE: Oh, join organizations that are working on issues that you care about. There are lots and lots of issues in the food movement.  KEN: Such as\u2026  Dr. NESTLE: There's the community food security movement, there's the marketing - the anti-marketing to kids movement. There's the school food movement. There's the fix the farm bill movement. And there are many organizations that are working on these. You pick your issue and work on it. They are all part of the food movement today.  Prof. POLLAN: You know, the other thing I would just point out is compared to so many of the issues we confront in the world today, and the problems we have, this one is a lot more amenable to the individual doing something today. I mean, you get three votes every day - actually, four now. We're up to four eating occasions a day - I've just read. But to vote with your fork, essentially, for a different kind of food system and where you spend your money, we have seen, has a very powerful effect. We've seen the organic movement, which was essentially created by consumers and farmers connecting with one another.  The grass-fed beef and poultry movement also, you know, created with no help from any institutions. So that, you know, this is something - you know, you have this fundamental political power, which is what you're going to take into your body and what you're not going to take into your body and where you're going to spend your food dollars. So it is an issue all of us can start on tonight.  FLATOW: Are we going to see any real movements in this farm bill as it moves through the Senate?  Prof. POLLAN: I think we will. I think that Harkin - Tom Harkin, who's going to write the farm bill in the Senate, is determined to write a more progressive bill and to put some real limits on subsidies. And put money into something called the conservation security program, which will reward farmers for being good stewards of the land for growing sustainably rather than cutting them checks for, you know, for every bushel of corn they can grow. So, you know, he's going to have to then negotiate his bill with Collin Peterson's in the House. The history of farm bill is they get written behind closed doors in conference committee. So it's really important that citizens keep up the pressure, and simply by writing your representative and your senator.  You know, I talked to a lot of people in Washington and, believe it or not, that quaint practice really works. It really can silence the lobbying dollars when they actually hear from citizens, because they hear from them so seldom. And especially when these urban and coastal representative hear from people about the farm bill, they will stop doing what they've been doing, which is essentially trading their vote away, you know, for something else that they care more about. They have to realize that, you know, that eaters have a stake in this bill. And when they do, we'll get a better farm bill.  FLATOW: All right.  Dr. NESTLE: And it's really easy to lobby Congress. All you have to do is Google Contact Congress and up it pops. You don't even have to know anything. You could just send an e-mail and they really do count them.  FLATOW: All right. We've ran out of time. I want to thank my guests. Michael Pollan, Knight professor of journalism, University of California at Berkeley; Dr. Marion Nestle, author of \"What to Eat,\" professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University here in New York; Sandor Elliz Katz is farmer - no, he's a gardener - sorry Sandor\u2026  (Soundbite of laughing)  FLATOW: \u2026author of \"The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved: Inside America's Underground Food Movements,\" a very interesting book.

I'm Michele Norris. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Tim Page writes music criticism for the Washington Post. He does it well enough to have won a Pulitzer Prize. He has advised a major symphony orchestra, interviewed important composers and musicians. He also wrote a biography of the novelist Dawn Powell, and edited and annotated her work. So reading his article in this week's issue of the New Yorker is a real eye-opener. The article is called \"Parallel Play, a Lifetime of Restless Isolation. \" It's about living with Asperger's syndrome. Tim Page joins us from Baltimore. Welcome, Tim. Mr. TIM PAGE (Music critic, Washington Post): It's good to be here. SIEGEL: First, how old were you when it became evident to people around you, if not you yourself, that you were different? Mr. PAGE: Oh, I think it was pretty obvious by the time I was 3 or 4. It was just a question of what that difference was and I didn't fit into any of the categories at that point. And I had some strengths and I had many, many weaknesses. SIEGEL: You start the New Yorker article with something that you wrote in the second grade. And I wonder if you would first describe the assignment, and then read some of what you wrote in response to the assignment. Mr. PAGE: Well, we took a field trip to Boston, and I think we were supposed to write all sorts of inspirational things about Bunker Hill and all sorts of things like that. I turned in an assignment that exasperated my teacher so extravagantly that she actually cut through the paper when she wrote, see me, in red pencil. SIEGEL: Well, let's hear what you wrote. Mr. PAGE: All right. Here's what I wrote. Well, we went to Boston, Massachusetts, through the town of Warrenville, Connecticut, on Route 44A. It was very pretty and there was a church that reminded me of pictures of Russia from our book that is published by Time Life. We arrived in Boston at 9:17. At 11, we went on a big tour of Boston on Gray Line 43 made by the Superior Bus Company like Schoolbus Six, which goes down Hutting(ph) Lodge road where Maria lives, and then on to Separatist Road, and then to South Eagle Ville before it comes to our school. We saw lots of good things like the Boston Massacre site. The tour ended at 1:05. Before I knew it, we were going home. (Soundbite of laughter) SIEGEL: Well, you certainly had observed a great deal on the field trip to Boston. Mr. PAGE: I went directly to the toenail of the matter. SIEGEL: The toenail, exactly. And this was a pattern. You were obsessed with detail when you came in contact with some information. Mr. PAGE: I was obsessed with detail. I was obsessed with music. I was obsessed with silent film. I was obsessed with old photographs. And I was really completely oblivious to a tremendous amount of other things that were going on around me, including most social things and certainly most of what my teachers wanted me to know. I basically flunked and flunked and flunked and flunked for many, many years but I educated myself, at least in the subjects I was really interested in. It was an unusual boyhood, and I thought perhaps writing about it would be helpful to other people who might have some of the same characteristics. SIEGEL: One of the things you immerse yourself in was etiquette. Mr. PAGE: Yeah, yeah. I really didn't understand how people related to each other. But it was funny. It was when I was in my early teens that I discovered Emily Post's book \"Etiquette\" and I fully intended on sneering at it and thinking that it was uncool - and old hat, and old fashioned. And it actually explained to me why people behave the way they did. And once it was actually explained to me and I could understand it intellectually, I could work it into my own life. SIEGEL: And you haven't placed the fork in the wrong place yet, I assume. Mr. PAGE: Oh, I'm not so good at that, but at least I got the gist of it. I got the idea of why people didn't just talk on and on about things and how courtesy was something that make people feel more comfortable. SIEGEL: How important was it to you - long after your childhood was behind you and after you'd become a very successful critic - how important was it for someone to diagnose and put a name to this condition and say you are living with Asperger's syndrome? Mr. PAGE: I found it very helpful simply because it explains so much. It finally explained why I had this, you know, fairly extraordinary capacity for remembering facts and figures and data, and why I was so oblivious to so much of what the rest of the world really thought was important. I say in the piece that I'm often complimented for being able to think outside the box. But for me, it's always been a struggle to find out exactly where the box is. You know, 40 years ago, when I was probably at my most afflicted, there was no knowledge about this whatsoever. I clearly wasn't retarded and I clearly didn't suffer from classic autism, but something was still very wrong. And I think, for me, it's certainly helped me make more sense of my life. And I just hope that my own experience will help other people. SIEGEL: In the article, you at least allude to the fact that in terms of interpersonal relationships, personal relationships, you feel much more easy about life today than you did 15, 20 years ago, yes? Mr. PAGE: Oh, absolutely. There's no doubt about it. I'm much more drawn into the human race now and much happier and certainly much more in control. But, you know, it's not something that goes away. There is no, quote, unquote, \"cure\" for it, but there is living with it. I mean, for instance, I couldn't tell you what color my mother's eyes were. And I have no idea what the person I had dinner with last night was wearing to dinner, but I'll remember all about, you know, what we talked about and what the room might have been like. You know, it's just a different way of processing information. And - but it can be quite difficult, especially when you're young. SIEGEL: Tim Page, thank you very much for talking with us today.

I'm Robert Siegel. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. The tale of Frankenstein has enthralled people for almost 200 years. It's read as a cautionary tale of science running amok. But some scholars see something else. An example of what even a short temporary change in the weather can mean for literature and culture. Today, as part of our Climate Connection series with National Geographic, we explore how a change in climate helped create a famous monster. Here's NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: Ask people if there's a connection between storms and literature, and chances are they might think of one thing. (Soundbite of audiobook of \"Frankenstein\") Unidentified Reader: (As Dr. Henry Frankenstein) It's alive! It's alive! It's alive! GREENFIELDBOYCE: In this classic film version of \"Frankenstein,\" the scientist jump-starts his creation with a bolt of lightning. But Bill Phillips says you won't find that scene in the book. Professor BILL PHILLIPS (Literature, University of Barcelona): There's no lightning or anything. It's not as spectacular as it is in the films. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Phillips teaches literature at the University of Barcelona in Spain. He says it's funny, though, because the movies do kind of get the right idea in a larger sense. Phillips thinks extreme weather was involved in the birth of the creature. Just not like we usually think. Mary Shelley started writing the book in 1816. She was just a teenager. She'd run off with a married poet, Percy Shelley. They went to Switzerland for a summer vacation. Prof. PHILLIPS: I think the plan would have been to be tourists and go climbing mountains and things like that. And they couldn't, because of the weather. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Phillips says the weather was beyond bad. It was unbelievable. Prof. PHILLIPS: And we know why it was bad weather. It was because of this volcano. GREENFIELDBOYCE: A volcano named Mount Tambora. It erupted in Indonesia, sending vast plumes of dust into the atmosphere. Starting in the spring of 1816, people in Europe and North America saw skies that were strange, even alarming. Prof. PHILLIPS: It actually really was dark for days, if not weeks, on end. The harvest failed for three years. It was one of the coldest periods in modern history, so it was extremely serious. There were many people dying from starvation because of the loss of harvest. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In the midst of this chaos, Mary Shelley was hanging out at a villa reading ghost stories with her friends, including Lord Byron. Prof. PHILLIPS: And then I think it was Byron who came up with the idea that they should actually write a ghost story themselves. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Shelley started work on \"Frankenstein\" and the weather seemed to show up on almost every page. Take page 68. Victor Frankenstein is out walking in the rain at night. He's just about to catch a glimpse of the monster. (Soundbite of audiobook of \"Frankenstein\") Unidentified Reader: (As Victor Moritz) Vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire. (Soundbite of thunder) Unidentified Reader: (As Victor Moritz) A flash of lightning illuminated the object; its gigantic stature and the deformity of its aspect, more hideous than belongs to humanity. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Storms like this one seem to have come almost word for word from letters she wrote about the weather in Switzerland. Here's the letter to her sister. Unidentified Woman: (Reading) One night, we enjoyed a fine storm than I'd ever before beheld. The lake was lit up. The pines on Jura made visible, and all the scene illuminated for an instant, when a pitchy blackness succeeded, and the thunder came in frightful bursts over our heads amid the darkness. GREENFIELDBOYCE: the creature in \"Frankenstein\" is strongly associated with these storms. And Bill Phillips says, all through the novel he's also linked to cold. Prof. PHILLIPS: He invariably meets his creator at the tops of mountains, in icy caves. And then at the end of the novel, they go into the Arctic Ocean. We're led to believe that they die as they drift off on an ice floe. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Now, maybe Mary Shelley would have sent her creature to the Arctic no matter what kind of weather was outside. But John Clubbe doesn't think so. He taught literature at the University of Kentucky and he points out, in 1816, it was snowing in July. Professor JOHN CLUBBE (English, University of Kentucky): Seeing this world of ice and snow at close hand, when you should be seeing green fields and trees in bloom, this is so unusual. It has to affect the way you feel and want to write. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He thinks when people look at art, they should think more about weather and climate. And \"Frankenstein\" shows that if our climate changes, our literature and our poetry might change, too. Plus, John Clubbe says, if you're talking about climate, \"Frankenstein\" is just a weirdly appropriate cautionary tale about unintended consequences. Prof. CLUBBE: All the improvements to make life easier and better and so forth, they resulted in this oncoming crisis called global warming, which is a potentially monstrous scenario that looms ahead for all of us. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Clubbe says if we just ignore this problem, like Victor Frankenstein neglected his creation, the weather might start to feel as strange as it was in 1816.

African Americans accounted for a lot of it. That's when Michelle Ozumba joined the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention. And she's their CEO and president today. Michelle, welcome. Ms. MICHELLE OZUMBA (President and Chief Executive Officer, Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention): Thank you very much. CHIDEYA: So when you started this in Georgia, how bad was the teen pregnancy rate? Ms. OZUMBA: Well, we were at a rate of about 107 per 1,000 girls ages 15 to 19, having - becoming pregnant here in Georgia. CHIDEYA: How did you go about trying to change that, bring the rate down? Ms. OZUMBA: Well, the state, like other states at the same time, as Stephanie was saying earlier, in 1996, when welfare reform happened, there was, for the first time, a provision that linked public dependency, long-term public dependency to teen pregnancy. And it was researched at the time that said 50 percent of women on public assistance had, at one time, been teenage mothers. So there was an opportunity for states to have funding that allowed us to mobilize and do programs that could reach large enough populations to begin to affect the race and to begin to have a statistic trend going in the right direction for the first time in a very long time. CHIDEYA: So let's tick through a few of the different things that people have suggested will help decrease pregnancy. Tell me what you think of them empowering young women, teaching them to just say no. Ms. OZUMBA: Well, I think just saying no sounds very good but, really, it's a very complex issue. So I think empowerment certainly is one of the things that we seek to do but it's not about just saying no. It's really empowering young people to have a sense of a future that they are motivated to avoid anything that will distract them from achieving their goals. And we believe that a goal for a successful - getting to successful adulthood is having an aspiration - that that's going to keep you focused. CHIDEYA: What about in light of what you were just saying, anti-poverty? Will lowering the poverty rate overall help give people a different perspective on their life opportunity. Ms. OZUMBA: Certainly, poverty is - poverty reduction is a goal and there is such a link between poverty and teenage pregnancy. Sixty percent of teenage girls who give birth are, in fact, living in poverty. And there's a recent data from the national campaign that really further suggests how interlinked poverty is to young people becoming pregnant and becoming parents too soon. So anything we can do to address poverty is really going have a positive consequence on our issue of pregnancy prevention. CHIDEYA: Quick hit. What about contraception? Important? Ms. OZUMBA: Very important. A large reason for the decline has been increased defective use of contraceptives by young girls as well as young men. So that's definitely a contributing factor to the positive trend we're seeing. CHIDEYA: All right. Thank you, Michelle. And Michelle Ozumba is CEO and president of the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention. She spoke with us from Georgia Public Radio in Atlanta.  FARAI CHIDEYA, host:  And turning to Georgia 12 years ago, that state had the highest rate of teen pregnancy in the country. African Americans accounted for a lot of it.

So there was an opportunity for states to have funding that allowed us to mobilize and do programs that could reach large enough populations to begin to affect the race and to begin to have a statistic trend going in the right direction for the first time in a very long time.  CHIDEYA: So let's tick through a few of the different things that people have suggested will help decrease pregnancy. Tell me what you think of them empowering young women, teaching them to just say no.  Ms. OZUMBA: Well, I think just saying no sounds very good but, really, it's a very complex issue. So I think empowerment certainly is one of the things that we seek to do but it's not about just saying no. It's really empowering young people to have a sense of a future that they are motivated to avoid anything that will distract them from achieving their goals.  And we believe that a goal for a successful - getting to successful adulthood is having an aspiration - that that's going to keep you focused.  CHIDEYA: What about in light of what you were just saying, anti-poverty? Will lowering the poverty rate overall help give people a different perspective on their life opportunity.  Ms. OZUMBA: Certainly, poverty is - poverty reduction is a goal and there is such a link between poverty and teenage pregnancy. Sixty percent of teenage girls who give birth are, in fact, living in poverty. And there's a recent data from the national campaign that really further suggests how interlinked poverty is to young people becoming pregnant and becoming parents too soon. So anything we can do to address poverty is really going have a positive consequence on our issue of pregnancy prevention.  CHIDEYA: Quick hit. What about contraception? Important?  Ms. OZUMBA: Very important. A large reason for the decline has been increased defective use of contraceptives by young girls as well as young men. So that's definitely a contributing factor to the positive trend we're seeing.  CHIDEYA: All right. Thank you, Michelle. And Michelle Ozumba is CEO and president of the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention. She spoke with us from Georgia Public Radio in Atlanta.

The National Center for Health Statistics reports that the pregnancy rate among black teens has dropped to its lowest rate ever. For more, we have Stephanie Ventura. She's chief of the Natality Division at the National Center for Health Statistics. Welcome. Ms. STEPHANIE VENTURA (Natality Division Chief, National Center for Health Statistics): Thank you very much for having me. CHIDEYA: So when we say that the teen pregnancy rate has dropped, do we mean pregnancy or talking about a drop in babies born to teens? Ms. VENTURA: Well, we can actually be talking about both on this case. Pregnancy rates would include both medical(ph) births, abortions and miscarriages. And for those rates - the rates for blacks have dropped to their lowest levels ever. And just looking at teen birth rates, just - you know, live birth outcome, those rates have also dropped very, very steeply in the last 10 or 15 years. CHIDEYA: So give us a comparison between the last decade and this one. Ms. VENTURA: Okay. Well, looking at the birth rates because those are the most current that we have like, we have data through 2005, the birth rate has dropped to both 48 percent for African-American teenagers, and that's the steepest decline of any group. It's down to about 61 births per thousand. That could translate to about six births - six percent of all black teenagers having a baby in 2005. CHIDEYA: So do we have any idea why this drop has happened? Ms. VENTURA: Well, the rates had - actually for all groups, black, white, Hispanic and so forth, those rates have actually been increasing pretty steeply in the late 1980s. It's hard to remember, that seems so long ago. But about the early 1990s, people got very energized about that. There were - there was a lot of concern about the direction of the rates were heading. And so a lot of programs were in, you know, installed kind of public, private governmental, all kinds of programs not on - no federal mandate here. Just programs around the country that were targeted to address, you know, the issues that were affecting teen birth rates. And, not just sexual activity or contraception, but more like a positive youth development model with trying to address improvements in educational attainment and inspire teenagers to complete their education, get good jobs, and then think about having families, so that all started in the early 1990s, and it has had a tremendous impact on all groups but especially on black teenagers. CHIDEYA: Finally, just one bit of not so great news. Can you tell us about the low birth weight of black infants? Ms. VENTURA: Yes, that's a low birth weight in the pre-term birth. Those are two different measures. One is, you know, how the gestational - how long the pregnancy lasted and the other is actually the birth weight when the child is born. Those measures are both - have not been good for black infants of, you know, regardless of the age of the mother. And in fact, those measures have been increasing for all groups, which is very troubling in the last few years. But in general, the rates for blacks tend to be, you know, close to twice the rates for whites, which is, you know, way too high. And it's certainly a very serious matter because pre-term birth and low birth weight are very - are both very important risk factors for, you know, poor infant development and, you know, lifelong health issues.

I'm Ira Flatow. August is National Inventors Month. So this hour, we're honoring inventions and inventors of all kinds. If you're an inventor or you want to be one, this hour could be life changing. Our guests include two inventors who are experts at helping you get your idea from your shop, or your basement or your PC to store shelves and, possibly, Internet sales. One of the first roadblocks faced by new inventors is how to get their gizmo or their idea patented. With so many new patent applications being filed each month, the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office is flooded and overworked. There are not enough people to analyze and review those highly technical patents. So what to do? Why not do what scientists do? When they want to judge the merits of a research paper or experiment, they seek outside advice from other scientists - experts in their fields. Peer review is what it's called. Well, the patent office has decided to give it a try, allowing the public to -allowing the public to review patent applications. That means, anyone who's interested, who is interested, you can apply. Thanks to a new approach to applying for patents called Peer-to-Patent. And this hour, an intellectual property lawyer from IBM who helped come up with the plan is here to tell us about that and how you might get involved in reviewing patents. But first up, to get us thinking creatively, Amy Smith joins us. She's a mechanical engineer, who goes low-tech, about as low-tech as she can to come up with cheap simple machines that people from developing nations can use to improve their lives. When Ms. Smith was only a graduate student, she came up with a simple plastic box that keeps microscope slides and test tubes heated without electricity, incubator sans power cord. So people in remote places can find out if they're sick. And now, Ms. Smith is on her way to Haiti where she and her students are testing out a press that makes briquettes for cooking from sugarcane waste. She hopes to come up with something cleaner and safer than wood charcoal. Ms. Smith is a MacArthur Genius award-winner. She's instructor at MIT's Edgerton Center where she co-founded the International Development Initiative - a program where MIT students work with local people on what's called appropriate technology. She has also came up with the idea's competition, which encourages teams to come up with projects that make a difference. And she joins us today from the studios at MIT. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Ms. Smith. Professor AMY SMITH (Mechanical Engineer; Instructor, The Edgerton Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology):  Thank you very much. FLATOW: Tell us about your project in Haiti. Prof. SMITH: Well, it's a project we'd been working on for a while. It started about four years ago when we recognized how deforested Haiti is and the fact that people still rely on wood and wood charcoal as cooking fuel. So we wanted to create an alternative fuel and we looked around to see what source of materials might be available, and sugarcane waste and other agricultural waste are - they're in abundant supply, and so we have been looking at waste to turn them into charcoal that people can use as cooking fuel. And I've got a student over there now and I'll be heading down, I think, probably once the hurricane passes by to start setting up a project that we'll be doing on a grassroots level in the southwest part of Haiti to establish this charcoal-making technique throughout the country, we hoped. FLATOW: And would - this will help the health of the folks there? Prof. SMITH: Yeah, it's actually a great project because it helps in three ways. One, it helps the health because people won't be breathing the smoky fires that are - when you burn either wood or other kinds of agricultural waste. It also helps the environment because it doesn't lead to cutting down trees. And then it also helps with people's economic situation. A lot of people there spend almost a quarter of their income on cooking fuel if they use charcoal. And this allows them to make their own charcoal from their agricultural waste materials, so they can be saving quite a bit of money over the course of a year and maybe even start up a business to sell to other people. So with those three things in our favor, we're hoping to have good luck with the project. FLATOW: Yeah, we wish you luck. You teach actually kids how to be inventors in MIT in an invention lab, do you not? Prof. SMITH: Yeah, I teach a class called D-Lab, which stands for development, design and dissemination. And one of the classes I teach is all about designing products for the developing world. And so we focus on a variety of problems and students come up with really creative solutions to them. FLATOW: And are they motivated to go to places like Haiti? Prof. SMITH: Yes, very much so. We probably send about 50 students a year just through my class and through other programs at MIT. It's a couple of hundred students who are interested in doing this type of work and really getting the experience of working with their community partners, you know, face-to-face to move these projects forward. FLATOW: And you're very creative. You've come up with some really, you know, unusual designs. I know in Honduras, you built a water purification system using a toilet valve and an IV drip. Wow. Prof. SMITH: Yeah. We were sort of in a situation where they had this water tank and a chlorination system, but the chlorination system wasn't working well. And so with both limited materials and limited Spanish, we looked around and try to find things that we could do to fix the situation. And, yes, I went to the local hardware store and the local pharmacy and managed to communicate well enough to get a plastic gas tank, a IV drip and a toilet valve and we were able to build a chlorination system that worked fine. And, in fact, by now it's in about, I don't know, 20 or 30 villages surrounding the neighborhood where we first put it in. So it's done well and the local plumber there has become quite the technician of his region as people come to him to learn how to make these things to put into their own water systems. FLATOW: Now, I think that that must be some innate ingenuity, Yankee ingenuity, that you have. It's something that really you can teach, is it? You know\u2026 Prof. SMITH: Yeah, it's interesting. I think you can teach people to look at problems and available materials and to try to figure out solutions to them. I think that one of the things we try to do is we try to encourage people to go back to the very basic principles of what needs to be done rather than looking at existing technologies and how to adapt them. And I think that type of mindset gives you a better chance of getting a simple solution that's effective and doesn't have, doesn't do a whole lot more than what it needs to do. But it does what it needs to do. And that's what I think is really important in this field. FLATOW: Well, I know you have to catch a plane to Haiti. I want to thank you for taking time to be with us, and good luck to you. Prof. SMITH: Oh, thanks. It was a pleasure. FLATOW: Well, Amy Smith, mechanical engineer, instructor and a designer of technology for developing countries at Edgerton Center at MIT in Cambridge. (Speaking of music) FLATOW: Speaking of invention, did you know that if you apply today to the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office, you won't hear back about your patent for as long as four years. The patent office is so short of people who can review your idea that it takes much too long to get any idea patented, no matter how good it is or how much we need it. Enter our next guest, David Kappos, intellectual property lawyer for IBM. Working with a team of lawyers and law students, he is co-author of a new proposal called Peer-to-Patent. So now, anyone can apply online to review patent applications for the patent office, no special credentials required. And as Mr. Kappos will tell us, thousands of people already have. David Kappos is vice president and assistant general counsel for intellectual property at IBM. He joins us today from his office in Armonk. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Mr. DAVID KAPPOS (Vice President; Assistant General Counsel, Intellectual Property Law, IBM Corporation): Well, thanks for having me on the show, Ira. FLATOW: Well, you've (unintelligible), you've reinvented a wheel, so to speak. Mr. KAPPOS: Well, that's right. You know, the patent system in the U. S. is just fundamentally important to our national excellence, to our place in the global stream of commerce. And it really deserves to have a way to evaluate all of those submissions that you mentioned - the hundreds of thousands that come into the U. S. Patent Office each year. And a way to do that that leverages the 21st century Internet infrastructure that's available, and the Peer-to-Patent review system that we put together in cooperation with New York Law School is just exactly that. It's simply the patent office meets the 21st century. FLATOW: How can people apply to become patent reviewers? Mr. KAPPOS: Well, it's actually very, very simple. You can go on to the Peer-to-Patent Web site, which is available on the World Wide Web. And there is a nice, very simple description. And I'm happy to describe briefly how the process works. You actually don't have to register if you don't want to. And you don't have to provide your name if you don't want to, although it's great if people do because it enables them to be part of the community. Then you can view applications, patent applications that have been submitted into the process by a number of companies, including IBM and others. And you can place comments in the system on them. You can submit documents that you think may be relevant to them. You can comment on anything you might know about the invention. And you can also evaluate and essentially comment on the comments that other people have made about applications in the system. Then what happens is after a period of time, a neutral party takes a look at all the comments that have been made, the documents that have been submitted and essentially puts together the top comments, the top documents and forwards those to the U. S. Patent Office, so that the U. S. Patent Office Examining Corps can use that material to do a better, faster job of examining and issuing patents. FLATOW: So, you know, you can see a patent - I can - well, one of the problems the patent office had, is it didn't have enough experts. You know, they were allowing some silly patents to go through. Mr. KAPPOS: Yeah, that's exactly right. The patent office has got a wonderful corps of folks. But as you mentioned, they are just outgunned. They're overwhelmed with the hundreds of thousands of applications coming in, and they just do not have enough resource. Peer-to-Patent is just absolutely spot-on intended to help the patent office by leveraging the millions and millions of expert people around the world who can very easily comment on pending patent applications, saving patent office examiners tremendous amount of time and getting better leverage out of their efforts. FLATOW: What about people who are afraid that their ideas will be stolen now that they're on the Web and people are looking at them? Mr. KAPPOS: Right. Well, that's an important concern and certainly nobody wants that to happen, whether you're a big company or a small company or an individual, we all very carefully want to preserve not having our information taken from us. So the way the system works is it evaluates only those applications that are already published by the U. S. Patent Office, so the applications that are already out there in the public domain, so there's no issue once you get into this system, Peer-to-Patent. There's no issue of your application somehow being compromised because it's already public. There are some other safeguards in the system, including, most principally, that the only applications that go into the system are ones where their author, the inventor, agrees to put the application in the system. FLATOW: Right. Hang on, David, because I got to take a break. We're going to come back and take a short break. Stay with us. We'll talk more about, I think, talk with David and other patent experts for a few more minutes with David. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this break. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking about patents and patenting this hour with my guest David Kappos, vice president and assistant general counsel for Intellectual Property Law at IBM in Armonk, who has created a new way to help out the patent office called the Peer-to-Patent which means that you can - David is this correct, even smalltime not the IBM's and the Microsoft's people, or just plain citizens, folks, can review patent applications? Mr. KAPPOS: Yeah, that's exactly right, Ira. And we would just love to see people from all over the world get on the system. To date, over 115,000 people from, I believe, over 100 countries so far have come and visited the system. There have been something like 18,000-plus unique people who've come in and registered on the site. And we've got thousands of comments coming in. So, literally, people from all over, large and small companies, individuals are both encouraged to visit the site and to get involved and are actually doing that now. FLATOW: And you don't have - do you have to qualify with any kind of knowledge or all of your comments will be considered? Mr. KAPPOS: There's no qualification requirement. All comments get considered. The system works a little bit like a wiki kind of an idea, where comments that are really good ones get rated highly by other people, who are also looking at the comments. And comments that aren't so good get rated more lowly. And so, over time, people who are supplying value will have their comments considered more seriously, and those who are supplying less value likewise. FLATOW: A patent wiki, very interesting idea. Yeah. And this is going to be running for how long? Or is it going to be running forever? Or are we in a test period, I guess I'm intending to say? Mr. KAPPOS: Right. Well, we're currently in a pilot stage and it is clearly a test period. The U. S. Patent Office is helping out and New York Law School, a number of companies are helping out. And then, as I mentioned, everyone is invited to get on the site and join. The test period will be running for a period of over a year and the reason for that is it takes quite a bit of time to get applications in, get them commented on and find out what's working and what needs to be improved. After that period of time, we'll be trying to move from a pilot phase into a production phase where the USPTO hopefully will be able to roll the system out across very large numbers of applications. FLATOW: Well, David Kappos, I wish you and your Peer-to-Patent folks good luck. Mr. KAPPOS: Well, thank you very much, Ira. FLATOW: Thank you. Have a good weekend. Mr. KAPPOS: Yeah. Bye. FLATOW: David Kappos is vice president and assistant general counsel for Intellectual Property Law at IBM. He was talking with us from IBM headquarters in Armonk. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: Staying with our patent thing and theme, it's a patent thing. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Let's say you're, say you're inventing something, or have invented something, you've got a great idea, you don't know what to do with it. Now where do you go with it from here? well, sit tight because we now have two experts with us today who are here to tell you what your next step should be. My first guest expert is Cy Tymony, an inventor who writes books about what he makes from cheap, ordinary stuff he finds around the house. Did you ever think you could turn an ordinary penny into a radio? He tells you how to do that. or control the electricity in your home by using a plastic ring, no special equipment required. Cy Tymony is the man who has done it, a lot of these things along with many other inventions he makes from normal household items and tools. He has stopped by SCIENCE FRIDAY before to tell us how to make invisible ink. Maybe you remember that episode or many other things that you can find in his book, \"Sneaky Uses for Everyday Things\" and \"Sneakier Uses for Everyday Things. \" His new book will be out on October. Full disclosure, I wrote the introduction to it and the title is, you guessed it, \"Sneakiest Uses for Everyday Things. \" He joins us today from the studios of NPR in Culver City, California. Hi, Cy. Mr. CY TYMONY (Inventor; Author, \"Sneaky Uses for Everyday Things\"): Hi, Ira. Thanks for having me back. FLATOW: Welcome back. Our second guest expert is also an inventor who has reinvented himself as an inventor educator. Seven years ago, Andrew Krauss founded the Inventors Alliance, a nonprofit group that helps inventors and would-be inventors sell their ideas. Mr. Krauss has teamed up with a very successful inventor, Stephen Key, to found inventRight, a nonprofit - a for-profit company that advises investors and inventors. And he joins us today from his office from Mountain View, California. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Mr. ANDREW KRAUSS (Inventor Educator; President, Inventors Alliance; Co-founder and partner, inventRight): Hi, Ira. Thanks for having me on. FLATOW: Thank you. Cy, what would be the best way for people to celebrate Inventors Month? Mr. TYMONY: Well, there are so many things that inventors can do now, because instead of having to reinvent the wheel and create a whole all new invention, there are so many products that come out virtually every month that they can just adapt and decorate and make a small fortune. For instance, the new Wii game machine with the little handheld controller that people\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Mr. TYMONY: \u2026are using for so many ways and people are adapting iPods and flash drives and Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices. And now, with programmable IC chips, they can do things electronically that only big businesses could do. So on the Web now, now that you can check patents and trademarks right from home, you can - if you want to develop your own idea, you can not only build it mechanically, but if it's too complex, you can use free or low-cost animation software to get your message across and also contact businesses and people for licensing to create an alliance all for little or no money. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. I'll say that again if you need patenting or invention advice and guidance 1-800-989-8255. We're here to help you out. Andrew Krauss at the Inventors Alliance, you get calls every day from inventors who need advice right? Mr. KRAUSS: I do, I do. I hope we're going to be able to take some calls today. FLATOW: What are their biggest problems? What do they need most? Mr. KRAUSS: I think their biggest problem is they make assumptions about the process, so it's very important for inventors to invent products, but not invent the process of selling their ideas. So I think the best thing you can invent or can do is to model their sales techniques after successful inventors and not make that part up, because otherwise it can be very costly. FLATOW: So you have an idea and where is the next step? Mr. KRAUSS: Well, I'll give you an example. Most inventors think the next step is to run down to a patent attorney (unintelligible) out a bunch of cash and say here, get me a patent. But that's not the right way to go about things. And I can - I'm qualified to say that because I've been running Inventors Alliance for seven years now. The first step is not patenting the idea, but doing your market research. So, sometimes, to give you an example, one of the things that we teach in inventRight is if you have a hammer that hits a nail straight every time, the best thing you can do is go down to your local hardware store or chain where you want to ultimately see your idea and look at the world of hammers. Look at all the hammers. Look at the packages. Look at what the material they're made out of. Most importantly, look at all the different benefits, maybe one is heavy, maybe one is light, maybe one has a really sticky grip that you like and look at all the benefits. And then figure out where your product is going to be on the shelf and how it compares to all these other products. FLATOW: So is marketing more important than the idea? Mr. KRAUSS: Absolutely. I mean, I would say the idea - and this isn't what inventors like to hear but I tell inventors what they don't like to hear all the time - the idea is maybe five to 10 percent of it. Patenting is maybe five to 10 percent of it. The rest of it, 80 percent of it, is knowing how to sell it. Good ideas are a dime a dozen. FLATOW: Cy, do you agree? Mr. TYMONY: Yes. And one thing I learned recently, too, is that - and Andrew can follow up on that - is that some famous inventions don't even have patents. They have trademarks for various reasons. For instance, the hula-hoop is such a simple device in the sense that it's just a circular hoop. And they've been using it in different countries for many years. But the title hula-hoop can be trademarked. And in some cases - like probably the world's most recognizable invention per se or product - Coca-Cola, does not have a patent because when they would do that, they'd have to reveal their secret ingredients but it does have a trademark. So there's many ways for people to get in contact with like Inventors Alliances to find out what's the best way to go. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We've got an inventor on the line. That's Guy(ph) from Phoenix. GUY (Caller): Hi. How are you doing, Ira? Nice to finally get to talk to you. FLATOW: Thank you. Go ahead. GUY: I have an invention in my head, okay? I am an online video gamer. All right. I have friends all over the world. I want to take a video game and turn it into real life. Okay? The first person tactical shooter. I know the people I need to talk to to be able to get the authorization to do it. My problem is the weapons themselves. I want to take authentic looking weapons with actual recoil, but they shoot lasers out at the end. Now I don't know how to find out about this stuff. And, I mean - you were saying something at the beginning of the show about, you know, finding companies that could, that could help you with this and the animation aspects of it and stuff like that, I'm just like lost as to where to go with an idea that's been stuck in my head for four years and driving me up, it drives me up the wall. FLATOW: Andrew Krauss, any advice? Mr. KRAUSS: Yeah, I mean, you can team with other people that know the parts of the technology that you don't. But you know what a lot of inventors don't realize is there's basically two paths you can go down. You can venture, which is just a fancy way of saying starting your own company. You can license, which is basically renting your intellectual property, or patent copy or either trademark to a company providing that they meet certain criteria. They sell so much, quarter one, quarter two, quarter three, you know, every year. Then, they get to continue to rent your idea and you get a royalty for every unit that you sell. It sounds like this would be a great match for licensing not venturing because you probably don't want to start your own video game company rights. Right, Guy? GUY: No, no. I'm not into making a video game. I want to take a game that already exists. Mr. KRAUSS: Right. GUY: And it's a very, very popular video game and they've made multiple, you know, number two, number three, number four, and so on and so forth. And I want to take that, but I want to - I want to take one of the maps that's on the game and put it into a real-life situation. A real building with identical - people walk into the room that is this map and just be completely amazed, you know, it's like I've seen this. I know this map. This is on that game, you know? I play it every day or on the weekends or whatever, you know, and to actually see it, I mean, it's - for me, it's a thrill to even think about doing this. And hearing, you know, people, you know, when I talk to them and tell them my idea, you know, to try and get some information from them, they're just like, dude, if you could do this\u2026 FLATOW: Are you, you're talking about creating a theme park of, you know, built\u2026 GUY: It would be a family-based theme, you know, family-based entertainment but they're hitting\u2026 FLATOW: But they're shooting up a lot of people there. GUY: \u2026so much on the invention part that has to be done\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. GUY: \u2026that it's - that's where I am lost. The weapons, you know. The military has this stuff called Miles Gear, okay? And, basically, they put a box on the end of their M-16 that shoots out a laser signal and they use live blanks in their weapons. Mr. KRAUSS: Guy, Guy, here's my advice. This is Andrew. You need to first figure out who you're going to license this to and how that deal is going to work. Before inventors spend way too much time in patents and prototypes, before they figure out who they're going to cut the deal with. So the first thing you need to do is go down to the marketplace, which you understand the market fairly well. But you haven't pinpointed who you're going to license this to, who you're going to rent this idea to. You need to understand that first before you spend one cent or one, you know, bit of time figuring out how you're going to implement the technology. The - and, really, one of the things that we teach at inventRight and successful inventor, Stephen Key, has been teaching us for a long time. It took him a while to figure this out and it's common sense. You don't need a patent or a prototype to sell your idea. With a provisional patent for 100 bucks, you can write in common English, it allows you to fish off at the end of the pier for one year, it allows you to save patent pending. Okay, right there it's $100, right? You got your protection. Next part of it, a sell sheet because you're not selling your prototype and you're not selling your patent. You're selling the benefits of your idea. So you protect yourself with the provisional for 100, you do a sell sheet, which is a one-page sheet with the big benefits of your idea, maybe a picture of your product. You can fake in the picture. You can cannibalize other products, you can have a rendering done by a college arts student, something like that. You can do this very affordably. Let's say that's another $80 if you get a college student. And then, you need to figure out what companies are potential licensees for your product. Who - what companies are you going to call. That's very easy to do. So if you can give me kind of a better idea of what this product is, I could explain to you what companies you need to call. But you can sell your idea before you've made it, that's what I'm saying. And it's a big mistake inventors make to go out and spend three to $20,000 on a patent, and another 5,000 on a prototype before you've got any interest from somebody in that industry is suicide and I see inventors make that mistake every single day. FLATOW: Talking about patent advice this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY FROM NPR News. Talking with Andy Krauss, an inventor educator and co-founder of inventRight. com. Cy Tymony, inventor and author, has written three books about invention. His latest coming out is \"Sneakiest Uses for Everyday Things. \" Our number 1-800-989-8255. Cy, do you have to worry about any of this stuff with just making a little gadgets from common household items? Mr. TYMONY: Well, that's the beauty of - sometimes, if you're an inventor and in some cases, you may want to make a physical model, you may want to license it with another company or get a patent and go from there. But in other cases, inventors, if they broaden their minds and open up their thinking about what inventions are, there's many other avenues. You can write, like I do and get a copyright to protect your interests, you can produce items and sell them at craft fairs and like MAKE magazine's Makers Faire, you can create computer software - that's inventions, you know, that those are inventions, too. So - and you can sometimes show your inventions and by creating a DVD and in other words the creativity doesn't have to be in the normal model of a mechanical device. And in some cases, some people are more fit to write, a photograph, make a video, a movie, and that way - and there's protection schemes for all of those. So that way, you still protect it, but you could go with what feels good for you. In my case, I like adapting things just like Amy Smith does. And in her case, she doesn't even get a license but great, you know, it is great that she gets great awards. I mean, she's won over half a million dollars in awards and she's very altruistic and she's saving lives, too. So there are so many avenues for inventors to take advantage of their creativity and to make alliances. And like Andrew said to find out which your market is - do you want to go all the way with this? How much money do you want to spend? Or, like in my case, I like writing about it, getting ideas, adapting and putting them on paper and sometimes video. And, you know, distributing them that way. FLATOW: And, of course, that was a great idea. You mentioned about videos. Now, you can do animation and computer graphics to illustrate exactly what you want to do without ever having to build it. Mr. TYMONY: Right. And that animation software, which used to be, you know, tens of thousands of dollars - there's so many versions of it - now almost shareware versions practically, where in the past an inventor couldn't get his message across. And now, if he or she can't do it themselves, there's so many people that can show them how where that way, they can work out some of the kinks before they spend money and machine tooling and, you know, tool and dye and things like that. And then, I'll work those things out and come up even with better ideas. FLATOW: I'm talking with Cy Tymony and Andrew Krauss at this hour, we're going to have to take a short break. To talk with lots more folks about the inventions, I see you on the phones, you're on the line, you're looking for some advice, we'll get to you. Try not to get too detailed about because we can't really give you all that detailed advice like almost like when you ask people for medical advice, the invention, the inventor advice gets even more detailed sometimes. So stay with us. We'll give you as much advice as we can after this break. Don't go away. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking about inventions and inventors. If you're an inspiring or aspiring or, as Thomas Edison might say, a perspiring inventor. This is the hour for you. It's your chance to hear from two experts on how to take your ideas from your kitchen table or from your computer to the market perhaps. Cy Tymony, inventor and author. He's written three books about invention. The latest coming out is \"Sneakiest Uses for Everyday Things. \" Andrew Krauss, co-founder of inventRight. com and president of InventorsAlliance. org. Our number 1-800-989-8255. Andrew, you know, we were talking about making this computer models and things now using graphics. You know, wouldn't YouTube be a perfect place to show off something now if you, well, you want to get somebody interested to see what you do? Mr. KRAUSS: I'm not sure what you mean? FLATOW: Well, you can put your video up on YouTube, you know, and people come to look at it. Mr. KRAUSS: Oh, absolutely. Well, you know, I'm not an attorney so I can't offer legal advice. But in the United States, it's still a first to invent country. So once you disclose your invention, you have to patent it within a year. I will say it depends on your approach. If you're looking to sell it yourself, fantastic, go for it. If you're planning to license it to a company and have them sell it, I wouldn't recommend putting a video up on YouTube. I'd recommend a password protected Web site that you could show a select few manufacturers because there are some legal issues there. FLATOW: Good point. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Elizabeth(ph) in Tallahassee. Hi, Elizabeth. ELIZABETH (Caller): Hi. How are you doing? FLATOW: How are you? ELIZABETH: I love your show. CONAN: Thank you. ELIZABETH: I just wanted to call to comment, actually, not so much a question. But I have been learning about some inventions that my grandfather need some -having to do with some military patents, actually. And just wanted to comment about the unsung inventors that exist. My grandfather had, he was our captain and he came up with the, I guess, first prototype, for the - gosh, I'm like, going blank here. FLATOW: You're nervous. (Soundbite of laughter) ELIZABETH: Yeah, I'm a little nervous. But he came up with the prototype for the aircraft carrier runway\u2026 FLATOW: No kidding. ELIZABETH: \u2026or landing strip. FLATOW: No kidding. ELIZABETH: And he also invented the exploding bolts\u2026 FLATOW: Oh, that they use\u2026 ELIZABETH: \u2026which allow the space shuttle to disengage, I believe? FLATOW: Yeah, they had - that's, they've been using those for decades not just for the space shuttle. Yeah. ELIZABETH: Yeah, yeah. So that was - it's just, you know, fascinating to me and I just, you know, think that these guys and men and women who contribute to the world of science, they don't always take credit for it or\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. ELIZABETH: \u2026you know, they deserve a little bit of - some (unintelligible). FLATOW: Well, we have the right guy on to talk about that because Andrew Krauss, you know, is an inventor and educator. And believe me, you know, he must know about a lot of these people you never hear of. And they're all over the place. ELIZABETH: Yeah, yeah, and I think, you know, and, you know, as his granddaughter just now learning about all of this things that he was able to contribute and thinking, gosh, why didn't I inherit some of that genius, you know? (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Well\u2026 Mr. KRAUSS: And I think you could follow in his footsteps. It's not - you were talking about Thomas Edison earlier. How he would come up with ideas because I realize about 50 percent of the people I talk to when I tell them I ran an inventors' association, they say they came up with an idea at one point or another. But then, there's the other 50 percent and I'm sure some of your listeners would like to know how to come up with ideas. ELIZABETH: Yeah. Mr. KRAUSS: And so it's very important not to force it. Very few people can come up with ideas when they're stressed. What Thomas Edison used to do is sit in his lounge chair with a pool ball in his hand, and he would just relax. I mean, almost to the point of falling asleep and that is the best point. And so for some people it's the shower, it's the porch, it's in the parking lying under a tree. And he would, anyway, think of all these best ideas that way. And if the pool ball fell on the floor, and wake him up, and then he would pick it up back up and he'd do it all over again. So people\u2026 ELIZABETH: It's so like (unintelligible). Mr. KRAUSS: \u2026people can come with ideas and I think you could fall on the footsteps of your, with your grandfather? ELIZABETH: Yeah. Mr. KRAUSS: Yeah. ELIZABETH: My grandfather. His name is Bert O. Carlson(ph). FLATOW: Well, he's now immortalized, Elizabeth. Thanks to you. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Thanks a lot for calling. ELIZABETH: Wonderful. Thank you. FLATOW: Bye bye. 1-800-989-8255. Cy, how do you come up - I find that when I'm driving, speaking of a relaxing drive - I come up with all kinds of ideas. Where do yours come from? Mr. TYMONY: Well, I come up with ideas just by reading, experimenting, playing around with things. Just when I think I'm out of ideas for another book, I come across a new category. When she spoke about unsung heroes, there's a great book called \"Women Invent\" by Susan Casey. And I learned so much about women's inventions way back in the 1800s up to the present of so many things that they developed, enhanced and invented so she may want to check that out, you know? It ties into what she said about her grandfather. But like Andrew said, in some cases, people have a hard time coming up with inventions. And in other cases, you come up with them every five minutes and then, there's a thing of what do you do with it? And - but it's also important. An idea's one thing, I can think of many things to do. But then, when you start to implement it, then you find out it may not work. It may not work well. And yet through that process, you learn something else. So just use the Internet. You know, get around different types of people. Like Andrew said, go to different stores, touch hammers and go to toy stores, go to makers' fairs, craft fairs. And you won't have any problem coming up with adaptations and ideas. I mean, we're in the age of Bluetooth and USB accessories and flash drives and iPods and iPhone. There's so many - just look at a kiosk on a mall that sell cell phone accessories. You know, from the cases to the adaptors, and to accessories for iPods to give them speakers. I mean, coming up with ideas in this day and age to enhance already existing ideas is a cottage industry. FLATOW: Well, Gina(ph) in\u2026 Mr. KRAUSS: Yeah, that's a very important point. I mean, a lot of people think it needs to be completely new idea, but almost all inventions are just adaptations, like Cy said, of existing products. FLATOW: Gina in Kansas City has an idea. Right, Gina? GINA (Caller): Yeah, I do. Thanks. How are you? FLATOW: How are you? GINA: Good. Hey, my idea basically is - my son plays with little Nintendo DS games and the game chips are literally a little bit bigger than my thumbnail. And they cost, you know, 20 to 30 bucks and we lose them all the time. And so basically, I'm thinking about something that would be almost like a keychain. And you could retrofit something that would go on each game. You know, and then go to hook it on the keychain when you aren't playing. But my question is, do I need to make a prototype of it or - I don't even know where to start? Mr. KRAUSS: I've got some input on that. FLATOW: Go ahead. Mr. KRAUSS: Basically, some ideas, you can protect; some ideas, you can't. My gut instinct is telling me that you can't protect that idea. So either you start your own company and you manufacture this idea\u2026 GINA: Right. Mr. KRAUSS: \u2026or you come up with an incredibly clever keychain. If it's incredibly clever, there might be some protection you could get, and then you can license it and some other company can worry about manufacturing, marketing it, all that, and give you a percentage in each sale. So I hate to say that there's not a way to figure out how to make a really unique keychain that holds that chip like cooler and better than anything else. GINA: Right. Mr. KRAUSS: But I have a hard time imagining that. But if you can do that, then it's licensable. Otherwise, you need to start your own company and sell it yourself. GINA: Okay. That's a tough one. FLATOW: Good luck to you. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Join the crowd, Gina. GINA: Yeah. Thanks. It sounds like a great idea. I just couldn't quite figure out how to put it on paper. FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah. Well, good luck to you. Get some help of, well, you know, some drawing help maybe. GINA: Yeah. Thanks so much. FLATOW: Yeah, good luck. Have a good weekend. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's continue. Let's, you know, a lot of women on the phone today of inventors. I don't mean to be sexist about it, but either a lot of women with great ideas and we don't hear from them. I'm glad we are. Anne(ph) in Jacksonville. Hi, Anne. Anne, are you there? Oh, come on. Anne in Jacksonville, no? All right. Well, I guess we'll have to go to - let's go to San Antonio. Hi. Justices(ph), is it? Ms. JUSDIASAS REID(ph)(Caller): Yes. My name is Jusdaisas Reid from San Antonio. I'm a mother of three, and my husband is deployed and so I'm very busy. My hands are very full, and I just have an idea that I need to have at home. And so I don't know how to go about creating this object that I need, and I need to have it at home right now. So how do I start? What do I do? It's a very clever idea. It's a very\u2026 FLATOW: You don't want to give it away by telling us anything about it? Ms. REID: No. I don't tell anyone my idea. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. REID: All I know that it's a very good idea. Moms need this. I know they need it. I need one right now. How do I start? What do I do? FLATOW: Andrew, I'm sure you've heard this before? Mr. KRAUSS: Yeah. I mean, maybe Cy - it seems like he's really good at prototyping. Do you have any prototyping tips, Cy? Mr. TYMONY: Well, what I would highly suggest she and some of your listeners do, in yesterday's New York Times there's an article about dads coming up with inventions because more dads - inventions for childcare because more dads are helping out with childcare. And it gives about four, five examples of dads that have created or adapted things to make it easier for childcare. So if you get that article, it's online or you might, better go to a library, the Thursday New York Times. It was very, very informative about the problems that they had, what they wanted to do, how they created their little prototypes, and then how they brought it to market. So I would highly suggest that, and it's a nice, easy read. FLATOW: Good idea. Thanks for calling. Good luck to you. Ms. REID: Okay. All right. Thank you. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's go to Daniel(ph) in Des Moines. Hi, Daniel. DANIEL (Caller): Hello, there. FLATOW: Hi, there. DANIEL: I create a\u2026 FLATOW: Are you there, Daniel? Well, I guess we lost him. Cy, are you there? Mr. TYMONY: Yes, I'm here. FLATOW: What do people like Daniel has dropped off - it looks actually all of our callers - we must have a technical glitch. What - how do people find investors? You know, you have an idea, how do you find an investor for a product, if you're looking for one? Mr. TYMONY: Well, step one would be to first somehow protect it, get an interim trademark or interim patent first. And, you know, write up and create some kind of model for your idea on paper or with software. And then what you can do is you have to look at companies that already produce similar products. And by that research process, you'll come into a list of people. And also there's - there are inventor alliances like Andrew's group. There - legal advice that you can get to. So that will be no problem. The Internet is a great tool for all inventors as far as creating an alliance and trying to get a licenser. And I'm sure Andrew has some ideas on that, too. FLATOW: Yeah. We've lost all our phone clients for some reason. And Andrew was on the line, so we're going to have to talk with you, Cy\u2026 Mr. KRAUSS: I'm back. I'm back. FLATOW: Oh, he's back. Okay. Mr. TYMONY: There he is. FLATOW: There he is. We were talking, Andrew, about how do you find a good investor? You know, do you have an idea? Do - you know, will they find you? Mr. KRAUSS: It's really hard to find people that want to fund inventions, because a person with an idea isn't very fundable. You have to have a team that knows how to market it, manufacture it, do all that. Yeah, and quite often a lot of inventors or - are moms or engineers and they don't know anything about business. So is somebody going to hand you a million dollars? Probably not. You need to put a team together to do that. FLATOW: Let me see if I can get enough phone call in before we have to go. Back to the phones. Let's go to Barbara(ph) in California. Hi, Barbara. GARY(ph) (Caller): This is actually Gary, sorry about that. FLATOW: Okay. Go ahead, Gary. GARY: I'm wondering what Cy and Andrew had actually invented themselves. And in studying inventors, what they've learned about sort of pursuing their own ideas and creating realities out of baby ideas that would have gone somewhere, something - it wouldn't have created anything in the past? FLATOW: Let me get - let me first remind everybody that I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Cy, you've invented a lot of things. Mr. TYMONY: Yeah. I created a ring that basically has a magnet on the top that I used to turn on devices including starting up my car. Instead of having a cut off switch that I would lean over under the dash or under the seat to turn on, which is kind of cumbersome, I just aim my ring at a portion of the dash, dashboard, and behind there there's a magnetically sensitive switch. And I used to call that the magnapower ring(ph). And I put that idea in my books, \"Sneaky Uses for Everyday Things. \" And in fact, there's a little video of it when you're speaking of the YouTube videos, I put some videos at my sneakyuses. com Web site. And I even uploaded a video to the SCIENCE FRIDAY Web site about a radio-controlled jacket that you can\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. TYMONY: \u2026use the parts from a $5-toy and use it so that your jacket can control things, too. FLATOW: Yeah, and are you making more videos? You find that, you know, as you invent things, you're making videos out them? Mr. TYMONY: Yeah. I make videos because I do a lot of demonstrations at schools and libraries, and I have so many things that I show quickly that I wanted a way to - for people to come back home later and also spread the word. I created nine videos and I uploaded them to YouTube and there's a link at my site, too. And that way, people can see how to do these techniques, like how to test their money. You know, all you need a magnet and bring it near the - a currency, a dollar bill and you go see if it's counterfeit or not. So making little videos with inexpensive digital cameras is a very good tool to get your message across. FLATOW: Now, I've got Barbara on the line. Quickly, Barbara, we're running out of time. BARBARA (Caller): Real quick. I'm - I want to make a prototype. I'm not sure whether to do it in plastic or in metal. And I just don't really know. And when I do find someone - if I even knew how to get one - do they have to sign something or just - should I make them quiet or secretive or what? Mr. KRAUSS: Yes. It's called a work for hire agreement, Barbara. When somebody signs something saying that's your invention. BARBARA: Work for hire. Okay. Mr. KRAUSS: Yeah. You could try\u2026 BARBARA: And the agreement just says what essentially? Mr. KRAUSS: It basically says that, you know, you own the invention and any improvements that they make, you own. That's very important. BARBARA: Okay. All right. And how do I - do you think there's a good way to start with it? Do I just go to a local machine shop or something? Mr. KRAUSS: It - that's such a specific question. I mean, it all depend on your invention. I need to know more about your invention. BARBARA: Okay. FLATOW: Barbara, why not make a video of it or an animation? Then you could\u2026 BARBARA: That's so, that's so fancy. I don't think I can do that. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: All right. Good luck to you. BARBARA: Anyway, thanks so much. FLATOW: You're welcome. One last question for you, Andrew. We see all these ads on late-night TV shows or - if you've got an invention? Call us. Should we? Mr. KRAUSS: No. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. KRAUSS: And I won't go in the details, because I don't want to be sued. But there's a great Web site out there called inventored. org. And it talks about these companies, and I guess - I think he's a reporter. So I highly recommend it to anybody that's even thinking about getting involved with these companies, go to that Web site, that's what he does. What I do is I teach people to sell their ideas. FLATOW: All right. So you take - already made inventions? Mr. KRAUSS: No, well - well, what I do at inventRight - basically, my partner, he's licensed to over 20 products, and we just basically consolidate what did he do to sell his ideas? How do you do your market research? How do you get into companies? What do you say, you know? And then we basically put that into a course. FLATOW: I got you. Mr. KRAUSS: And we teach people how to sell their ideas. Through my inventors' association, we give people the opportunity to get all points of view from different inventors. We had Colin Rose speak back in November. He's the largest colored spread in the Wall Street Journal four days before he spoke. Yeah. Ergonomic pen that was kind of like a wishbone. That was ergonomic. And you know, they come and they speak and they say, hey, here's how I made my millions and here's how - here are some mistakes I made, here are some things I did right, and here's how you can do the same. And that's very, very important because ideas are a dime a dozen. People that know how to sell them are really hard to come by. And my mission in life is educating inventors as to how they can bring their products to market. Ideas are great, but if you don't know how to bring it to market, people are never going to know about them. FLATOW: Cy, you got 10 seconds. When is your last book coming out, your latest book? Mr. TYMONY: It will be out in late October. It's available online, in every bookstore called, \"Sneakiest Uses for Everyday Things. \" And I thank you for writing the foreword to it, Ira. FLATOW: You're welcome. It's been a pleasure to read and actually try some of the stuff you've got in your books. It reminds me of my teenage days. Cy Tymony is inventor, author in Torrance, California. He's written about - he's written three books about invention. The latest is the \"Sneakiest Use for Everyday Things. \" Andrew Krauss is an inventor educator, co-founder of inventRight. com and president of InventorsAlliance. org. Thanks again, gentlemen, for taking time to be with us. Mr. TYMONY: Thank you. Mr. KRAUSS: Thank you. FLATOW: Kimberly - you're welcome. (Soundbite of credits) FLATOW: Surf over to our Web site at sciencefriday. com. We're blogging and podcasting. If you want to see - you want Cy Tymony's videos. It's up there, plus, all kinds of other videos. If you got an invention video you want to send us, there's a great idea. Take a video of your invention. If you want to expose it to everybody, we'll put it up to our Web site for you. Have a great weekend. We'll see you next week. I'm Ira Flatow in New York.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  August is National Inventors Month. So this hour, we're honoring inventions and inventors of all kinds. If you're an inventor or you want to be one, this hour could be life changing. Our guests include two inventors who are experts at helping you get your idea from your shop, or your basement or your PC to store shelves and, possibly, Internet sales.  One of the first roadblocks faced by new inventors is how to get their gizmo or their idea patented. With so many new patent applications being filed each month, the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office is flooded and overworked. There are not enough people to analyze and review those highly technical patents. So what to do? Why not do what scientists do? When they want to judge the merits of a research paper or experiment, they seek outside advice from other scientists - experts in their fields. Peer review is what it's called.  Well, the patent office has decided to give it a try, allowing the public to -allowing the public to review patent applications. That means, anyone who's interested, who is interested, you can apply. Thanks to a new approach to applying for patents called Peer-to-Patent. And this hour, an intellectual property lawyer from IBM who helped come up with the plan is here to tell us about that and how you might get involved in reviewing patents.  But first up, to get us thinking creatively, Amy Smith joins us. She's a mechanical engineer, who goes low-tech, about as low-tech as she can to come up with cheap simple machines that people from developing nations can use to improve their lives. When Ms. Smith was only a graduate student, she came up with a simple plastic box that keeps microscope slides and test tubes heated without electricity, incubator sans power cord. So people in remote places can find out if they're sick.  And now, Ms. Smith is on her way to Haiti where she and her students are testing out a press that makes briquettes for cooking from sugarcane waste. She hopes to come up with something cleaner and safer than wood charcoal.  Ms. Smith is a MacArthur Genius award-winner. She's instructor at MIT's Edgerton Center where she co-founded the International Development Initiative - a program where MIT students work with local people on what's called appropriate technology. She has also came up with the idea's competition, which encourages teams to come up with projects that make a difference.  And she joins us today from the studios at MIT. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Ms. Smith.  Professor AMY SMITH (Mechanical Engineer; Instructor, The Edgerton Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology):  Thank you very much.  FLATOW: Tell us about your project in Haiti.  Prof. SMITH: Well, it's a project we'd been working on for a while. It started about four years ago when we recognized how deforested Haiti is and the fact that people still rely on wood and wood charcoal as cooking fuel. So we wanted to create an alternative fuel and we looked around to see what source of materials might be available, and sugarcane waste and other agricultural waste are - they're in abundant supply, and so we have been looking at waste to turn them into charcoal that people can use as cooking fuel. And I've got a student over there now and I'll be heading down, I think, probably once the hurricane passes by to start setting up a project that we'll be doing on a grassroots level in the southwest part of Haiti to establish this charcoal-making technique throughout the country, we hoped.  FLATOW: And would - this will help the health of the folks there?  Prof. SMITH: Yeah, it's actually a great project because it helps in three ways. One, it helps the health because people won't be breathing the smoky fires that are - when you burn either wood or other kinds of agricultural waste. It also helps the environment because it doesn't lead to cutting down trees. And then it also helps with people's economic situation. A lot of people there spend almost a quarter of their income on cooking fuel if they use charcoal. And this allows them to make their own charcoal from their agricultural waste materials, so they can be saving quite a bit of money over the course of a year and maybe even start up a business to sell to other people. So with those three things in our favor, we're hoping to have good luck with the project.  FLATOW: Yeah, we wish you luck. You teach actually kids how to be inventors in MIT in an invention lab, do you not?  Prof. SMITH: Yeah, I teach a class called D-Lab, which stands for development, design and dissemination. And one of the classes I teach is all about designing products for the developing world. And so we focus on a variety of problems and students come up with really creative solutions to them.  FLATOW: And are they motivated to go to places like Haiti?  Prof. SMITH: Yes, very much so. We probably send about 50 students a year just through my class and through other programs at MIT. It's a couple of hundred students who are interested in doing this type of work and really getting the experience of working with their community partners, you know, face-to-face to move these projects forward.  FLATOW: And you're very creative. You've come up with some really, you know, unusual designs. I know in Honduras, you built a water purification system using a toilet valve and an IV drip. Wow.  Prof. SMITH: Yeah. We were sort of in a situation where they had this water tank and a chlorination system, but the chlorination system wasn't working well. And so with both limited materials and limited Spanish, we looked around and try to find things that we could do to fix the situation.  And, yes, I went to the local hardware store and the local pharmacy and managed to communicate well enough to get a plastic gas tank, a IV drip and a toilet valve and we were able to build a chlorination system that worked fine. And, in fact, by now it's in about, I don't know, 20 or 30 villages surrounding the neighborhood where we first put it in. So it's done well and the local plumber there has become quite the technician of his region as people come to him to learn how to make these things to put into their own water systems.  FLATOW: Now, I think that that must be some innate ingenuity, Yankee ingenuity, that you have. It's something that really you can teach, is it? You know\u2026  Prof. SMITH: Yeah, it's interesting. I think you can teach people to look at problems and available materials and to try to figure out solutions to them. I think that one of the things we try to do is we try to encourage people to go back to the very basic principles of what needs to be done rather than looking at existing technologies and how to adapt them. And I think that type of mindset gives you a better chance of getting a simple solution that's effective and doesn't have, doesn't do a whole lot more than what it needs to do. But it does what it needs to do. And that's what I think is really important in this field.  FLATOW: Well, I know you have to catch a plane to Haiti. I want to thank you for taking time to be with us, and good luck to you.  Prof. SMITH: Oh, thanks. It was a pleasure.  FLATOW: Well, Amy Smith, mechanical engineer, instructor and a designer of technology for developing countries at Edgerton Center at MIT in Cambridge.  (Speaking of music)  FLATOW: Speaking of invention, did you know that if you apply today to the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office, you won't hear back about your patent for as long as four years. The patent office is so short of people who can review your idea that it takes much too long to get any idea patented, no matter how good it is or how much we need it.  Enter our next guest, David Kappos, intellectual property lawyer for IBM. Working with a team of lawyers and law students, he is co-author of a new proposal called Peer-to-Patent. So now, anyone can apply online to review patent applications for the patent office, no special credentials required.  And as Mr. Kappos will tell us, thousands of people already have. David Kappos is vice president and assistant general counsel for intellectual property at IBM. He joins us today from his office in Armonk. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Mr. DAVID KAPPOS (Vice President; Assistant General Counsel, Intellectual Property Law, IBM Corporation): Well, thanks for having me on the show, Ira.  FLATOW: Well, you've (unintelligible), you've reinvented a wheel, so to speak.  Mr. KAPPOS: Well, that's right. You know, the patent system in the U. S. is just fundamentally important to our national excellence, to our place in the global stream of commerce. And it really deserves to have a way to evaluate all of those submissions that you mentioned - the hundreds of thousands that come into the U. S. Patent Office each year. And a way to do that that leverages the 21st century Internet infrastructure that's available, and the Peer-to-Patent review system that we put together in cooperation with New York Law School is just exactly that. It's simply the patent office meets the 21st century.  FLATOW: How can people apply to become patent reviewers?  Mr. KAPPOS: Well, it's actually very, very simple. You can go on to the Peer-to-Patent Web site, which is available on the World Wide Web. And there is a nice, very simple description. And I'm happy to describe briefly how the process works. You actually don't have to register if you don't want to. And you don't have to provide your name if you don't want to, although it's great if people do because it enables them to be part of the community.  Then you can view applications, patent applications that have been submitted into the process by a number of companies, including IBM and others. And you can place comments in the system on them. You can submit documents that you think may be relevant to them. You can comment on anything you might know about the invention. And you can also evaluate and essentially comment on the comments that other people have made about applications in the system. Then what happens is after a period of time, a neutral party takes a look at all the comments that have been made, the documents that have been submitted and essentially puts together the top comments, the top documents and forwards those to the U. S. Patent Office, so that the U. S. Patent Office Examining Corps can use that material to do a better, faster job of examining and issuing patents.  FLATOW: So, you know, you can see a patent - I can - well, one of the problems the patent office had, is it didn't have enough experts. You know, they were allowing some silly patents to go through.  Mr. KAPPOS: Yeah, that's exactly right. The patent office has got a wonderful corps of folks. But as you mentioned, they are just outgunned. They're overwhelmed with the hundreds of thousands of applications coming in, and they just do not have enough resource. Peer-to-Patent is just absolutely spot-on intended to help the patent office by leveraging the millions and millions of expert people around the world who can very easily comment on pending patent applications, saving patent office examiners tremendous amount of time and getting better leverage out of their efforts.  FLATOW: What about people who are afraid that their ideas will be stolen now that they're on the Web and people are looking at them?  Mr. KAPPOS: Right. Well, that's an important concern and certainly nobody wants that to happen, whether you're a big company or a small company or an individual, we all very carefully want to preserve not having our information taken from us. So the way the system works is it evaluates only those applications that are already published by the U. S. Patent Office, so the applications that are already out there in the public domain, so there's no issue once you get into this system, Peer-to-Patent. There's no issue of your application somehow being compromised because it's already public. There are some other safeguards in the system, including, most principally, that the only applications that go into the system are ones where their author, the inventor, agrees to put the application in the system.  FLATOW: Right. Hang on, David, because I got to take a break. We're going to come back and take a short break. Stay with us. We'll talk more about, I think, talk with David and other patent experts for a few more minutes with David. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this break. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking about patents and patenting this hour with my guest David Kappos, vice president and assistant general counsel for Intellectual Property Law at IBM in Armonk, who has created a new way to help out the patent office called the Peer-to-Patent which means that you can - David is this correct, even smalltime not the IBM's and the Microsoft's people, or just plain citizens, folks, can review patent applications?  Mr. KAPPOS: Yeah, that's exactly right, Ira. And we would just love to see people from all over the world get on the system. To date, over 115,000 people from, I believe, over 100 countries so far have come and visited the system. There have been something like 18,000-plus unique people who've come in and registered on the site. And we've got thousands of comments coming in. So, literally, people from all over, large and small companies, individuals are both encouraged to visit the site and to get involved and are actually doing that now.  FLATOW: And you don't have - do you have to qualify with any kind of knowledge or all of your comments will be considered?  Mr. KAPPOS: There's no qualification requirement. All comments get considered. The system works a little bit like a wiki kind of an idea, where comments that are really good ones get rated highly by other people, who are also looking at the comments. And comments that aren't so good get rated more lowly. And so, over time, people who are supplying value will have their comments considered more seriously, and those who are supplying less value likewise.  FLATOW: A patent wiki, very interesting idea. Yeah. And this is going to be running for how long? Or is it going to be running forever? Or are we in a test period, I guess I'm intending to say?  Mr. KAPPOS: Right. Well, we're currently in a pilot stage and it is clearly a test period. The U. S. Patent Office is helping out and New York Law School, a number of companies are helping out. And then, as I mentioned, everyone is invited to get on the site and join. The test period will be running for a period of over a year and the reason for that is it takes quite a bit of time to get applications in, get them commented on and find out what's working and what needs to be improved. After that period of time, we'll be trying to move from a pilot phase into a production phase where the USPTO hopefully will be able to roll the system out across very large numbers of applications.  FLATOW: Well, David Kappos, I wish you and your Peer-to-Patent folks good luck.  Mr. KAPPOS: Well, thank you very much, Ira.  FLATOW: Thank you. Have a good weekend.  Mr. KAPPOS: Yeah. Bye.  FLATOW: David Kappos is vice president and assistant general counsel for Intellectual Property Law at IBM. He was talking with us from IBM headquarters in Armonk.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: Staying with our patent thing and theme, it's a patent thing.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Let's say you're, say you're inventing something, or have invented something, you've got a great idea, you don't know what to do with it. Now where do you go with it from here? well, sit tight because we now have two experts with us today who are here to tell you what your next step should be. My first guest expert is Cy Tymony, an inventor who writes books about what he makes from cheap, ordinary stuff he finds around the house. Did you ever think you could turn an ordinary penny into a radio? He tells you how to do that. or control the electricity in your home by using a plastic ring, no special equipment required.  Cy Tymony is the man who has done it, a lot of these things along with many other inventions he makes from normal household items and tools. He has stopped by SCIENCE FRIDAY before to tell us how to make invisible ink. Maybe you remember that episode or many other things that you can find in his book, \"Sneaky Uses for Everyday Things\" and \"Sneakier Uses for Everyday Things. \" His new book will be out on October. Full disclosure, I wrote the introduction to it and the title is, you guessed it, \"Sneakiest Uses for Everyday Things. \" He joins us today from the studios of NPR in Culver City, California. Hi, Cy.  Mr. CY TYMONY (Inventor; Author, \"Sneaky Uses for Everyday Things\"): Hi, Ira. Thanks for having me back.  FLATOW: Welcome back. Our second guest expert is also an inventor who has reinvented himself as an inventor educator. Seven years ago, Andrew Krauss founded the Inventors Alliance, a nonprofit group that helps inventors and would-be inventors sell their ideas. Mr. Krauss has teamed up with a very successful inventor, Stephen Key, to found inventRight, a nonprofit - a for-profit company that advises investors and inventors. And he joins us today from his office from Mountain View, California. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Mr. ANDREW KRAUSS (Inventor Educator; President, Inventors Alliance; Co-founder and partner, inventRight): Hi, Ira. Thanks for having me on.  FLATOW: Thank you. Cy, what would be the best way for people to celebrate Inventors Month?  Mr. TYMONY: Well, there are so many things that inventors can do now, because instead of having to reinvent the wheel and create a whole all new invention, there are so many products that come out virtually every month that they can just adapt and decorate and make a small fortune. For instance, the new Wii game machine with the little handheld controller that people\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. TYMONY: \u2026are using for so many ways and people are adapting iPods and flash drives and Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices. And now, with programmable IC chips, they can do things electronically that only big businesses could do. So on the Web now, now that you can check patents and trademarks right from home, you can - if you want to develop your own idea, you can not only build it mechanically, but if it's too complex, you can use free or low-cost animation software to get your message across and also contact businesses and people for licensing to create an alliance all for little or no money.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. I'll say that again if you need patenting or invention advice and guidance 1-800-989-8255. We're here to help you out. Andrew Krauss at the Inventors Alliance, you get calls every day from inventors who need advice right?  Mr. KRAUSS: I do, I do. I hope we're going to be able to take some calls today.  FLATOW: What are their biggest problems? What do they need most?  Mr. KRAUSS: I think their biggest problem is they make assumptions about the process, so it's very important for inventors to invent products, but not invent the process of selling their ideas. So I think the best thing you can invent or can do is to model their sales techniques after successful inventors and not make that part up, because otherwise it can be very costly.  FLATOW: So you have an idea and where is the next step?  Mr. KRAUSS: Well, I'll give you an example. Most inventors think the next step is to run down to a patent attorney (unintelligible) out a bunch of cash and say here, get me a patent. But that's not the right way to go about things. And I can - I'm qualified to say that because I've been running Inventors Alliance for seven years now. The first step is not patenting the idea, but doing your market research. So, sometimes, to give you an example, one of the things that we teach in inventRight is if you have a hammer that hits a nail straight every time, the best thing you can do is go down to your local hardware store or chain where you want to ultimately see your idea and look at the world of hammers. Look at all the hammers. Look at the packages. Look at what the material they're made out of. Most importantly, look at all the different benefits, maybe one is heavy, maybe one is light, maybe one has a really sticky grip that you like and look at all the benefits. And then figure out where your product is going to be on the shelf and how it compares to all these other products.  FLATOW: So is marketing more important than the idea?  Mr. KRAUSS: Absolutely. I mean, I would say the idea - and this isn't what inventors like to hear but I tell inventors what they don't like to hear all the time - the idea is maybe five to 10 percent of it. Patenting is maybe five to 10 percent of it. The rest of it, 80 percent of it, is knowing how to sell it. Good ideas are a dime a dozen.  FLATOW: Cy, do you agree?  Mr. TYMONY: Yes. And one thing I learned recently, too, is that - and Andrew can follow up on that - is that some famous inventions don't even have patents. They have trademarks for various reasons. For instance, the hula-hoop is such a simple device in the sense that it's just a circular hoop. And they've been using it in different countries for many years. But the title hula-hoop can be trademarked. And in some cases - like probably the world's most recognizable invention per se or product - Coca-Cola, does not have a patent because when they would do that, they'd have to reveal their secret ingredients but it does have a trademark. So there's many ways for people to get in contact with like Inventors Alliances to find out what's the best way to go.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We've got an inventor on the line. That's Guy(ph) from Phoenix.  GUY (Caller): Hi. How are you doing, Ira? Nice to finally get to talk to you.  FLATOW: Thank you. Go ahead.  GUY: I have an invention in my head, okay? I am an online video gamer. All right. I have friends all over the world. I want to take a video game and turn it into real life. Okay? The first person tactical shooter. I know the people I need to talk to to be able to get the authorization to do it. My problem is the weapons themselves. I want to take authentic looking weapons with actual recoil, but they shoot lasers out at the end. Now I don't know how to find out about this stuff. And, I mean - you were saying something at the beginning of the show about, you know, finding companies that could, that could help you with this and the animation aspects of it and stuff like that, I'm just like lost as to where to go with an idea that's been stuck in my head for four years and driving me up, it drives me up the wall.  FLATOW: Andrew Krauss, any advice?  Mr. KRAUSS: Yeah, I mean, you can team with other people that know the parts of the technology that you don't. But you know what a lot of inventors don't realize is there's basically two paths you can go down. You can venture, which is just a fancy way of saying starting your own company. You can license, which is basically renting your intellectual property, or patent copy or either trademark to a company providing that they meet certain criteria. They sell so much, quarter one, quarter two, quarter three, you know, every year. Then, they get to continue to rent your idea and you get a royalty for every unit that you sell. It sounds like this would be a great match for licensing not venturing because you probably don't want to start your own video game company rights. Right, Guy?  GUY: No, no. I'm not into making a video game. I want to take a game that already exists.  Mr. KRAUSS: Right.  GUY: And it's a very, very popular video game and they've made multiple, you know, number two, number three, number four, and so on and so forth. And I want to take that, but I want to - I want to take one of the maps that's on the game and put it into a real-life situation. A real building with identical - people walk into the room that is this map and just be completely amazed, you know, it's like I've seen this. I know this map. This is on that game, you know? I play it every day or on the weekends or whatever, you know, and to actually see it, I mean, it's - for me, it's a thrill to even think about doing this. And hearing, you know, people, you know, when I talk to them and tell them my idea, you know, to try and get some information from them, they're just like, dude, if you could do this\u2026  FLATOW: Are you, you're talking about creating a theme park of, you know, built\u2026  GUY: It would be a family-based theme, you know, family-based entertainment but they're hitting\u2026  FLATOW: But they're shooting up a lot of people there.  GUY: \u2026so much on the invention part that has to be done\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  GUY: \u2026that it's - that's where I am lost. The weapons, you know. The military has this stuff called Miles Gear, okay? And, basically, they put a box on the end of their M-16 that shoots out a laser signal and they use live blanks in their weapons.  Mr. KRAUSS: Guy, Guy, here's my advice. This is Andrew. You need to first figure out who you're going to license this to and how that deal is going to work. Before inventors spend way too much time in patents and prototypes, before they figure out who they're going to cut the deal with. So the first thing you need to do is go down to the marketplace, which you understand the market fairly well. But you haven't pinpointed who you're going to license this to, who you're going to rent this idea to. You need to understand that first before you spend one cent or one, you know, bit of time figuring out how you're going to implement the technology. The - and, really, one of the things that we teach at inventRight and successful inventor, Stephen Key, has been teaching us for a long time. It took him a while to figure this out and it's common sense.  You don't need a patent or a prototype to sell your idea. With a provisional patent for 100 bucks, you can write in common English, it allows you to fish off at the end of the pier for one year, it allows you to save patent pending. Okay, right there it's $100, right? You got your protection. Next part of it, a sell sheet because you're not selling your prototype and you're not selling your patent. You're selling the benefits of your idea.  So you protect yourself with the provisional for 100, you do a sell sheet, which is a one-page sheet with the big benefits of your idea, maybe a picture of your product. You can fake in the picture. You can cannibalize other products, you can have a rendering done by a college arts student, something like that. You can do this very affordably. Let's say that's another $80 if you get a college student.  And then, you need to figure out what companies are potential licensees for your product. Who - what companies are you going to call. That's very easy to do. So if you can give me kind of a better idea of what this product is, I could explain to you what companies you need to call. But you can sell your idea before you've made it, that's what I'm saying. And it's a big mistake inventors make to go out and spend three to $20,000 on a patent, and another 5,000 on a prototype before you've got any interest from somebody in that industry is suicide and I see inventors make that mistake every single day.  FLATOW: Talking about patent advice this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY FROM NPR News. Talking with Andy Krauss, an inventor educator and co-founder of inventRight. com. Cy Tymony, inventor and author, has written three books about invention. His latest coming out is \"Sneakiest Uses for Everyday Things. \"  Our number 1-800-989-8255. Cy, do you have to worry about any of this stuff with just making a little gadgets from common household items?  Mr. TYMONY: Well, that's the beauty of - sometimes, if you're an inventor and in some cases, you may want to make a physical model, you may want to license it with another company or get a patent and go from there. But in other cases, inventors, if they broaden their minds and open up their thinking about what inventions are, there's many other avenues.  You can write, like I do and get a copyright to protect your interests, you can produce items and sell them at craft fairs and like MAKE magazine's Makers Faire, you can create computer software - that's inventions, you know, that those are inventions, too. So - and you can sometimes show your inventions and by creating a DVD and in other words the creativity doesn't have to be in the normal model of a mechanical device. And in some cases, some people are more fit to write, a photograph, make a video, a movie, and that way - and there's protection schemes for all of those. So that way, you still protect it, but you could go with what feels good for you. In my case, I like adapting things just like Amy Smith does.  And in her case, she doesn't even get a license but great, you know, it is great that she gets great awards. I mean, she's won over half a million dollars in awards and she's very altruistic and she's saving lives, too. So there are so many avenues for inventors to take advantage of their creativity and to make alliances. And like Andrew said to find out which your market is - do you want to go all the way with this? How much money do you want to spend? Or, like in my case, I like writing about it, getting ideas, adapting and putting them on paper and sometimes video. And, you know, distributing them that way.  FLATOW: And, of course, that was a great idea. You mentioned about videos. Now, you can do animation and computer graphics to illustrate exactly what you want to do without ever having to build it.  Mr. TYMONY: Right. And that animation software, which used to be, you know, tens of thousands of dollars - there's so many versions of it - now almost shareware versions practically, where in the past an inventor couldn't get his message across. And now, if he or she can't do it themselves, there's so many people that can show them how where that way, they can work out some of the kinks before they spend money and machine tooling and, you know, tool and dye and things like that. And then, I'll work those things out and come up even with better ideas.  FLATOW: I'm talking with Cy Tymony and Andrew Krauss at this hour, we're going to have to take a short break. To talk with lots more folks about the inventions, I see you on the phones, you're on the line, you're looking for some advice, we'll get to you. Try not to get too detailed about because we can't really give you all that detailed advice like almost like when you ask people for medical advice, the invention, the inventor advice gets even more detailed sometimes. So stay with us. We'll give you as much advice as we can after this break. Don't go away. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking about inventions and inventors. If you're an inspiring or aspiring or, as Thomas Edison might say, a perspiring inventor. This is the hour for you. It's your chance to hear from two experts on how to take your ideas from your kitchen table or from your computer to the market perhaps.  Cy Tymony, inventor and author. He's written three books about invention. The latest coming out is \"Sneakiest Uses for Everyday Things. \" Andrew Krauss, co-founder of inventRight. com and president of InventorsAlliance. org. Our number 1-800-989-8255. Andrew, you know, we were talking about making this computer models and things now using graphics. You know, wouldn't YouTube be a perfect place to show off something now if you, well, you want to get somebody interested to see what you do?  Mr. KRAUSS: I'm not sure what you mean?  FLATOW: Well, you can put your video up on YouTube, you know, and people come to look at it.  Mr. KRAUSS: Oh, absolutely. Well, you know, I'm not an attorney so I can't offer legal advice. But in the United States, it's still a first to invent country. So once you disclose your invention, you have to patent it within a year. I will say it depends on your approach. If you're looking to sell it yourself, fantastic, go for it. If you're planning to license it to a company and have them sell it, I wouldn't recommend putting a video up on YouTube. I'd recommend a password protected Web site that you could show a select few manufacturers because there are some legal issues there.  FLATOW: Good point. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Elizabeth(ph) in Tallahassee. Hi, Elizabeth.  ELIZABETH (Caller): Hi. How are you doing?  FLATOW: How are you?  ELIZABETH: I love your show.  CONAN: Thank you.  ELIZABETH: I just wanted to call to comment, actually, not so much a question. But I have been learning about some inventions that my grandfather need some -having to do with some military patents, actually. And just wanted to comment about the unsung inventors that exist. My grandfather had, he was our captain and he came up with the, I guess, first prototype, for the - gosh, I'm like, going blank here.  FLATOW: You're nervous.  (Soundbite of laughter)  ELIZABETH: Yeah, I'm a little nervous. But he came up with the prototype for the aircraft carrier runway\u2026  FLATOW: No kidding.  ELIZABETH: \u2026or landing strip.  FLATOW: No kidding.  ELIZABETH: And he also invented the exploding bolts\u2026  FLATOW: Oh, that they use\u2026  ELIZABETH: \u2026which allow the space shuttle to disengage, I believe?  FLATOW: Yeah, they had - that's, they've been using those for decades not just for the space shuttle. Yeah.  ELIZABETH: Yeah, yeah. So that was - it's just, you know, fascinating to me and I just, you know, think that these guys and men and women who contribute to the world of science, they don't always take credit for it or\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  ELIZABETH: \u2026you know, they deserve a little bit of - some (unintelligible).  FLATOW: Well, we have the right guy on to talk about that because Andrew Krauss, you know, is an inventor and educator. And believe me, you know, he must know about a lot of these people you never hear of. And they're all over the place.  ELIZABETH: Yeah, yeah, and I think, you know, and, you know, as his granddaughter just now learning about all of this things that he was able to contribute and thinking, gosh, why didn't I inherit some of that genius, you know?  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Well\u2026  Mr. KRAUSS: And I think you could follow in his footsteps. It's not - you were talking about Thomas Edison earlier. How he would come up with ideas because I realize about 50 percent of the people I talk to when I tell them I ran an inventors' association, they say they came up with an idea at one point or another. But then, there's the other 50 percent and I'm sure some of your listeners would like to know how to come up with ideas.  ELIZABETH: Yeah.  Mr. KRAUSS: And so it's very important not to force it. Very few people can come up with ideas when they're stressed. What Thomas Edison used to do is sit in his lounge chair with a pool ball in his hand, and he would just relax. I mean, almost to the point of falling asleep and that is the best point. And so for some people it's the shower, it's the porch, it's in the parking lying under a tree. And he would, anyway, think of all these best ideas that way. And if the pool ball fell on the floor, and wake him up, and then he would pick it up back up and he'd do it all over again. So people\u2026  ELIZABETH: It's so like (unintelligible).  Mr. KRAUSS: \u2026people can come with ideas and I think you could fall on the footsteps of your, with your grandfather?  ELIZABETH: Yeah.  Mr. KRAUSS: Yeah.  ELIZABETH: My grandfather. His name is Bert O. Carlson(ph).  FLATOW: Well, he's now immortalized, Elizabeth. Thanks to you.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Thanks a lot for calling.  ELIZABETH: Wonderful. Thank you.  FLATOW: Bye bye. 1-800-989-8255. Cy, how do you come up - I find that when I'm driving, speaking of a relaxing drive - I come up with all kinds of ideas. Where do yours come from?  Mr. TYMONY: Well, I come up with ideas just by reading, experimenting, playing around with things. Just when I think I'm out of ideas for another book, I come across a new category. When she spoke about unsung heroes, there's a great book called \"Women Invent\" by Susan Casey. And I learned so much about women's inventions way back in the 1800s up to the present of so many things that they developed, enhanced and invented so she may want to check that out, you know? It ties into what she said about her grandfather.  But like Andrew said, in some cases, people have a hard time coming up with inventions. And in other cases, you come up with them every five minutes and then, there's a thing of what do you do with it? And - but it's also important. An idea's one thing, I can think of many things to do. But then, when you start to implement it, then you find out it may not work. It may not work well. And yet through that process, you learn something else.  So just use the Internet. You know, get around different types of people. Like Andrew said, go to different stores, touch hammers and go to toy stores, go to makers' fairs, craft fairs. And you won't have any problem coming up with adaptations and ideas. I mean, we're in the age of Bluetooth and USB accessories and flash drives and iPods and iPhone. There's so many - just look at a kiosk on a mall that sell cell phone accessories. You know, from the cases to the adaptors, and to accessories for iPods to give them speakers. I mean, coming up with ideas in this day and age to enhance already existing ideas is a cottage industry.  FLATOW: Well, Gina(ph) in\u2026  Mr. KRAUSS: Yeah, that's a very important point. I mean, a lot of people think it needs to be completely new idea, but almost all inventions are just adaptations, like Cy said, of existing products.  FLATOW: Gina in Kansas City has an idea. Right, Gina?  GINA (Caller): Yeah, I do. Thanks. How are you?  FLATOW: How are you?  GINA: Good. Hey, my idea basically is - my son plays with little Nintendo DS games and the game chips are literally a little bit bigger than my thumbnail. And they cost, you know, 20 to 30 bucks and we lose them all the time. And so basically, I'm thinking about something that would be almost like a keychain. And you could retrofit something that would go on each game. You know, and then go to hook it on the keychain when you aren't playing. But my question is, do I need to make a prototype of it or - I don't even know where to start?  Mr. KRAUSS: I've got some input on that.  FLATOW: Go ahead.  Mr. KRAUSS: Basically, some ideas, you can protect; some ideas, you can't. My gut instinct is telling me that you can't protect that idea. So either you start your own company and you manufacture this idea\u2026  GINA: Right.  Mr. KRAUSS: \u2026or you come up with an incredibly clever keychain. If it's incredibly clever, there might be some protection you could get, and then you can license it and some other company can worry about manufacturing, marketing it, all that, and give you a percentage in each sale. So I hate to say that there's not a way to figure out how to make a really unique keychain that holds that chip like cooler and better than anything else.  GINA: Right.  Mr. KRAUSS: But I have a hard time imagining that. But if you can do that, then it's licensable. Otherwise, you need to start your own company and sell it yourself.  GINA: Okay. That's a tough one.  FLATOW: Good luck to you.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Join the crowd, Gina.  GINA: Yeah. Thanks. It sounds like a great idea. I just couldn't quite figure out how to put it on paper.  FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah. Well, good luck to you. Get some help of, well, you know, some drawing help maybe.  GINA: Yeah. Thanks so much.  FLATOW: Yeah, good luck. Have a good weekend.  1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's continue. Let's, you know, a lot of women on the phone today of inventors. I don't mean to be sexist about it, but either a lot of women with great ideas and we don't hear from them. I'm glad we are.  Anne(ph) in Jacksonville. Hi, Anne. Anne, are you there? Oh, come on. Anne in Jacksonville, no? All right. Well, I guess we'll have to go to - let's go to San Antonio. Hi. Justices(ph), is it?  Ms. JUSDIASAS REID(ph)(Caller): Yes. My name is Jusdaisas Reid from San Antonio. I'm a mother of three, and my husband is deployed and so I'm very busy. My hands are very full, and I just have an idea that I need to have at home. And so I don't know how to go about creating this object that I need, and I need to have it at home right now. So how do I start? What do I do? It's a very clever idea. It's a very\u2026  FLATOW: You don't want to give it away by telling us anything about it?  Ms. REID: No. I don't tell anyone my idea.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. REID: All I know that it's a very good idea. Moms need this. I know they need it. I need one right now. How do I start? What do I do?  FLATOW: Andrew, I'm sure you've heard this before?  Mr. KRAUSS: Yeah. I mean, maybe Cy - it seems like he's really good at prototyping. Do you have any prototyping tips, Cy?  Mr. TYMONY: Well, what I would highly suggest she and some of your listeners do, in yesterday's New York Times there's an article about dads coming up with inventions because more dads - inventions for childcare because more dads are helping out with childcare. And it gives about four, five examples of dads that have created or adapted things to make it easier for childcare. So if you get that article, it's online or you might, better go to a library, the Thursday New York Times. It was very, very informative about the problems that they had, what they wanted to do, how they created their little prototypes, and then how they brought it to market. So I would highly suggest that, and it's a nice, easy read.  FLATOW: Good idea. Thanks for calling. Good luck to you.  Ms. REID: Okay. All right. Thank you.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's go to Daniel(ph) in Des Moines. Hi, Daniel.  DANIEL (Caller): Hello, there.  FLATOW: Hi, there.  DANIEL: I create a\u2026  FLATOW: Are you there, Daniel? Well, I guess we lost him. Cy, are you there?  Mr. TYMONY: Yes, I'm here.  FLATOW: What do people like Daniel has dropped off - it looks actually all of our callers - we must have a technical glitch. What - how do people find investors? You know, you have an idea, how do you find an investor for a product, if you're looking for one?  Mr. TYMONY: Well, step one would be to first somehow protect it, get an interim trademark or interim patent first. And, you know, write up and create some kind of model for your idea on paper or with software. And then what you can do is you have to look at companies that already produce similar products. And by that research process, you'll come into a list of people. And also there's - there are inventor alliances like Andrew's group. There - legal advice that you can get to. So that will be no problem. The Internet is a great tool for all inventors as far as creating an alliance and trying to get a licenser. And I'm sure Andrew has some ideas on that, too.  FLATOW: Yeah. We've lost all our phone clients for some reason. And Andrew was on the line, so we're going to have to talk with you, Cy\u2026  Mr. KRAUSS: I'm back. I'm back.  FLATOW: Oh, he's back. Okay.  Mr. TYMONY: There he is.  FLATOW: There he is. We were talking, Andrew, about how do you find a good investor? You know, do you have an idea? Do - you know, will they find you?  Mr. KRAUSS: It's really hard to find people that want to fund inventions, because a person with an idea isn't very fundable. You have to have a team that knows how to market it, manufacture it, do all that. Yeah, and quite often a lot of inventors or - are moms or engineers and they don't know anything about business. So is somebody going to hand you a million dollars? Probably not. You need to put a team together to do that.  FLATOW: Let me see if I can get enough phone call in before we have to go. Back to the phones. Let's go to Barbara(ph) in California. Hi, Barbara.  GARY(ph) (Caller): This is actually Gary, sorry about that.  FLATOW: Okay. Go ahead, Gary.  GARY: I'm wondering what Cy and Andrew had actually invented themselves. And in studying inventors, what they've learned about sort of pursuing their own ideas and creating realities out of baby ideas that would have gone somewhere, something - it wouldn't have created anything in the past?  FLATOW: Let me get - let me first remind everybody that I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  Cy, you've invented a lot of things.  Mr. TYMONY: Yeah. I created a ring that basically has a magnet on the top that I used to turn on devices including starting up my car. Instead of having a cut off switch that I would lean over under the dash or under the seat to turn on, which is kind of cumbersome, I just aim my ring at a portion of the dash, dashboard, and behind there there's a magnetically sensitive switch. And I used to call that the magnapower ring(ph). And I put that idea in my books, \"Sneaky Uses for Everyday Things. \" And in fact, there's a little video of it when you're speaking of the YouTube videos, I put some videos at my sneakyuses. com Web site. And I even uploaded a video to the SCIENCE FRIDAY Web site about a radio-controlled jacket that you can\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  Mr. TYMONY: \u2026use the parts from a $5-toy and use it so that your jacket can control things, too.  FLATOW: Yeah, and are you making more videos? You find that, you know, as you invent things, you're making videos out them?  Mr. TYMONY: Yeah. I make videos because I do a lot of demonstrations at schools and libraries, and I have so many things that I show quickly that I wanted a way to - for people to come back home later and also spread the word. I created nine videos and I uploaded them to YouTube and there's a link at my site, too. And that way, people can see how to do these techniques, like how to test their money. You know, all you need a magnet and bring it near the - a currency, a dollar bill and you go see if it's counterfeit or not. So making little videos with inexpensive digital cameras is a very good tool to get your message across.  FLATOW: Now, I've got Barbara on the line. Quickly, Barbara, we're running out of time.  BARBARA (Caller): Real quick. I'm - I want to make a prototype. I'm not sure whether to do it in plastic or in metal. And I just don't really know. And when I do find someone - if I even knew how to get one - do they have to sign something or just - should I make them quiet or secretive or what?  Mr. KRAUSS: Yes. It's called a work for hire agreement, Barbara. When somebody signs something saying that's your invention.  BARBARA: Work for hire. Okay.  Mr. KRAUSS: Yeah. You could try\u2026  BARBARA: And the agreement just says what essentially?  Mr. KRAUSS: It basically says that, you know, you own the invention and any improvements that they make, you own. That's very important.  BARBARA: Okay. All right. And how do I - do you think there's a good way to start with it? Do I just go to a local machine shop or something?  Mr. KRAUSS: It - that's such a specific question. I mean, it all depend on your invention. I need to know more about your invention.  BARBARA: Okay.  FLATOW: Barbara, why not make a video of it or an animation? Then you could\u2026  BARBARA: That's so, that's so fancy. I don't think I can do that.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: All right. Good luck to you.  BARBARA: Anyway, thanks so much.  FLATOW: You're welcome. One last question for you, Andrew. We see all these ads on late-night TV shows or - if you've got an invention? Call us. Should we?  Mr. KRAUSS: No.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. KRAUSS: And I won't go in the details, because I don't want to be sued. But there's a great Web site out there called inventored. org. And it talks about these companies, and I guess - I think he's a reporter. So I highly recommend it to anybody that's even thinking about getting involved with these companies, go to that Web site, that's what he does. What I do is I teach people to sell their ideas.  FLATOW: All right. So you take - already made inventions?  Mr. KRAUSS: No, well - well, what I do at inventRight - basically, my partner, he's licensed to over 20 products, and we just basically consolidate what did he do to sell his ideas? How do you do your market research? How do you get into companies? What do you say, you know? And then we basically put that into a course.  FLATOW: I got you.  Mr. KRAUSS: And we teach people how to sell their ideas. Through my inventors' association, we give people the opportunity to get all points of view from different inventors. We had Colin Rose speak back in November. He's the largest colored spread in the Wall Street Journal four days before he spoke. Yeah. Ergonomic pen that was kind of like a wishbone. That was ergonomic. And you know, they come and they speak and they say, hey, here's how I made my millions and here's how - here are some mistakes I made, here are some things I did right, and here's how you can do the same. And that's very, very important because ideas are a dime a dozen. People that know how to sell them are really hard to come by. And my mission in life is educating inventors as to how they can bring their products to market. Ideas are great, but if you don't know how to bring it to market, people are never going to know about them.  FLATOW: Cy, you got 10 seconds. When is your last book coming out, your latest book?  Mr. TYMONY: It will be out in late October. It's available online, in every bookstore called, \"Sneakiest Uses for Everyday Things. \" And I thank you for writing the foreword to it, Ira.  FLATOW: You're welcome. It's been a pleasure to read and actually try some of the stuff you've got in your books. It reminds me of my teenage days. Cy Tymony is inventor, author in Torrance, California. He's written about - he's written three books about invention. The latest is the \"Sneakiest Use for Everyday Things. \"  Andrew Krauss is an inventor educator, co-founder of inventRight. com and president of InventorsAlliance. org.  Thanks again, gentlemen, for taking time to be with us.  Mr. TYMONY: Thank you.  Mr. KRAUSS: Thank you.  FLATOW: Kimberly - you're welcome.  (Soundbite of credits)  FLATOW: Surf over to our Web site at sciencefriday. com. We're blogging and podcasting. If you want to see - you want Cy Tymony's videos. It's up there, plus, all kinds of other videos. If you got an invention video you want to send us, there's a great idea. Take a video of your invention. If you want to expose it to everybody, we'll put it up to our Web site for you.  Have a great weekend. We'll see you next week. I'm Ira Flatow in New York.

I'm Debbie Elliott. Imagine you're sitting on your porch this evening, sipping a mint tulip to help you get through the sultry summer heat when suddenly, duck, an enormous moth comes swishing by, a little too close for comfort as it succumbs to its fatal attraction to your porch light. Everyone knows moths will fly to a flame, but we wondered why? (Soundbite of music) ELLIOTT: As we pursued the moth-flame connection for this week's Science Out of the Box segment, we found a few theories out there. For the first, we turn to Dr. May Berenbaum. She's the head of the department of entomology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Hello there. Dr. MAY BERENBAUM (Department of Entomology, University of Illinois): Hi there. ELLIOTT: So why do moths have this suicidal attraction to flames and light bulbs? Dr. BERENBAUM: Well, the sort of standard line of explanation is that it's something of an evolutionary short circuit that moths and other nocturnal insects use celestial navigation for orienting about in the dark, the same way that explorers could find their way by charting a course relative to the North Star or some celestial far-distant point source of light. And what has happened since that time is that humans have come along and developed terrestrial point sources of light. So very intense light that is not millions of miles away. So in a behavior called transverse orientation, many animals, including insects, can move or fly to maintain a constant angle relative to a distant point source of light. So that - yeah. ELLIOTT: So is this similar to what - you know, we've always heard about sea turtles and how they are looking for the moon to go back into the sea and when you have your lights on all along the beach, it confuses them and they don't know which way to go? Dr. BERENBAUM: Yeah. It's, I think, another manifestation of more or less the same phenomenon. The reason that moths end up at porch lights so often, along with other nocturnal flying insects, is to maintain a constant angle relative to a nearby point source of light. They had to keep kind of moving closer and closer and adjusting their relative position. And ultimately they end up kind of at the light itself. ELLIOTT: I can understand why they might bump into light bulbs and keep flying around that, but what about flames? When you have a candle and they tend to fly into the candle, and it's hot and often times it leads to their demise. It seems like the heat would push them away. Dr. BERENBAUM: Well, that's kind of a short circuit part of it. If there's no evolutionary history of a close-by point source of light that also puts out enormous amounts of heat then they have no history of dealing with those conflicting kinds of signals. ELLIOTT: Now, we've heard some other theories on this so we're going to let you hear one of those. We talked earlier to Henry Hsiao, a professor of biomedical engineering at the University of North Carolina. And back in 1972, he wrote a whole book on moths. Here is what he had to say. Dr. HENRY HSIAO (Professor, Biomedical Engineering, University of North Carolina): My best hypothesis is that it's net(ph) response of a night-flying insect to the morning light and let me explain that. During the day, almost all moths try to hide from predators. That's why their wing patterns have camouflaged patterns in drab colors. And at night, the darkness of light do not allow a moth to select the best hiding place so when the first morning light appears they have to fly up and towards the light and seek a place to hide. So you'd expect the behavior where they first seek light and then fly down and hide. ELLIOTT: So Dr. Hsiao has studied the moth's flight patterns and says if moths really use the moon to navigate, they would end up flying in spirals around the light. His research seems to show that they actually make a beeline for it, if you pardon my mixed insect metaphor there. Which theory seems more plausible to you, Dr. Berenbaum? Dr. BERENBAUM: He has a valid point, you know, and why they appear to fly straight at the light, everything is relative. The transverse orientation may begin at some considerable distance - 30 feet, 50 feet from the light source. ELLIOTT: Well, thank you very much for talking with us. Dr. BERENBAUM: Thank you for the question. ELLIOTT: Dr. May Berenbaum is the head of the entomology department at the University Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Earlier this summer, Silvia and her husband were asked to keep their son out of the public pool and showers at an RV park in southern Alabama. We also spoke with the park's owner, Ken Zadnichek, who says that he just wanted to keep the boy out of the facilities until he got confirmation that it was safe for other patrons. So from a medical perspective, how should the situation have played out, and what are the myths and realities of HIV transmission? Dr. Luther Virgil is a physician with Integrated Minority AIDS Network Inc. , or IMANI. It's a nonprofit network of doctors who treat HIV patients. Dr. Virgil, welcome. Dr. LUTHER VIRGIL (Physician, Integrated Minority AIDS Network, Inc. ): Well, thank you. I appreciate being here. How are you doing today? CHIDEYA: I'm doing absolutely great. And so I mentioned that I spoke last week with the RV park's owner. He asked the Glovers to keep Caleb out of the public pool and showers until he could get assurance from a health official that Caleb, who has HIV, wouldn't put other patrons in danger. So I want to play you a little bit of my conversation with him. (Soundbite of interview recording) Mr. KEN ZADNICHEK (RV Park Owner, Mobile, Alabama): The real story to us is child-on-child contact. We weren't sure what we were dealing with. We wanted to protect Caleb's health as well as every other child's health because he's got a suppressed immune system. We didn't know what would happen if a bunch of kids all were in the same place, sharing things that infants do, chewing on toys, diapers, the whole mess. CHIDEYA: So, Dr. Virgil, how justified were Mr. Zadnichek's fears? Dr. VIRGIL: Well, his fears most likely came from a lack of knowledge about the disease. In reality, the things that he mentioned such as child-on-child contact, casual, normal, everyday child-on-child contact does not place anyone at risk for the transmission of HIV and also does not place the child with HIV at risk for transmission from someone who has some other illness other than HIV. CHIDEYA: So run us through bodily fluids: saliva, urine, blood. These are all things that people wonder about in terms of how much of a risk they are. Dr. VIRGIL: Yes, there are some common misconceptions out there, again, reflecting on our need for more education and understanding about the virus itself. Many individuals are not fully aware of where the virus is actually located and what fluids are the key fluids that we are concerned about in relations to HIV. For example, HIV can be found in blood, naturally, also in the semen of male individuals and the vaginal fluids of female individuals. Those are the bodily fluids that we are most concerned about with the transmission of HIV. CHIDEYA: And what about saliva? Dr. VIRGIL: Saliva - not so much a concern about transmission. What a lot of people don't understand is that there's a certain - what we call an inoculum size or certain load or amount of virus that must be present in the transmissible fluid in order for a person to truly get the HIV virus. And the saliva is not a fluid that we look at or consider as one that has a high load in most instances transmit. So kissing an individual on the lips with HIV is not a high-risk situation. Placing your mouth on toys, which children will do, and then sharing with other children is not a high-risk behavior for transmission of HIV. CHIDEYA: So there are a lot of stories about HIV. You can get it through shared clothing. You can get it through toilet seats, mosquitoes. What are - what do you say to things like that? Dr. VIRGIL: We run into these types of beliefs even to this day, and they are beliefs which are limiting individuals' abilities to deal with HIV and limiting our overall ability to deal with this illness. We heard stories such as you can get it from toilet seats, you can get it from mosquitoes, you can get it from sharing clothes. These types of beliefs, of course, are not founded. They're not true, but they do exist. And we find it each and every day when we go out to places like high schools or elementary schools and even adult institutions such as churches and talk about the illness. CHIDEYA: So are there myths that you find are really more prevalent in the African-American community? Dr. VIRGIL: I think there are myths in all communities but some of the myths that we do find more frequently in the minority community are ones were sent around things like the toilet seats. And also, one of the biggest concerns that we've been having in the minority community, there have been studies, which have shown issues of risk and risk behavior and how people perceive themselves to be at risk. One of our biggest concerns at this time is that when we look in the population of men who have sex with men, the concepts of what the risks are such as unprotected types of sexual behavior are the true understanding of that is being forgotten. In other words, individuals are not putting as much stock in that and are taking more risks when they are being involved with sexual relationships. CHIDEYA: Now, what about this. There definitely are theories about AIDS being created, secret cures, things like that. Can you speak to that? Dr. VIRGIL: Yes. More recently, a study done by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease showed that about 48 percent of the minority or African-American individuals that they interviewed felt that the HIV virus was created in order to attack certain populations, that it was created by the federal government, whether they believe it was created for a tool of war or created in order to actually attack minority populations. They did have that belief. And that, of course, presents a difficulty when it comes to treatment because if the belief is that HIV was created in order to attack black people or HIV was created by the federal government, then the medicines which come out from studies related to the federal government, the individuals who would best benefit them - benefit from them, we find that they are less likely to take those medications which, again, then sets up those individuals who are HIV positive for spreading the disease because of the issue I talked about before, this inoculum size of viral load. CHIDEYA: And what about the issue of secret cures, if that has come up? Dr. VIRGIL: Yes, it has and it is very predominant in the African-American population. And many of the African-American individuals with HIV and those who don't have HIV will give you a classic example and they talk about the case of Irvin \"Magic\" Johnson, the famous basketball player. They will say, well, Magic Johnson has been cured. And then they look to the issue of the fact that those individuals who have - those individuals with money and power will be able to get the cure and those individuals who are poor, like the large portion of minority population, will not be able to get the cure. That is a difficulty in itself. Magic Johnson, and I've talked with him myself, has not been cured of HIV. He takes the medications the way he's supposed to take the medications and because of that, he gets the best benefit of health. CHIDEYA: Very quickly, what is your main approach at IMANI to dealing with myths and information? Dr. VIRGIL: Education, education, education. And some of the best education can come from the people who have the disease themselves. They serve as the best ambassadors for learning. We are continually and constantly trying to find anyone who - will listen and educate them on the issue of HIV disease. CHIDEYA: Well, Dr. Virgil, thank you so much. Dr. VIRGIL: I really appreciate you allowing me to talk with you and spread more education about HIV. CHIDEYA: Dr. Luther Virgil is a physician with Integrated Minority AIDS Network Inc. , a nonprofit network for doctors of HIV and AIDS patients.

NEWS & NOTES was created by NPR News and the African American Public Radio Consortium. I'm Farai Chideya. This is NEWS & NOTES.  FARAI CHIDEYA, host:  Last week, we spoke with Silvia Glover, the foster mother of 2-year-old Caleb, who has HIV. Earlier this summer, Silvia and her husband were asked to keep their son out of the public pool and showers at an RV park in southern Alabama.  We also spoke with the park's owner, Ken Zadnichek, who says that he just wanted to keep the boy out of the facilities until he got confirmation that it was safe for other patrons.  So from a medical perspective, how should the situation have played out, and what are the myths and realities of HIV transmission?  Dr. Luther Virgil is a physician with Integrated Minority AIDS Network Inc. , or IMANI. It's a nonprofit network of doctors who treat HIV patients.  Dr. Virgil, welcome.  Dr. LUTHER VIRGIL (Physician, Integrated Minority AIDS Network, Inc. ): Well, thank you. I appreciate being here. How are you doing today?  CHIDEYA: I'm doing absolutely great. And so I mentioned that I spoke last week with the RV park's owner. He asked the Glovers to keep Caleb out of the public pool and showers until he could get assurance from a health official that Caleb, who has HIV, wouldn't put other patrons in danger. So I want to play you a little bit of my conversation with him.  (Soundbite of interview recording)  Mr. KEN ZADNICHEK (RV Park Owner, Mobile, Alabama): The real story to us is child-on-child contact. We weren't sure what we were dealing with. We wanted to protect Caleb's health as well as every other child's health because he's got a suppressed immune system. We didn't know what would happen if a bunch of kids all were in the same place, sharing things that infants do, chewing on toys, diapers, the whole mess.  CHIDEYA: So, Dr. Virgil, how justified were Mr. Zadnichek's fears?  Dr. VIRGIL: Well, his fears most likely came from a lack of knowledge about the disease. In reality, the things that he mentioned such as child-on-child contact, casual, normal, everyday child-on-child contact does not place anyone at risk for the transmission of HIV and also does not place the child with HIV at risk for transmission from someone who has some other illness other than HIV.  CHIDEYA: So run us through bodily fluids: saliva, urine, blood. These are all things that people wonder about in terms of how much of a risk they are.  Dr. VIRGIL: Yes, there are some common misconceptions out there, again, reflecting on our need for more education and understanding about the virus itself. Many individuals are not fully aware of where the virus is actually located and what fluids are the key fluids that we are concerned about in relations to HIV. For example, HIV can be found in blood, naturally, also in the semen of male individuals and the vaginal fluids of female individuals. Those are the bodily fluids that we are most concerned about with the transmission of HIV.  CHIDEYA: And what about saliva?  Dr. VIRGIL: Saliva - not so much a concern about transmission. What a lot of people don't understand is that there's a certain - what we call an inoculum size or certain load or amount of virus that must be present in the transmissible fluid in order for a person to truly get the HIV virus. And the saliva is not a fluid that we look at or consider as one that has a high load in most instances transmit. So kissing an individual on the lips with HIV is not a high-risk situation. Placing your mouth on toys, which children will do, and then sharing with other children is not a high-risk behavior for transmission of HIV.  CHIDEYA: So there are a lot of stories about HIV. You can get it through shared clothing. You can get it through toilet seats, mosquitoes. What are - what do you say to things like that?  Dr. VIRGIL: We run into these types of beliefs even to this day, and they are beliefs which are limiting individuals' abilities to deal with HIV and limiting our overall ability to deal with this illness.

And this is NEWS & NOTES. Tomorrow the emergency contraceptive known as the morning-after pill will have been sold over the counter for exactly one year. The Food and Drug Administration had postponed its ruling on whether there could be over-the-counter sales again and again. Doctor Valerie Montgomery Rice is Dean of the School of Medicine at Meharry Medical College, where she's also senior vice president for health affairs. She joins us now to look back at that controversy over the morning-after pill, also known as Plan B and to look at the current set of contraceptive options for women. Dr. Rice, thanks for coming on. Dr VALERIE MONTGOMERY RICE (Dean, Meharry Medical College): Thank you for having me. CHIDEYA: So, I remember there were some misconceptions about the morning-after pill and whether or not it was a so-called abortion pill, like Mifepristone. Is that kind of misconception still out there? Dr. RICE: I think there may be some confusion still in the mind of some of the individuals, but we now know, based on good data and the work that was done by the companies who sponsored this, is that what we believe is happening is that it is ovulation is probably inhibited and that the normal menstrual cycle is altered, which would delay ovulation. And so, we don't believe that what you are really seeing is a embryo that is somewhat aborted. We believe that the mechanism is based on ovulation really being inhibited and a delay in ovulation, which, of course, you can't get fertilization and therefore, you won't have this quote, unquote, \"chemical abortion\" that people talk about. CHIDEYA: So, are there any side effects with this pill? Dr. RICE: With any birth control pills, some people do have some nausea, occasionally vomiting, but you - remember, this is a dose that is given 12 hours apart, and typically, most of the patients, particularly when they are used in the progestin-only type of morning-after pill, which Plan B is, then you don't see significant nausea at all. CHIDEYA: Progestin is one of the different hormones that are used in some birth control pills. Just very briefly, tell us why this pill has that particular hormone. Dr. RICE: Well, I think that when you look at the side effect profile, the number of people who had, like, the nausea, the vomiting, et cetera, as compared to some of the other progestins that were maybe considered, this one had the lowest side effect profile because, remember, we're trying to utilize something that's going to be effective and, of course, have the greatest safety profile for women. CHIDEYA: So whether minors could get their hands on the drug was one of the key points of debate on whether to make available over the counter - has that issue been resolved? Dr. RICE: I believe so. I did sit on the FDA panel during this time and was at the, of course, participated in the hearings, et cetera, and you know, the concerns were whether or not this would be a \"licensed,\" quote, unquote for minors to participate in more sexual activity, et cetera. And my response to that has always been that people make decisions about whether or not to have intercourse based on, really, multiple factors. But one of the key factors is the information that they get at home. And so I did not agree that this would be a licensed. But the controversy was still there, whether or not if we placed it away from behind the counter then - and put it on the shelf like other over-the-counter medications, whether we would see an increase use, and I'm not clear that the data has shown that at all. That you're seeing an increase use by teens, et cetera. I think I want to make sure that we clarify this. Plan B is an emergency type of contraceptive, and none of us would advocate that be the standard form of contraception that a person would use a lot, okay? No one would advocate that. We would advocate that people get on a more standard regimen of contraceptive. We have multiple options for women for long-term contraceptives that are reversible. So, I want to make sure that by no means that people walk away with this thinking that any of us would advocate that this is the standard means by which a woman will protect herself from pregnancy. This is what we recommend and the time when a condom breaks, or there has been a loss of your birth control pills and you have intercourse and you are concerned, that would be the situation that you will use this in. So I want to make sure that that is clear. CHIDEYA: Well, Dr. Valerie Montgomery Rice, thank you for coming on. Dr. RICE: All right. Thank you for having me. CHIDEYA: Dr. Valerie Montgomery Rice is an obstetrician and gynecologist. She joined us by phone from Meharry Medical College in Nashville where she's dean of the school of medicine and senior vice president for health affairs.  FARAI CHIDEYA, host:  I'm Farai Chideya.

We noticed in a recent Chicago weather report, in addition to thunderstorms and some dazzling cloud-to-ground lightning, a series of minor seiches in Lake Michigan. Seiches, spelled S-E-I-C-H-E-S, are evidently common fair in the Great Lakes and in other, lowercased G, great lakes. But for those of us who live far from a great inland body of water, the seiche is an exotic word and an exotic phenomenon. And joining us to explain what it means is Dr. Stephen Bortone who directs Minnesota Sea Grant, which is part of the University of Minnesota. He's in Duluth. Welcome to the program, Dr. Bortone. Dr. STEPHEN BORTONE (Director, Minnesota Sea Grant, University of Minnesota): Oh, thank you. SIEGEL: And first of all this word, S-E-I-C-H-E, seiche, I've read that it comes from some Swiss-French dialect. Dr. BORTONE: Yes. It seems to be the - somewhere around the 1890s that was coined. The word slosh might be better for an American to say. But, you know, that seems to be the word we have adopted. SIEGLE: When there is a seiche or a slosh in Lake Michigan, what is it? What does it look like? Dr. BORTONE: Well, it's really a standing wave. There's two kinds of waves. One that you're all familiar with or everybody's familiar with, called the progressive wave. And that's the one you typically see on the shoreline, where a wave comes along, breaks and splashes. Then there's a standing wave in which there's no net movement of water in a large body. But basically, it's - water moving back and forth. The best analogy is water sloshing around in your bathtub. SIEGLE: Or having a basin of water and tipping it back and forth. Dr. BORTONE: Exactly. SIEGLE: Well, I know why it happens in the basin or in the bathtub. Why does it happen in Lake Michigan? Dr. BORTONE: Well, there's a lot of causes, anything that would set up water motion. An earthquake could do it. Some very large meteor hitting the water body could do it. But most of the time, it's due to things like storm fronts moving through and then quickly subsiding, or sometimes, heavy rains could cause it, or even winds that blow very strongly and then quickly stop. And that's probably what's been happening recently in the Lake Michigan situation. SIEGLE: You mean, so the weather is so remarkable at one end of the lake - the very large bathtub - that it affects the level of the water at the other end of the lake or the bathtub. Dr. BORTONE: Correct. And what would, I guess the visual image would be you push water up against one side and then quickly release that. Push from the wind, and then it sloshes back to the other side. Takes quite a while for it to happen, maybe a few hours in some cases for it to slosh back. SIEGLE: Are we talking about standing waves, which are at their highest are inches or feet or many feet? How big can a seiche be? Dr. BORTONE: Well, they happen all the time. And in they're in the matter of inches. And you don't notice them and no one cares. But when they get to be a few feet or more, then we start noticing their impacts along the shorelines. SIEGLE: We did see an account of one seiche in Lake Superior, where the level -the water level went down by three feet over the course of a quarter of an hour. And lots of boats were. . . Dr. BORTONE: Right. SIEGLE . . . stranded as a result. Dr. BORTONE: Yeah, it can do that. It can even pick boats up and put them on top of docks. And it causes other boats to smash into each other as they move from side to side. So there's a fair amount of destruction that can take place. SIEGLE: And I gather, folks who watch weather reports in and around the Great Lakes, for them this word is not strange. Dr. BORTONE: No. It's fairly common. In fact, Minnesota Sea Grant's newsletter is called The Seiche. We have adopted that as sort of our way of communicating with the public. But it's a fairly common word. A lot of people know it. I'm not sure they always understand what the causes of them and that sort of thing. And the fact that they are out there all the time, they're not just such of a magnification. We can actually see them. SIEGLE: Well, Dr. Bortone, thank you very much for talking with us about it. Dr. BORTONE: You're welcome. SIEGLE: It's Dr. Stephen Bortone in Duluth, who is director of Minnesota Sea Grant, part of the University of Minnesota, explaining seiches to us.

We can actually see them.  SIEGLE: Well, Dr. Bortone, thank you very much for talking with us about it.  Dr. BORTONE: You're welcome.  SIEGLE: It's Dr. Stephen Bortone in Duluth, who is director of Minnesota Sea Grant, part of the University of Minnesota, explaining seiches to us.

And this is NEWS & NOTES. As a fighter, Muhammad Ali left an indelible mark on America's cultural landscape. But for the past 20 years, he's been locked in a fight of his life with Parkinson's disease. As they say, behind every good man is a great woman. In Muhammad Ali's case, it's his wife of over 20 years, Lonnie Ali. She's been his primary caregiver during most of their marriage and is now, for the first time, speaking out about her experiences at his side. She's teamed up with the Fight For MORE campaign to help educate patients and caregivers about all aspects of Parkinson's disease and treatment. Lonnie, welcome. Ms. LONNIE ALI (Muhammad Ali's Wife; Fight For MORE Campaign): Thank you. CHIDEYA: So, is this a road that you ever expected to travel and how hard has it been on you? Ms. ALI: You know what? When I married Muhammad, he had Parkinson's disease, so it wasn't something that was unexpected. I will say it's been a different journey. And it's not one that has been real tumultuous, but it's been an experience - it's been a learning experience for me. CHIDEYA: I can imagine that because of all the things he's done in his life and continues to do, this has been difficult for him and also must put a strain on how he sees himself and how you can deal with any emotional issues for yourself and him. How do you deal with the moments where you're down, where he's down? Ms. ALI: You know, the one important thing that I will say to anyone who has a caregiver is to keep a positive attitude. Any time you find out that someone that's close to you, a loved one, a close friend, a relative, has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, just don't think the worst and realize that there is help out there. There is research going on. There's all kind of treatment options that are available. There's support. And, really, with regards to the neurological degenerative diseases, this is one of the most promising cures for diseases for - with Parkinson's disease. With regards to ourselves of, you know, when we get down and low - you know, we probably have moments, but not many, because we are a very positive people. We really look forward to what we can do and what we - and not what we can't do. And Muhammad is just a fighter, you know? This whole campaign, Fight For MORE, is so appropriately named. I mean, for me to be associated, you know, I really have to thank Valeant Pharmaceuticals for asking me to be the face of this campaign and giving me the opportunity to share with thousands of caregivers out there, of Parkinson patients, my experiences and what I have learned. CHIDEYA: Tell me more about your fight, and why you took on this mission, and what you're hoping to do. Ms. ALI: My fight is with the Fight For MORE campaign. As I said, it's a national educational campaign that hopes to empower the thousands of caregivers out there taking care of Parkinson patients with knowledge, resources, opportunity to connect with one another and form a Parkinson's caregiver community, to give them a source and a basis of where to go if somebody has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in your family or you know somebody. This is like one of the first steps, you know, to go to this Web site that's associated with this campaign. And that Web site address is www. fightformore. com, and learn more not only about the disease, but where you should go to get information and treatment options with regards to this disease. And there's also a section on there of caregiver tips of what I have learned over the last 20 years of giving care to Muhammad. And my intent is to help share that information that I have gained over the last 20 years with others to help empower them to be better caregivers and to learn more about, not only the disease itself, but, as I said, the treatment options. There's new treatment options coming on the scene all the time in this illness. There's all kinds of new research going on as well. So there's a lot of hope in this disease, of a cure being found, or something that will arrest it or treat it better than what's being done today. CHIDEYA: How many people are we talking about who are affected either in terms of having Parkinson's or, by extension, I'm sure, that many more people are affected by living with someone with Parkinson's? Ms. ALI: Research show there's about a million people who have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. I don't know how true that is because I'm meeting too many people all the time who were recently diagnosed or have been diagnosed. And we have this whole, huge, young adult onset that's coming up, you know? I just recently got a call from a friend of ours, who had a friend whose daughter is 13-years-old and was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in Southern California. It was just shocking to a lot of people, you know, because a lot of people think this is an old person's disease, but it's not. And you're finding that more and more that people are being diagnosed in their late 30s, you know, early 40s. And to me, that's still fairly, relatively young. So there's a lot of challenges there. CHIDEYA: Lonnie, are there any issue specific to the African-American community and how people are dealing with Parkinson's? Ms. ALI: Well, actually, what we've found out is that Parkinson's disease affects people of different races equally. There's not like, you know, more Caucasian people or people of European descent that have it more than people who are of African descent or Asian descent. It affects the races quite equally. But it's interesting, because I've read recently that 22. 4 million care-giving households of a nation's - and that's how many households in this nation there are of caregivers, 22. 4 million, 10 percent of those are African American. So I find that very interesting. And what's also interesting is that it's always a challenge. As African Americans, we are so used to taking care of people all by ourselves. And it's very important to realize that, you know, we need help, you need help as a caregiver to bring in that family support, because most of the time when that happens, especially in the African-American community and household - and I don't want it limit it to that, but, you know, it takes - it's usually two incomes coming in. And when one is sacrificed, it makes it very difficult. So we find, in the African-American household, that even though the caregiver is giving full time care to the person, they're also working. CHIDEYA: Is there anything that the challenges faced by being a caregiver have given you that's positive? Ms. ALI: Absolutely. You know, like - you know, I am a positive person. The fact that I can give my husband a better quality of life than he might have gotten normally, to me, is positive. For me to be able to provide some opportunity to put a smile on his face, to me, is positive. I'm always looking at what he still is able to do and his mission in life and achieving that mission in life and not what he's not able to do. I am very aware that things have changed and that, you know, some things have to be limited now. But to me, it's important that as much as he can do, that he continues to do. And he's the very same way. He's a fighter, he believes in that, and he's never allowed this illness to define who he is as person or what he hopes to achieve as an individual before he leaves this Earth. He has a large legacy to leave. And Parkinson's, hopefully, research a cure fighting for more for Parkinson's patients and caregivers will be part of his legacy and part of mine. CHIDEYA: Lonnie, is there anything you'd like to add? Ms. ALI: Well, one thing I'd like to add is that it's important that people realize that a cure for Parkinson's disease is simply a function of money. And what's great about this Fight for MORE campaign that is if anybody goes to the Web site www. fightformore. com and signs up, Valeant Pharmaceuticals will donate $10 per person who signs up to the Partisan Unity Walk. So you can sit in the comfort of your home and still raise money for the research and cure for this disease. CHIDEYA: Well, Lonnie, thank you so much. Ms. ALI: Thank you. CHIDEYA: Lonnie Ali is married to boxing legend Muhammad Ali. She's a spokesperson for the Fight for MORE campaign. She spoke with me here in our NPR West Studios.

I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, host: And I'm Steve Inskeep. A new report from the group Trust for America's Health on Obesity is called F as in fat. Most Americans agree that obesity is a serious problem. But last year in 31 states the rate of obesity continued to rise. Since 2003, when the non-profit, bi-partisan organization started tracking these trends, not one state has reported a decline in obesity. NPR's Brenda Wilson reports. BRENDA WILSON: The report not only tracks trends, it ranks states. Colorado is the leanest state, but even there obesity went up a little over half a percentage point. This report found the heaviest people in the South - in Mississippi - where nearly a third of adults are considered obese. Pointing out the severity of the problem in the South, Jeff Levi, the executive director of Trust for America's Health, says it's not the same as picking on fat people. Mr. JEFF LEVI (Executive Director, Trust for America's Health): This isn't about stigmatizing individuals. It is about alerting and trying to catalyze state legislatures, community zoning boards, school boards, whoever has a role to play, and they all do. WILSON: Even as he spoke, experts in southern states were meeting at the Obesity Summit in Little Rock, Arkansas to discuss ways to reverse obesity trends in the South - by building more parks, restricting vending machines that sell junk food in schools, and requiring physical education programs for students.  But at yesterday's teleconference, Joshua Norman, a reporter with the Mississippi Sun Herald, wondered whether state programs would be enough to get people in Mississippi to shed pounds.  Mr. JOSHUA NORMAN (Mississippi Sun Herald): I worked and lived here in Mississippi, and I got to say that we're talking about a massive cultural shift. We have an overweight governor. Our last Department of Health director weighed 300 pounds. And it seems like this culture of bad food is part of the fabric of this state.  How do you propose really combating something that's beyond just, you know, getting kids to workout more and eat healthier food? I mean, how do you get them to stop eating fried catfish five times a week when it's what people do here? WILSON: But it comes as no surprise to Mississippi's interim state health director, Dr. Ed Thompson, that the state has the worst record. Dr. ED THOMPSON (Interim State Health Officer, Mississippi): We're on the front end of a very negative trend, but the rest of the country is coming right along with us.  WILSON: The report looks at an average of the latest yearly trends. Thompson is looking at one year alone. Dr. THOMPSON: For 2006, the most recent year, where things are actually going, you will see that Mississippi is number one, but Michigan is number five.  WILSON: It's a statistical argument, but he's making the same point as Trust for America's Health. There's no region of the country that's not in trouble. And he says Mississippi has undertaken initiatives and passed laws. It now requires 30 minutes of physical activity three days a week for children in grades kindergarten through 12. And it now also provides vouchers under the Women and Infants Nutrition Program for fruits and vegetables from the local farmers markets. Dr. James Wood(ph), a pediatrician, is the senior vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which supports such programs. Dr. JAMES WOOD (Senior Vice President, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation): I think we will see, as we're starting to see, some of the changes in the behaviors before we actually see the weight turn around. WILSON: The obesity report calls for more research and more support from the federal government. Brenda Wilson, NPR News.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host:  This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News.

So far, there's been no writing in the webs, no letters spelling out some pig or radiant that Charlotte herself might look at the masses of draping webs and say, wow. At Lake Tawakoni State Park, several hundred yards along a nature trail have been taken over the elaborate arachnid construction, web stretching from tree to tree and down to the ground. Donna Garde is the superintendent of the park, about 50 miles from Dallas. And Donna Garde, how do those webs look today? Ms. DONNA GARDE (Superintendent, Lake Tawakoni State Park, Texas): Well, they're a little drippy and creepy-looking actually. We had some rain that knocked them down, so there's no more fairyland spider webs. It's a little creepier now. BLOCK: Creepier? Ms. GARDE: Yeah, it is. There would be a darker, scary movie now instead of just a fantasy scary movie. BLOCK: Is that sort of what it's been like to go out there and look at the thing? Ms. GARDE: It really is. It's just hard to believe that it's not manmade, fake Hollywood set. It's just so incredible. The amount of webbing is just hard to believe that these little, teeny, one-inch-long or less spiders have made all of these. BLOCK: Give us some sense of the scale of this. I'm trying to picture 200 yards worth of spider webs. Ms. GARDE: Spiders, I know. That's the general area. The original spider web covers about five really large posts of trees, plus, a few other trees thrown in for a good measure. So, you know, it's just a massive area, form kind of in a curved shape, so it's hard to see the whole thing at once. It sort of circles a little pond that was probably providing plenty of food with all of those little mosquitoes hatching all the time. That's what the hum noise was that you would hear when you go in there so. BLOCK: You could hear the mosquitoes in the webs? Ms. GARDE: That was the second thing that strikes you when you - when we first came to this web and we're paying attention to it. The first thing, of course, is the big mass of web and then the next thing you notice is this loud hum. And you could actually approach this web pretty close and stand there and watch these little trapped mosquitoes. And they weren't able to get to you. They were trapped. It was terrific. Buzzing and\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) BLOCK: And terrific for the spiders, too. Ms. GARDE: Well, you know, I think maybe at the time I saw it, the spiders were probably so well fed they weren't really tearing around, you know, grabbing these mosquitoes. They were just in there, trapped and buzzing around. I mean, I'm sure eventually they've all been eaten. That's what made the web get a little browner and a little heavier, and then the wind and rain took its toll on it also. BLOCK: How many spiders would you say are responsible for these webs? (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. GARDE: Oh, that is so hard to say. I'll tell you, I measured roughly a cubic foot and I counted, and they're just a really quick count. I counted 35 spiders just in a cubic foot. So thousands, thousands - I wouldn't show up to say billions just to include that old (unintelligible). (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. GARDE: But a lot. How's that? BLOCK: There's a scientific term. Ms. GARDE: Yeah. Lot of spiders. BLOCK: And any idea what kind of spiders these are? Ms. GARDE: Yeah. The general category is the long-jawed orb-weaver is the type of spider that it is. BLOCK: A long-jawed orb-weaver. Ms. GARDE: Orb-weaver. And orb-weaver spiders are very common, but they don't typically behave in a social way. This is a social behavior. They're all grouped together in this web, working together and that isn't the way these spiders are supposed to behave. They're supposed to be solitary guys. BLOCK: Well, they're just friendly Texans. Ms. GARDE: They are. That's it. They got together and it worked. You know, so all of those mosquitoes - the group web is actually more effective in capturing them all. So maybe, you know, they just got smart quick. (Soundbite of laughter) BLOCK: Are you getting tons of visitors coming to see this curiosity? Ms. GARDE: Oh, yes, we are. It's great. Of course, there is also the other reaction that we did have. We did have one camper cancel because she was worried her dogs would be eaten by the spiders so\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. GARDE: You know, that can happen. People overreact. But so far, these spiders are proved to be quite a crowd-drawer. We're getting a lot of people in. BLOCK: Well, it sounds like a good time out there at Lake Tawakoni State Park. Ms. GARDE: Yeah. It really is. BLOCK: Donna Garde, it's great to talk with you. Thanks very much. Ms. GARDE: Thank you so much, Melissa. BLOCK: Donna Garde is the superintendent at Lake Tawakoni State Park in North Texas. You can see those huge spider webs for yourself at npr. org.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  A huge, elaborate network of spider webs at a Texas state park is mystifying scientists. So far, there's been no writing in the webs, no letters spelling out some pig or radiant that Charlotte herself might look at the masses of draping webs and say, wow. At Lake Tawakoni State Park, several hundred yards along a nature trail have been taken over the elaborate arachnid construction, web stretching from tree to tree and down to the ground.  Donna Garde is the superintendent of the park, about 50 miles from Dallas.  And Donna Garde, how do those webs look today?  Ms. DONNA GARDE (Superintendent, Lake Tawakoni State Park, Texas): Well, they're a little drippy and creepy-looking actually. We had some rain that knocked them down, so there's no more fairyland spider webs. It's a little creepier now.  BLOCK: Creepier?  Ms. GARDE: Yeah, it is. There would be a darker, scary movie now instead of just a fantasy scary movie.  BLOCK: Is that sort of what it's been like to go out there and look at the thing?  Ms. GARDE: It really is. It's just hard to believe that it's not manmade, fake Hollywood set. It's just so incredible. The amount of webbing is just hard to believe that these little, teeny, one-inch-long or less spiders have made all of these.  BLOCK: Give us some sense of the scale of this. I'm trying to picture 200 yards worth of spider webs.  Ms. GARDE: Spiders, I know. That's the general area. The original spider web covers about five really large posts of trees, plus, a few other trees thrown in for a good measure. So, you know, it's just a massive area, form kind of in a curved shape, so it's hard to see the whole thing at once. It sort of circles a little pond that was probably providing plenty of food with all of those little mosquitoes hatching all the time. That's what the hum noise was that you would hear when you go in there so.  BLOCK: You could hear the mosquitoes in the webs?  Ms. GARDE: That was the second thing that strikes you when you - when we first came to this web and we're paying attention to it. The first thing, of course, is the big mass of web and then the next thing you notice is this loud hum. And you could actually approach this web pretty close and stand there and watch these little trapped mosquitoes. And they weren't able to get to you. They were trapped. It was terrific. Buzzing and\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  BLOCK: And terrific for the spiders, too.  Ms. GARDE: Well, you know, I think maybe at the time I saw it, the spiders were probably so well fed they weren't really tearing around, you know, grabbing these mosquitoes. They were just in there, trapped and buzzing around. I mean, I'm sure eventually they've all been eaten. That's what made the web get a little browner and a little heavier, and then the wind and rain took its toll on it also.  BLOCK: How many spiders would you say are responsible for these webs?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. GARDE: Oh, that is so hard to say. I'll tell you, I measured roughly a cubic foot and I counted, and they're just a really quick count. I counted 35 spiders just in a cubic foot. So thousands, thousands - I wouldn't show up to say billions just to include that old (unintelligible).  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. GARDE: But a lot. How's that?  BLOCK: There's a scientific term.  Ms. GARDE: Yeah. Lot of spiders.  BLOCK: And any idea what kind of spiders these are?  Ms. GARDE: Yeah. The general category is the long-jawed orb-weaver is the type of spider that it is.  BLOCK: A long-jawed orb-weaver.  Ms. GARDE: Orb-weaver. And orb-weaver spiders are very common, but they don't typically behave in a social way. This is a social behavior. They're all grouped together in this web, working together and that isn't the way these spiders are supposed to behave. They're supposed to be solitary guys.  BLOCK: Well, they're just friendly Texans.  Ms. GARDE: They are. That's it. They got together and it worked. You know, so all of those mosquitoes - the group web is actually more effective in capturing them all. So maybe, you know, they just got smart quick.  (Soundbite of laughter)  BLOCK: Are you getting tons of visitors coming to see this curiosity?  Ms. GARDE: Oh, yes, we are. It's great. Of course, there is also the other reaction that we did have. We did have one camper cancel because she was worried her dogs would be eaten by the spiders so\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. GARDE: You know, that can happen. People overreact.

It's been a publishing sensation, on top of The New York Times bestseller list for seven months now. SMITH: Been meaning to read it. Yeah. BRAND: Okay. Well, here's a secret for you. The book is part of a multi-million dollar movement. It's called Positive Psychology, started in the '90s by people who thought psychology was just too focused on the negative, the bad things that happen in life.  Chantal Allan reports that critics worry, though, about the major funder of Positive Psychology. Supporters, though, say it works. Dr. SONJA LYUBOMIRSKY (University of California, Riverside): I'm much more of an optimist and I'm generally a happy person. CHANTAL ALLAN: Sonja Lyubomirsky has good reason to be upbeat about her work. She researches happiness. Her work at U. C. Riverside is at the forefront of Positive Psychology. It's a branch of psychology that looks at positive human traits. Dr. LYUBOMIRSKY: People who are happy turn out to be more creative, more charitable, more productive at work. They earn more money. They have better health, strong immune systems. They even live longer. ALLAN: Happiness is one of the emotions that positive psychologists study. Dr. LYUBOMIRSKY: You can argue that Freudian psychology has a focus on what has gone wrong, you know, in your childhood, in your life. And it's really a huge focus on the negative, you know, sort of what your parents did that was wrong. And positive psychology has more of a focus on the positive side of life. ALLAN: Love, joy, gratitude and optimism - all of these are being studied by positive psychologists. Some positive psychologists say the field bridges the gap between science and religion. This caught the attention of the John Templeton Foundation. It's an organization that funds studies that attempt to use science to explore spirituality. (Soundbite of DVD) Unidentified Man: For thousands of years, human beings have gazed in wonder of the world about them and asked, why are we here? ALLAN: That's a Templeton Foundation DVD. Why are we here is one of the questions the foundation tries to answer. And seven years ago, the foundation started funding Positive Psychology, even though it hadn't been the group's focus.  Templeton senior vice president Charles Harper explains why. Dr. CHARLES HARPER (John Templeton Foundation): In the history of the profession of psychology, there have been aversions to looking at religious communities or religious practices. And we have been interested to cross that boundary, to encourage psychologists to not exclude religious communities or religious practices, religious virtues, from their investigations. ALLAN: Harper says the foundation gives around $10 million a year to positive psychologists. It also granted millions more to fund a Positive Psychology center in Philadelphia. It's all too much for Jim Coyne(ph). Professor JIM COYNE (University of Pennsylvania): There are a lot of incentives now in psychology for claiming to be a positive psychologist. ALLAN: Coyne can't get any money from the Templeton Foundation because he researches the downside of Positive Psychology. He's a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's medical school. His research shows that breast cancer patients who use positive thinking strategies have difficulty accepting that they may have a terminal illness. Prof. COYNE: And I'm particularly concerned that they feel responsible for having a cancer that isn't responsive to treatment because they haven't thought the right thoughts or done the right thing. ALLAN: Coyne also worries the movement is too closely connected with religion, that there will be a push to fund studies that promote religion. After all, Templeton's founder calls himself an enthusiastic Christian and its president is an outspoken evangelical. Prof. COYNE: Now, if a drug company was coming in and buying psychology in that fashion, everybody would be outraged. But if it's merely a foundation, it's somehow okay.  ALLAN: Templeton executive Charles Harper says his foundation doesn't advocate a particular position when deciding who gets grants. But then he points to research showing religious organizations are a significant hub for volunteering, philanthropy and community. Mr. HARPER: Just looking at the American landscape, if a psychologist ignores the religious dimension of the positive, they are ignoring what a sociologist would see, it's about 50 percent of the bonds of connection in the United States. And that would be irrational for a profession to ignore. ALLAN: One psychologist who hasn't ignored it is UC Davis Professor Bob Emmons. He's received almost $1. 5 million from the Templeton Foundation. That's a big boost for his studies on positive emotions and religion. And he sees this as just the beginning. Dr. ROBERT EMMONS (University of California Davis): Twenty-five years ago we didn't even use the term happiness. And I think spirituality is at a similar position. And two decades from now it'll be very commonplace, very accepted. ALLAN: But John Shook with the Center for Inquiry doesn't want that to happen. He says positive psychology should stay in the secular realm. Mr. JOHN SHOOK (Center for Inquiry): Positive psychology is, of course, a branch of psychology which has been safely scientific, empirical and naturalistic for 100 years. And the emergence of Positive Psychology and its interest in religion is not going to change that. Psychologists have been interested in studying religious beliefs and religious phenomenon for well over 100 years going back to great luminaries like William James. ALLAN: Shook's an atheist and hopes Positive Psychology can prove that positive human traits aren't just for the religious. Mr. SHOOK: For example, it may be possible that a person can have all of the character strengths that tend to lead towards long-term happiness entirely without any supernatural beliefs whatsoever. ALLAN: But where Shook sees a collision between the scientific and the spiritual, others insist there could be collusion. For NPR News, I'm Chantal Allan.

The Boston-based Judge Rotenberg Center uses electroshock therapy to modify the behavior of its students. Kids from eight different states attend the center: many are autistic or mentally retarded, others suffer from acute emotional problems or disorders like attention deficit. Jennifer Gonnerman is a freelance reporter whose piece on the center appears in this month's Mother Jones magazine. And Greg Miller is a former teacher's assistant at the school. Welcome to you both. Ms. JENNIFER GONNERMAN (Freelance Reporter): Thank you. Mr. GREG MILLER (Former Teacher's Assistant, Judge Rotenberg Center): Thank you. CHIDEYA: So Jennifer, Rob Santana is one of the kids you profiled in your piece. He spent three years at the center and why was he there? What happened with him? Ms. GONNERMAN: Rob Santana went to this facility in 1999 when he was 13. His parents sent him there. He had been referred - his mother had been given the name of the place from a special education committee in Upstate New York. And he was a pretty troubled kid - always pretty aggressive and had been troubled since he was a baby actually when he was born, addicted to drugs, went into foster care and was adopted. His mother sent him there in the hopes that it would improve his behavior. CHIDEYA: So what exactly has happened there? I know that there have been children who have died in the center's care. Can you tell me about that? Ms. GONNERMAN: Over the years, that center has been around since the '70s. It's been around for 36 years. And six children who were in the care of the center have died, though none of those have been linked explicitly to the center's use of aversives or of shock. CHIDEYA: You yourself got shocked. Describe what it felt like. Ms. GONNERMAN: Sure. The shocks are two seconds long. I had a shock device, sort of, an electrode strapped on to my arm and in my other hand, I had a remote control. The kids wear backpacks with the shock devices and wires run down their pants and up their shirts. And then they have these electrodes locked on or attached to their arms, their legs, their torso. I pressed the button and the staff had told me that it's no more painful than a bee sting. And I have to say, two seconds never felt so long. To me, it felt less like a bee sting than being stung by a horde of wasps. CHIDEYA: Greg, how did you come to this work? Mr. MILLER: Well, I am (unintelligible) teacher certified in Massachusetts. And I wanted to try something different so I wanted to enter into the, you know, special ed and so I enrolled there as a teacher. I actually started off as a teacher's assistant and remained as a teacher's assistant. That's how I started. CHIDEYA: What exactly constitutes a reason to be shocked? And how involved were you in these treatments in addition to the other aspects of educating the kids? Mr. MILLER: I was working with mostly with the students with autism and I was - gave many electric shocks to students during my time there. The types of things, which I saw a student shocked there for are types of things such as tearing a - corner of a paper cup while they're sitting on the sofa. There's no differentiation between tearing a paper cup or tearing posters off the wall. A tear is a tear. Students, you know, blowing bubbles with their saliva or pulling arms or shirt sleeves, a lot of things that's aggression but still categorized things under aggression or other strange behaviors that aren't so severe and treat them like they are severe. CHIDEYA: Now, Jennifer, as I understand it, a good number of the high-functioning children there are black and Latino. There are students who are very difficult to teach, who are very antisocial and other ones that are higher functioning. So why do you think that is in terms of the racial demographics? Ms. GONNERMAN: You know, many of the kids who are considered so-called high functioning are actually from New York. And when I was there, I would ask them, you know, where are you from exactly in New York and they would name neighborhoods often in New York City that were among the poorest in the city, you know, places like south Bronx or northern Harlem. And I don't have a statistics on the racial breakdown or the class backgrounds of the students, but it did seem to me that they were so disproportionately poor. And I don't know if that had so much to do with this treatment facility or if it's more something that reflects on the sort of special education system in New York City that's sending a lot of kids to this place. CHIDEYA: There is certainly - there's a lot of people who will say electric shock that's barbaric, but we reached out to the Judge Rotenberg Center. They sent us a response posted to the Mother Jones blog by Matthew Israel, director of the center. And he wrote - this is quite a bit of a copy but very important to get their perspective in here. Other so-called effective treatments for severe behavior disorders that JRC has seen in the histories of newly admitted students include lobotomy, removal of teeth for severe biters, constant seclusion, constant medical restraint, and many others that experts refer to as, quote, \"more humane and effective,\" end quote, alternatives to JRC's aversive procedures. The lack of an effective alternative and the sheer cruelty of drugging a child into a near coma is why parents turn to a non-public special needs school such as the center that is especially equipped to manage and educate the student and has a proven track record of saving students from the ravages of constant heavy sedation. What do you say in response to that? Ms. GONNERMAN: You know, the history of the Judge Rotenberg Center -originally, the students who were there - nearly all of them exhibited very, very extreme types of self-abusive, self-injurious behavior, things like banging their heads or tearing their hair out or chewing on their fingers, and that was the original justification for an approach that involved pain or for eventually for the use of these two-second electric shocks. Today, the school has about 220 or 230 students and, as we mentioned earlier, a little bit more than half are what are called high functioning. These are not students who are severely autistic or mentally retarded. These are students who have things like bipolar - have been diagnosed with bipolar or attention deficit disorder. So the trouble rises when a device like the shock device, which was developed for very extreme cases of self-injurious behavior, then becomes instead a kind of routine disciplinary tool used on all different types of students. CHIDEYA: Greg, what turned you away? What made you leave? You stayed there for years. Mr. MILLER: I came to realize - just over time, I kept seeing things I disagreed with, you know, student being attacked in front of 40 other students by a staff with a knife as part of his treatment and shocked while he's in restraints and trying to keep the knife out of his face. And I saw that happen three times a week and I just - every time it happened, I just got sick and I said, hey, somebody's got to be wrong here. But, you know, I stayed there even after that was taking place because, you know, the psychologists said it was okay. The judges said it was okay. The state, of course, approved it as far as its laws and the parents approved of it, so who was I to question attacking the student, you know, staff attacking the student in front of 40 other students who are also - they were so traumatized by watching it we'd have to shock them, too. Standing up out of their seat, you know, and the reaction - we'd have to shock them for that. And it just - or throwing a tantrum(ph), or screaming just in reaction of watching their classmate get shocked and attacked, you know, with a knife by a staff yelling at him. So these scenes weighed on me and bothered me. And the last thing that kind of in helping make my final decision to leave was when I had to - a student stood up, raised his hand and asked politely to go to the bathroom, and he's a student with autism and they shocked him and I was part of that. CHIDEYA: I'm going to have - sorry to interrupt. We're going to have to leave it there. Greg Miller, former employee of the center. Jennifer Gonnerman, the reporter who wrote the article on the center for this month's Mother Jones magazine. Ms. GONNERMAN: Thanks, Farai. Mr. MILLER: Thank you.

Students, you know, blowing bubbles with their saliva or pulling arms or shirt sleeves, a lot of things that's aggression but still categorized things under aggression or other strange behaviors that aren't so severe and treat them like they are severe.  CHIDEYA: Now, Jennifer, as I understand it, a good number of the high-functioning children there are black and Latino. There are students who are very difficult to teach, who are very antisocial and other ones that are higher functioning. So why do you think that is in terms of the racial demographics?  Ms. GONNERMAN: You know, many of the kids who are considered so-called high functioning are actually from New York. And when I was there, I would ask them, you know, where are you from exactly in New York and they would name neighborhoods often in New York City that were among the poorest in the city, you know, places like south Bronx or northern Harlem. And I don't have a statistics on the racial breakdown or the class backgrounds of the students, but it did seem to me that they were so disproportionately poor. And I don't know if that had so much to do with this treatment facility or if it's more something that reflects on the sort of special education system in New York City that's sending a lot of kids to this place.  CHIDEYA: There is certainly - there's a lot of people who will say electric shock that's barbaric, but we reached out to the Judge Rotenberg Center. They sent us a response posted to the Mother Jones blog by Matthew Israel, director of the center. And he wrote - this is quite a bit of a copy but very important to get their perspective in here.  Other so-called effective treatments for severe behavior disorders that JRC has seen in the histories of newly admitted students include lobotomy, removal of teeth for severe biters, constant seclusion, constant medical restraint, and many others that experts refer to as, quote, \"more humane and effective,\" end quote, alternatives to JRC's aversive procedures. The lack of an effective alternative and the sheer cruelty of drugging a child into a near coma is why parents turn to a non-public special needs school such as the center that is especially equipped to manage and educate the student and has a proven track record of saving students from the ravages of constant heavy sedation.  What do you say in response to that?  Ms. GONNERMAN: You know, the history of the Judge Rotenberg Center -originally, the students who were there - nearly all of them exhibited very, very extreme types of self-abusive, self-injurious behavior, things like banging their heads or tearing their hair out or chewing on their fingers, and that was the original justification for an approach that involved pain or for eventually for the use of these two-second electric shocks.  Today, the school has about 220 or 230 students and, as we mentioned earlier, a little bit more than half are what are called high functioning. These are not students who are severely autistic or mentally retarded. These are students who have things like bipolar - have been diagnosed with bipolar or attention deficit disorder. So the trouble rises when a device like the shock device, which was developed for very extreme cases of self-injurious behavior, then becomes instead a kind of routine disciplinary tool used on all different types of students.  CHIDEYA: Greg, what turned you away? What made you leave? You stayed there for years.  Mr. MILLER: I came to realize - just over time, I kept seeing things I disagreed with, you know, student being attacked in front of 40 other students by a staff with a knife as part of his treatment and shocked while he's in restraints and trying to keep the knife out of his face. And I saw that happen three times a week and I just - every time it happened, I just got sick and I said, hey, somebody's got to be wrong here.  But, you know, I stayed there even after that was taking place because, you know, the psychologists said it was okay. The judges said it was okay. The state, of course, approved it as far as its laws and the parents approved of it, so who was I to question attacking the student, you know, staff attacking the student in front of 40 other students who are also - they were so traumatized by watching it we'd have to shock them, too. Standing up out of their seat, you know, and the reaction - we'd have to shock them for that. And it just - or throwing a tantrum(ph), or screaming just in reaction of watching their classmate get shocked and attacked, you know, with a knife by a staff yelling at him.  So these scenes weighed on me and bothered me. And the last thing that kind of in helping make my final decision to leave was when I had to - a student stood up, raised his hand and asked politely to go to the bathroom, and he's a student with autism and they shocked him and I was part of that.  CHIDEYA: I'm going to have - sorry to interrupt. We're going to have to leave it there. Greg Miller, former employee of the center. Jennifer Gonnerman, the reporter who wrote the article on the center for this month's Mother Jones magazine.  Ms. GONNERMAN: Thanks, Farai.  Mr. MILLER: Thank you.

In Britain, there has been fierce opposition from some church and ethics groups to the idea of creating hybrid human animal embryos. But today, British regulators still decided - at least in principle - to allow it. The embryos would be used for research into degenerative diseases. NPR's Rob Gifford is in London. ROB GIFFORD: Two teams of British scientists had applied to Britain's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority or H. F. E. A. They wanted permission to create what are known in Britain as cytoplastic hybrids, or cybrids, in order to overcome a shortage of donated human eggs. The process involves injecting human DNA into an animal egg cell from which the nucleus has been removed. Researchers hope to use the hybrid embryos, which must be destroyed after 14 days to create stem cells, which can then be used to help find new medical treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Lou Gherig's disease. The chief executive of the HFEA, Angela McNabb, says the legal and ethical pros and cons were weighed very carefully. Ms. ANGELA McNABB (Chief Executive, Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority): We've been able to weigh the results and take what's very strong decision where we're saying we can move forward with cytoplasmic hybrid embryos and the creation of those in some research, so we can gain the potential benefits, but only in the framework of very strong regulation. GIFFORD: Scientists have said they understand that the idea of the process, which will create a hybrid embryo that is 99. 9 percent human and 0. 1 percent animal, might be shocking to some people. But Dr. Stephen Minger of King's College London said the public should not be too alarmed. Dr. STEPHEN MINGER (Stem Cell Expert, King's College London): What we do when we take an animal egg is we remove the nucleus from the egg. We remove not only the genetic identity but we remove the species identity. What makes a cow egg a cow is its nuclear DNA. And we take that out \u2014 it's no longer a cow. GIFFORD: The regulators' consultation included an opinion poll of more than 2,000 British people. The survey found people supported the creation of the kind of hybrid embryos proposed by the two research teams \u2014 but only when they were given a reason for the experiments. Sixty-one percent of those asked gave their backing if the hybrids would help understand some diseases. That support fell to 35 percent if the hybrids were being created purely for nonspecific research. But Dr. Helen Watt, a medical ethicist at the Catholic organization called the Linacre Centre for Healthcare Ethics, told the BBC the move is wrong and immoral. Dr. HELEN WATT (Director, Linacre Center for Healthcare Ethics): If we're looking at a model for studying disease, these embryos will be highly abnormal. There's a limit to how much we're going to be able to learn from embryos containing animal material in this way. In any case, there are ways of doing science that respects both human life and human dignity. In these experiments, we not only risk creating a genuine human embryo who has no human parents and who has a nonhuman partial mother, but we also offend against human dignity by entering into animal reproduction. GIFFORD: The HFEA deferred a decision on other types of human-animal embryos, such as what are known as true hybrids created by the fusion of a human sperm and an animal egg and so-called human chimeras, where human cells are injected into animal embryos whose cells still contain animal nuclei. They said there was no evidence that British scientists are, at present, considering using such hybrids in their research. Rob Gifford, NPR News, London.

I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. Out in the wild, as animals get old, they just fade away - more or less - if they don't get eaten. But in zoos, it's a different story. Living in captivity without fear of predators, many animals are around so long that they develop humanlike problems: arthritis, backaches, poor vision. As NPR's Ted Robbins reports, one zoo in Arizona is taking pains to make its senior citizens comfortable. TED ROBBINS: Seven-year-old Samantha Kaiser(ph) thinks she knows what a zoo does with an aging animal. Ms. SAMANTHA KAISER: I think when it gets too old, they just keep it until it's dead. ROBBINS: Of course, like most visitors to zoos - in this case, the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum - she has no idea how old is too old for an animal. And you sure can't tell much just by looking at the two snoozing black bears in front of us. They could be 5, 10 or 20 years old. They are, in fact, an elderly 22. Once they get up and move around, that's a little more obvious. Mr. CRAIG IVANYI (Head Curator, Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum): As bears age, then they start having the same problems we do as we get older: difficulty in negotiating steep terrains, steps, things like that. ROBBINS: That's Craig Ivanyi, the Desert Museum's head curator. The bear's habitat looks like the mountains where wild bears live. It has lots of steep terrain. But these days, the bears mostly stay on the upper ledge just outside their den. Like seniors living in a three-story house, they need to downsize. So the Desert Museum is building a sort of bear retirement village. The crew pours concrete for a gentle slope leading from an air-conditioned den. Shawnee Riplog-Peterson is the mammal curator here. Ms. SHAWNEE RIPLOG-PETERSON (Mammal Curator, Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum): It's a nice flat area that will be very, very shady for them along with a nice pool that they can easily go in and soak in and get completely out of. ROBBINS: Meanwhile, the Desert Museum will remodel the old habitat to make it more generationally friendly for future animals. If you think about it, in a way, a zoo has it tougher than a human retirement home. It has lots of different species, each of which has different needs at different ages. The venomous animal area, that's where we're entering? Mr. IVANYI: Yup. (Soundbite of rattlesnakes rattling) ROBBINS: We're in a room full of rattlesnakes, each in its own locked container. When people aren't here, the rattlers are silent, which is a good thing since there are other kinds of snakes here including a very quiet, very old king snake. It hatched at the museum 18 years ago and spent most of its life on display. But now, people tapping on glass or snapping flash photos would be too stressful. That's why it was moved here. Plus, even though the king snake is aging normally, it no longer looked so great. Mr. IVANYI: It's very, very thin, okay? So this is an animal that if the public were to look at that, they would constantly question, why do you have this animal that looks like it's emaciated. And it's because just like us, as we get older and we have a harder time keeping body mass where we want it to be, things kind of sag, same things happen to toads, snakes, et cetera. ROBBINS: A few aging animals need no elder care at all. Take prairie dogs. They live in colonies. The Desert Museum has one. Craig Ivanyi says when a prairie dog nears the end of its life - maybe seven years in captivity - the other prairie dogs take care of it. Mr. IVANYI: They have a specific way that they actually deal with animals as they die. And so our enclosure, they can actually go and do what they normally do in nature and take an animal that has died and burry it underground and wall it off. And so you'll go from seeing an animal to suddenly it's no longer seen. ROBBINS: The Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum has what it calls a cradle-to-grave policy toward its animals. It's a policy all members of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums are supposed to follow. And it's quite a commitment since caring for large mammals, like bears, is expensive. It would be easier to euthanize them, but Craig Ivanyi says as long as their quality of life is good, zoos have a moral obligation to care for their elderly animals. Mr. IVANYI: We owe it to them after they've basically dedicated their lives to us in service of their species conservation to be able to bring them down here and then be able to still continue their lives. ROBBINS: There is no Medicare in zoos, no HMOs, at least not for the animals. Places like the Desert Museum rely largely on donors for the money to allow animals like bears to relax by the pool in their golden years. Ted Robbins, NPR News, Tucson.

If the panel recommends its approval, the new drug would expand options for people infected with HIV who have become resistant to current medications. NPR's Brenda Wilson reports. BRENDA WILSON: There are up to 30 anti-AIDS drugs now available to treat people with HIV. They all slow the virus down by attacking two main enzymes. Dr. Mark(ph) Markowitz is the clinical director at the Aaron Diamond Research Institute. He says that the new drug, raltegravir, is the first to attack another enzyme called the integrase. Dr. MARTIN MARKOWITZ, (Clinical Director, Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center): Integrase is one of the enzymes that the virus codes for that is required for the virus to make new copies of itself. And to date, there are no drugs that are currently approved to treat HIV infection that target this particular enzyme. WILSON: That means that raltegravir is the first in its class of what is called an integrase inhibitor. Dr. MARKOWITZ: What the integrase inhibitor does is binds to the enzyme and prevents the enzyme from taking the virus' genetic material and allowing it to integrate into the DNA of the host. And that's required for HIV to complete its life cycle. So if you prevent that, then the virus can't make new copies of itself. WILSON: The drug would be used in combination with current anti-retrovirals. The drug manufacturer Merck is hoping that the advisory panel of the FDA agrees that its version of raltegravir is both safe and effective and serves an important niche. Dr. MARKOWITZ: There are people who have been taking drugs for a long period of time who have virus that's resistant to some of the drugs that are currently available to treat HIV infection. So by having a new target, you can basically predict that essentially all viruses are going to be susceptible to this drug. WILSON: In all likelihood, until more it's known about raltegravir, that is how it will be used - for people who have exhausted other combinations of therapy. So far, in small studies, it appears to be as safe and effective as other drugs that are used to treat patients who have just been diagnosed. And there are indications that raltegravir may have other potential as well. When compared with some anti-AIDS drugs, it appeared to be even more effective in suppressing the virus. Dr. Ken Mayer is a professor of medicine and community health involved in AIDS research at Brown University. Dr. KEN MAYER (Professor, Brown University): Just like in the old days, when we didn't know whether adding a third drug would make a big difference - and we found out it really did - only time will tell how much of a breakthrough this may be. WILSON: Perhaps, he says, if the virus is attacked at the earliest stage of infection, using combinations of drugs that attack a variety of targets, the progression of the virus could be dramatically altered, eradicated even. And there are studies looking into different approaches to HIV therapy using the new drugs. Mayer spends a lot of time working in developing countries. This new drug serves once again as a reminder to him of the discrepancies in HIV care between rich and poor countries when older, so-called first-line treatments begin to fail. Dr. MAYER: There are now several million people now on anti-retroviral therapy but they're on first-line for the most part. So I think this does heighten the need to think about how to get cheaper second-line and third-line drugs available. WILSON: Raltegravir is just another in a series of new, costly anti-AIDS drugs, and there are others on the way that provide new mechanisms for attacking an old virus, a virus of many parts. Brenda Wilson, NPR News.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host:  A panel of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration meets today to review a new kind of anti-AIDS drug. If the panel recommends its approval, the new drug would expand options for people infected with HIV who have become resistant to current medications.  NPR's Brenda Wilson reports.  BRENDA WILSON: There are up to 30 anti-AIDS drugs now available to treat people with HIV. They all slow the virus down by attacking two main enzymes.  Dr. Mark(ph) Markowitz is the clinical director at the Aaron Diamond Research Institute. He says that the new drug, raltegravir, is the first to attack another enzyme called the integrase.  Dr. MARTIN MARKOWITZ, (Clinical Director, Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center): Integrase is one of the enzymes that the virus codes for that is required for the virus to make new copies of itself. And to date, there are no drugs that are currently approved to treat HIV infection that target this particular enzyme.  WILSON: That means that raltegravir is the first in its class of what is called an integrase inhibitor.  Dr. MARKOWITZ: What the integrase inhibitor does is binds to the enzyme and prevents the enzyme from taking the virus' genetic material and allowing it to integrate into the DNA of the host. And that's required for HIV to complete its life cycle. So if you prevent that, then the virus can't make new copies of itself.  WILSON: The drug would be used in combination with current anti-retrovirals. The drug manufacturer Merck is hoping that the advisory panel of the FDA agrees that its version of raltegravir is both safe and effective and serves an important niche.  Dr. MARKOWITZ: There are people who have been taking drugs for a long period of time who have virus that's resistant to some of the drugs that are currently available to treat HIV infection. So by having a new target, you can basically predict that essentially all viruses are going to be susceptible to this drug.  WILSON: In all likelihood, until more it's known about raltegravir, that is how it will be used - for people who have exhausted other combinations of therapy. So far, in small studies, it appears to be as safe and effective as other drugs that are used to treat patients who have just been diagnosed. And there are indications that raltegravir may have other potential as well. When compared with some anti-AIDS drugs, it appeared to be even more effective in suppressing the virus.  Dr. Ken Mayer is a professor of medicine and community health involved in AIDS research at Brown University.  Dr. KEN MAYER (Professor, Brown University): Just like in the old days, when we didn't know whether adding a third drug would make a big difference - and we found out it really did - only time will tell how much of a breakthrough this may be.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Checking, double-checking and second-guessing - all of us do it. But millions of us take our anxieties to extremes - obsessing about an unlocked door, dirty hands, a properly made bed, and then rechecking again and again. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is when the walls of reason and function crumble, when we listen to intrusive thoughts that compel us to repeat seemingly mundane actions that we're unable to stop. On one end of the continuum, OCD can seem quirky, eccentric or annoying. At the other, it can be crippling. Today, our main focus is the diagnosis, treatment and living with OCD. Later in the hour, word up, the creator and the star of PBS' \"WordGirl\" joins us. But first, OCD. If you're living with it, what's it like for you? Do other people understand? Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. E-mail is talk@npr. org and you could join the conversation on our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation. KCBS anchorman Jeff Bell chronicles his experiences with OCD in a memoir titled \"Rewind, Replay, Repeat. \" He joins us from KCBS Radio in San Francisco. Nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION today. Mr. JEFF BELL (Anchorman, KCBS Radio; Author, \"Rewind, Replay, Repeat\"): Thanks so much for having me, Neal. CONAN: And, Jeff, you used to be a reporter there and I wonder how did your OCD affect you and your ability to do your job? Mr. BELL: Oh, man, it's a long, long list. One of the biggest challenges for me as an OCD checker with harm obsessions - meaning, I'm concerned about harming other people through my negligence, unknowingly - is driving. A classic OCD-harming, obsession compulsion cycle - for somebody with these harming obsessions - would be driving along and you hit a pothole with your car. We've all done it. It rattles the car. We think to ourselves, I hit a pothole. You drive on a little bit farther and you start thinking to yourself, well, are you sure that was a pothole you hit and not somebody you ran over in the street? Well, as an OCD checker, my natural compulsion is to double the car back and verify for myself that there is, in fact, a pothole in the road. You would think that that might solve the problem. I would drive off and then wonder to myself if perhaps the body bounced to the side of the road and have to go back again and again and again - endless loops. So that's a very classic OCD pattern for somebody with this particular pattern. CONAN: Mm-hmm. Mr. BELL: As and\u2026 CONAN: I was just going to say, there was another moment in your book where you describe your daughter's had given you a friendship bracelet and you were standing on the edge of a pool, terrified that if you jump into the pool, the colors would run and you would hurt other - the dyes would hurt other people in the pool. And you stood there frozen. Can you describe what's going through your mind at a moment like that? Mr. BELL: Yeah. In that particular case, Neal, I was concerned that somehow, the dye from this friendship bracelet that my daughter had made me would get in the pool and somehow contaminate the pool and harm other people. Again, that root obsession for me - always about harming other people. So what if that dye contaminates the pool, other people get in that pool and are harmed through my negligence? And uninterestingly, those of us who battled this disorder are acutely and painfully aware of just how ridiculous a notion like that might be. You would ask about how this impacted my work life, for example. With that driving issue - as you can imagine in someone in the business that you are in, as a field reporter, I was paid to get to the scene of a crime or a breaking news story. And in an efficient manner, I'll report back to the station and heads to our listeners what's going on. But in our KCBS news van, I spent so much time driving the car in circles, checking those potholes over and over again. That ultimately, out of necessity, I got into this pattern of taking the news car out of our KCBS garage here in San Francisco, parking it around the corner and ultimately taking a taxicab out to breaking news stories because it was the only way I could get there in an efficient manner. CONAN: And what happens if the taxicab hits a pothole? Mr. BELL: Well, that's okay because I'm not necessarily responsible for that. I mean, I'd like to tell you it's all about this great concern I have for humanity. But one of the things that therapy with all of these has helped me learned over the years is that, no, really I'm protecting myself from the obsessive thoughts because they're so uncomfortable. CONAN: Hmm. Is there a shame connected with OCD? Mr. BELL: Lots of shame. I spent so many years covering up who I was with this OCD. I spent thousands of dollars out of my own pocket to avoid leaving a paper trail in the health care system. I would literally park my car blocks away from a therapist's office and sneak through alleys to get to and from the office because I was so embarrassed by what I was doing with these obsessions and compulsions, embarrassed even by the whole notion of being in therapy. I mean, that's a whole other issue in terms of the stigma surrounding mental illness. If you had told me all those years back that I would be sharing my story in this book and talking with you and people across the country about this, I would have never believed you. There were probably a half-dozen people in my entire world who had any clue what was going on. CONAN: Hmm. And those very few people, did they keep your secret? Mr. BELL: They did. They did, in fact. And primarily because they were family members\u2026 CONAN: So you had stuff on them? Mr. BELL: I had stuff on them, absolutely. You know, it's interesting, prior to about five months ago - I guess it is now - that when the book came out, nobody that I worked with - I mean, some of them for decades, had any clue about what was going on. I was a very, very good liar, very good at covering my tracks. So you know, when I couldn't drive somebody to the company party, there was always an excuse. When I had to disappear from the studio before a guest came in, to go scrub my hands, there was always an excuse. I got very good. I was very resourceful. CONAN: Hmm. Let's get some callers into this conversation. 800-989-8255. E-mail is talk@npr. org. Our guest, with a great pipes, is Jeff Bell, who's the afternoon co-anchor at KCBS and author of \"Rewind, Replay, Repeat: A memoir of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. \" And why don't we start with Jay(ph). Jay is with us from Dayton, Ohio. JAY (Caller): Good afternoon, Neal. Thank you so much for your show. I'm truly enjoying you. CONAN: Well, thank you. JAY: Absolutely. You know, everything that I've experienced in my life with OCD has just been echoed by your guest. CONAN: And what is your particular compulsion? Or is there one particular one? JAY: Well, there's a few. The one that's sort of manifest itself, for me, is hand washing. CONAN: Mm-hmm. JAY: I grew up with a mother who was in the dental field and so she was a compulsive hand washer as well. And so I find myself washing my hands, many, many times a day. And for many years, I thought, well, you know, that's just cleanliness. But it wasn't until college that I met somebody who also shared the great secret that we actually spoke about it and it was almost like a moment of - I'd really truly found a friend or somebody who would understand that I didn't - I don't - he had the compulsion to turn around, you know, bump checking, you know, to make sure. And so many times I would - it was so frustrating for me to see him go through that because I knew exactly what it felt like. And in many times, I would support him and go, like, let's go back and take a look, so that you can prove that no, you didn't injure someone. CONAN: And, Jeff Bell, I have to say a part of your therapy that that seems to have helped a lot is your association with somebody else with OCD. Mr. BELL: Absolutely. As I described in the book, I befriended a wonderful woman in her 70s, who had very different patterns from my own. But we were able to talk through a lot what was going on and that's helpful to get that layer of perspective. Interestingly, what Jay is talking about in terms of his own patterns and those of his friend who had the bump checking, all obsessive-compulsives have what I call a root obsession and a series of compulsions that have developed around. Now these could be very, very different on the surface. There are washers. There are checkers. There are repeaters and horders and orderers. And these things seemed very different in their manifestations, and they are at that layer. But when you break it down, it's all about the same cycle. It's always about some horrific what-if thought. What if I get germs on someone? What if I give someone germs? What if something happens through my negligence? And the compulsions are simply these rituals, these nonsensical, repetitive actions that we as OCs developed, trying to dislodge these thoughts that are biochemically stuck in our brains. It's the classic dog-chasing-its-own-tail. It doesn't work but because they feel good for the moment, we reinforce that cycle over and over again. CONAN: Jay, good luck with your problems. JAY: Absolutely. And thanks for the show, and truly, you're the greatest. Thank you. CONAN: Welcome. Thanks very much. Also with us is Dr. Wayne Goodman, director of the Division of Adult Translational Research and Treatment Development at the National Institute of Mental Health, and he's been kind enough to join us here in Studio 3A today. Thanks very much, Dr. Goodman. Dr. WAYNE GOODMAN (Director, National Institute of Mental Health, Division of Adult Translational Research and Treatment Development): Thank you very much. CONAN: And I was just wondering what you made of Jeff Bell's analysis of the condition there? Dr. GOODMAN: I couldn't do a better job. It's a classic description of a case of OCD. I generally do not like to make a diagnosis over the phone, but I would have to agree based upon what I heard that he's definitely has OCD and he has tremendous insight into it. CONAN: Mm-hmm. Living with it, your patients have to cope with it, too. This is not so easy. The kinds of problems Jeff Bell has had in his life, well, they're not uncommon. Dr. GOODMAN: They're not uncommon. Often, we see OCD represented in somewhat frivolous fashion and it's something that often we laugh at. But in many cases, it is crippling. One of the features, which Jeff described is that you try everything you can to camouflage your behaviors, keep it from others, and that itself occupies a great deal of time. CONAN: It can be exhausting, yeah. Dr. GOODMAN: So it's a cost in time, it interferes with functioning. It can be a very devastating condition. CONAN: Jeff Bell, I wanted to ask you. Probably, the person with OCD that most of us know or think we know is the fictional detective Adrian Monk, who lives in your town of San Francisco - think fictionally. Do you watch the show? Mr. BELL: I do watch the show and I have to tell you, Neal, I probably get that question more than any, when I'm out and about talking about the book these days. And I think a lot of folks were surprised to hear that I actually enjoy the show. I mean, there are holes. I think that the consistency could be a little bit better in terms of how they handle some of his challenges. Sometimes, he can face something. Sometimes, he can't. But the whole notion of being able to laugh together at the absurdity of all this is okay by me. In fact, recovering my lost sense of humor has been a big part of my own recovery because it allows us to step back and see what's going on, to understand that this is a biochemical, biological disorder, and that these thoughts aren't real despite the incredible realness of the feelings surrounding them, which drive the compulsions. But I think it's fine for us to be able to, you know, look at something like Monk as a starting point for discussion. I wish the producers spent a little more time focusing on Monk's agony in addition to the, you know, the absurdity of it all because you get glimpses of that. One of the hallmarks of OCD is that those of us who suffer from this get no pleasure out of it. You know, unlike somebody who might, you know, get great pleasure from doing various, quote, unquote, \"compulsions,\" if you have OCD, you're not enjoying getting stuck at the sink, scrubbing your hands. CONAN: All right. We're going to take a break. Jeff Bell, stay with us, also, Dr. Wayne Goodman. If you like to join the conversation, again, our phone number is 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. E-mail us talk@npr. org. I'm Neal Conan. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. A little later, we'll talk with the newest superhero, a fifth grader with a vivid vocabulary. It's WordGirl. We'll get to that in a bit. Right now, though, we are talking about obsessive-compulsive disorder and what it's like to live with OCD. If you're living it, what is life like for you? Do other people understand? 800-989-8255, e-mail: talk@npr. org. Our guests are, Jeff Bell, he is a co-anchor at KCBS radio and author of \"Rewind, Replay, Repeat: A Memoir of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\"; also with us is Dr. Wayne Goodman, director of the Division of Adult Translational Research and Treatment Development at the National Institute of Mental Health. And let's see if can get another caller on the line. And this is Laura(ph), Laura's with us from Myrtle Beach in South Carolina. LAURA (Caller): Hi. How are you today? CONAN: Well, thank you. LAURA: My husband suffers from OCD and isn't happy for it. I, first of all, want to thank you for referring to it as a mental illness. That is what it is. Very difficult for anyone to live with themselves or the people around them; it's very difficult for us as family members or friends. I wonder if there are other options besides therapy. He has a problem getting from point A to point B. Instead of taking 10 minutes, he can take three hours and 47 minutes. Picking weeds is a great compulsion. Internet buying was a great compulsion - he works very hard on it. But I wonder if there are other options for him and if there are other resources out there for me as a family member who lives with it. CONAN: Dr. Goodman? Dr. GOODMAN: Well, so far, you haven't described anything that I would clearly say tells me he has OCD. There's some controversy about whether a compulsive buying or even compulsive gambling is OCD. I tend to think it isn't. What other symptoms does he have that makes you think he has OCD? LAURA: Picking weeds. He can be on his way to the lawnmower and start picking weeds, and this is a constant that even the neighbors notice. And it'll take him hours to get to the lawnmower because he got busy bending over and picking weeds that hardly exist. CONAN: Anything else in the house? LAURA: Many projects started and unfinished over the course of the last eight years. He'll leave one little corner of a floor undone and move on to the next project. Mr. BELL: I'm not absolutely certain that's OCD. As I indicated earlier, I'm a little loath to make a diagnosis over the phone, one way or the other. But in general, in terms of treatment, there are various options. Principally, medications or form of therapy called behavior therapy. Has he tried either? LAURA: He has a psychologist that he sees very regularly and it's just a one-on-one. I don't know if other people involved in it, group-tried(ph) things with being a better help for him. CONAN: Well, we wish you the very best, Laura. It's a difficult problem. LAURA: Thank you. CONAN: All right. I wonder, Jeff Bell, illustratively, what worked for you? Mr. BELL: Well, I tell you, it's been a combination of a lot of things. But, as I think Dr. Goodman would agree, the real science these days in terms of OCD treatment is something called exposure response prevention, and it's pretty much it what it sounds like. It's exposing an obsessive-compulsive to his or her worst fears, worst obsessions, and then learning to desensitize around those fears in terms of not acting onto compulsions, to sit with the fear. It's a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy. I have found, in my own circuitous path through the mental health field, if you will, that it was really the only thing that work clinically for me. I was misdiagnosed twice. I'm not a big fan of traditional talk therapy for dealing with OCD. I know that there are some who, you know, find that there is a place for this in terms of talking about root issues. But when it comes right down to it, we're talking about a biological, biochemical disorder, and really, it is about retraining the brain. It's hard work - the ERP, exposure response prevention - really, really hard work. And much of my own process in terms of the recovery was learning to reframe the whole thing. I call it my greater-good framework, if you will, which was learning to reframe the need for confronting these particular fears and starting to retrain my brain because of the level of discomfort. CONAN: And are you on any medication? Mr. BELL: I am. I take a low dosage of Zoloft. I have found that over the years, that the medication - you cannot turn down the intensity or the volume of the thoughts if you will. The caveat I always put out there - and again, I'm not a medical expert. I'm just a guy who's been through this. But from where I sit, I think that medication alone can be problematic because really, what the ERP and the broader cognitive-behavioral therapy that I went through offered me was a set of life skills, coping skills, you know, the idea that I could learn to live with the obsessions and reduce the compulsions. And so I'm afraid that medication alone would prevent you from getting those skills that ultimately, I think, any obsessive-compulsive needs to learn. CONAN: And finally, Jeff Bell, before we let you go, you've talked about the agony and the shame and the difficulties that this has caused in your life, and all of us can see big, big, big downsides. Was there any upside at all? Mr. BELL: Well, you know, it's interesting, and that's another great question in that OCD certainly can have its \"benefits,\" if you will -I put benefits in quotes here - in that it certainly allows you to hyperfocus on things, you know, and people will say, well, isn't good that you're a perfectionist? In my line of work, I am paid, you know, to do stories as part of my job. So I put on, you know, a 60-second story. I like to joke that my stories are the best fact-checked stories at America. I mean, I have come through that script over and over again. On the surface, that would seem good. I mean, it would seem like I am serving my employer very well and serving my journalistic whatevers by checking the story. But here's the thing, Neal. If I get so sidetracked in checking that story - and I've been there many times. If I get so sidetracked on it, I can't get the story on the air, so it's no good to anybody. So, that again gets back to what I have been playing with over the years, and I write about, is this whole greater good notion where you have to accept that, yeah, you might get something wrong in that story. But in the greater good of it all, you have to accept that discomfort and save yourself, I'm at least going to get the story on the air. CONAN: Jeff Bell, thanks very much for your time today. We appreciate it. Mr. BELL: Thanks for having me, Neal. It's was a pleasure. CONAN: Jeff Bell, author of \"Rewind, Replay, Repeat: A Memoir of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,\" and he joined us today from KCBS Radio, where he's the afternoon anchor in San Francisco. Still with us, of course, is Dr. Wayne Goodman. And let's see if we can get some more callers on the line. And why don't we go to Francesca(ph), Francesca with us from San Jose in California. FRANCESCA (Caller): Hi. I'm actually calling about my daughter who's five and a half. I don't know if this diagnosis actually applies to children. She's had a ticking issue for about a year and it's manifested in different ways. She also occasionally has told me that she has thoughts that or thoughts that bother her that she can't get out of her head. CONAN: Mm-hmm. And when you say ticking behavior, what does that mean? FRANCESCA: Ticking, where she wants to - she had started with kind of grunting. I would think that the doctor might be familiar with that. CONAN: That - because isn't this sometimes associated with Tourette's syndrome? Dr. GOODMAN: Yeah. Yes, it is. Absolutely. FRANCESCA: I think - perhaps, which - I think I read was one type of OCD. So my concern is do we - I also read that its - this can occur in 10 to 20 percent of pre-school age kids, that it's fairly common and that it can work itself out over time. Dr. GOODMAN: Yeah, that's the good news\u2026 FRANCESCA: But I'm wondering is should - do we treat it? Do I\u2026 Dr. GOODMAN: Right. It's an excellent question. Could you - would you mind describing if she has any other ticks, like eye blinking? FRANCESCA: Yes. Eye blinking, she kind of stretches her eyes, and then just in July, she's started this next stretching, where she wants to kind of - she does this funny thing with her neck and her head. And I've often\u2026 Dr. GOODMAN: Does she have to touch any\u2026 FRANCESCA: \u2026I thought not to draw attention to it and try to - I don't to humiliate her or\u2026 Dr. GOODMAN: Absolutely. FRANCESCA: \u2026make her embarrassed or more nervous because I feel like it's a nervous issue. So - but I've asked her, do you want to stop doing that? You know, is it bothering you? And she said, well, it feels good. Dr. GOODMAN: Right. To answer your question, I think that there's enough there that I would recommend an evaluation. FRANCESCA: Mm-hmm. Dr. GOODMAN: Too soon - and certainly, I'm in no position to say whether she requires any treatment. But I would certainly go ahead with the evaluation. I certainly would wonder about a tick disorder. And as Neal mentioned, there's often a connection between tick disorders, in this case, multiple ticks, and OCD, and we tend to see that combination in childhood. And maybe that will still be a passing stage. She may get over it on her own. That's certainly the news in general about ticks or even Tourette's. But I would have somebody take a look at it and see and just watch for any progression, because some sort of intervention maybe called for, may not be medications, may be some sort of behavioral\u2026 FRANCESCA: But that's what I'm reluctant to do at this - it's, young\u2026 Dr. GOODMAN: Right. So, no - I mean, most folks today treating OCD in kids will not start with medication FRANCESCA: Okay. That's good to hear. CONAN: Well, Francesca, good luck. FRANCESCA: Thank you. CONAN: Bye-bye. And we mentioned Tourette's, which is that compulsion to blurt out, sometimes, very shocking things in conversation. OCD is also connected with any - a number of other kinds of disorders, eating disorders and depression, is it not? Dr. GOODMAN: The - I'd agree with the depression that many patients, at first, seek treatment for OCD do so because they become depressed. And I don't see that as much different from anybody who suffered from a chronic medical condition who may eventually become depressed. Eating disorders, that's a much more complex story. And although the word compulsive eating or compulsive gambling, compulsive sexual activity, often conjures up a notion of OCD, I don't see them as the same. One of the reasons being, as your - as Jeff mentioned earlier in the program, that the compulsions of OCD are not pleasurable at any point in their history. CONAN: Hmm. Let's get Andrew(ph) on the line, Andrew with us from Spokane in Washington. ANDREW (Caller): Hello. CONAN: Andrew, you're on the air. Go ahead, please. ANDREW: Hi. Hi, there. Thanks for taking my call. CONAN: Sure. ANDREW: This is a little bit out of the ordinary for me because I'm not really the kind of phone-calling person. However, I have been a longtime sufferer of both bipolar and OCD. And, you know, there was a young lady on the phone earlier who seemed to be distressed that her husband was, you know, picking weeds for just, you know, outrageous amounts of time and all those types of things. In the years of marriage - I've been married for 18 years now - my wife and my family and I have determined that, yes, my compulsions are certainly there, but then if they're directed to the lawn care, the washing of the car, the taking care of the dishes and, you know, family chores, things, you know, that are good and helpful, that has been an outlet for me, and it can be joked about. You know, I mean, you have to (unintelligible) all the time - you haven't washed the car in two days or something. But it's been helpful in my relationship, was my answer to her question. CONAN: Mm-hmm. I wonder, Dr. Goodman, is that - would you recommend something like that? Dr. GOODMAN: I'd first want to know what kind of compulsions you're referring to - the nonfunctional, the non-adaptive ones, the ones that take the time and, cause the stress. ANDREW: Well, the ones that she considered to cause stress were the - where she said her husband\u2026 Dr. GOODMAN: No, I'm talking about you. ANDREW: For me, my compulsions were excessive cleanliness - taking showers four, five times a day, washing my hands, absolutely needing to stay clean. Those types of things were kind of redirected in the keeping of the yard and taking care of the household functions, and vacuuming. You know, those types of things were, over time - I mean, yeah, they were certainly compulsion to do those things, yeah, but then by directing it and being directed by my family and helping me to deal with those compulsions, it became a positive, you know, compulsion. Do you understand that? Dr. GOODMAN: I do understand. And it's fortunate you were able to do it. Most patients - most sufferers with OCD can make that transition, at least initially, without some sort of treatment intervention that reduces the symptoms first. CONAN: Well, Andrew - but thanks very much for the call, and good luck with the dishes. ANDREW: Yes. Thank you. CONAN: All right. We're talking with Dr. Wayne Goodman of the National Institute of Mental Health about OCD - what it is, what it isn't, and about living with it. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And Dr. Goodman, as I think we've seen illustrated in a couple of calls, some people think they have OCD and may not. Dr. GOODMAN: I believe you're right. And sometimes, even trained mental health professionals may make a mistake in the diagnosis, either by missing it, not asking the right questions, or perhaps getting confused with some of the terminology. So OCD is something that seems very simple. By definition, all you need to have are obsessions and compulsions, but you need a lot of experience in seeing patients with OCD to be able to know when you have a true case. CONAN: Mm-hmm. Let's talk with Jill(ph). Jill with - excuse me - Bill. Bill is with us from Akron, Ohio. BILL (Caller): Hi, Neal. Thank you for taking my call. CONAN: Sure. BILL: I have kind of a two-part question. First part is OCD is there any kind of fear - inherit this or any hereditary factor, and\u2026 CONAN: Well, why don't we take it one at the time, Bill? Is this genetic? Dr. GOODMAN: There is mounting evidence that some forms of OCD are genetic, particularly like the possible case that was described earlier where the onset is in childhood, particularly if there are also ticks involved, and you find another family member, a parent, that had OCD. So there are some clues out there and we have some candidate genes that we're looking at. And if you look at twin studies, too, you see that identical twins are much more likely to develop OCD than just fraternal twins. So there are lots of evidence pointing in that direction, but not all cases are clearly have a genetic basis. CONAN: And, Bill, your other question? BILL: The other question is, let's say, excessive arranging or preparing for something - a symptom. For example, you can't just perform a task, let's say, get dinner ready or get breakfast ready, you have to some time prior - prepare, get things kind of in a stack, and then when the time comes in, you actually perform it. Almost all with the household-chore-type activities involved preparing for the activity and then sometime later you do the activity. And also\u2026 CONAN: But, why don't we\u2026 Dr. GOODMAN: By itself, that wouldn't concern me unless it added up to several extra hours a day. If it affect - it has to be at least an hour wasted. And if that preparation is actually helping performance, I would be reluctant to call it a disorder. CONAN: There are obsessives, though, who are compelled to correct the angle of every picture they see or rearrange the books in (unintelligible). Dr. GOODMAN: Oh, yeah, to the point that it's absurd. CONAN: Yeah. Yeah. Bill\u2026 BILL: The other one I was going to toss out there is, for example, when the children are playing with their toys and when the children leave the room, then the toys get arranged in kind of an optimal way for the children to come back and start playing with them again. Dr. GOODMAN: Is that - you mean, you're arranging them and not the children? BILL: No, the children leave the room and then\u2026 CONAN: Then you arrange the toys. Dr. GOODMAN: Yeah. That urge to\u2026 BILL: Well, I don't\u2026 Dr. GOODMAN: That urge to order and arrange certainly can be a symptom of OCD. CONAN: Mm-hmm. All right. Bill, thanks very much. BILL: Thank you. CONAN: I appreciate it. And Dr. Goodman, thank you for your time today, for being with us here in the studio. Wayne Goodman is director of the Division of Adult Translational Research and Treatment Development at the National Institute of Mental Health. And he was here with us, as I mentioned, in Studio 3A.  NEAL CONAN, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  Checking, double-checking and second-guessing - all of us do it. But millions of us take our anxieties to extremes - obsessing about an unlocked door, dirty hands, a properly made bed, and then rechecking again and again.  Obsessive-compulsive disorder is when the walls of reason and function crumble, when we listen to intrusive thoughts that compel us to repeat seemingly mundane actions that we're unable to stop. On one end of the continuum, OCD can seem quirky, eccentric or annoying. At the other, it can be crippling.  Today, our main focus is the diagnosis, treatment and living with OCD. Later in the hour, word up, the creator and the star of PBS' \"WordGirl\" joins us. But first, OCD. If you're living with it, what's it like for you? Do other people understand? Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. E-mail is talk@npr. org and you could join the conversation on our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation.  KCBS anchorman Jeff Bell chronicles his experiences with OCD in a memoir titled \"Rewind, Replay, Repeat. \" He joins us from KCBS Radio in San Francisco.  Nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION today.  Mr. JEFF BELL (Anchorman, KCBS Radio; Author, \"Rewind, Replay, Repeat\"): Thanks so much for having me, Neal.  CONAN: And, Jeff, you used to be a reporter there and I wonder how did your OCD affect you and your ability to do your job?  Mr. BELL: Oh, man, it's a long, long list. One of the biggest challenges for me as an OCD checker with harm obsessions - meaning, I'm concerned about harming other people through my negligence, unknowingly - is driving. A classic OCD-harming, obsession compulsion cycle - for somebody with these harming obsessions - would be driving along and you hit a pothole with your car. We've all done it. It rattles the car. We think to ourselves, I hit a pothole. You drive on a little bit farther and you start thinking to yourself, well, are you sure that was a pothole you hit and not somebody you ran over in the street?  Well, as an OCD checker, my natural compulsion is to double the car back and verify for myself that there is, in fact, a pothole in the road. You would think that that might solve the problem. I would drive off and then wonder to myself if perhaps the body bounced to the side of the road and have to go back again and again and again - endless loops. So that's a very classic OCD pattern for somebody with this particular pattern.  CONAN: Mm-hmm.  Mr. BELL: As and\u2026  CONAN: I was just going to say, there was another moment in your book where you describe your daughter's had given you a friendship bracelet and you were standing on the edge of a pool, terrified that if you jump into the pool, the colors would run and you would hurt other - the dyes would hurt other people in the pool. And you stood there frozen. Can you describe what's going through your mind at a moment like that?  Mr. BELL: Yeah. In that particular case, Neal, I was concerned that somehow, the dye from this friendship bracelet that my daughter had made me would get in the pool and somehow contaminate the pool and harm other people. Again, that root obsession for me - always about harming other people.  So what if that dye contaminates the pool, other people get in that pool and are harmed through my negligence? And uninterestingly, those of us who battled this disorder are acutely and painfully aware of just how ridiculous a notion like that might be.  You would ask about how this impacted my work life, for example. With that driving issue - as you can imagine in someone in the business that you are in, as a field reporter, I was paid to get to the scene of a crime or a breaking news story. And in an efficient manner, I'll report back to the station and heads to our listeners what's going on. But in our KCBS news van, I spent so much time driving the car in circles, checking those potholes over and over again.  That ultimately, out of necessity, I got into this pattern of taking the news car out of our KCBS garage here in San Francisco, parking it around the corner and ultimately taking a taxicab out to breaking news stories because it was the only way I could get there in an efficient manner.  CONAN: And what happens if the taxicab hits a pothole?  Mr. BELL: Well, that's okay because I'm not necessarily responsible for that. I mean, I'd like to tell you it's all about this great concern I have for humanity. But one of the things that therapy with all of these has helped me learned over the years is that, no, really I'm protecting myself from the obsessive thoughts because they're so uncomfortable.  CONAN: Hmm. Is there a shame connected with OCD?  Mr. BELL: Lots of shame. I spent so many years covering up who I was with this OCD. I spent thousands of dollars out of my own pocket to avoid leaving a paper trail in the health care system. I would literally park my car blocks away from a therapist's office and sneak through alleys to get to and from the office because I was so embarrassed by what I was doing with these obsessions and compulsions, embarrassed even by the whole notion of being in therapy. I mean, that's a whole other issue in terms of the stigma surrounding mental illness.  If you had told me all those years back that I would be sharing my story in this book and talking with you and people across the country about this, I would have never believed you. There were probably a half-dozen people in my entire world who had any clue what was going on.  CONAN: Hmm. And those very few people, did they keep your secret?  Mr. BELL: They did. They did, in fact. And primarily because they were family members\u2026  CONAN: So you had stuff on them?  Mr. BELL: I had stuff on them, absolutely. You know, it's interesting, prior to about five months ago - I guess it is now - that when the book came out, nobody that I worked with - I mean, some of them for decades, had any clue about what was going on. I was a very, very good liar, very good at covering my tracks.  So you know, when I couldn't drive somebody to the company party, there was always an excuse. When I had to disappear from the studio before a guest came in, to go scrub my hands, there was always an excuse. I got very good. I was very resourceful.  CONAN: Hmm. Let's get some callers into this conversation. 800-989-8255. E-mail is talk@npr. org.  Our guest, with a great pipes, is Jeff Bell, who's the afternoon co-anchor at KCBS and author of \"Rewind, Replay, Repeat: A memoir of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. \"  And why don't we start with Jay(ph). Jay is with us from Dayton, Ohio.  JAY (Caller): Good afternoon, Neal. Thank you so much for your show. I'm truly enjoying you.  CONAN: Well, thank you.  JAY: Absolutely. You know, everything that I've experienced in my life with OCD has just been echoed by your guest.  CONAN: And what is your particular compulsion? Or is there one particular one?  JAY: Well, there's a few. The one that's sort of manifest itself, for me, is hand washing.  CONAN: Mm-hmm.  JAY: I grew up with a mother who was in the dental field and so she was a compulsive hand washer as well. And so I find myself washing my hands, many, many times a day. And for many years, I thought, well, you know, that's just cleanliness.  But it wasn't until college that I met somebody who also shared the great secret that we actually spoke about it and it was almost like a moment of - I'd really truly found a friend or somebody who would understand that I didn't - I don't - he had the compulsion to turn around, you know, bump checking, you know, to make sure. And so many times I would - it was so frustrating for me to see him go through that because I knew exactly what it felt like.  And in many times, I would support him and go, like, let's go back and take a look, so that you can prove that no, you didn't injure someone.  CONAN: And, Jeff Bell, I have to say a part of your therapy that that seems to have helped a lot is your association with somebody else with OCD.  Mr. BELL: Absolutely. As I described in the book, I befriended a wonderful woman in her 70s, who had very different patterns from my own. But we were able to talk through a lot what was going on and that's helpful to get that layer of perspective.  Interestingly, what Jay is talking about in terms of his own patterns and those of his friend who had the bump checking, all obsessive-compulsives have what I call a root obsession and a series of compulsions that have developed around.  Now these could be very, very different on the surface. There are washers. There are checkers. There are repeaters and horders and orderers. And these things seemed very different in their manifestations, and they are at that layer. But when you break it down, it's all about the same cycle.  It's always about some horrific what-if thought. What if I get germs on someone? What if I give someone germs? What if something happens through my negligence? And the compulsions are simply these rituals, these nonsensical, repetitive actions that we as OCs developed, trying to dislodge these thoughts that are biochemically stuck in our brains.  It's the classic dog-chasing-its-own-tail. It doesn't work but because they feel good for the moment, we reinforce that cycle over and over again.  CONAN: Jay, good luck with your problems.  JAY: Absolutely. And thanks for the show, and truly, you're the greatest. Thank you.  CONAN: Welcome. Thanks very much. Also with us is Dr. Wayne Goodman, director of the Division of Adult Translational Research and Treatment Development at the National Institute of Mental Health, and he's been kind enough to join us here in Studio 3A today. Thanks very much, Dr. Goodman.  Dr. WAYNE GOODMAN (Director, National Institute of Mental Health, Division of Adult Translational Research and Treatment Development): Thank you very much.  CONAN: And I was just wondering what you made of Jeff Bell's analysis of the condition there?  Dr. GOODMAN: I couldn't do a better job. It's a classic description of a case of OCD. I generally do not like to make a diagnosis over the phone, but I would have to agree based upon what I heard that he's definitely has OCD and he has tremendous insight into it.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. Living with it, your patients have to cope with it, too. This is not so easy. The kinds of problems Jeff Bell has had in his life, well, they're not uncommon.  Dr. GOODMAN: They're not uncommon. Often, we see OCD represented in somewhat frivolous fashion and it's something that often we laugh at. But in many cases, it is crippling. One of the features, which Jeff described is that you try everything you can to camouflage your behaviors, keep it from others, and that itself occupies a great deal of time.  CONAN: It can be exhausting, yeah.  Dr. GOODMAN: So it's a cost in time, it interferes with functioning. It can be a very devastating condition.  CONAN: Jeff Bell, I wanted to ask you. Probably, the person with OCD that most of us know or think we know is the fictional detective Adrian Monk, who lives in your town of San Francisco - think fictionally. Do you watch the show?  Mr. BELL: I do watch the show and I have to tell you, Neal, I probably get that question more than any, when I'm out and about talking about the book these days. And I think a lot of folks were surprised to hear that I actually enjoy the show. I mean, there are holes. I think that the consistency could be a little bit better in terms of how they handle some of his challenges. Sometimes, he can face something. Sometimes, he can't.  But the whole notion of being able to laugh together at the absurdity of all this is okay by me. In fact, recovering my lost sense of humor has been a big part of my own recovery because it allows us to step back and see what's going on, to understand that this is a biochemical, biological disorder, and that these thoughts aren't real despite the incredible realness of the feelings surrounding them, which drive the compulsions.  But I think it's fine for us to be able to, you know, look at something like Monk as a starting point for discussion. I wish the producers spent a little more time focusing on Monk's agony in addition to the, you know, the absurdity of it all because you get glimpses of that.  One of the hallmarks of OCD is that those of us who suffer from this get no pleasure out of it. You know, unlike somebody who might, you know, get great pleasure from doing various, quote, unquote, \"compulsions,\" if you have OCD, you're not enjoying getting stuck at the sink, scrubbing your hands.  CONAN: All right. We're going to take a break. Jeff Bell, stay with us, also, Dr. Wayne Goodman. If you like to join the conversation, again, our phone number is 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. E-mail us talk@npr. org.  I'm Neal Conan. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  A little later, we'll talk with the newest superhero, a fifth grader with a vivid vocabulary. It's WordGirl. We'll get to that in a bit.  Right now, though, we are talking about obsessive-compulsive disorder and what it's like to live with OCD. If you're living it, what is life like for you? Do other people understand? 800-989-8255, e-mail: talk@npr. org.  Our guests are, Jeff Bell, he is a co-anchor at KCBS radio and author of \"Rewind, Replay, Repeat: A Memoir of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\"; also with us is Dr. Wayne Goodman, director of the Division of Adult Translational Research and Treatment Development at the National Institute of Mental Health.  And let's see if can get another caller on the line. And this is Laura(ph), Laura's with us from Myrtle Beach in South Carolina.  LAURA (Caller): Hi. How are you today?  CONAN: Well, thank you.  LAURA: My husband suffers from OCD and isn't happy for it. I, first of all, want to thank you for referring to it as a mental illness. That is what it is. Very difficult for anyone to live with themselves or the people around them; it's very difficult for us as family members or friends.  I wonder if there are other options besides therapy. He has a problem getting from point A to point B. Instead of taking 10 minutes, he can take three hours and 47 minutes. Picking weeds is a great compulsion. Internet buying was a great compulsion - he works very hard on it. But I wonder if there are other options for him and if there are other resources out there for me as a family member who lives with it.  CONAN: Dr. Goodman?  Dr. GOODMAN: Well, so far, you haven't described anything that I would clearly say tells me he has OCD. There's some controversy about whether a compulsive buying or even compulsive gambling is OCD. I tend to think it isn't. What other symptoms does he have that makes you think he has OCD?  LAURA: Picking weeds. He can be on his way to the lawnmower and start picking weeds, and this is a constant that even the neighbors notice. And it'll take him hours to get to the lawnmower because he got busy bending over and picking weeds that hardly exist.  CONAN: Anything else in the house?  LAURA: Many projects started and unfinished over the course of the last eight years. He'll leave one little corner of a floor undone and move on to the next project.  Mr. BELL: I'm not absolutely certain that's OCD. As I indicated earlier, I'm a little loath to make a diagnosis over the phone, one way or the other. But in general, in terms of treatment, there are various options. Principally, medications or form of therapy called behavior therapy. Has he tried either?  LAURA: He has a psychologist that he sees very regularly and it's just a one-on-one. I don't know if other people involved in it, group-tried(ph) things with being a better help for him.  CONAN: Well, we wish you the very best, Laura. It's a difficult problem.  LAURA: Thank you.  CONAN: All right. I wonder, Jeff Bell, illustratively, what worked for you?  Mr. BELL: Well, I tell you, it's been a combination of a lot of things. But, as I think Dr. Goodman would agree, the real science these days in terms of OCD treatment is something called exposure response prevention, and it's pretty much it what it sounds like. It's exposing an obsessive-compulsive to his or her worst fears, worst obsessions, and then learning to desensitize around those fears in terms of not acting onto compulsions, to sit with the fear.  It's a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy. I have found, in my own circuitous path through the mental health field, if you will, that it was really the only thing that work clinically for me. I was misdiagnosed twice. I'm not a big fan of traditional talk therapy for dealing with OCD. I know that there are some who, you know, find that there is a place for this in terms of talking about root issues.  But when it comes right down to it, we're talking about a biological, biochemical disorder, and really, it is about retraining the brain. It's hard work - the ERP, exposure response prevention - really, really hard work. And much of my own process in terms of the recovery was learning to reframe the whole thing. I call it my greater-good framework, if you will, which was learning to reframe the need for confronting these particular fears and starting to retrain my brain because of the level of discomfort.  CONAN: And are you on any medication?  Mr. BELL: I am. I take a low dosage of Zoloft. I have found that over the years, that the medication - you cannot turn down the intensity or the volume of the thoughts if you will. The caveat I always put out there - and again, I'm not a medical expert. I'm just a guy who's been through this.  But from where I sit, I think that medication alone can be problematic because really, what the ERP and the broader cognitive-behavioral therapy that I went through offered me was a set of life skills, coping skills, you know, the idea that I could learn to live with the obsessions and reduce the compulsions. And so I'm afraid that medication alone would prevent you from getting those skills that ultimately, I think, any obsessive-compulsive needs to learn.  CONAN: And finally, Jeff Bell, before we let you go, you've talked about the agony and the shame and the difficulties that this has caused in your life, and all of us can see big, big, big downsides. Was there any upside at all?  Mr. BELL: Well, you know, it's interesting, and that's another great question in that OCD certainly can have its \"benefits,\" if you will -I put benefits in quotes here - in that it certainly allows you to hyperfocus on things, you know, and people will say, well, isn't good that you're a perfectionist? In my line of work, I am paid, you know, to do stories as part of my job. So I put on, you know, a 60-second story. I like to joke that my stories are the best fact-checked stories at America.  I mean, I have come through that script over and over again. On the surface, that would seem good. I mean, it would seem like I am serving my employer very well and serving my journalistic whatevers by checking the story. But here's the thing, Neal. If I get so sidetracked in checking that story - and I've been there many times. If I get so sidetracked on it, I can't get the story on the air, so it's no good to anybody.  So, that again gets back to what I have been playing with over the years, and I write about, is this whole greater good notion where you have to accept that, yeah, you might get something wrong in that story. But in the greater good of it all, you have to accept that discomfort and save yourself, I'm at least going to get the story on the air.  CONAN: Jeff Bell, thanks very much for your time today. We appreciate it.  Mr. BELL: Thanks for having me, Neal. It's was a pleasure.  CONAN: Jeff Bell, author of \"Rewind, Replay, Repeat: A Memoir of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,\" and he joined us today from KCBS Radio, where he's the afternoon anchor in San Francisco. Still with us, of course, is Dr. Wayne Goodman. And let's see if we can get some more callers on the line. And why don't we go to Francesca(ph), Francesca with us from San Jose in California.  FRANCESCA (Caller): Hi. I'm actually calling about my daughter who's five and a half. I don't know if this diagnosis actually applies to children. She's had a ticking issue for about a year and it's manifested in different ways. She also occasionally has told me that she has thoughts that or thoughts that bother her that she can't get out of her head.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. And when you say ticking behavior, what does that mean?  FRANCESCA: Ticking, where she wants to - she had started with kind of grunting. I would think that the doctor might be familiar with that.  CONAN: That - because isn't this sometimes associated with Tourette's syndrome?  Dr. GOODMAN: Yeah. Yes, it is. Absolutely.  FRANCESCA: I think - perhaps, which - I think I read was one type of OCD. So my concern is do we - I also read that its - this can occur in 10 to 20 percent of pre-school age kids, that it's fairly common and that it can work itself out over time.  Dr. GOODMAN: Yeah, that's the good news\u2026  FRANCESCA: But I'm wondering is should - do we treat it? Do I\u2026  Dr. GOODMAN: Right. It's an excellent question. Could you - would you mind describing if she has any other ticks, like eye blinking?  FRANCESCA: Yes. Eye blinking, she kind of stretches her eyes, and then just in July, she's started this next stretching, where she wants to kind of - she does this funny thing with her neck and her head. And I've often\u2026  Dr. GOODMAN: Does she have to touch any\u2026  FRANCESCA: \u2026I thought not to draw attention to it and try to - I don't to humiliate her or\u2026  Dr. GOODMAN: Absolutely.  FRANCESCA: \u2026make her embarrassed or more nervous because I feel like it's a nervous issue. So - but I've asked her, do you want to stop doing that? You know, is it bothering you? And she said, well, it feels good.  Dr. GOODMAN: Right. To answer your question, I think that there's enough there that I would recommend an evaluation.  FRANCESCA: Mm-hmm.  Dr. GOODMAN: Too soon - and certainly, I'm in no position to say whether she requires any treatment. But I would certainly go ahead with the evaluation. I certainly would wonder about a tick disorder. And as Neal mentioned, there's often a connection between tick disorders, in this case, multiple ticks, and OCD, and we tend to see that combination in childhood.  And maybe that will still be a passing stage. She may get over it on her own. That's certainly the news in general about ticks or even Tourette's. But I would have somebody take a look at it and see and just watch for any progression, because some sort of intervention maybe called for, may not be medications, may be some sort of behavioral\u2026  FRANCESCA: But that's what I'm reluctant to do at this - it's, young\u2026  Dr. GOODMAN: Right. So, no - I mean, most folks today treating OCD in kids will not start with medication  FRANCESCA: Okay. That's good to hear.  CONAN: Well, Francesca, good luck.  FRANCESCA: Thank you.  CONAN: Bye-bye.  And we mentioned Tourette's, which is that compulsion to blurt out, sometimes, very shocking things in conversation. OCD is also connected with any - a number of other kinds of disorders, eating disorders and depression, is it not?  Dr. GOODMAN: The - I'd agree with the depression that many patients, at first, seek treatment for OCD do so because they become depressed. And I don't see that as much different from anybody who suffered from a chronic medical condition who may eventually become depressed.  Eating disorders, that's a much more complex story. And although the word compulsive eating or compulsive gambling, compulsive sexual activity, often conjures up a notion of OCD, I don't see them as the same. One of the reasons being, as your - as Jeff mentioned earlier in the program, that the compulsions of OCD are not pleasurable at any point in their history.  CONAN: Hmm. Let's get Andrew(ph) on the line, Andrew with us from Spokane in Washington.  ANDREW (Caller): Hello.  CONAN: Andrew, you're on the air. Go ahead, please.  ANDREW: Hi. Hi, there. Thanks for taking my call.  CONAN: Sure.  ANDREW: This is a little bit out of the ordinary for me because I'm not really the kind of phone-calling person. However, I have been a longtime sufferer of both bipolar and OCD. And, you know, there was a young lady on the phone earlier who seemed to be distressed that her husband was, you know, picking weeds for just, you know, outrageous amounts of time and all those types of things.  In the years of marriage - I've been married for 18 years now - my wife and my family and I have determined that, yes, my compulsions are certainly there, but then if they're directed to the lawn care, the washing of the car, the taking care of the dishes and, you know, family chores, things, you know, that are good and helpful, that has been an outlet for me, and it can be joked about. You know, I mean, you have to (unintelligible) all the time - you haven't washed the car in two days or something. But it's been helpful in my relationship, was my answer to her question.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. I wonder, Dr. Goodman, is that - would you recommend something like that?  Dr. GOODMAN: I'd first want to know what kind of compulsions you're referring to - the nonfunctional, the non-adaptive ones, the ones that take the time and, cause the stress.  ANDREW: Well, the ones that she considered to cause stress were the - where she said her husband\u2026  Dr. GOODMAN: No, I'm talking about you.  ANDREW: For me, my compulsions were excessive cleanliness - taking showers four, five times a day, washing my hands, absolutely needing to stay clean. Those types of things were kind of redirected in the keeping of the yard and taking care of the household functions, and vacuuming. You know, those types of things were, over time - I mean, yeah, they were certainly compulsion to do those things, yeah, but then by directing it and being directed by my family and helping me to deal with those compulsions, it became a positive, you know, compulsion. Do you understand that?  Dr. GOODMAN: I do understand. And it's fortunate you were able to do it. Most patients - most sufferers with OCD can make that transition, at least initially, without some sort of treatment intervention that reduces the symptoms first.  CONAN: Well, Andrew - but thanks very much for the call, and good luck with the dishes.  ANDREW: Yes. Thank you.  CONAN: All right. We're talking with Dr. Wayne Goodman of the National Institute of Mental Health about OCD - what it is, what it isn't, and about living with it.  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  And Dr. Goodman, as I think we've seen illustrated in a couple of calls, some people think they have OCD and may not.  Dr. GOODMAN: I believe you're right. And sometimes, even trained mental health professionals may make a mistake in the diagnosis, either by missing it, not asking the right questions, or perhaps getting confused with some of the terminology. So OCD is something that seems very simple. By definition, all you need to have are obsessions and compulsions, but you need a lot of experience in seeing patients with OCD to be able to know when you have a true case.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. Let's talk with Jill(ph). Jill with - excuse me - Bill. Bill is with us from Akron, Ohio.  BILL (Caller): Hi, Neal. Thank you for taking my call.  CONAN: Sure.  BILL: I have kind of a two-part question. First part is OCD is there any kind of fear - inherit this or any hereditary factor, and\u2026  CONAN: Well, why don't we take it one at the time, Bill? Is this genetic?  Dr. GOODMAN: There is mounting evidence that some forms of OCD are genetic, particularly like the possible case that was described earlier where the onset is in childhood, particularly if there are also ticks involved, and you find another family member, a parent, that had OCD. So there are some clues out there and we have some candidate genes that we're looking at. And if you look at twin studies, too, you see that identical twins are much more likely to develop OCD than just fraternal twins. So there are lots of evidence pointing in that direction, but not all cases are clearly have a genetic basis.  CONAN: And, Bill, your other question?  BILL: The other question is, let's say, excessive arranging or preparing for something - a symptom. For example, you can't just perform a task, let's say, get dinner ready or get breakfast ready, you have to some time prior - prepare, get things kind of in a stack, and then when the time comes in, you actually perform it. Almost all with the household-chore-type activities involved preparing for the activity and then sometime later you do the activity. And also\u2026  CONAN: But, why don't we\u2026  Dr. GOODMAN: By itself, that wouldn't concern me unless it added up to several extra hours a day. If it affect - it has to be at least an hour wasted. And if that preparation is actually helping performance, I would be reluctant to call it a disorder.  CONAN: There are obsessives, though, who are compelled to correct the angle of every picture they see or rearrange the books in (unintelligible).  Dr. GOODMAN: Oh, yeah, to the point that it's absurd.  CONAN: Yeah. Yeah. Bill\u2026  BILL: The other one I was going to toss out there is, for example, when the children are playing with their toys and when the children leave the room, then the toys get arranged in kind of an optimal way for the children to come back and start playing with them again.  Dr. GOODMAN: Is that - you mean, you're arranging them and not the children?  BILL: No, the children leave the room and then\u2026  CONAN: Then you arrange the toys.  Dr. GOODMAN: Yeah. That urge to\u2026  BILL: Well, I don't\u2026  Dr. GOODMAN: That urge to order and arrange certainly can be a symptom of OCD.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. All right. Bill, thanks very much.  BILL: Thank you.  CONAN: I appreciate it.  And Dr. Goodman, thank you for your time today, for being with us here in the studio.  Wayne Goodman is director of the Division of Adult Translational Research and Treatment Development at the National Institute of Mental Health. And he was here with us, as I mentioned, in Studio 3A.

I mean, all of us - everybody on Earth. You know, so many times you've heard environmentalists talking about saving the world. What if they really mean it, you know? If what if they mean, well, if we have to save the world - to keep the world safe, a safe place - we humans can't be here? Because the world would seem, you know - maybe it'll go on just fine without us. At least that seems to be the message of a new book called \"The World Without Us. \" Some things like head lice or cattle might be in trouble without humans. But by and large, the world would survive and might be argued, might be better off ecologically and environmentally without us in it. Joining me now to talk about what might happen on Earth if humans were to suddenly vanish is my guest, the author of \"The World Without Us,\" Alan Weisman. He's a journalist and senior editor and producer at Homeland Productions Radio. Thanks for talking with us today, Mr. Weisman. Mr. ALAN WEISMAN (Author, \"The World Without Us\"): Thank you, Ira. Good to be here. FLATOW: What made you decide to take us off the Earth here? Mr. WEISMAN: Well, I actually don't want to take us off the Earth, but theoretically removing us from the Earth helps us solve the problem that a lot of us who write about the environment constantly confront, which is the more deeply and completely we report it, the more overwhelmed are readers or listeners sometimes feel. And sometimes, they just don't want to face it because it just seems so depressing or so scary. And I realized that if I just disarm the concern about all - are we all going to die if this, you know, if this keeps going this way. If I just kill everybody off in the beginning and then let everybody stick around to see what happens next, they might just sort of relax and enjoy it. They would think that, you know, this is kind of a fantasy. And I posed some remote possibilities how this could happen, say a Homo sapiens-specific virus just picked us off and left everything else. Let's say that AIDS were airborne rather than, you know, passed by fluids. Or a lot of people believe in the rapture may be, you know, a spiritual figure or space aliens take us away to heaven or to some place across the galaxy. But just suppose that the Earth woke up tomorrow and everything else was here intact as it is today except for us. What happens next? FLATOW: And, you know, you came up, I think, with some - initially some very surprising things that would happen, like the cockroaches would go away. Mr. WEISMAN: The cockroaches would go away from our northern cities because it turns out, I'm informed, that they depend on the heat inside buildings to get through the winter. So if people are gone, the power plants are off, the heat goes off, the cockroaches have no refuge to take and they would be cold. But in the tropics, places like Florida, they would still have to deal with cockroaches. FLATOW: And there would be a disruption in the whole chain of the food system? Mr. WEISMAN: Well definitely. The - by food system, you mean agriculture? FLATOW: Agriculture would go away and food that we eat, that we feed inadvertently to rats and other kinds of animals that depend on it. Mr. WEISMAN: Well definitely. The urban rats who live a lot on human refuge, they would be sorting for food. In fact, they would become food themselves because there would be a lot of raptors and other predators that would be populating the cities very soon and they would find hungry rats everywhere looking around in the surface for something to eat. At the same time, our agricultural fields - I trace in this book what the succession back to a natural forest environment, for example, would be in fields that have both never been fertilized before such as in New England, parts of New England, such as where I live in western Massachusetts, where farmers moved on to better soils and longer growing seasons as United States march westward, and also places that have received liberal amounts of herbicides, pesticides and chemical fertilizers over the years, forest succession would proceed differently in those cases. But in any event, a lot of those crops that we have planted, they would be gone and some of the vegetables and things that we are used to, like cauliflower and broccoli and carrots - they would revert back to wilder forms that wouldn't be very recognizable to us. Well, carrots are an interesting example because they would revert back to Queen Anne's lace, which we know is a flower, not as an edible root. FLATOW: Wow. So you'd be - we'd be turning the clock backwards. I want to talk more about this because we're talking about the food here. But you have - you will describe, when you go back in history, some interesting things to how we got to be where we are, and that's just as interesting as where we would be headed. So we're going to take a break and come back and talk not just about the disappearance of the living things but how quickly are structures, are bridges, are buildings would just disappear. It's shocking talking with Alan Weisman, author of \"The World Without Us. \" We'll take your questions. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Also, you can go visit our avatar on Second Life at Science School in Sci Land, so stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour with author Alan Weisman, author of the book \"The World Without Us. \" 1-800-989-8255. It's a book about what would happen to the Earth if all the people disappeared accidentally. And you start out with New York City, I guess, because it's a really interesting place to watch what happens when the people disappear. And you talk about how important - what happens with water when it's allowed to get into places that we have no control over anymore? Mr. WEISMAN: Well, in a previous chapter, it show how our houses are something that are certainly vulnerable to water. Anybody that has ever had a roof leak knows about that. But even our big, cemented cities, same thing happens. So in the case of New York - and I mentioned several other cities - it would actually start underneath the city, not on the roof. Subway engineers took me through the bowels of the city and showed me how the history of the city can be seen down there in the rushing water that is coming out of the ground all the time. New York used to be a hilly city. The name Manhattan refers to hills - that's an old Algonquin term Manhatta(ph). And there were forty-some streams and rivers on the surface that would, of course, drain water away to the sea. When those hills got smashed down to superimpose the grid on the city, the rivers were pushed underground. And even on a sunny day, they're pumping about 13 million gallons of ground water in a rising water table up - out of the city into the sea. If the power went off, nearly 800 pumps would go silent and the subways would flood. And then the columns that are holding up the streets would start to rust and start to corrode, and they gave, what about, two decades before they would start to collapse. And the streets would start to crater and some of that water would then become surface water once again. And at the same time, the foundations of a lot of buildings would start to become waterlogged and they would also corrode and eventually come destabilized because they were built to be standing in water. FLATOW: Then you say that eventually, our skyscrapers would be just blown over by the wind? Mr. WEISMAN: Well, a destabilized skyscraper would be very susceptible to high winds and of course, New York being a coastal city, has been hit by hurricanes before. There are some speculation that we may be seeing more hurricanes around East Coast and perhaps more powerful ones in the decades to come. And a destabilized skyscraper - we all know that skyscrapers will sway in the wind. This will - if it topples, it will probably do the same thing as a big tree does when it topples in the forest. It takes down some other trees standing around it with it. And that's actually going to be kind of good for the succession of forest in the city. New York was once completely forested, of course, and trees will be already colonizing in the streets. They'll be growing in the leaf litter that will be filling the gutters in the streets, because no one will be raking the streets and no one will be unclogging the sewers that - will probably have plastic bags stuck over the top of them. And the crumbling concrete will add lime to the soil, which will make it less acidic. So more and more plants - types of plants will be able to colonize. FLATOW: Hmm. And you also talk about how quickly, you know, New York is famous also for its majestic bridges. How quickly do bridges will crumble? Mr. WEISMAN: The bridges will not exactly crumble as they will begin to fall into the bodies of water below them, because a bridge has to be maintained all the time. That means painting it and that means clearing the debris that will gather in the expansion joints. Now, bridges, which are made out of metal usually - except for the very old ones, the stone ones - they expand and contract. And in the wintertime, the expansion joints are open, and if they fill with debris or if they fill with rust - which occupies a lot more space than metal does, they will clog and in the summer - there'll be no place for the bridge to expand. But it has to so it starts straining at the very bolts that connected to piers of concrete or connected to the bedrock on either end, on the mainland, or on Manhattan or Staten Island. And eventually, when those bolts shear off, the bridge will just start to walk around until finally, one of end it collapses. Also, steel plates that make up the bridge, if they are rusting, water will penetrate between them and that rust has to expand and will absolutely pop rivets, even rivets that are two inches long. I've seen examples of this thing. The bridge experts showed it to me. FLATOW: Wow. 1-800-989-8255. Wendy(ph) in Spring Creek, Nevada. Hi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. WENDY (Caller): I love your show. I listen to it every week. I just love it. It's great. FLATOW: Thank you. WENDY: What is going to happen to all the atomic energy plants throughout the world when this (unintelligible)? FLATOW: Good question. Mr. WEISMAN: That is a good question, and I have a whole chapter on that, Wendy. The - our atomic bombs aren't going to be much of a problem because they need repulsion that only we can provide - to slam a couple of pieces of uranium together or to implode plutonium fast enough so it will explode. And therefore, when corrosion finally exposes the radioactive materials to the elements, they will just be very radioactive. But the plants are much more of a concern to me because there's a lot more radioactive materials in them and they will\u2026 (Soundbite of phone ringing) FLATOW: You can get the phone. Mr. WEISMAN: No. I'm sorry. FLATOW: That's okay. Mr. WEISMAN: That was a different line. FLATOW: That's okay. Mr. WEISMAN: And what happens with the nuclear plant, I visit - I mean, two interesting examples. I go to Chernobyl, which, of course, has already had a bad accident, and I go to the newest one that we have in the United States, Palo Verde in Arizona. Palo Verde is very typical that if the plant suddenly were to shut down - it's human personnel we're not there - it would shut down but a fail-safe generators, diesel generators would come on to keep the water circulating around the reactors, which cools them. That diesel is only about a seven-day supply, so when that stops - if there were no human beings - the water around the reactors would start to evaporate because the reactors are very hot. And depending on how much fuel is in the reactor - cycle, it would either catch fire or it would melt down. Now, we have 441 nuclear plants in the world and many of them have multiple reactors. So those would be a lot of Chernobyls that the ecosystem would have to deal with. I mean, the present Chernobyl, of course, many of us know that the area right around the plant strangely enough has greater biodiversity than the area outside evacuated zones because there are no human beings there so the animals and plants are rushing in. FLATOW: Even being radioactive, they survived. Mr. WEISMAN: Yeah. Well, the studies are showing that their life spans - the species that have been studied - their lifespan seem to be abbreviated, and some of them may not do very well. No one really knows how the radiation will tumble, bounce(ph) regenerations and whether its effects, genetic effects, would be cumulative. The birds don't seem to be doing tremendously well. They may be very sensitive, but there's a population of voles that's being studied and it's noticed that even though they are dying younger, they are also sexually maturing younger and they are throwing off more offspring, which may be nature's way of responding to this big change in the environment, by throwing out more opportunities for some, more radiation-tolerant mutation to appear. And maybe that's the direction the lineage will go. But, you know, I really think that our nuclear plants would cause a tremendous problem. And whether we're here or not, the fact that so much of our radioactive waste is just sitting alongside them in temporary storage until we figure out what to do with it was a fact that really came home to me during the research I did all over the world for this book. FLATOW: Yeah. I'm talking with Alan Weisman, author of \"The World Without Us,\" a meticulously written book. You know, in writing the book and then reading it - a terrific read - you had to learn so much about how to build these things that eventually decay. Mr. WEISMAN: Well, that's true, Ira, and thanks for your compliment. I agree with Wendy. I'm a great fan of your show as well. The learning curve for this book was enormous but it was like, you know, a rollercoaster. I would travel to one place after another, trying to find out all sorts of different things like what happens to the sea after we're gone? What happens to our petrochemical installations? Along with nuclear plants, I also went to see chemical plants and oil refineries in that huge petroscape that we have between Houston and Galveston, which is sort of the biggest concentration in that kind of stuff on Earth. I went to former war zones. The Korean DMZ is a wonderful example of an area that had just been left fallow. And even though you got two of the world's biggest and most hostile armies facing off each other, in sight of each other, the strip in between them has become this inadvertent nature preserve, where some of the most precious endangered species in all of Asia now are sheltered. And other places - well, I saw another demilitarized zone in Cyprus where a fairly new seaside resort had been built in the early '70s, you know, it sort of looks like a riviera with hotels and big balconies along the shore. And then the war came along and it was built with Greek Cypriot money, but after the war, it ended up on the Turkish side. The Turks put a fence around it so it would be intact in a good bargaining ship when the island got down to reunification talks. But 33 years later, sadly that hasn't happened. And now all these buildings of our newest kinds of architecture, you know, reinforced concrete with steel reinforcing bar, glass and steel - these buildings are complete goners. And a lot of them are still standing but they can't be salvaged anymore. And the beach is full of not bathing human beings, but sea turtles, which is very nice. FLATOW: Wow. A thousand - two thousand years from now - whatever\u2026 Mr. WEISMAN: Mm-hmm. FLATOW: \u2026is there anything left of us to know that we were even here? Mr. WEISMAN: Oh, lots of things. FLATOW: What will stay around? I imagine the plastics will last forever. Mr. WEISMAN: Yeah. There's a whole chapter on plastics which was really one of those staggering journalistic experience is to learn amazing fact after amazing fact. Plastic isn't that old. It was invented in the beginning of the 20th century but it didn't really enter the mainstream until after World War II. And yet now, we've got more than a billion tons of the stuff. There is so much of it out there. And it turns out that much of it ends up in the ocean. Perhaps, most of it because, you know, everything eventually erodes and goes to the sea. But plastic is much lighter than rocks so it's getting there a lot faster. There are continent-sized rafts of the stuff floating around in our oceans and wave action is breaking it up. If all the plastic, except for a little bit that's been incinerated, all the plastic ever made is still there. If it breaks up in the ocean into smaller and smaller particles, if it breaks up on land, if ultraviolet hits the plastic that is UV-sensitive, it's still is there. It's just in smaller bits. And in the ocean, smaller and smaller creatures are mistaking it for something organic and they're eating it. And their systems will get clogged up if they eat too much of it or a piece that's too big for them to digest, and we don't know what the repercussions of this is going to be. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. WEISMAN: It was pretty enormous to find this out. Also, I'm assured by plastic experts that because the hydrocarbon with various other added elements to give it different kinds of properties, eventually microbes will figure out how to digest it but this could take thousands, hundred of thousands, even millions of years. And it's, you know, just like it took microbes that long to figure out how to digest the lignite and cellulose in trees - until that happened, trees didn't decay. They eventually got buried and eventually got so compressed by what buried them that they turned into coal. Well, this probably going to happen to plastic as well. FLATOW: Talking with Alan Weisman, author of \"The World Without Us\" on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Let's go to the phone for some questioning. Let's go to Malcolm(ph) in Cody, Wyoming. Hi, Malcolm. MALCOLM (Caller): Hi there. FLATOW: Hi. MALCOLM: Hi. Alan, I just saw you on \"The Daily Show\" a couple of days ago. Looks like a very fascinating book and I can't wait to read it. Mr. WEISMAN: Thank you. MALCOLM: My question was if you addressed global warming at all? If we get to a tipping point where even if we're gone, is that's going to leave an impact in the long term? I'll take my question off the air. FLATOW: Okay, thanks for calling. Mr. WEISMAN: Okay, thanks. Yeah, I had to address global warming because, you know, the future is kind of a moving target right now. We're not sure where it's going. There are several different models, and I point to a couple of different possibilities in various sections of the book of what we might expect. For example, the forest I mentioned before that will eventually cover New York City again - and we know that there's going to be a combination of native species and a combination of exotic species that we have introduced overtime into New York. But if the seas keep rising because of global warming, how much of Manhattan, for example, will be above the water? Certain parts of it, like Washington Heights for example or the hill in Central Park, probably will be. But will the foliage there, the native foliage - or will we be looking at palmettos? We'll be seeing magnolia trees coming in there. Some of the models - and Ira, I know that this has been discussed a lot in your show - indicate, you know, steadily warming temperatures. Some of them believe that we could be ushering in an ice age very quickly, particularly if cold, freshwater from Greenland inundates the ocean conveyor and suddenly shots that down or shows it down considerably. So, I looked at a few different models like this and try to speculate or - I got experts to speculate. I'm just a journalist myself. And some of them also point that out to some models that suggested some of these things might cancel out each other and that the temperatures may stable for a while. FLATOW: And you did mention that eventually, even though we have high CO2 levels and they're rising, that will eventually lower itself, as people are gone. Mr. WEISMAN: Well, if we were gone and smoke stacks tomorrow stopped issuing more buried carbon into, formerly buried carbon, into the atmosphere, that would be an enormous relief I think for the ecosystem as we know it. I mean the Earth has, in the past, have this much carbon in its atmosphere and it was a really different planet at that time. I think the last time was 700,000 years ago. And we know that were, you know, tropical vegetations growing in Greenland and in Antarctica. Possibly, we would be looking at that again. But the consensus that I got from atmospheric scientists I talked to is that it would probably take around 100,000 years for all the carbon that we have put into the atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial revolution to be absorbed by a combination of ocean, the action of the biosphere, plants, et cetera and geologic cycles itself. You know, rain will dissolve carbon dioxide and then the carbolic acid will then dissolve rocks and eventually this stuff precipitates out in the form of limestone, shells, all sorts of thing. Most of that would probably happen during the first 1,000 years. It takes the sea 1,000 years to turn over but, again, we're looking at models of something that no one has ever witnessed before, so scientists are doing their best to try to get in all the variables into this huge ecosystem model to predict what's going to happen. FLATOW: Talking with Alan Weisman, author of \"The World Without Us. \" A really interesting book about what would happen to the Earth if people suddenly disappeared and the consequences. And if you'd like how - if you like to talk about how things are put together, you like to talk about how they come apart. So, I want to keep you on for a few more minutes. We're going to go to the break and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more with you. So, stay with us, we'll take some more of your calls and your questions, 1-800-989-8255. We'll be right back after this short break. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: We're talking this hour with Alan Weisman, author of \"The World Without Us. \" There's so much in this book about the details, and my new - I say that in a positive way because for a geeky guy like me who likes to know how everything works, I used to rip things apart in the basement. He takes everything in the world. Take everything apart and looks how it was put together and where it may be heading. Our number: 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to the phones to Melody(ph) in Syracuse, New York. Hi, Melody. MELODY (Caller): Hi. I know that Northern Europe has a tremendous human imprint left on it and I was thinking of places like the Netherlands with the dikes and so many places. Have you thought about the impact there? How long will it take, the dikes, to collapse or erode? FLATOW: Well, we got - do we have him back yet? We don't have them back. That's a good question, Melody. We had got disconnected from Alan Weisman a little bit here, so we're going to have to talk to you about it a little bit more. What makes you thought - think of the Netherlands? MELODY: Well, I - just all of Northern Europe has been so much transformed by human beings and the Netherlands just keeps increasing the technology to keep sea at bay. And I think at some point that even though they have - I forget how many dikes now, how many layers of land, what is it about a third of their land or maybe\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. MELODY: \u2026two-thirds that has been reclaimed now, that - if it's suddenly were all to go at once would it cause more damage than just the Netherlands, you know, would more species in Northern Europe be affected by this? Would it all turn to marshland? FLATOW: Yeah. Let me ask Alan. Are you back? Mr. WEISMAN: I'm back and I didn't hear the first part of the question. FLATOW: Question is what would happen to all the dikes of the Netherlands there? What would happen, you know, the - what would sequence of events today do the life forms there? Mr. WEISMAN: My best guess - because I did not get to the Netherlands for this, but I did look at other dike and dam systems elsewhere, is that all the dikes and the dams require human maintenance. And if human beings were not maintaining - for example, I went to one of the biggest pieces of infrastructure on Earth, the Panama Canal. And a tropical river, which, you know, this is the rainforest there - which runs into what is the canal, is being held back by a series of earthen dams. Earthen dams or cement dams, it doesn't matter. These dams will all fail without human maintenance. They have to be opened\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Mr. WEISMAN: \u2026their floodgates have to be opened from time to time to let currents through or let the tides through or they will erode and if they're not being maintained. And yes, Holland will definitely - eventually flood again if those dikes are not maintained. We haven't built anything permanent that will hold back the sea. FLATOW: Well, let's talk about what you saw as the most permanent kinds of structures. Could they be the oldest - you mentioned the ones that are made of - that are masonry or made out of stone. Will they virtually last almost for eons? Mr. WEISMAN: Well, I think their building blocks will certainly last. Stone, of course, is the stuff of the Earth itself. FLATOW: The pyramids either in Egypt or in South America, things like that. Are they going to be around much longer than anything we have built? Mr. WEISMAN: The pyramid - I mean, just consider it now a mountain, you know? It used to have marble all over it, which was carted away by the Arabs to build Alexandria but - or to build Cairo, I'm sorry. But today, it is just eroding like any other mountain and it will probably be around a million years or more, probably much more, but it's going to get steadily lower. I would say that some of our most resilient structures will be like Machu Picchu. I - those not only that made out of stone but those stones are fit together so beautifully that they're not that dependent on mortar, they're dependent on gravity to hold them together and they're going to be pretty resilient. In New York City, I mentioned that St. Paul's Chapel, the oldest building in the city, which is across the street from the World Trade Center. It's built out of Manhattan's shift(ph), the same thing the island is made out of so that's going to be around for a long time. And even if, eventually, it topples, well, its building blocks will be there. But concrete and steel, they're not going to last that long. Steel corrodes and the steel rebar inside of concretes, it expands and it just - it flakes away the concrete pretty fast. FLATOW: And of course, then you have things like earthquakes that could shake up a lot of things. Mr. WEISMAN: Well, absolutely. And of course in the case of Manhattan, eventually, there's going to be another ice age. There've been a lot of them, and no matter what we're doing to the atmosphere, once that dies down, the ice will scrape the island clean again. Thinking about that, I did go visit some of the underground infrastructure that human beings have created there. Some underground cities in central Turkey that go down at least 18 stories. They keep discovering more. And a glacier going over the top of that would probably just bury it a little deeper. FLATOW: Wow, you know\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: How did you know what - where to stop? I mean, there's so much to think about. You must have put - or you've just, you know, have to brain melt some\u2026 Mr. WEISMAN: At a certain point, Ira, my publisher said we need you to write the book. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. WEISMAN: But I tried to cover as many bases as I possibly could. I mean, there are a lot of ways to think about the planet and what it is that we do to it. But most important, ultimately, was the fact that I really wasn't suggesting that we have been horrible for the planet and that the planet would be much better off without us. I think that we are a valuable species, as valuable as any other species. I think that we have grown so powerful that we can go so far, and dig so deep, and harvest so much. And most of all, there are so many of us that our impact really has to come back into better balance of nature, and that's why I wrote this book. FLATOW: Yeah, you mentioned that in the last chapter of your book. You talked about limiting population growth, someone - something that no one really wants to talk about very much. Mr. WEISMAN: Yeah, and that's why I brought it up. I mean, I didn't want to offer any suggestions in this book, you know, do any preaching that we have to do this, we have to do that. There are many eloquent books that are doing that job already. But at the very end, I decided to raise the population issue because it has kind of disappeared from the conversation in the last 15 years or so. It's been scared off for political reasons, and we really need to be thinking that even if we do the best we can in conserving energy and recycling stuff, there are so many of us. I mean, a million more every four days, a million more humans, that we really have to be thinking about it. So I looked at the so-called Chinese experiment, which I think has revealed to us a lot of interesting things, that if we all had one child per family from now on, no matter how you define families. Well, at the beginning of the 20th century there were 1. 6 billion. At the end of the 20th century, 6. 6 billion. We're headed to 9 billion by the middle of this century. But if we just did one child per family, we'd be back down to 1. 6 billion within a century. And that might buy us a lot of time on this planet to come up with some other solutions that might give a lot of space to those other organisms who make this life beautiful. They share this planet with us and we depend on them. I mean, just think of that bee segment that you just ran. A lot of these species are very, very critical to our survival, and I think giving them more space and more room to breathe and more places to grow would be in everybody's best interest. So it's something that we have to think about. I know it's an uncomfortable -you know, conversation to have. I mean, we all love our brothers and sisters -I certainly do. But this is - I mean, we're going to have a population crash of human beings at some point because we're about to limit of our resources that happens to every species. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. WEISMAN: The question is: Do we want to manage it or have nature do it for us? FLATOW: Alan Weisman, author of \"The World Without Us. \" A terrific read. It's something you should pick up this weekend. Thank you very much\u2026 Mr. WEISMAN: Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: \u2026for taking time to be with us.  IRA FLATOW, host:  Up next, what happens if we were to disappear? I mean, all of us - everybody on Earth. You know, so many times you've heard environmentalists talking about saving the world. What if they really mean it, you know? If what if they mean, well, if we have to save the world - to keep the world safe, a safe place - we humans can't be here?  Because the world would seem, you know - maybe it'll go on just fine without us. At least that seems to be the message of a new book called \"The World Without Us. \" Some things like head lice or cattle might be in trouble without humans. But by and large, the world would survive and might be argued, might be better off ecologically and environmentally without us in it.  Joining me now to talk about what might happen on Earth if humans were to suddenly vanish is my guest, the author of \"The World Without Us,\" Alan Weisman. He's a journalist and senior editor and producer at Homeland Productions Radio. Thanks for talking with us today, Mr. Weisman.  Mr. ALAN WEISMAN (Author, \"The World Without Us\"): Thank you, Ira. Good to be here.  FLATOW: What made you decide to take us off the Earth here?  Mr. WEISMAN: Well, I actually don't want to take us off the Earth, but theoretically removing us from the Earth helps us solve the problem that a lot of us who write about the environment constantly confront, which is the more deeply and completely we report it, the more overwhelmed are readers or listeners sometimes feel.  And sometimes, they just don't want to face it because it just seems so depressing or so scary. And I realized that if I just disarm the concern about all - are we all going to die if this, you know, if this keeps going this way. If I just kill everybody off in the beginning and then let everybody stick around to see what happens next, they might just sort of relax and enjoy it. They would think that, you know, this is kind of a fantasy. And I posed some remote possibilities how this could happen, say a Homo sapiens-specific virus just picked us off and left everything else. Let's say that AIDS were airborne rather than, you know, passed by fluids. Or a lot of people believe in the rapture may be, you know, a spiritual figure or space aliens take us away to heaven or to some place across the galaxy. But just suppose that the Earth woke up tomorrow and everything else was here intact as it is today except for us. What happens next?  FLATOW: And, you know, you came up, I think, with some - initially some very surprising things that would happen, like the cockroaches would go away.  Mr. WEISMAN: The cockroaches would go away from our northern cities because it turns out, I'm informed, that they depend on the heat inside buildings to get through the winter. So if people are gone, the power plants are off, the heat goes off, the cockroaches have no refuge to take and they would be cold. But in the tropics, places like Florida, they would still have to deal with cockroaches.  FLATOW: And there would be a disruption in the whole chain of the food system?  Mr. WEISMAN: Well definitely. The - by food system, you mean agriculture?  FLATOW: Agriculture would go away and food that we eat, that we feed inadvertently to rats and other kinds of animals that depend on it.  Mr. WEISMAN: Well definitely. The urban rats who live a lot on human refuge, they would be sorting for food. In fact, they would become food themselves because there would be a lot of raptors and other predators that would be populating the cities very soon and they would find hungry rats everywhere looking around in the surface for something to eat.  At the same time, our agricultural fields - I trace in this book what the succession back to a natural forest environment, for example, would be in fields that have both never been fertilized before such as in New England, parts of New England, such as where I live in western Massachusetts, where farmers moved on to better soils and longer growing seasons as United States march westward, and also places that have received liberal amounts of herbicides, pesticides and chemical fertilizers over the years, forest succession would proceed differently in those cases.  But in any event, a lot of those crops that we have planted, they would be gone and some of the vegetables and things that we are used to, like cauliflower and broccoli and carrots - they would revert back to wilder forms that wouldn't be very recognizable to us. Well, carrots are an interesting example because they would revert back to Queen Anne's lace, which we know is a flower, not as an edible root.  FLATOW: Wow. So you'd be - we'd be turning the clock backwards. I want to talk more about this because we're talking about the food here. But you have - you will describe, when you go back in history, some interesting things to how we got to be where we are, and that's just as interesting as where we would be headed. So we're going to take a break and come back and talk not just about the disappearance of the living things but how quickly are structures, are bridges, are buildings would just disappear.  It's shocking talking with Alan Weisman, author of \"The World Without Us. \" We'll take your questions. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Also, you can go visit our avatar on Second Life at Science School in Sci Land, so stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour with author Alan Weisman, author of the book \"The World Without Us. \" 1-800-989-8255. It's a book about what would happen to the Earth if all the people disappeared accidentally. And you start out with New York City, I guess, because it's a really interesting place to watch what happens when the people disappear. And you talk about how important - what happens with water when it's allowed to get into places that we have no control over anymore?  Mr. WEISMAN: Well, in a previous chapter, it show how our houses are something that are certainly vulnerable to water. Anybody that has ever had a roof leak knows about that. But even our big, cemented cities, same thing happens. So in the case of New York - and I mentioned several other cities - it would actually start underneath the city, not on the roof. Subway engineers took me through the bowels of the city and showed me how the history of the city can be seen down there in the rushing water that is coming out of the ground all the time. New York used to be a hilly city. The name Manhattan refers to hills - that's an old Algonquin term Manhatta(ph).  And there were forty-some streams and rivers on the surface that would, of course, drain water away to the sea. When those hills got smashed down to superimpose the grid on the city, the rivers were pushed underground. And even on a sunny day, they're pumping about 13 million gallons of ground water in a rising water table up - out of the city into the sea.  If the power went off, nearly 800 pumps would go silent and the subways would flood. And then the columns that are holding up the streets would start to rust and start to corrode, and they gave, what about, two decades before they would start to collapse. And the streets would start to crater and some of that water would then become surface water once again. And at the same time, the foundations of a lot of buildings would start to become waterlogged and they would also corrode and eventually come destabilized because they were built to be standing in water.  FLATOW: Then you say that eventually, our skyscrapers would be just blown over by the wind?  Mr. WEISMAN: Well, a destabilized skyscraper would be very susceptible to high winds and of course, New York being a coastal city, has been hit by hurricanes before. There are some speculation that we may be seeing more hurricanes around East Coast and perhaps more powerful ones in the decades to come. And a destabilized skyscraper - we all know that skyscrapers will sway in the wind. This will - if it topples, it will probably do the same thing as a big tree does when it topples in the forest. It takes down some other trees standing around it with it.  And that's actually going to be kind of good for the succession of forest in the city. New York was once completely forested, of course, and trees will be already colonizing in the streets. They'll be growing in the leaf litter that will be filling the gutters in the streets, because no one will be raking the streets and no one will be unclogging the sewers that - will probably have plastic bags stuck over the top of them. And the crumbling concrete will add lime to the soil, which will make it less acidic. So more and more plants - types of plants will be able to colonize.  FLATOW: Hmm. And you also talk about how quickly, you know, New York is famous also for its majestic bridges. How quickly do bridges will crumble?  Mr. WEISMAN: The bridges will not exactly crumble as they will begin to fall into the bodies of water below them, because a bridge has to be maintained all the time. That means painting it and that means clearing the debris that will gather in the expansion joints. Now, bridges, which are made out of metal usually - except for the very old ones, the stone ones - they expand and contract. And in the wintertime, the expansion joints are open, and if they fill with debris or if they fill with rust - which occupies a lot more space than metal does, they will clog and in the summer - there'll be no place for the bridge to expand. But it has to so it starts straining at the very bolts that connected to piers of concrete or connected to the bedrock on either end, on the mainland, or on Manhattan or Staten Island. And eventually, when those bolts shear off, the bridge will just start to walk around until finally, one of end it collapses.  Also, steel plates that make up the bridge, if they are rusting, water will penetrate between them and that rust has to expand and will absolutely pop rivets, even rivets that are two inches long. I've seen examples of this thing. The bridge experts showed it to me.  FLATOW: Wow. 1-800-989-8255. Wendy(ph) in Spring Creek, Nevada. Hi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  WENDY (Caller): I love your show. I listen to it every week. I just love it. It's great.  FLATOW: Thank you.  WENDY: What is going to happen to all the atomic energy plants throughout the world when this (unintelligible)?  FLATOW: Good question.  Mr. WEISMAN: That is a good question, and I have a whole chapter on that, Wendy. The - our atomic bombs aren't going to be much of a problem because they need repulsion that only we can provide - to slam a couple of pieces of uranium together or to implode plutonium fast enough so it will explode. And therefore, when corrosion finally exposes the radioactive materials to the elements, they will just be very radioactive. But the plants are much more of a concern to me because there's a lot more radioactive materials in them and they will\u2026  (Soundbite of phone ringing)  FLATOW: You can get the phone.  Mr. WEISMAN: No. I'm sorry.  FLATOW: That's okay.  Mr. WEISMAN: That was a different line.  FLATOW: That's okay.  Mr. WEISMAN: And what happens with the nuclear plant, I visit - I mean, two interesting examples. I go to Chernobyl, which, of course, has already had a bad accident, and I go to the newest one that we have in the United States, Palo Verde in Arizona. Palo Verde is very typical that if the plant suddenly were to shut down - it's human personnel we're not there - it would shut down but a fail-safe generators, diesel generators would come on to keep the water circulating around the reactors, which cools them. That diesel is only about a seven-day supply, so when that stops - if there were no human beings - the water around the reactors would start to evaporate because the reactors are very hot. And depending on how much fuel is in the reactor - cycle, it would either catch fire or it would melt down.  Now, we have 441 nuclear plants in the world and many of them have multiple reactors. So those would be a lot of Chernobyls that the ecosystem would have to deal with. I mean, the present Chernobyl, of course, many of us know that the area right around the plant strangely enough has greater biodiversity than the area outside evacuated zones because there are no human beings there so the animals and plants are rushing in.  FLATOW: Even being radioactive, they survived.  Mr. WEISMAN: Yeah. Well, the studies are showing that their life spans - the species that have been studied - their lifespan seem to be abbreviated, and some of them may not do very well. No one really knows how the radiation will tumble, bounce(ph) regenerations and whether its effects, genetic effects, would be cumulative.  The birds don't seem to be doing tremendously well. They may be very sensitive, but there's a population of voles that's being studied and it's noticed that even though they are dying younger, they are also sexually maturing younger and they are throwing off more offspring, which may be nature's way of responding to this big change in the environment, by throwing out more opportunities for some, more radiation-tolerant mutation to appear. And maybe that's the direction the lineage will go.  But, you know, I really think that our nuclear plants would cause a tremendous problem. And whether we're here or not, the fact that so much of our radioactive waste is just sitting alongside them in temporary storage until we figure out what to do with it was a fact that really came home to me during the research I did all over the world for this book.  FLATOW: Yeah. I'm talking with Alan Weisman, author of \"The World Without Us,\" a meticulously written book. You know, in writing the book and then reading it - a terrific read - you had to learn so much about how to build these things that eventually decay.  Mr. WEISMAN: Well, that's true, Ira, and thanks for your compliment. I agree with Wendy. I'm a great fan of your show as well. The learning curve for this book was enormous but it was like, you know, a rollercoaster. I would travel to one place after another, trying to find out all sorts of different things like what happens to the sea after we're gone? What happens to our petrochemical installations? Along with nuclear plants, I also went to see chemical plants and oil refineries in that huge petroscape that we have between Houston and Galveston, which is sort of the biggest concentration in that kind of stuff on Earth.  I went to former war zones. The Korean DMZ is a wonderful example of an area that had just been left fallow. And even though you got two of the world's biggest and most hostile armies facing off each other, in sight of each other, the strip in between them has become this inadvertent nature preserve, where some of the most precious endangered species in all of Asia now are sheltered. And other places - well, I saw another demilitarized zone in Cyprus where a fairly new seaside resort had been built in the early '70s, you know, it sort of looks like a riviera with hotels and big balconies along the shore. And then the war came along and it was built with Greek Cypriot money, but after the war, it ended up on the Turkish side. The Turks put a fence around it so it would be intact in a good bargaining ship when the island got down to reunification talks.  But 33 years later, sadly that hasn't happened. And now all these buildings of our newest kinds of architecture, you know, reinforced concrete with steel reinforcing bar, glass and steel - these buildings are complete goners. And a lot of them are still standing but they can't be salvaged anymore. And the beach is full of not bathing human beings, but sea turtles, which is very nice.  FLATOW: Wow. A thousand - two thousand years from now - whatever\u2026  Mr. WEISMAN: Mm-hmm.  FLATOW: \u2026is there anything left of us to know that we were even here?  Mr. WEISMAN: Oh, lots of things.  FLATOW: What will stay around? I imagine the plastics will last forever.  Mr. WEISMAN: Yeah. There's a whole chapter on plastics which was really one of those staggering journalistic experience is to learn amazing fact after amazing fact. Plastic isn't that old. It was invented in the beginning of the 20th century but it didn't really enter the mainstream until after World War II. And yet now, we've got more than a billion tons of the stuff. There is so much of it out there. And it turns out that much of it ends up in the ocean. Perhaps, most of it because, you know, everything eventually erodes and goes to the sea. But plastic is much lighter than rocks so it's getting there a lot faster. There are continent-sized rafts of the stuff floating around in our oceans and wave action is breaking it up.  If all the plastic, except for a little bit that's been incinerated, all the plastic ever made is still there. If it breaks up in the ocean into smaller and smaller particles, if it breaks up on land, if ultraviolet hits the plastic that is UV-sensitive, it's still is there. It's just in smaller bits. And in the ocean, smaller and smaller creatures are mistaking it for something organic and they're eating it. And their systems will get clogged up if they eat too much of it or a piece that's too big for them to digest, and we don't know what the repercussions of this is going to be.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Mr. WEISMAN: It was pretty enormous to find this out. Also, I'm assured by plastic experts that because the hydrocarbon with various other added elements to give it different kinds of properties, eventually microbes will figure out how to digest it but this could take thousands, hundred of thousands, even millions of years. And it's, you know, just like it took microbes that long to figure out how to digest the lignite and cellulose in trees - until that happened, trees didn't decay. They eventually got buried and eventually got so compressed by what buried them that they turned into coal. Well, this probably going to happen to plastic as well.  FLATOW: Talking with Alan Weisman, author of \"The World Without Us\" on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  Let's go to the phone for some questioning. Let's go to Malcolm(ph) in Cody, Wyoming. Hi, Malcolm.  MALCOLM (Caller): Hi there.  FLATOW: Hi.  MALCOLM: Hi. Alan, I just saw you on \"The Daily Show\" a couple of days ago. Looks like a very fascinating book and I can't wait to read it.  Mr. WEISMAN: Thank you.  MALCOLM: My question was if you addressed global warming at all? If we get to a tipping point where even if we're gone, is that's going to leave an impact in the long term? I'll take my question off the air.  FLATOW: Okay, thanks for calling.  Mr. WEISMAN: Okay, thanks. Yeah, I had to address global warming because, you know, the future is kind of a moving target right now. We're not sure where it's going. There are several different models, and I point to a couple of different possibilities in various sections of the book of what we might expect. For example, the forest I mentioned before that will eventually cover New York City again - and we know that there's going to be a combination of native species and a combination of exotic species that we have introduced overtime into New York. But if the seas keep rising because of global warming, how much of Manhattan, for example, will be above the water?  Certain parts of it, like Washington Heights for example or the hill in Central Park, probably will be. But will the foliage there, the native foliage - or will we be looking at palmettos? We'll be seeing magnolia trees coming in there. Some of the models - and Ira, I know that this has been discussed a lot in your show - indicate, you know, steadily warming temperatures. Some of them believe that we could be ushering in an ice age very quickly, particularly if cold, freshwater from Greenland inundates the ocean conveyor and suddenly shots that down or shows it down considerably.  So, I looked at a few different models like this and try to speculate or - I got experts to speculate. I'm just a journalist myself. And some of them also point that out to some models that suggested some of these things might cancel out each other and that the temperatures may stable for a while.  FLATOW: And you did mention that eventually, even though we have high CO2 levels and they're rising, that will eventually lower itself, as people are gone.  Mr. WEISMAN: Well, if we were gone and smoke stacks tomorrow stopped issuing more buried carbon into, formerly buried carbon, into the atmosphere, that would be an enormous relief I think for the ecosystem as we know it. I mean the Earth has, in the past, have this much carbon in its atmosphere and it was a really different planet at that time. I think the last time was 700,000 years ago. And we know that were, you know, tropical vegetations growing in Greenland and in Antarctica. Possibly, we would be looking at that again.  But the consensus that I got from atmospheric scientists I talked to is that it would probably take around 100,000 years for all the carbon that we have put into the atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial revolution to be absorbed by a combination of ocean, the action of the biosphere, plants, et cetera and geologic cycles itself. You know, rain will dissolve carbon dioxide and then the carbolic acid will then dissolve rocks and eventually this stuff precipitates out in the form of limestone, shells, all sorts of thing. Most of that would probably happen during the first 1,000 years.  It takes the sea 1,000 years to turn over but, again, we're looking at models of something that no one has ever witnessed before, so scientists are doing their best to try to get in all the variables into this huge ecosystem model to predict what's going to happen.  FLATOW: Talking with Alan Weisman, author of \"The World Without Us. \" A really interesting book about what would happen to the Earth if people suddenly disappeared and the consequences. And if you'd like how - if you like to talk about how things are put together, you like to talk about how they come apart. So, I want to keep you on for a few more minutes. We're going to go to the break and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more with you. So, stay with us, we'll take some more of your calls and your questions, 1-800-989-8255. We'll be right back after this short break.  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: We're talking this hour with Alan Weisman, author of \"The World Without Us. \" There's so much in this book about the details, and my new - I say that in a positive way because for a geeky guy like me who likes to know how everything works, I used to rip things apart in the basement. He takes everything in the world. Take everything apart and looks how it was put together and where it may be heading. Our number: 1-800-989-8255.  Let's go to the phones to Melody(ph) in Syracuse, New York. Hi, Melody.  MELODY (Caller): Hi. I know that Northern Europe has a tremendous human imprint left on it and I was thinking of places like the Netherlands with the dikes and so many places. Have you thought about the impact there? How long will it take, the dikes, to collapse or erode?  FLATOW: Well, we got - do we have him back yet? We don't have them back. That's a good question, Melody. We had got disconnected from Alan Weisman a little bit here, so we're going to have to talk to you about it a little bit more. What makes you thought - think of the Netherlands?  MELODY: Well, I - just all of Northern Europe has been so much transformed by human beings and the Netherlands just keeps increasing the technology to keep sea at bay. And I think at some point that even though they have - I forget how many dikes now, how many layers of land, what is it about a third of their land or maybe\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  MELODY: \u2026two-thirds that has been reclaimed now, that - if it's suddenly were all to go at once would it cause more damage than just the Netherlands, you know, would more species in Northern Europe be affected by this? Would it all turn to marshland?  FLATOW: Yeah. Let me ask Alan. Are you back?  Mr. WEISMAN: I'm back and I didn't hear the first part of the question.  FLATOW: Question is what would happen to all the dikes of the Netherlands there? What would happen, you know, the - what would sequence of events today do the life forms there?  Mr. WEISMAN: My best guess - because I did not get to the Netherlands for this, but I did look at other dike and dam systems elsewhere, is that all the dikes and the dams require human maintenance. And if human beings were not maintaining - for example, I went to one of the biggest pieces of infrastructure on Earth, the Panama Canal. And a tropical river, which, you know, this is the rainforest there - which runs into what is the canal, is being held back by a series of earthen dams. Earthen dams or cement dams, it doesn't matter. These dams will all fail without human maintenance. They have to be opened\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. WEISMAN: \u2026their floodgates have to be opened from time to time to let currents through or let the tides through or they will erode and if they're not being maintained. And yes, Holland will definitely - eventually flood again if those dikes are not maintained. We haven't built anything permanent that will hold back the sea.  FLATOW: Well, let's talk about what you saw as the most permanent kinds of structures. Could they be the oldest - you mentioned the ones that are made of - that are masonry or made out of stone. Will they virtually last almost for eons?  Mr. WEISMAN: Well, I think their building blocks will certainly last. Stone, of course, is the stuff of the Earth itself.  FLATOW: The pyramids either in Egypt or in South America, things like that. Are they going to be around much longer than anything we have built?  Mr. WEISMAN: The pyramid - I mean, just consider it now a mountain, you know? It used to have marble all over it, which was carted away by the Arabs to build Alexandria but - or to build Cairo, I'm sorry. But today, it is just eroding like any other mountain and it will probably be around a million years or more, probably much more, but it's going to get steadily lower.  I would say that some of our most resilient structures will be like Machu Picchu. I - those not only that made out of stone but those stones are fit together so beautifully that they're not that dependent on mortar, they're dependent on gravity to hold them together and they're going to be pretty resilient.  In New York City, I mentioned that St. Paul's Chapel, the oldest building in the city, which is across the street from the World Trade Center. It's built out of Manhattan's shift(ph), the same thing the island is made out of so that's going to be around for a long time. And even if, eventually, it topples, well, its building blocks will be there. But concrete and steel, they're not going to last that long. Steel corrodes and the steel rebar inside of concretes, it expands and it just - it flakes away the concrete pretty fast.  FLATOW: And of course, then you have things like earthquakes that could shake up a lot of things.  Mr. WEISMAN: Well, absolutely. And of course in the case of Manhattan, eventually, there's going to be another ice age. There've been a lot of them, and no matter what we're doing to the atmosphere, once that dies down, the ice will scrape the island clean again. Thinking about that, I did go visit some of the underground infrastructure that human beings have created there. Some underground cities in central Turkey that go down at least 18 stories. They keep discovering more. And a glacier going over the top of that would probably just bury it a little deeper.  FLATOW: Wow, you know\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: How did you know what - where to stop? I mean, there's so much to think about. You must have put - or you've just, you know, have to brain melt some\u2026  Mr. WEISMAN: At a certain point, Ira, my publisher said we need you to write the book.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. WEISMAN: But I tried to cover as many bases as I possibly could. I mean, there are a lot of ways to think about the planet and what it is that we do to it. But most important, ultimately, was the fact that I really wasn't suggesting that we have been horrible for the planet and that the planet would be much better off without us.  I think that we are a valuable species, as valuable as any other species. I think that we have grown so powerful that we can go so far, and dig so deep, and harvest so much. And most of all, there are so many of us that our impact really has to come back into better balance of nature, and that's why I wrote this book.  FLATOW: Yeah, you mentioned that in the last chapter of your book. You talked about limiting population growth, someone - something that no one really wants to talk about very much.  Mr. WEISMAN: Yeah, and that's why I brought it up. I mean, I didn't want to offer any suggestions in this book, you know, do any preaching that we have to do this, we have to do that. There are many eloquent books that are doing that job already. But at the very end, I decided to raise the population issue because it has kind of disappeared from the conversation in the last 15 years or so. It's been scared off for political reasons, and we really need to be thinking that even if we do the best we can in conserving energy and recycling stuff, there are so many of us.  I mean, a million more every four days, a million more humans, that we really have to be thinking about it. So I looked at the so-called Chinese experiment, which I think has revealed to us a lot of interesting things, that if we all had one child per family from now on, no matter how you define families. Well, at the beginning of the 20th century there were 1. 6 billion. At the end of the 20th century, 6. 6 billion. We're headed to 9 billion by the middle of this century.  But if we just did one child per family, we'd be back down to 1. 6 billion within a century. And that might buy us a lot of time on this planet to come up with some other solutions that might give a lot of space to those other organisms who make this life beautiful. They share this planet with us and we depend on them. I mean, just think of that bee segment that you just ran. A lot of these species are very, very critical to our survival, and I think giving them more space and more room to breathe and more places to grow would be in everybody's best interest.  So it's something that we have to think about. I know it's an uncomfortable -you know, conversation to have. I mean, we all love our brothers and sisters -I certainly do. But this is - I mean, we're going to have a population crash of human beings at some point because we're about to limit of our resources that happens to every species.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.

What's the most common form of treatment for the mentally ill? Ask a mental health professional and he or she will probably tell you, no treatment. That's because mental illness carries a huge stigma in American society. That can be especially true in urban areas where large numbers of African-Americans live. Step Up is a mental health facility located in Santa Monica, California. About 40 percent of its participants are African-American. But Step Up doesn't see itself as a mental institution in the traditional sense. It calls itself a psychosocial rehabilitation center. That's a place where people with schizophrenia and forms of extreme depression can receive psychosocial training and learn life skills. Tod Lipka is the CEO of Step Up, and Jacob Ramsey is a full-time participant in the program. Welcome, gentlemen. Mr. TOD LIPKA (Chief Executive Officer, Step Up): Thank you. Mr. JACOB RAMSEY (Participant, Step Up program): Hello. CHIDEYA: Tod, I'm just going to ask you about the term psychosocial rehabilitation. What do you exactly mean by that? Mr. LIPKA: A psychosocial model for rehabilitation is a - it's a philosophy and it's a practice. The philosophy is that someone is responsible for their own mental health, that someone - you create an environment where someone is able to take charge of their own care, their own health care similar to physical health care. Mental health care has that same parallel. But beyond that, we're an asset-based program. We don't focus on the illness. We focus on the person. And we've looked at what their goals are and we charge them with being responsible for achieving their own goals that's why we talk about the people or our participants in our program are members, they're not clients that speaks to their partnership. But in addition to that, we provide comprehensive services that allow someone to utilize those programs and services as part of their own, achieving their own goals. And because there's no cure for mental illness, the treatment may last over a fairly long period of time and those goals - just like for you and I in our own life - those goals will evolve and change as a person progresses in their treatment. CHIDEYA: So Jacob, why don't you tell me a little bit about your story? How did you first find yourself in a position of having to deal with depression? Mr. RAMSEY: Approximately 15 years ago, I went through a divorce that I really didn't want to happen, but it happened. And divorce to me is like death so it's a grieving process I went through. And every day for about a year and a half, I would be crying and I didn't know why. So I was led to Step Up on Second, which is a mental health facility. The staff there told me about a process of reintegrating into the community. Because of my mental health issues, I had lost contact with reality. I'd isolate. Mr. LIPKA: Socialization is a very important part of what we do. Really, one of the strategies of our program is to create a sense of community for people. It's to invite them in and accept people for who they are. And so we may have somebody who is - has been homeless for 10 years who comes in, you talk with him, you say, gee, this person - they need a shower, they need laundry, services, they need food, they need housing. But for them, they may be only interested in food, and so for us, that's really where we start. It's what someone's goals are for themselves, it's not what other people think are important or what we think are important and then we try and build a relationship overtime and entice that person into the variety of services that we can offer to help them move forward in their life. CHIDEYA: What do you consider the next step from just dealing with someone in -on their day to day? Mr. LIPKA: It's - it could be laundry or shower services for homeless individuals. We provide meals every day of the year. We run 60 to 70 groups in which members and staff and volunteer lead it, everything from understanding your medications to dealing with strong emotions, to yoga and art. We have psychiatrists on staff for medication support, case management and vocational training, as well as computer training, and we also offer onsite housing. So it really is a community because it's almost one-stop shopping that you can get almost everything you need as part of your own individualized goal plan right at Step Up, and that makes it quite unique. CHIDEYA: For you, Jacob, being African-American - did being black put another burden on you in terms of, perhaps, trying to hide what you were going through? Mr. RAMSEY: I'm not only black, I'm, like, 6'4\", 220 pounds and - so I'm scary-looking already. So I learned not to share that with other African-Americans. It's like you're sitting there playing spades or dominos and they say, that guy is bipolar, you know. Don't offend him. Don't push him. It's really a stigma that that's - and so what Step Up on Second does, it's a psychosocial program, and the social part of that it gives us some place to socialize. For example, Halloween, Christmas, Thanksgiving - we have our own parties. We have over 1,250 members at Step Up on Second so we have a community that we can always socialize with. But then, from there, we can go out and that's what our mission statement says. It's says we reintegrate into the community. We can leave Step Up and go to the Coffee Bean and because we've learned how to socialize and drink coffee in our store there at Step Up for a fresh start, then we can go to Starbucks or one of those places. So with bipolar, I take medication and then I'm part of a psychosocial program, which is 70 percent of the reason why I can function for the last 10 years. And the stigma is not there. If I run into - and I don't want to call them ignorant people but maybe misinformed or uninformed people who feel uncomfortable around me. And I've been in situations when I shared in church that I was diagnosed. And until that I was like, (unintelligible) all of that but when they found it out, it was like a different kind of a vibe. So that's why I'm part of this. And that's why I came on to radio. It's like people came out to the cause and for a lot of other issues. It's time now for the African-Americans to come out and say hey, yes, I'm taking medication for mental health issue and as long as I take this medication, I'm just like anybody else. CHIDEYA: On that note, Tod and Jacob, thank you so much. Mr. LIPKA: Thank you. Mr. RAMSEY: Thank you. CHIDEYA: Tod Lipka is CEO of Step Up and Jacob Ramsey is a participant and resident at the Step Up facility in Sta. Monica, California. They spoke with me here in our NPR West studios.

I'm Joe Palca, sitting in for Ira Flatow. Later in the hour, we'll be taking up a scratchy subject: itch. But first, if the foiled German terror plot, the latest bin Laden video, and the president's speech last night are any indication - the terrorist threat isn't over. As intelligence agencies continue to track terrorist activities worldwide, they may have some help from a rather unlikely source - academic mathematicians and computer scientists. For example, mathematicians have developed theoretical tools that can be used to reveal things like the chain of command in a terrorist cell, or how many volunteers you need to be disable - how many volunteers you need to disable to disrupt the group, or say you want to sift through the massive amounts of information out there in cyberspace looking for terrorist activity. Computer scientists are used to dealing with mountains of data. They're using those skills to scan e-mails, forum postings and online videos that could reveal an attack in the making. We'll start the hour today talking about how math and computer science can help track down terrorists. So if you'd like to join our discussion, give us a call. Our number is 1-800-989-8255, that's 1-800-989-TALK. And if you want more information about what we're talking about this hour, go to our Web site at www. sciencefriday. com, where you'll find links to the topic. Now, let me introduce my guests. Bernard Brooks is a professor of mathematics and the head of research programs in the School of Mathematics - Mathematical Sciences at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York. He joins me today from the studios of member station WXXI in Rochester. Welcome to the program, Dr. Brooks. Dr. BERNARD BROOKS (Mathematics; Head of Research Programs, School of Mathematical Sciences, Rochester Institute of Technology): Thank you. Good afternoon. PALCA: Good afternoon. Also with us is Hsinchun Chen. He's the director of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and a professor of management information systems at the University of Arizona in Tucson. He joins me by phone from his office there. Welcome to the program, Dr. Chen. Dr. HSINCHUN CHEN (Director, Artificial Intelligence Laboratory; Professor, Management Information Systems, University of Arizona): Hi. Good morning. PALCA: Good morning, or afternoon, depending on where you're sitting. Well, thanks to both of you for joining us. Dr. Brooks, maybe we could start with you. The recent - there was this terror plot in Germany that the German officials broke up. How would mathematics or a mathematician be able to help uncover that plot or do something about it? Dr. BROOKS: Well, mathematics is very useful for optimizing the resources that you have. We're working with - in terrorist hunting, we're working with limited resources and we have to make the best use of it. If you think about the - let's say the communication network that the terrorists would have used for that particular cell, if that communication network can be monitored and one of the member of the cell can be identified, then we can use some of the algorithms that are useful for searching social networks in order to identify the clique or the terrorist cell. PALCA: Well, explain what - first of all, what's a social network then? Dr. BROOKS: It comes out of graph theory, which is an area that - area of mathematics that overlaps with sociology. If you think of a - let's say a fishnet, where the knots are the people and the strings in between the people are the relationships, we get what we refer to as a graph, so that the nodes or the dots are the people, and everybody I know is connected by edges from me to them. PALCA: Uh-huh. Dr. BROOKS: Now, once I draw one of these sort of a fishnet or a spider web-type structures, we can identify patterns in it that could correspond to the hierarchical structure of a terrorist cell. Now. . . PALCA: But don't you need to have some data? I mean where does the data for the connections or the nodes come from to begin with? Dr. BROOKS: Well that would have to come from monitoring communications building the network. PALCA: I see. I see. So in other words, if there's someone out there that's collecting this information, you can begin to make sense of it? Dr. BROOKS: Yes. The science of the study of social networks has to start with the actual network laid down, you're right. PALCA: Well, maybe I could turn to Dr. Chen, then. Is the work of computer scientists then something that could be gathering that data that maybe Dr. Brooks could use to set up algorithms to find people? Dr. CHEN: Yeah. I think definitely - I think that's everyone want to see in a little bit. Clearly, the intelligence agency might be collecting data on various groups, various (unintelligible) and so on, and a lot of them are security level data. But from the computer science or information science viewpoint - a lot of data that can be collected from the Web, especially from a targeted group, and just using my project, a project called Darkweb, which is monitoring the darker side of the Web in this scenario while looking at a lot of the Web sites and forums and bulletin boards, which are heavily used by some of the terrorist group. So we do collect those data, and some of that may not contain very violent actual operations, but they do give you indication of who is linking to whom and the timing or the kind of surge of activities. So this will become data sources that can be used by the mathematicians to understand the cliques, the spheres and so on. PALCA: I see. Tell me a little bit more about what you mean when you say dark Web. Dr. CHEN: The Web is bright, is open, but at the same time, the Web is also dark and also hidden. And when we define \"Dark Web,\" we're really looking at the side of the Web, which has a darker purpose to it, people hiding, as what this could be. Some kinds of crime could be hackers hiding in the Internet, this could be child pornography, this could be extremists or terrorists who are using the Web also for their own purpose, or really, the dark is a relative term - they just hide in the dark. And many of the purposes may be illegal or may be more violent and so on. PALCA: So how do they - how do the dark Webs elude the kind of search engines like Google or what have you that typically find everything? Dr. CHEN: Well, most of the search engines, they try to capture, quote, unquote, \"all the contents in the Web,\" but because of the commercial reasons that they need to get pages that will have some commercial values. So in many cases, they actually don't do exhaustive search. They may be doing a sampling of 20, 30 percent of portion of the Net. But here, as you can see, is the darker side of the Web. So a lot of those Web sites may be dangling, which means they're not connected to anyone. They will not submit their URLs to Google to search. So they're hiding, you know, because they are targeting a particular subset of the society of interest to them. So they are not - they are very difficult to find. So Google, in most cases, they might have some content, but definitely they only have a very small percentage of those content. PALCA: We're talking about the use of computer science and mathematical tools to track terror. And we are taking your calls at 1-800-989-8255, that's 1-800-989-TALK. And, Dr. Brooks, maybe I could turn back to you. So if you - if Dr. Chen's data show - comes to you and it shows that two people are talking, how do you assess, you know, who's on top, who's on the bottom, who's giving the orders, who's carrying them out? How does the mathematical theory account for these things? Dr. BROOKS: Well, there are search algorithms that look for particular patterns. And the patterns that we would be looking for would be different, depending on whether the cell that we think we're looking for is more of an amateur terrorist cell. If the people knew each other before they set up the terrorist cell, if they set themselves up - if they were just a group of disgruntled individuals, this probably happens more in domestic terrorists. If you think about five people, they would all have known each other beforehand and wouldn't have the opportunity to set up the optimum, the perfect terrorist cell. So that would manifest itself as a complete subgraph. In other words, five people, they would all know each other. So you would have five dots and out of each one of those dots, the five people, you would have four edges emanating to each other, and that would look like a complete subgraph that you would be looking for. On the other hand, Jonathan Farley, one of the organizers of the terrorists conference coming up this next week, is - he presented at last year's terrorist conference a mathematical theory that worked with the lattice theory and posets that set up a way to design the optimal terrorist cell. So. . . PALCA: Do I want to know what posets are or is that - can we just posit that those are something you use in mathematics? Dr. BROOKS: It's like a graph. . . PALCA: Uh-huh. Dr. BROOKS: . . . so that the fishbone - oh, sorry, I'm made it myself - the fishnet structure that I talked about before. PALCA: Yeah, uh-huh. Dr. BROOKS: It doesn't have a top or a bottom, whereas a poset would have a top or a bottom. So we're starting to work some hierarchy into these social networks - that's a good way to think about it. And he's set up this optimal terrorist cell in sort of a fishbone-like structure, think of it as a ladder with one leg removed, where commanders have a trusted lieutenant on one side and then the rest of the network below them. And he's designed this so that if it's disrupted in any way - in other words, one of the agents is compromised -then that sort of structure, that sort of network is the most resilient to that sort of compromise or capture of an agent. PALCA: Oh. Dr. BROOKS: So if a professional terrorist organization that had the luxury of setting up the perfect command structure, they would choose that sort of thing. So if we're looking for a more professional cell, we would be looking for something similar to that structure. PALCA: Okay. Dr. BROOKS: So now as a terrorist organization, I have to make - I would have to make a choice. I would have to say, do I go with the optimal structure, in which case I would be slightly easier to find with these search algorithms, or do I go with the less optimal structure, become a little bit harder to find but easier to compromise when I am found. PALCA: All right. Well, let's see if our listeners have any questions about this. And let's go first to Roger(ph) in Rockville. Roger, welcome to the program. ROGER (Caller): Thank you. When I heard the topic of this show, it made me think of the TV show \"Numbers. \" PALCA: Uh-huh. ROGER: I wondered whether your guests were familiar with it and whether they thought it was realistic. PALCA: Hmm. Do - gentlemen, Dr. Brooks, Dr. Chen, do you know this program? Dr. CHEN: Which program is it? PALCA: It's called \"Numbers. \" Dr. CHEN: I'm not familiar with it. PALCA: Oh. Dr. Brooks? Dr. BROOKS: I have seen it. It's on Friday nights and one of the organizers, Anthony Harkin, of the conference coming up next week has actually done some consulting for that show. PALCA: Really? Is it, are they realistic at all? What - first of all, maybe you could give a brief description of what the show is about. Dr. BROOKS: The show is about an FBI agent and his mathematician brother, and they solve mysteries and crimes using mathematics. He. . . PALCA: I see. So this has already passed into popular domain? Dr. BROOKS: Yes. I mean, as a mathematician, it's nice to see the hero of the show being a mathematician. Easy for you. . . PALCA: Yeah. Next thing you know, they'll have a hero of the show being a radio talk show host. You know, that would really be going out on a limb. Is it realistic, I guess, is Roger's question. Dr. BROOKS: The mathematics that they use is real. Is it realistic when they do some calculations on a blackboard and discover, oh, the bad person is hiding behind such and such a bush, and the way they catch them at the end of the hour, no. It's. . . PALCA: You guys are just going to have to work harder, that's all. Well, I'm afraid we're - well, so it has a nodding acquaintance with reality, but not totally realistic. Okay. We have to take a short break. When we come back, we'll be talking more with our guests about using computer science and mathematics to track terrorism. Stay with us. (Soundbite of music) PALCA: From NPR News this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca. We're talking this hour about using math and science to fight terror. My guests are Hsinchun Chen, director of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Arizona in Tucson; and Bernard Brooks, professor of mathematics at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York. And Dr. Chen, I want to turn to you first and ask - if you don't know what's out there, if people are hiding on the Web, how do you know where to start to look for them? Dr. CHEN: Well, for computer scientists, definitely, we don't know the terrorism area as good any other terrorism researchers. So the first thing that we do is actually work with those people who have been monitoring those groups for years. And there are some international research groups, there are people in West Point, combating terrorism centers, there are people in other academic institutions. A lot of them are communication researchers, political scientists, and they've been monitoring terrorist groups for some time. But the problem has been that because of Internet, because of the overwhelming information and communication over in the cyberspace, it's very difficult for them to keep track of this phenomenon. So by working with them, we typically can identify certain groups, identify certain seed URLs, we identify a certain forum that they are aware of. Now, using that as the starting point, then we can do the crawling, so crawling is sort of a spidering term, meaning that search engine do that as what they call the Web. So, we send computer programs starting with those feed, URLs, to go to other link sites or other forums so we're - just like what Dr. Brooks says - talk about we're casting the net out from initial small patches and then into the bigger connected Web. With that then we use various weighting mechanism to identify other potentially important Web sites and forums that missed, even by those terrorism researchers. So, even in the collection that we have collected over the past three or four years, we do spidering or crawling about every two or three months, so we collect about four, five collections a year, and we're getting probably thousands of Web sites, hundreds of millions of Web pages, and even close to billions of postings in forums and so on. . . PALCA: Right. Dr. CHEN: . . . you find different languages, in English, in Arabic, and Spanish, and French, and so on. But it's really becoming a very tightly connected Web of the darker nature. PALCA: Mmm. And - I'm just curious, have you stumbled across something that has caused you to think, oh, I might be on to something here? Something that makes you alarmed? Dr. CHEN: Yeah. There's definitely a lot examples of those kind of content that they created. But in particular, you see a lot of Web sites that are very radical and - but extremely popular among those disgruntled set of Muslim young men, and you see the posting and you see this, sort of, the followers of those messages, and that's really very disturbing. We also have seen content in one of our recent analysis of these analyses is IEDs on the dark Web; what are the things that they talk about regarding improvised explosive devices on the Web. PALCA: Right. Uh-huh. Dr. CHEN: And there's - actually, we found out they have seven Web sites that acting as the hubs, disseminating IED-related postings and manuals and videos and so on, and those become very powerful tool to entice their audience. PALCA: Interesting, interesting. Well, let's take another call now. And let's go Kyle(ph) in Aurora, Illinois. Kyle, welcome to the program. KYLE (Caller): Thank you. My question - I can understand crawling Web sites and trying to find the different links of communication or the different connections between them all, but I would think that more sensitive type of information - I mean, wouldn't it be extremely easy for them to just use something like, very widely available encryption methods like OpenSSL, in order to mask, like, more sensitive communications. So I guess, how do they - the things that are kind of broadcast to everyone, like maybe IED explosives, how to make something like that, I understand how to try to find something like that. But let's say that Osama was trying to send, you know, a message to one other person and how would - is there a way we can really even try? PALCA: Right. So in other words, if the content and even if you know that message is being sent, the content may be encrypted. KYLE: Yeah. PALCA: Let me ask Dr. Brooks. What do you think about that? Dr. BROOKS: Well, I think Kyle's question is a good one and our search algorithms for searching the net would not pick up those, because we're looking for more general patterns. But once we did identify the individual, then you would specifically monitor their communications, and then a different team of mathematicians - people more skilled in cryptography than I am - would be able to open those. PALCA: So in other words, you get them to the table and then let somebody else try and figure out what they're doing there. Dr. BROOKS: Yes, yes. PALCA: Okay. Dr. CHEN: Actually, in my experience searching those Web sites and forums, the major proposition right now are really not in those secret communications, because in most cases, they know those Web sites and forums are sometimes monitored by intelligence agencies or research programs. So they're smart. They're cautious. PALCA: Hmm. Dr. CHEN: So, a lot of those communications will be taken offline, from landlines and cell phones and so on. So we don't see a lot of evidence like that. But the biggest values of their Web sites and forum are really serving as a recruiting, incitement and radicalization tools. PALCA: Yeah. Dr. CHEN: So, they are hitting the large populations of the young people. In fact, the head of the idea, not infectious disease, but infectious ideas. PALCA: Right, right. Dr. Chen. . . Dr. CHEN: So those people are not born terrorists, but they get infected. PALCA: Dr. Brooks. . . Dr. BROOKS: Dr. Chen's right to equate the information flow on the Internet with an infectious disease. It's the same mathematics that is used to model epidemics we're using to model information flow over the Internet as one example of a network. And he speaks of these sort of hub connections that the theory shows obviously that those would be the ones to remove if you wanted to slow down the flow of information across that particular net. PALCA: Interesting. Dr. CHEN: That's right. PALCA: You know, there are a group of people who are gathering on the Web actually, as this show is on the air in the Science School area and some of them have posed some questions. So I'm going to ask \"Second Life\" - sorry, \"Second Life\" and the Science School area of \"Second Life. \" And - so we have a question here from Azorro(ph) - well, I'm going to have to guess at the pronunciation, Azorro Todria(ph), who says, given that the net and communications in general have been monitored for some years now, have any useful mathematical models of terrorist communications been developed that would enable new cells to be detected by identifying them from their pattern of behavior, rather than what they actually say? That sounds a little bit like what you're trying to do, Dr. Brooks, isn't it? Dr. BROOKS: Yes, I mean, the quick answer to Mr. Todria's question is yes, that's exactly what we're doing. You don't have to necessarily listen to the content, you can just look for the pattern of communication. Dr. CHEN: Could I say something? PALCA: Yes, sure, Dr. Chen. Dr. CHEN: Well, for computer scientists, we actually - there is a branch of computer science that is dealing with text mining. So, in a content of text mining, as you know that in the forums and chat rooms, there are lot of new ideas and new topic and new ideologies that come up. And this branch of computer science called text mining, almost specifically use natural language processing, we actually look at contents or what do they say, and you can even look at the opinions, like looking at their sentiments. So, that's another branch called opinion mining. These, in the past, have been used to monitor -let's say, people - new put-up reviews and movie ratings, and so on. Do you like it? Do you hate it? PALCA: Oh. Dr. CHEN: So, when you look into the forums, you can actually identify certain forums or Web sites that become more radical and talk about these topics more. You can also identify opinion leaders who are the most radical members who brought idea that are infectious, that are sticky(ph), that people listen to him. In one study we had with one of the forums, before we speak, it has almost like 850,000 posting, that have been collected over the past three or four years. In every single second, there are people on the Web, and yet there are about 60,000 people connecting to this pretty radical Muslim forums, mostly Arabic. But if you can track, in this case, its natural language processing using Arabic text, looking at the sentiment of angers and racial hatred, and with that also look at the search activities or with a combination of mathematical model and natural language processing, you can identify the most critical members, the most critical messages that you really need to pay more attention to. PALCA: Let's take another call now and go to Kate(ph) in Washington, D. C. Kate, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. KATE (Caller): Hi, Joe. How are you? PALCA: Great. KATE: And hello, gentlemen, how are you today? Dr. CHEN: Good. Dr. BROOKS: Hello, we're fine. KATE: Good. Let me just throw a little bit into this. Two things you need to know. Number one, I'm an African-American woman, and number two, I'm a corporate anthropologist. And I deal in both of these arenas, both the social networks as well as computer science. And let me throw something in that I think needs to be developed. Most of what is being viewed now is being viewed, whether it's mathematics or whether it's in computer science, but the populations that are being targeted are populations that are coming out of the imagination, primarily of Western, frightful white men. PALCA: Mm-hmm. KATE: And what that brings - I mean, even though we want to believe that science is objective and that it's all interesting, the bottom line is that many, many ethnic groups in this country have different ways of dealing with one another from cultural perspective - in terms of clusters, chain migration, et cetera. And the problem I have with a lot of this - especially being a black woman in this country - is that you'll get situations like CODIS, like DNA and CODIS, which is the, you know, the DNA database. And you'll get certain things and certain populations where they believe they've got the perp. But no one has gone behind the scenes to see how people actually deal with one another and weight it from a cultural perspective, sufficient that they actually are dealing with the fact that like in some black communities, the sex ratio between men and women - there're so few men, that in many cases some of the children are siblings. So they think they've got the guy with the DNA and it turns out that that neighborhood is full of half-sibs. PALCA: Right. Right. KATE: If you don't know that and if you don't weight it from the perspective of reality, you've targeted a group of people for no other reason than white guys in America are terrified and so they form this thing of what they think they see. And they really don't know what the heck they're doing. PALCA: Well, I think it raises an interesting question, Kate. I want to ask Dr. Brooks what he makes of that. But I also want to - well, first, let's start with Dr. Brooks. That would be interesting. What do you think about what Kate just had to say there? Dr. BROOKS: Well, certainly, just like when Roger asked about the \"Numbers\" program and how - my answer being that they don't find - they don't rely on the mathematics in real life and say that guy is behind the bush. She's right. It has to be combined with actual boots-on-the-ground people. So it's - the mathematics provides a tool that optimizes your search, but it doesn't - it has to be supplemented with. . . PALCA: Yeah. Dr. BROOKS: . . . traditional police work. PALCA: I was thinking that - I mean, Kate's point is a real-world point. And we are talking more theoretically, but we are talking about the marriage of the real world and theory, so I guess it's important to consider what Kate is saying. Thanks very much for calling about that, Kate. KATE: Sure. Dr. BROOKS: There are. . . PALCA: Thank you. Go ahead, Doctor. Dr. BROOKS: We took a - just as an experiment at school, at RIT. We made a social network out of the mathematicians and the psychologists because Dr. DiFonzo is the lead on this rumor research that I'm involved in and he's in the psychology department. So we did an anonymous survey to see who knows whom in both of those departments. And then, I took that social network and I applied a common clustering algorithm, this Newman algorithm. Basically what it does is it divides the network into groups. And I applied it blind, so we didn't know who was a mathematician and who was a psychologist. And it managed to separate out - in two runs, it managed to separate out the psychologists from the mathematicians just on their - just on the basis of who was connected to whom. PALCA: Interesting. We're talking this hour about using computer science and mathematical tools to track terror. I'm Joe Palca. And this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Dr. Chen, I think I might have cut you off there. Did you want to say something? Dr. CHEN: Yeah, I think that's an interesting question. I think when you are studying those - in my case, sort of a cyber activism phenomenon, there's certainly a difference between the virtual world and your real identity, and there are a lot of studies about that. Whether what you talk about in the virtual world is a reflection of your true identity - you could be somebody extremely violent on the virtual space but you are young, gentle kid in school. So there's - certainly, there's that differences of a person's real identity. And this is really, also, complicated by a lot of cultural context. And I think I concur with the previous questions and comments is that you really need to understand the ground truth. But in the phenomena that we're studying, there could be the first generation, Muslim persons, and then they could be the homegrown group. And they could be people in Germany. They could be people in U. K and Canada. And they are all in very different social context. And we have one recent study that we studied the presence of the Muslim woman in somewhat radical forums and what's their role. Again, they are Muslim women. They have a different cultural context, and they are in a cyberspace, so their identity are even more different from their traditional role, but we see a lot of examples that they are not just caring about those radical idea. They may provide some supporting role. But a lot of the issue that they care about are really the women's right and then in how they should be educated at about younger generation. So not all the contents are radical. They actually care about other issues of relevance to them. PALCA: Let me take another question now from the community that's gathered in \"Second Life\" at the Science School. This is one comes from Devlin Yuri(ph) who asked, how about the legal framework for this and how about privacy issues? And I wonder, Dr. Chen, have you had to wrestle with that at all? Dr. CHEN: Oh, all the time. PALCA: Uh-huh. Dr. CHEN: That's really a question number one that we always get. I'm very sensitive about civil liberty issues and, you know, getting into the area - the gray area of, you know, how you identify innocent citizens and so on. In our research, we're very careful, if that is correct, to work with the domain experts or a terrorism researcher looking as a known group that has particular presence. But, you know, when you backtrack, the war of terror is really very politically defined, that clearly, the definition in U. S. is very different from the definition in U. K. versus in China, for example. And I came from Taiwan. There's really no known group of terrorist group in Taiwan. So it's very politically defined - so when you have those terminology, so you really had to be very careful about the content you collect. And since I'm funded by NSF, I'm really doing a scientific study of what are they thinking, why are they doing certain things the way they do. So we have to be careful about collecting the content we have. So as I described earlier, working with those terrorism researcher, we know there are certain known groups identified in this case by the State Department, then we find the linkage to them. And sometimes we really to have avoid using the word terrorist, because we may call you a cyber extremist or cyber activist, but when we do the math, this is not going to - and as I received an e-mail recently - actually a couple of days ago, it asked me, are you searching for innocent communication of U. S. citizens? PALCA: Right. Dr. CHEN: And the answer is no. PALCA: Dr. Chen, I'm afraid we're going to have to stop there because we've run out of time for this segment. But thank you very much for shedding some light on this. And I appreciate it. Dr. Hsinchun Chen is director of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and professor of management information systems at the University of Arizona in Tucson. And I would also like to thank Bernard Brooks. He's professor of mathematics and the head of research programs in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York.  JOE PALCA, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Joe Palca, sitting in for Ira Flatow.  Later in the hour, we'll be taking up a scratchy subject: itch.  But first, if the foiled German terror plot, the latest bin Laden video, and the president's speech last night are any indication - the terrorist threat isn't over.  As intelligence agencies continue to track terrorist activities worldwide, they may have some help from a rather unlikely source - academic mathematicians and computer scientists.  For example, mathematicians have developed theoretical tools that can be used to reveal things like the chain of command in a terrorist cell, or how many volunteers you need to be disable - how many volunteers you need to disable to disrupt the group, or say you want to sift through the massive amounts of information out there in cyberspace looking for terrorist activity.  Computer scientists are used to dealing with mountains of data. They're using those skills to scan e-mails, forum postings and online videos that could reveal an attack in the making.  We'll start the hour today talking about how math and computer science can help track down terrorists.  So if you'd like to join our discussion, give us a call. Our number is 1-800-989-8255, that's 1-800-989-TALK. And if you want more information about what we're talking about this hour, go to our Web site at www. sciencefriday. com, where you'll find links to the topic.  Now, let me introduce my guests. Bernard Brooks is a professor of mathematics and the head of research programs in the School of Mathematics - Mathematical Sciences at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York. He joins me today from the studios of member station WXXI in Rochester.  Welcome to the program, Dr. Brooks.  Dr. BERNARD BROOKS (Mathematics; Head of Research Programs, School of Mathematical Sciences, Rochester Institute of Technology): Thank you. Good afternoon.  PALCA: Good afternoon.  Also with us is Hsinchun Chen. He's the director of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and a professor of management information systems at the University of Arizona in Tucson. He joins me by phone from his office there.  Welcome to the program, Dr. Chen.  Dr. HSINCHUN CHEN (Director, Artificial Intelligence Laboratory; Professor, Management Information Systems, University of Arizona): Hi. Good morning.  PALCA: Good morning, or afternoon, depending on where you're sitting. Well, thanks to both of you for joining us.  Dr. Brooks, maybe we could start with you. The recent - there was this terror plot in Germany that the German officials broke up. How would mathematics or a mathematician be able to help uncover that plot or do something about it?  Dr. BROOKS: Well, mathematics is very useful for optimizing the resources that you have. We're working with - in terrorist hunting, we're working with limited resources and we have to make the best use of it.  If you think about the - let's say the communication network that the terrorists would have used for that particular cell, if that communication network can be monitored and one of the member of the cell can be identified, then we can use some of the algorithms that are useful for searching social networks in order to identify the clique or the terrorist cell.  PALCA: Well, explain what - first of all, what's a social network then?  Dr. BROOKS: It comes out of graph theory, which is an area that - area of mathematics that overlaps with sociology. If you think of a - let's say a fishnet, where the knots are the people and the strings in between the people are the relationships, we get what we refer to as a graph, so that the nodes or the dots are the people, and everybody I know is connected by edges from me to them.  PALCA: Uh-huh.  Dr. BROOKS: Now, once I draw one of these sort of a fishnet or a spider web-type structures, we can identify patterns in it that could correspond to the hierarchical structure of a terrorist cell. Now. . .  PALCA: But don't you need to have some data? I mean where does the data for the connections or the nodes come from to begin with?  Dr. BROOKS: Well that would have to come from monitoring communications building the network.  PALCA: I see. I see. So in other words, if there's someone out there that's collecting this information, you can begin to make sense of it?  Dr. BROOKS: Yes. The science of the study of social networks has to start with the actual network laid down, you're right.  PALCA: Well, maybe I could turn to Dr. Chen, then. Is the work of computer scientists then something that could be gathering that data that maybe Dr. Brooks could use to set up algorithms to find people?  Dr. CHEN: Yeah. I think definitely - I think that's everyone want to see in a little bit. Clearly, the intelligence agency might be collecting data on various groups, various (unintelligible) and so on, and a lot of them are security level data.  But from the computer science or information science viewpoint - a lot of data that can be collected from the Web, especially from a targeted group, and just using my project, a project called Darkweb, which is monitoring the darker side of the Web in this scenario while looking at a lot of the Web sites and forums and bulletin boards, which are heavily used by some of the terrorist group.  So we do collect those data, and some of that may not contain very violent actual operations, but they do give you indication of who is linking to whom and the timing or the kind of surge of activities. So this will become data sources that can be used by the mathematicians to understand the cliques, the spheres and so on.  PALCA: I see. Tell me a little bit more about what you mean when you say dark Web.  Dr. CHEN: The Web is bright, is open, but at the same time, the Web is also dark and also hidden. And when we define \"Dark Web,\" we're really looking at the side of the Web, which has a darker purpose to it, people hiding, as what this could be. Some kinds of crime could be hackers hiding in the Internet, this could be child pornography, this could be extremists or terrorists who are using the Web also for their own purpose, or really, the dark is a relative term - they just hide in the dark. And many of the purposes may be illegal or may be more violent and so on.  PALCA: So how do they - how do the dark Webs elude the kind of search engines like Google or what have you that typically find everything?  Dr. CHEN: Well, most of the search engines, they try to capture, quote, unquote, \"all the contents in the Web,\" but because of the commercial reasons that they need to get pages that will have some commercial values.  So in many cases, they actually don't do exhaustive search. They may be doing a sampling of 20, 30 percent of portion of the Net. But here, as you can see, is the darker side of the Web. So a lot of those Web sites may be dangling, which means they're not connected to anyone. They will not submit their URLs to Google to search. So they're hiding, you know, because they are targeting a particular subset of the society of interest to them. So they are not - they are very difficult to find.  So Google, in most cases, they might have some content, but definitely they only have a very small percentage of those content.  PALCA: We're talking about the use of computer science and mathematical tools to track terror. And we are taking your calls at 1-800-989-8255, that's 1-800-989-TALK.  And, Dr. Brooks, maybe I could turn back to you. So if you - if Dr. Chen's data show - comes to you and it shows that two people are talking, how do you assess, you know, who's on top, who's on the bottom, who's giving the orders, who's carrying them out? How does the mathematical theory account for these things?  Dr. BROOKS: Well, there are search algorithms that look for particular patterns. And the patterns that we would be looking for would be different, depending on whether the cell that we think we're looking for is more of an amateur terrorist cell. If the people knew each other before they set up the terrorist cell, if they set themselves up - if they were just a group of disgruntled individuals, this probably happens more in domestic terrorists.  If you think about five people, they would all have known each other beforehand and wouldn't have the opportunity to set up the optimum, the perfect terrorist cell. So that would manifest itself as a complete subgraph. In other words, five people, they would all know each other. So you would have five dots and out of each one of those dots, the five people, you would have four edges emanating to each other, and that would look like a complete subgraph that you would be looking for.  On the other hand, Jonathan Farley, one of the organizers of the terrorists conference coming up this next week, is - he presented at last year's terrorist conference a mathematical theory that worked with the lattice theory and posets that set up a way to design the optimal terrorist cell. So. . .  PALCA: Do I want to know what posets are or is that - can we just posit that those are something you use in mathematics?  Dr. BROOKS: It's like a graph. . .  PALCA: Uh-huh.  Dr. BROOKS: . . . so that the fishbone - oh, sorry, I'm made it myself - the fishnet structure that I talked about before.  PALCA: Yeah, uh-huh.  Dr. BROOKS: It doesn't have a top or a bottom, whereas a poset would have a top or a bottom. So we're starting to work some hierarchy into these social networks - that's a good way to think about it. And he's set up this optimal terrorist cell in sort of a fishbone-like structure, think of it as a ladder with one leg removed, where commanders have a trusted lieutenant on one side and then the rest of the network below them. And he's designed this so that if it's disrupted in any way - in other words, one of the agents is compromised -then that sort of structure, that sort of network is the most resilient to that sort of compromise or capture of an agent.  PALCA: Oh.  Dr. BROOKS: So if a professional terrorist organization that had the luxury of setting up the perfect command structure, they would choose that sort of thing. So if we're looking for a more professional cell, we would be looking for something similar to that structure.  PALCA: Okay.  Dr. BROOKS: So now as a terrorist organization, I have to make - I would have to make a choice. I would have to say, do I go with the optimal structure, in which case I would be slightly easier to find with these search algorithms, or do I go with the less optimal structure, become a little bit harder to find but easier to compromise when I am found.  PALCA: All right. Well, let's see if our listeners have any questions about this. And let's go first to Roger(ph) in Rockville. Roger, welcome to the program.  ROGER (Caller): Thank you. When I heard the topic of this show, it made me think of the TV show \"Numbers. \"  PALCA: Uh-huh.  ROGER: I wondered whether your guests were familiar with it and whether they thought it was realistic.  PALCA: Hmm. Do - gentlemen, Dr. Brooks, Dr. Chen, do you know this program?  Dr. CHEN: Which program is it?  PALCA: It's called \"Numbers. \"  Dr. CHEN: I'm not familiar with it.  PALCA: Oh. Dr. Brooks?  Dr. BROOKS: I have seen it. It's on Friday nights and one of the organizers, Anthony Harkin, of the conference coming up next week has actually done some consulting for that show.  PALCA: Really? Is it, are they realistic at all? What - first of all, maybe you could give a brief description of what the show is about.  Dr. BROOKS: The show is about an FBI agent and his mathematician brother, and they solve mysteries and crimes using mathematics. He. . .  PALCA: I see. So this has already passed into popular domain?  Dr. BROOKS: Yes. I mean, as a mathematician, it's nice to see the hero of the show being a mathematician. Easy for you. . .  PALCA: Yeah. Next thing you know, they'll have a hero of the show being a radio talk show host. You know, that would really be going out on a limb. Is it realistic, I guess, is Roger's question.  Dr. BROOKS: The mathematics that they use is real. Is it realistic when they do some calculations on a blackboard and discover, oh, the bad person is hiding behind such and such a bush, and the way they catch them at the end of the hour, no. It's. . .  PALCA: You guys are just going to have to work harder, that's all. Well, I'm afraid we're - well, so it has a nodding acquaintance with reality, but not totally realistic. Okay. We have to take a short break. When we come back, we'll be talking more with our guests about using computer science and mathematics to track terrorism. Stay with us.  (Soundbite of music)  PALCA: From NPR News this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca.  We're talking this hour about using math and science to fight terror. My guests are Hsinchun Chen, director of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Arizona in Tucson; and Bernard Brooks, professor of mathematics at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York.  And Dr. Chen, I want to turn to you first and ask - if you don't know what's out there, if people are hiding on the Web, how do you know where to start to look for them?  Dr. CHEN: Well, for computer scientists, definitely, we don't know the terrorism area as good any other terrorism researchers. So the first thing that we do is actually work with those people who have been monitoring those groups for years. And there are some international research groups, there are people in West Point, combating terrorism centers, there are people in other academic institutions. A lot of them are communication researchers, political scientists, and they've been monitoring terrorist groups for some time.  But the problem has been that because of Internet, because of the overwhelming information and communication over in the cyberspace, it's very difficult for them to keep track of this phenomenon. So by working with them, we typically can identify certain groups, identify certain seed URLs, we identify a certain forum that they are aware of. Now, using that as the starting point, then we can do the crawling, so crawling is sort of a spidering term, meaning that search engine do that as what they call the Web.  So, we send computer programs starting with those feed, URLs, to go to other link sites or other forums so we're - just like what Dr. Brooks says - talk about we're casting the net out from initial small patches and then into the bigger connected Web. With that then we use various weighting mechanism to identify other potentially important Web sites and forums that missed, even by those terrorism researchers.  So, even in the collection that we have collected over the past three or four years, we do spidering or crawling about every two or three months, so we collect about four, five collections a year, and we're getting probably thousands of Web sites, hundreds of millions of Web pages, and even close to billions of postings in forums and so on. . .  PALCA: Right.  Dr. CHEN: . . . you find different languages, in English, in Arabic, and Spanish, and French, and so on. But it's really becoming a very tightly connected Web of the darker nature.  PALCA: Mmm. And - I'm just curious, have you stumbled across something that has caused you to think, oh, I might be on to something here? Something that makes you alarmed?  Dr. CHEN: Yeah. There's definitely a lot examples of those kind of content that they created. But in particular, you see a lot of Web sites that are very radical and - but extremely popular among those disgruntled set of Muslim young men, and you see the posting and you see this, sort of, the followers of those messages, and that's really very disturbing. We also have seen content in one of our recent analysis of these analyses is IEDs on the dark Web; what are the things that they talk about regarding improvised explosive devices on the Web.  PALCA: Right. Uh-huh.  Dr. CHEN: And there's - actually, we found out they have seven Web sites that acting as the hubs, disseminating IED-related postings and manuals and videos and so on, and those become very powerful tool to entice their audience.  PALCA: Interesting, interesting. Well, let's take another call now. And let's go Kyle(ph) in Aurora, Illinois. Kyle, welcome to the program.  KYLE (Caller): Thank you. My question - I can understand crawling Web sites and trying to find the different links of communication or the different connections between them all, but I would think that more sensitive type of information - I mean, wouldn't it be extremely easy for them to just use something like, very widely available encryption methods like OpenSSL, in order to mask, like, more sensitive communications.  So I guess, how do they - the things that are kind of broadcast to everyone, like maybe IED explosives, how to make something like that, I understand how to try to find something like that. But let's say that Osama was trying to send, you know, a message to one other person and how would - is there a way we can really even try?  PALCA: Right. So in other words, if the content and even if you know that message is being sent, the content may be encrypted.  KYLE: Yeah.  PALCA: Let me ask Dr. Brooks. What do you think about that?  Dr. BROOKS: Well, I think Kyle's question is a good one and our search algorithms for searching the net would not pick up those, because we're looking for more general patterns. But once we did identify the individual, then you would specifically monitor their communications, and then a different team of mathematicians - people more skilled in cryptography than I am - would be able to open those.  PALCA: So in other words, you get them to the table and then let somebody else try and figure out what they're doing there.  Dr. BROOKS: Yes, yes.  PALCA: Okay.  Dr. CHEN: Actually, in my experience searching those Web sites and forums, the major proposition right now are really not in those secret communications, because in most cases, they know those Web sites and forums are sometimes monitored by intelligence agencies or research programs. So they're smart. They're cautious.  PALCA: Hmm.  Dr. CHEN: So, a lot of those communications will be taken offline, from landlines and cell phones and so on. So we don't see a lot of evidence like that. But the biggest values of their Web sites and forum are really serving as a recruiting, incitement and radicalization tools.  PALCA: Yeah.  Dr. CHEN: So, they are hitting the large populations of the young people. In fact, the head of the idea, not infectious disease, but infectious ideas.  PALCA: Right, right. Dr. Chen. . .  Dr. CHEN: So those people are not born terrorists, but they get infected.  PALCA: Dr. Brooks. . .  Dr. BROOKS: Dr. Chen's right to equate the information flow on the Internet with an infectious disease. It's the same mathematics that is used to model epidemics we're using to model information flow over the Internet as one example of a network. And he speaks of these sort of hub connections that the theory shows obviously that those would be the ones to remove if you wanted to slow down the flow of information across that particular net.  PALCA: Interesting.  Dr. CHEN: That's right.  PALCA: You know, there are a group of people who are gathering on the Web actually, as this show is on the air in the Science School area and some of them have posed some questions. So I'm going to ask \"Second Life\" - sorry, \"Second Life\" and the Science School area of \"Second Life. \"  And - so we have a question here from Azorro(ph) - well, I'm going to have to guess at the pronunciation, Azorro Todria(ph), who says, given that the net and communications in general have been monitored for some years now, have any useful mathematical models of terrorist communications been developed that would enable new cells to be detected by identifying them from their pattern of behavior, rather than what they actually say? That sounds a little bit like what you're trying to do, Dr. Brooks, isn't it?  Dr. BROOKS: Yes, I mean, the quick answer to Mr. Todria's question is yes, that's exactly what we're doing. You don't have to necessarily listen to the content, you can just look for the pattern of communication.  Dr. CHEN: Could I say something?  PALCA: Yes, sure, Dr. Chen.  Dr. CHEN: Well, for computer scientists, we actually - there is a branch of computer science that is dealing with text mining. So, in a content of text mining, as you know that in the forums and chat rooms, there are lot of new ideas and new topic and new ideologies that come up. And this branch of computer science called text mining, almost specifically use natural language processing, we actually look at contents or what do they say, and you can even look at the opinions, like looking at their sentiments. So, that's another branch called opinion mining. These, in the past, have been used to monitor -let's say, people - new put-up reviews and movie ratings, and so on. Do you like it? Do you hate it?  PALCA: Oh.  Dr. CHEN: So, when you look into the forums, you can actually identify certain forums or Web sites that become more radical and talk about these topics more. You can also identify opinion leaders who are the most radical members who brought idea that are infectious, that are sticky(ph), that people listen to him.  In one study we had with one of the forums, before we speak, it has almost like 850,000 posting, that have been collected over the past three or four years. In every single second, there are people on the Web, and yet there are about 60,000 people connecting to this pretty radical Muslim forums, mostly Arabic. But if you can track, in this case, its natural language processing using Arabic text, looking at the sentiment of angers and racial hatred, and with that also look at the search activities or with a combination of mathematical model and natural language processing, you can identify the most critical members, the most critical messages that you really need to pay more attention to.  PALCA: Let's take another call now and go to Kate(ph) in Washington, D. C. Kate, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  KATE (Caller): Hi, Joe. How are you?  PALCA: Great.  KATE: And hello, gentlemen, how are you today?  Dr. CHEN: Good.  Dr. BROOKS: Hello, we're fine.  KATE: Good. Let me just throw a little bit into this. Two things you need to know. Number one, I'm an African-American woman, and number two, I'm a corporate anthropologist. And I deal in both of these arenas, both the social networks as well as computer science. And let me throw something in that I think needs to be developed. Most of what is being viewed now is being viewed, whether it's mathematics or whether it's in computer science, but the populations that are being targeted are populations that are coming out of the imagination, primarily of Western, frightful white men.  PALCA: Mm-hmm.  KATE: And what that brings - I mean, even though we want to believe that science is objective and that it's all interesting, the bottom line is that many, many ethnic groups in this country have different ways of dealing with one another from cultural perspective - in terms of clusters, chain migration, et cetera. And the problem I have with a lot of this - especially being a black woman in this country - is that you'll get situations like CODIS, like DNA and CODIS, which is the, you know, the DNA database. And you'll get certain things and certain populations where they believe they've got the perp.  But no one has gone behind the scenes to see how people actually deal with one another and weight it from a cultural perspective, sufficient that they actually are dealing with the fact that like in some black communities, the sex ratio between men and women - there're so few men, that in many cases some of the children are siblings. So they think they've got the guy with the DNA and it turns out that that neighborhood is full of half-sibs.  PALCA: Right. Right.  KATE: If you don't know that and if you don't weight it from the perspective of reality, you've targeted a group of people for no other reason than white guys in America are terrified and so they form this thing of what they think they see. And they really don't know what the heck they're doing.  PALCA: Well, I think it raises an interesting question, Kate. I want to ask Dr. Brooks what he makes of that. But I also want to - well, first, let's start with Dr. Brooks. That would be interesting. What do you think about what Kate just had to say there?  Dr. BROOKS: Well, certainly, just like when Roger asked about the \"Numbers\" program and how - my answer being that they don't find - they don't rely on the mathematics in real life and say that guy is behind the bush. She's right. It has to be combined with actual boots-on-the-ground people. So it's - the mathematics provides a tool that optimizes your search, but it doesn't - it has to be supplemented with. . .  PALCA: Yeah.  Dr. BROOKS: . . . traditional police work.  PALCA: I was thinking that - I mean, Kate's point is a real-world point. And we are talking more theoretically, but we are talking about the marriage of the real world and theory, so I guess it's important to consider what Kate is saying. Thanks very much for calling about that, Kate.  KATE: Sure.  Dr. BROOKS: There are. . .  PALCA: Thank you. Go ahead, Doctor.  Dr. BROOKS: We took a - just as an experiment at school, at RIT. We made a social network out of the mathematicians and the psychologists because Dr. DiFonzo is the lead on this rumor research that I'm involved in and he's in the psychology department. So we did an anonymous survey to see who knows whom in both of those departments. And then, I took that social network and I applied a common clustering algorithm, this Newman algorithm. Basically what it does is it divides the network into groups. And I applied it blind, so we didn't know who was a mathematician and who was a psychologist. And it managed to separate out - in two runs, it managed to separate out the psychologists from the mathematicians just on their - just on the basis of who was connected to whom.  PALCA: Interesting. We're talking this hour about using computer science and mathematical tools to track terror.  I'm Joe Palca. And this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  Dr. Chen, I think I might have cut you off there. Did you want to say something?  Dr. CHEN: Yeah, I think that's an interesting question. I think when you are studying those - in my case, sort of a cyber activism phenomenon, there's certainly a difference between the virtual world and your real identity, and there are a lot of studies about that. Whether what you talk about in the virtual world is a reflection of your true identity - you could be somebody extremely violent on the virtual space but you are young, gentle kid in school. So there's - certainly, there's that differences of a person's real identity. And this is really, also, complicated by a lot of cultural context.  And I think I concur with the previous questions and comments is that you really need to understand the ground truth. But in the phenomena that we're studying, there could be the first generation, Muslim persons, and then they could be the homegrown group. And they could be people in Germany. They could be people in U. K and Canada. And they are all in very different social context.  And we have one recent study that we studied the presence of the Muslim woman in somewhat radical forums and what's their role. Again, they are Muslim women. They have a different cultural context, and they are in a cyberspace, so their identity are even more different from their traditional role, but we see a lot of examples that they are not just caring about those radical idea. They may provide some supporting role. But a lot of the issue that they care about are really the women's right and then in how they should be educated at about younger generation. So not all the contents are radical. They actually care about other issues of relevance to them.  PALCA: Let me take another question now from the community that's gathered in \"Second Life\" at the Science School. This is one comes from Devlin Yuri(ph) who asked, how about the legal framework for this and how about privacy issues? And I wonder, Dr. Chen, have you had to wrestle with that at all?  Dr. CHEN: Oh, all the time.  PALCA: Uh-huh.  Dr. CHEN: That's really a question number one that we always get. I'm very sensitive about civil liberty issues and, you know, getting into the area - the gray area of, you know, how you identify innocent citizens and so on. In our research, we're very careful, if that is correct, to work with the domain experts or a terrorism researcher looking as a known group that has particular presence. But, you know, when you backtrack, the war of terror is really very politically defined, that clearly, the definition in U. S. is very different from the definition in U. K. versus in China, for example. And I came from Taiwan. There's really no known group of terrorist group in Taiwan.  So it's very politically defined - so when you have those terminology, so you really had to be very careful about the content you collect. And since I'm funded by NSF, I'm really doing a scientific study of what are they thinking, why are they doing certain things the way they do. So we have to be careful about collecting the content we have.  So as I described earlier, working with those terrorism researcher, we know there are certain known groups identified in this case by the State Department, then we find the linkage to them. And sometimes we really to have avoid using the word terrorist, because we may call you a cyber extremist or cyber activist, but when we do the math, this is not going to - and as I received an e-mail recently - actually a couple of days ago, it asked me, are you searching for innocent communication of U. S. citizens?  PALCA: Right.  Dr. CHEN: And the answer is no.  PALCA: Dr. Chen, I'm afraid we're going to have to stop there because we've run out of time for this segment. But thank you very much for shedding some light on this. And I appreciate it.  Dr. Hsinchun Chen is director of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and professor of management information systems at the University of Arizona in Tucson. And I would also like to thank Bernard Brooks. He's professor of mathematics and the head of research programs in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York.

I'm Joe Palca sitting in for Ira Flatow. Last Sunday, millions of NFL fans saw Buffalo Bills' football player Kevin Everett tackle a Denver Broncos player and then fall facedown on the turf, unable to move. Everett, we later learned, had damaged his spinal cord. As he was being rushed to the hospital in an ambulance, doctors tried an experimental treatment on him. They pumped cold saline into him to lower his body temperature. Some are saying that inducing hypothermia may have helped limit the damage to Mr. Everett's spinal cord. So should everyone who suffers a spinal cord injury be treated with hypothermia? Joining me now to talk more about this is my guest, Dr. John McDonald. He is the director of the International Center for Spinal Cord Injury at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. He joins me by phone. Welcome to the program, Dr. McDonald. Dr. JOHN McDONALD (Director of the International Center for Spinal Cord Injury at the Kennedy Krieger Institute): Oh, glad to help out. PALCA: So what was the point of using this cold saline on this football player's injury? What were they - what were doctors trying to accomplish with this? Dr. McDONALD: Yeah. And then, you know, let me discuss and I'd like to back up and talk about the factors that contributed to his good recovery to date. PALCA: Okay. Dr. McDONALD: Research in animals and in culture dishes have demonstrated that if you lower the temperature, that molecular mechanisms go slower - those molecular mechanisms that are involved in progressing the injury. So when you have a trauma to the spinal cord that's just the beginning of the injury, and it evolves over the next 24 hours. So if you can intervene in the minutes to hours after the injury and prevent its progression, you can limit a lot of the eventual dysfunction. So now, although this has not been proven in humans, they've first started using hypothermia in trials in brain injury and that's come up with equivocal results, so there's no evidence to support its use in humans yet. Now we do use it in other areas. So when we have to arrest the heart to treat aneurysms and other brain and heart issues, they lower the body temperature tremendously, much more than they did in Mr. Everett's case. But - so suffice it to say that there's experimental evidence that hasn't been proven in humans yet, it says that you can lower the body temperature slightly and perhaps there's an improvement and there's not that much of a risk. If you lower the body temperature tremendously, there's a lot of risks, but they didn't do that in this case. But let me back up and say why I believe he's done so well. First, he had exemplary treatment from the moment he was injured through the acute surgery. So I believe there's two factors that are critical for his early success. The first one is the fact that he was treated with another drug, methylprednisolone, nearly immediately. PALCA: Is that a steroid kind of drug? Dr. McDONALD: That's right. PALCA: And it reduces inflammation? Dr. McDONALD: Yeah, this is a drug that's been shown in multicenter clinical trials in spinal cord injury to show some benefit - although it's a small benefit. But keep in mind that the average individual that has trauma to the spinal cord, it nearly takes four and a half hours before they receive that drug. The difference with the NFL - the NFL has done a wonderful job over the past decade - those - the NFL players that have spinal cord injuries can receive that drug in as low as 15 minutes. In the animal studies, if you treat the animals that have a spinal cord injury with this drug, it works very effectively in the first half hour. And then it very quickly wanes off in terms of effectiveness. So if you give it at that same time when most humans get it, four and a half hours, in an animal, it's not very effective. But if you give them the first 15 minutes, you can block three-quarters of the progression of the injury. PALCA: So you sound like you're suggesting that that may have been the more important variable in the treatment than the cool saline. Dr. McDONALD: Yes. And there is a second thing. Let me finish. The second thing is that he had the best of care in emergency technicians and then initially at the hospital. They did emergent decompression surgery. So the more compelling evidence at the basic science level in animals and early evidence in humans suggest that early decompression of the spinal cord is a critical event. PALCA: And what do you mean by decompression? Dr. McDONALD: Yeah, let me explain. So what happens after an injury to the spinal cord, the spine breaks and is now pinching the spinal cord. But just like if someone punches you in the eye, the spinal cord rapidly swells and now it's in this fixed bony canal called the spinal canal, but some of those fragments that are broken are pushing on the spinal cord. If you can release that pressure, the - you can limit the secondary progression of injury. What happens is that additional pressure causes more of a stroke and leads to further progression of the injury. So early decompression and then surgical stabilization, where they go in and they put hardware in and make the spine stable, that also allows very early rehabilitation. So Mr. Everett had the best of care from the minute on the field to the NFL and the work that they've done ahead of time. They were prepared for these accidents. PALCA: Right. Dr. McDONALD: Then the emergency medical technicians did everything right in terms of stabilizing the spine and not worsening the injury by inappropriately moving the head. And then at the hospital, they also did the right thing. They operated immediately. PALCA: Right. Dr. McDONALD: On the average, most people are not operated on in the first 12 hours, you know, we're trying to change that. So the two biggest factors where there's good scientific evidence to support their benefit is the early delivery of the methylprednisolone, the drug that reduces, slowing an edema and then the second one is the early surgery and decompression. Now let me say a few things about hypothermia. So I laid out the basic science evidence in support of this. They've done limited trials of this in traumatic brain injury where it has not proven to be a benefit, but that's just the first try. It has not been trialed in spinal cord injury adequately. So suffice it to say, there's no evidence out there that in humans, this is of benefit. Now - but there is scientific evidence at the basic science level to say it may help, and it may have helped. But I can tell you that it's a distant third in terms of benefits compared to the early delivery of methylprednisolone and the early surgery and decompression. Those two things account for three-quarters, at minimum, of his enhanced recovery. PALCA: I see. So in a sense, it's not - this is not something that's going to be available, all three of these things that you mentioned, perhaps maybe the early surgery, but this is an unusual circumstance where you basically have medical professionals watching an event unfold so that if something happens, they can pounce and do what they do best. Dr. McDONALD: That's right. But we can take advantage of this, you know, we had a patient, Sam Schmidt, who was injured at Indy 500 racing accident. And, unfortunately, they weren't prepared. They didn't have methylprednisolone. Now, methylprednisolone is at all IRL racing tracks. You know, methylprednisolone needs to be at all the football games at college and at high school. They need to prepare and practice these things like the NFL did. And this is doable. It is also doable for people to receive methylprednisolone in the field. So why is it that the average person that has trauma from a motor vehicle accidents, it takes four and a half hours to receive methylprednisolone? Well, the EMTs in the field can't deliver it because it needs to be mixed up right away, and it's an unstable compound. So they have to wait until they get to the hospital. They need to be assessed then the order needs to go into the pharmacy. The pharmacy mixes it up. By the time all that happens, they've missed the window of opportunity. It is, however, possible - and there's precedence for this - you can create a multi-break bag so that it keeps the drug's stability. All the emergency technician would need to do is break the seal between the two bags and they could deliver it in the field. PALCA: Well, it sounds like there may be some good news to come out of this for the future, Dr. McDonald. Thank you very much for joining us and explaining this to us.

Did you stand there soaking up the aroma, wondering why old food gets stinky? Probably not, but some people do. And they are subject of today's Science Out of the Box. (Soundbite of music) ADAMS: NPR's John Nielsen has the story about a team of scientists that spent three years studying a very unusual idea about why dead fish stink. (Soundbite of birds) JOHN NIELSEN: I'm at a fish market on the Anacostia River in Washington, D. C. A small one, but it's pretty active especially early in the morning. The people who own the various stalls here do not want to talk to me, and I can understand that. I mean, who would want to talk to a reporter who tells them he's doing a story about stinky fish. But the customers aren't so shy. How come these things (unintelligible)? BOYD(ph) (Customer, Fish Market, Washington, D. C. ): I've got some big fish, raw fish, mac. NIELSEN: Boyd says he knows the fish in his bag are fresh because their eyes are clear and because they do not stink. He says he wouldn't touch a fish that had the smell of rot upon it. Except for dead bodies, there is no smell he hates more than rotting fish. But why exactly is the smell of rotting fish so bad? Has Boyd ever wondered about that? BOYD: No. Not really. Mmm-mmm. No. Unidentified Man: They just do. BOYD: Because they're fish. Unidentified Man: Yeah. NIELSEN: Until recently, because they are fish and - I don't know but ask your mother - are about the only responses you could get to questions about why rotting fish stink. Mark Hay, a biologist with the Georgia Institute of Technology, says nobody seem to want to know. Professor MARK HAY (Linda and Harry Teasely Chair, Environmental Biology, Georgia Institute of Technology): Things rot. And we think that that's just the way the world is. There's gravity. Things rot. You know, sunlight comes from above. And we don't ask why. NIELSEN: Then three years ago, Hay set out to test an interesting idea about why fish stink. It holds that the skanky smell associated with dead fish is made not by some unimportant natural process, but by a clever trick pulled off by microbes that like to eat the dead fish. Hay had a hunch that the microbes had evolved to produce smells that drive off competitors. In other words\u2026 Prof. HAY: The rotten smell, I would argue, is not God's way of saying, you know, this is bad for you, stay away from it. It's the microbes way of saying this is mine. Don't touch it. NIELSEN: To test this idea, Hay asked his graduate students to fill a bunch of plastic baby pools they bought at Toys \"R\" Us with loads of dead fish - some were fresh and some were horrifically smelly. They then lowered the so-called pools of death into the water to see what got eaten up by the live fish and live crabs. The fresh fish in the baby pools drew a lot more interest. Deron Burkepile, now a biologist with Yale University, helped to run this stench-related fieldwork. Mr. DERON BURKEPILE (Biologist, Yale University): And, you know, when I first thought of it, I really didn't think that I'd spend the summer retching into a basin in the lab. I didn't really think it through very well. NIELSEN: Burkepile says he's proud of the work he did with all those dead fish, even though the stench came close to ruining his life. His colleagues at the marine lab barred his entire team from working during the day, at one point, because they smelled so bad. Mr. BURKEPILE: Eventually, you know, it was kind of useless to shower because we just smell like dead fish all the time. Go out for a beer at the end of the day, there is this kind of halo around us at the bar - the halo of death, I guess. NIELSEN: A report on Hay's research has been published by the journal Ecology. And although it might seem esoteric to you and me, Hay says it might end up having some important real-world applications. Prof. HAY: If you look at it, we lose about a third of all food production worldwide, a third of our agricultural products, to pests at one sort or another, and much of that - although people think about insects primarily - much of it is lost to microbes. NIELSEN: In other words, if scientists can learn to slow down the microbes that make food like fish all smelly, they might also be able to keep food fresher for longer. John Nielsen, NPR News, Washington.  NOAH ADAMS, host:  When was the last time you opened your refrigerator and got hit in the face by the smell of something rotten? Did you stand there soaking up the aroma, wondering why old food gets stinky? Probably not, but some people do. And they are subject of today's Science Out of the Box.  (Soundbite of music)  ADAMS: NPR's John Nielsen has the story about a team of scientists that spent three years studying a very unusual idea about why dead fish stink.  (Soundbite of birds)  JOHN NIELSEN: I'm at a fish market on the Anacostia River in Washington, D. C. A small one, but it's pretty active especially early in the morning. The people who own the various stalls here do not want to talk to me, and I can understand that. I mean, who would want to talk to a reporter who tells them he's doing a story about stinky fish. But the customers aren't so shy.  How come these things (unintelligible)?  BOYD(ph) (Customer, Fish Market, Washington, D. C. ): I've got some big fish, raw fish, mac.  NIELSEN: Boyd says he knows the fish in his bag are fresh because their eyes are clear and because they do not stink. He says he wouldn't touch a fish that had the smell of rot upon it. Except for dead bodies, there is no smell he hates more than rotting fish.  But why exactly is the smell of rotting fish so bad? Has Boyd ever wondered about that?  BOYD: No. Not really. Mmm-mmm. No.  Unidentified Man: They just do.  BOYD: Because they're fish.  Unidentified Man: Yeah.  NIELSEN: Until recently, because they are fish and - I don't know but ask your mother - are about the only responses you could get to questions about why rotting fish stink.  Mark Hay, a biologist with the Georgia Institute of Technology, says nobody seem to want to know.  Professor MARK HAY (Linda and Harry Teasely Chair, Environmental Biology, Georgia Institute of Technology): Things rot. And we think that that's just the way the world is. There's gravity. Things rot. You know, sunlight comes from above. And we don't ask why.  NIELSEN: Then three years ago, Hay set out to test an interesting idea about why fish stink. It holds that the skanky smell associated with dead fish is made not by some unimportant natural process, but by a clever trick pulled off by microbes that like to eat the dead fish. Hay had a hunch that the microbes had evolved to produce smells that drive off competitors. In other words\u2026  Prof. HAY: The rotten smell, I would argue, is not God's way of saying, you know, this is bad for you, stay away from it. It's the microbes way of saying this is mine. Don't touch it.  NIELSEN: To test this idea, Hay asked his graduate students to fill a bunch of plastic baby pools they bought at Toys \"R\" Us with loads of dead fish - some were fresh and some were horrifically smelly. They then lowered the so-called pools of death into the water to see what got eaten up by the live fish and live crabs. The fresh fish in the baby pools drew a lot more interest.  Deron Burkepile, now a biologist with Yale University, helped to run this stench-related fieldwork.  Mr. DERON BURKEPILE (Biologist, Yale University): And, you know, when I first thought of it, I really didn't think that I'd spend the summer retching into a basin in the lab. I didn't really think it through very well.  NIELSEN: Burkepile says he's proud of the work he did with all those dead fish, even though the stench came close to ruining his life. His colleagues at the marine lab barred his entire team from working during the day, at one point, because they smelled so bad.

FOGARTY: That's called vertical evacuation. In Japan, some towns have taken to this idea by building escape towers, like big lighthouses. Cox's research shows that could save people in parts of the real town of seaside. Prof. COX: The time that it takes to evacuate from there is roughly the same amount of time that it takes for the tsunami to come. FOGARTY: There are warning systems along the West Coast, but nearly three years after the Indian Ocean tsunami, there's still no uniform notification system. In Oregon State University, researcher Harry Yeh says in a big earthquake, every one will know what's happening. Dr. HARRY YEH (Environmental and Civil Engineering, Oregon State University): If you have a strong, real big, strong ground shaking, I do not know how reliable that official one system will work. FOGARTY: Yeh simulated two evacuations of seaside: One with those Japanese style escape towers and one without. He found at least 1,600 would die if seaside depended solely on people fleeing town. But 200 people would die if residents could escape to those towers.

Joining us now is the manager of the Cryos sperm bank, Claus Rodgaard. Welcome to the program. Mr. CLAUS RODGAARD (Cryos International): Thank you very much. BRAND: Well, first explain this ban. Mad cow disease is this brain-eating disease in cattle and when people eat contaminated beef, they can get Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. How would that affect the sperm? Mr. RODGAARD: Well, we don't think that it affects the sperm at all. This has also been backed up by the World Health Organization. There's absolutely nothing indicating that it's possible. So\u2026 BRAND: So mad cow is not a sexually transmitted disease? Mr. RODGAARD: No, it is not. BRAND: Okay. But still, the ban is in effect. Mr. RODGAARD: Yes. BRAND: How is it affecting your business? Mr. RODGAARD: Well, it's completely stopped the import of any sperm from Europe. You know, it has a quite dramatic effect on our business. The only reason why we're still here is because we've actually opened also for donations here in New York. BRAND: So you're no longer the leading Scandinavian sperm bank? Mr. RODGAARD: We are in a way because we still have a little supply left, and I guess it doesn't take much nowadays, since you can't import sperm from Europe anymore. BRAND: Well, is it that desirable to have Scandinavian sperm? Mr. RODGAARD: We are part of one of the biggest sperm banks located in Denmark, and when you only have offices in Denmark, you're going to have mostly guys from Denmark donating. And then back in the '90s, it just happened by coincidence that we found out there was a demand here and we decided to help the patients here in the United States. BRAND: Well, now what are they getting? A woman comes in and she's just going to get ordinary American sperm? Mr. RODGAARD: Well, I wouldn't call it ordinary. We've already seen a lot of great donors here in New York. But sperm banking, it's not about creating this designed baby or anything. What it's all about is people are trying to find a donor that matches themself, which me being an Danish guy, if my sperm didn't work, I of course would love to do a photo match and find a donor that looked like me. BRAND: So there aren't similar bans in other countries? Just here? Mr. RODGAARD: No. There's nobody that has any ban that resembles this ban. BRAND: If a woman wants some good, hearty Danish stock\u2026 Mr. RODGAARD: Yes. BRAND: \u2026they just go to Denmark and\u2026 Mr. RODGAARD: They can do that, yeah.

They're under investigation for allegedly kidnapping, sexually assaulting and torturing Megan Williams, a 20-year-old African-American woman. Among the questions, how will this woman recover from the trauma that she suffered? To talk about strategies for healing, we've got Carolyn Moore. She's a licensed clinical psychologist and director of counseling at North Carolina Central University. Welcome, Carolyn. Dr. CAROLYN MOORE (Clinical Psychologist; Director of Counseling, North Carolina Central University): Thank you. CHIDEYA: So what is the emotional healing process going to look like for Ms. Williams? What kind of help will she need? What can she expect? Dr. MOORE: Well, this will be probably a very lengthy process for her. She will need to, first, decide that she wants to go through the process. And that's not easy, because really talking about what has happened to her will often bring back all of the painful feelings of abuse and trauma that she endured. She needs a lot of emotional support. Initially, it could be crisis counseling or later individual or longer-term therapy. She may see a minister, she may seek a support group, but whichever, she needs to have people around her who can support her in her recovery from this extremely traumatic event. CHIDEYA: Now, there's a question on the table, Ms. Williams' mother released her daughter's name to the public even though in general sexual assault victims don't have that done. Is that healthy you think for Ms. Williams? Dr. MOORE: Well, what, actually, I think is that talking can be a very important part of a person's healing. However, when it comes to public acknowledgement, it really needs to be that person's decision. So much of power and control is taken away from a victim during a sexual or physical assault. And what they really need as part of the healing is to be empowered. And if they choose to tell - if they choose to release their information, it needs to be something that they have made a conscious decision about themselves. CHIDEYA: Now for Ms. Williams, could the addition of race and racism make this rape more traumatic? Dr. MOORE: Absolutely. I mean, rape and sexual assault are very traumatic events any way. There are all kinds of difficulties: emotional, behavioral, cognitive, and all areas of life in relating to other people that can come from being traumatized sexually and physically. However, when you add on top of that an interracial incident, it really complicates it even more. As African-American women, you know, we have a common history of slavery in the United States. And part of that slavery did include rape by white slave owners and other white men systematically. And those kinds of events really affect the entire community especially other African-American women. CHIDEYA: Now, when you think about - you mentioned the legacy of slavery, which is something that's been carried over generations, but what about today when people who are readers, listeners, viewers of news hear about a case like that, do they recall trauma in their own lives? Could they be traumatized simply by plugging into a story like this? Dr. MOORE: Absolutely. They can recall a trauma that they've actually experienced or the - there is a collective unconscious that we share, and therefore when you hear about something like this happening to an individual that you have something very much in common with like race, especially if it's assumed to be a hate crime, then it makes you feel vulnerable, fearful and can bring on symptoms of anxiety and depression. CHIDEYA: Now how do African-American women fare when it comes to reporting rape, getting counseling, what's the general prospect for an African-American woman versus someone from, you know, a white community? Dr. MOORE: Well, rape and sexual assault are underreported crimes regardless of race. Survivors think that they won't be believed or that people will blame them. They may fear some kind of retribution from others or just may not want to burden other people with what's going on with them. And black women in particular seem to underreport. Because of the history of black people with mistreatment of the legal and criminal justice system, oftentimes, black women feel that they are not going to be - not going to fare well and don't trust the legal system. And getting back to that whole history and legacy of slavery, black women were not considered women and therefore they could do whatever they wanted. And therefore, they did not - reporting wasn't even an option. CHIDEYA: Think about your experiences as a psychologist. I'm not asking you to tell a specific woman's story, but if someone walked into you and said, I've been raped, I've been brutalized, I don't want to tell anyone. What would you tell that woman? Dr. MOORE: Well, first, I would want them - the fact they're in my office means that they are telling someone. They are telling me. And I would get them to tell me their story and we will work on what their feelings were about what's going on with them. I would help to normalize those feelings, help them understand what others in their situations have gone through and be an emotional support for them. If they say they're not interested in taking any further than that, then I have to support that. I have to be there for them. I can tell them what other people have experienced in the process of going forth. But if they choose not to, I can't do anything about that. I will support them. CHIDEYA: Well, Carolyn, thank you so much for sharing your wisdom with us. Dr. MOORE: You're quite welcome.

She may see a minister, she may seek a support group, but whichever, she needs to have people around her who can support her in her recovery from this extremely traumatic event.  CHIDEYA: Now, there's a question on the table, Ms. Williams' mother released her daughter's name to the public even though in general sexual assault victims don't have that done. Is that healthy you think for Ms. Williams?  Dr. MOORE: Well, what, actually, I think is that talking can be a very important part of a person's healing. However, when it comes to public acknowledgement, it really needs to be that person's decision. So much of power and control is taken away from a victim during a sexual or physical assault.  And what they really need as part of the healing is to be empowered. And if they choose to tell - if they choose to release their information, it needs to be something that they have made a conscious decision about themselves.  CHIDEYA: Now for Ms. Williams, could the addition of race and racism make this rape more traumatic?  Dr. MOORE: Absolutely. I mean, rape and sexual assault are very traumatic events any way. There are all kinds of difficulties: emotional, behavioral, cognitive, and all areas of life in relating to other people that can come from being traumatized sexually and physically.  However, when you add on top of that an interracial incident, it really complicates it even more. As African-American women, you know, we have a common history of slavery in the United States. And part of that slavery did include rape by white slave owners and other white men systematically. And those kinds of events really affect the entire community especially other African-American women.  CHIDEYA: Now, when you think about - you mentioned the legacy of slavery, which is something that's been carried over generations, but what about today when people who are readers, listeners, viewers of news hear about a case like that, do they recall trauma in their own lives? Could they be traumatized simply by plugging into a story like this?  Dr. MOORE: Absolutely. They can recall a trauma that they've actually experienced or the - there is a collective unconscious that we share, and therefore when you hear about something like this happening to an individual that you have something very much in common with like race, especially if it's assumed to be a hate crime, then it makes you feel vulnerable, fearful and can bring on symptoms of anxiety and depression.  CHIDEYA: Now how do African-American women fare when it comes to reporting rape, getting counseling, what's the general prospect for an African-American woman versus someone from, you know, a white community?  Dr. MOORE: Well, rape and sexual assault are underreported crimes regardless of race. Survivors think that they won't be believed or that people will blame them. They may fear some kind of retribution from others or just may not want to burden other people with what's going on with them.  And black women in particular seem to underreport. Because of the history of black people with mistreatment of the legal and criminal justice system, oftentimes, black women feel that they are not going to be - not going to fare well and don't trust the legal system.  And getting back to that whole history and legacy of slavery, black women were not considered women and therefore they could do whatever they wanted. And therefore, they did not - reporting wasn't even an option.  CHIDEYA: Think about your experiences as a psychologist. I'm not asking you to tell a specific woman's story, but if someone walked into you and said, I've been raped, I've been brutalized, I don't want to tell anyone. What would you tell that woman?  Dr. MOORE: Well, first, I would want them - the fact they're in my office means that they are telling someone. They are telling me. And I would get them to tell me their story and we will work on what their feelings were about what's going on with them. I would help to normalize those feelings, help them understand what others in their situations have gone through and be an emotional support for them.  If they say they're not interested in taking any further than that, then I have to support that. I have to be there for them. I can tell them what other people have experienced in the process of going forth. But if they choose not to, I can't do anything about that. I will support them.  CHIDEYA: Well, Carolyn, thank you so much for sharing your wisdom with us.  Dr. MOORE: You're quite welcome.

I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, host: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Good morning. When Hillary Clinton introduced a health care plan this week, she addressed an issue that's widely expected to be important in 2008. It's especially important for her since she led a failed effort for national health insurance in the '90s. Many candidates are proposing ways to cover 47 million Americans without insurance. But some states may be getting ahead of that long-running federal debate. And that number, 47 million, could shrink by the time the next president takes office. MONTAGNE: It all depends on what happens, in particular, here in California where Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has called a special session of the legislature to work out a statewide health care plan. As NPR's Ina Jaffe reports, the plan would cover the 6. 5 million Californians without insurance. INA JAFFE: Arnold Schwarzenegger likes to talk about bipartisan, even post-partisan government. But that's generally meant that the Republican governor works out a deal with the Democrats who control the legislature while his fellow Republicans sit on the sidelines - and that seems to be the case now with health care reform. Listen to him introduce Democrat and Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez at a recent event in Los Angeles. Governor ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (Republican, California): This man is a great friend of mine. He is a hardworking man. And he always makes decisions that are right for the people of California. This is why I call him my partner, and this is why I'm looking forward to this next week or two where we will negotiate and work so that we have true health care reform. So please welcome, Speaker Nunez. JAFFE: Who then praised Schwarzenegger's ability to martial support for health care reform from hospitals and business associations and other disparate groups. Nunez didn't even mind that the governor is going to veto a health care plan his Democrats already passed. Right now, said the speaker, he and Schwarzenegger are working shoulder-to-shoulder to come up with a compromise. Speaker FABIAN NUNEZ (Democrat, California; California State Assembly): I said, if it were up to the governor and I, we can do it in 15 minutes. Mr. ROGER NIELLO (Republican Assembly Member, California): I don't want to say that we feel shut out. JAFFE: Says Republican Assembly member Roger Niello who has the GOP's health care working group. Mr. NIELLO: But we are very disappointed that principles that are important to us are not included in any of the proposals. JAFFE: Those principles are less regulation and more market forces. But the proposals that are being considered, says Niello, are simply unacceptable to Republicans - like the possibility that everyone could be required to have health insurance; or that illegal immigrants would be included; or that the program might be paid for in part by a sales tax hike; or that employers who don't provide health insurance would be required to kick into a state fund to help the working poor buy policies. But whatever is in the final plan\u2026 Mr. LARRY LEVITT (Vice President, Kaiser Family Foundation): The impact, nationally, would be huge. JAFFE: Says Larry Levitt, vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. Mr. LEVITT: The uninsured problem in California is one of the biggest in the country, and it's a large and diverse state. So success here would really demonstrate that this is something that can be done nationally. JAFFE: But it will be a long way between the deal and the reality. Democrats have enough votes to pass a plan but in California, the taxes to pay for it must be passed by a two-thirds vote. And the Republicans will never go for it. So it may be done in two stages. First, the legislature will adopt the framework of a health care plan, then the money part will be turned into a ballot initiative to be approved or not by the voters. But that will require petitions being circulated, signatures being gathered. The measure probably won't go on the ballot on November of 2008. And that's a long time from now, says Democratic political consultant Darry Sragow. Mr. DARRY SRAGOW (Democratic Political Consultant, California): And if on reflection any of those supporters of the plan initially decide that they really aren't comfortable with it, then all they have to do is oppose the ballot measure and you still have a program on the books but no way to pay for it. JAFFE: So if Schwarzenegger and the Democrats do make a deal on health care reform, they could be facing a long, tough and expensive campaign with as much to fear from their supporters as from their opponents.

Over the last two decades, yoga has moved rapidly from the fringes to the mainstream. An estimated 15 million Americans do some form of yoga. Now, two yoga instructors are trying to bring more black people to the physical and spiritual art that's more than 5,000 years old. Jana Long and Maya Breuer have organized Roots, Rhythm, and Soul. It's a retreat that's drawing instructors from across the country to teach the unique benefits of yoga for black communities. The gathering starts today at the Omega Institute in Rhinebeck, New York. And joining me now to talk about the event is Maya Breuer. She's a longtime yoga instructor and she currently teaches at the Santosha School of Yoga in Providence, Rhode Island. We also have Jana Long. She's instructor at Power of One Yoga in Baltimore. Ladies, thanks for joining us. Ms. JANA LONG (Yoga Instructor, Power of One Yoga): Thank you for having us, Farai. Ms. MAYA BREUER (Yoga Instructor, Santosha School of Yoga): Thank you, Farai. CHIDEYA: Jana, how's the gathering - Roots, Rhythm, and Soul - taking yoga and applying it to some of the needs and interests of African-Americans specifically? Ms. LONG: Well, this is a unique gathering that Maya and I have organized because we will, not only look at the potential that yoga has on black health, especially when you look at the glaring disparities that our community is facing when it comes to access to health care. But we're also looking at the potential impact that yoga can have on our state of mind, our emotions, and examining that as we live out in a culture where there is racism and there's politics of being black in this country that impact us. And what a fortuitous time with all of the activity going on around the Jena Six right now, so you can see exactly what we're talking about. CHIDEYA: So Maya, you have been teaching yoga for more than 20 years. You probably have heard all the excuses in the book about why African-Americans don't want to do yoga. So what are some of those excuses? How do you answer them? Ms. BREUER: Well, I guess the biggest excuse was that black people are not interested in yoga because it does not connect with their religion. And there was some truth to that because when I started teaching many people, my people could not get beyond the fact that yoga originated with the Hindu religion. But I think that barrier is now on its way out. And people are aware that yoga is about health and wellness, and feeling good. CHIDEYA: So what are the other issues around this question of religion? Ms. LONG: Well, one of the things that I've encountered living here in Baltimore where I mostly teach black people here. It's a very large black population in this city. And I've also taught yoga in Ghana, West Africa. And the question always is, is yoga a religion, or thinking that it's something for white people because that's what we see mainly depicted in the mainstream culture: in magazines, on television, et cetera. We don't see ourselves, but I think once people - black people see a black yoga teacher, which has been my experience, that opens the way for them to at least practice or try it out. CHIDEYA: So let's talk a little bit about the practicalities and the physicalities of yoga. I've done it in the past. I found it very difficult because I'm not that flexible. My sister's done it, and she's pretty hardcore. I have a friend who has M. S. , and she takes a class for people who have fairly serious mobility issues. Those are all three different experiences. But what if you go into a class for the first time - say, someone drags you along - and the next day, you're like, oh, my gosh, I can't walk. Jana, what do you do in that case? Ms. LONG: Well, the main thing about yoga is learning to relax and keeping in mind, especially in this culture, that yoga is not a competitive sport. It's an inner journey that the individual goes on to get in touch with themselves. CHIDEYA: But, Maya, there are many cases where people who are fans of yoga are pushing certain disciplines, you know, Bikram, power yoga. And if someone's new, what do you do to make them welcomed, and just have realistic expectations about how they're going to do physically? Ms. BREUER: Well, in my training, which is kripalu training, we really integrate the approach to body, mind and spirit. So I welcome people and then encourage them to listen to their bodies, and to move only to the level that they feel comfortable. Now, every yoga class you might enter won't have the same focus, so it's important for people to try out a few classes and stick with the one that resonates with your body, mind and spirit. And I also think black people, once they get into it, realize that it's so close to our rhythmic, spiritual approach to living that it resonates with people once they can get beyond the barrier. CHIDEYA: Well, Jana, let's talk a little bit more about the question of how people access this on just a practical level. Now, we just did a story about a Los Angeles councilwoman who wants to slow down the development of fast food restaurants in neighborhoods that are low-income - mostly black and Latino. And that's partly because those neighborhoods are dealing with a lot of the health issues we mentioned like diabetes. So what are you doing to get yoga into neighborhoods that are underserved by grocery stores, let alone yoga studios? Ms. LONG: Well, one thing that was really important to me when I opened my studio here in Baltimore that - was that at the - in a black neighborhood because rarely does anything related to wellness and healing exist in those communities. As a yoga teacher here, however, I find that I have to do as much as I can as to connect with different groups, organizations, bookstores, local community leaders, et cetera. And anytime I can get a group of people together and offer them yoga - and I do that for free, they don't have to pay - I'm just happy to bring the practice to them to expose them to it, so they can see if it's something that's useful or not. CHIDEYA: Maya, how is this weekend retreat going to be different - because it's for African-Americans - than any other retreat? Ms. BREUER: I think the main difference is that we're black - all of us; and secondly, because the focus has been on our health. We also are having one workshop that is focusing on stress - and the title of it is, Is It Because I'm Black - where we're going to really talk about how difficult it is to live and exist in a racist culture and how that impacts our health. And then we'll look at strategies and approaches to help ourselves manage better, to keep our hypertension down, and to control those diseases that are adversely impacting our lives. CHIDEYA: Well, Maya and Jana, thank you so much. Ms. LONG: Thank you, Farai. Ms. BREUER: Thank you so much for having us. CHIDEYA: Maya Breuer is a yoga instructor at the Santosha School of Yoga in Providence, Rhode Island. And Jana Long is an instructor at Power of One Yoga in Baltimore. They organized the Roots, Rhythm, and Soul yoga gathering this weekend at the Omega Institute in Rhinebeck, New York.  FARAI CHIDEYA, host:  From modern high-tech to the ancient practice of yoga.

Many of us have heard about the links between race and the shortened life expectancy of black men. But what lies behind the numbers and what makes a difference in changing black men's lives. To help us dig into the issues, we've got psychologist Vickie Mays. She's the director of the UCLA Center on Research Education, Training and Strategic Communication on Minority Health Disparities. Thanks for coming on. Dr. VICKIE MAYS (Director, UCLA Center on Research Education, Training and Strategic Communication on Minority Health Disparities; Professor, Psychology, University of California): Thank you. CHIDEYA: Well, Vickie, what do we know about the problem of health disparities among black men? Dr. MAYS: We're at a stage where what we know is that they definitely exist. We're not trying to prove them any longer because when we look at life expectancy, despite the fact that many African-American men are moving up in the economic and social ladder, they're still not living that long. I mean, it's pretty sad that an African-American man born in 1999 is expected to live to be 68. But, yet, a white man, born in that same time, is expected to live to be 75. CHIDEYA: So what are we talking about with causes or possible causes? Dr. MAYS: There's a range of things. And - I mean, there's the typical suspects where we talk about not enough exercise, diet, and things like that. But what we find is that there are individuals who are dieting, who have, you know, great exercise habits, and still seem to die early. And so some of us have started asking this question of why is it that for African-American men, despite the fact that they may have all kind of life stresses in comparison to other ethnic groups who have those same life stresses, that they live longer and African-American don't? One of the factors that we're starting to really pay attention to it is that of race-based discrimination. Race-based discrimination is something that when you think about it, it's all those little subtle things that happen every day - the feeling that, you know, someone's following you in the store, the feeling that, you know, you get passed over for a job, the feeling that, you know, despite all your best efforts, someone is looking at you as being less than, not equal to, they treat you differently, badly, unfairly. CHIDEYA: So how does that translate in the body, that kind of generalized stress? Dr. MAYS: Well, what happens - and, you know, you can kind of think about this in lots of ways - but, for example, if you feel that someone is treating you differently like, you know, when we think about that, what you'll find is that even though the incident occurred at that moment, later you're still telling somebody about it. You're still upset about it. And what happens in the body is that your brain perceives that there is a problem. It perceives that there is danger - a threat that something is going to put you at peril. And then what happens is your body - and this is, you know, really back from more evolutionary times where, you know, we had to worry about being eaten by lions, and bears, and tigers, and things like that. But it's still the same principle of the body experiences a threat. When it experiences that sense of threat or something that is putting its survival at risk, it then goes into a mode where it gives you, for example, all the things that you would need to do to fight a big fight. Well, race - we've underestimated race-based discrimination, and the extent to which, when we experience it, it really is pretty serious. And it puts the body on this alert. And, you know, asking African-American men what they feel, for example, when they see a police car; what they feel, for example, when they walk into an environment and people are looking at them as if they don't belong there - it begins to cause the body to respond in a way in which, if something is going to happen, you feel your heart race sometime, you feel clenching in your teeth, in your hands, you know? What your body is doing is giving you this extra incentive to pay attention, be hyper alert, and to protect yourself. CHIDEYA: But given that, you know, those stresses might be chronic, what can an individual do to, say, you know what, maybe I am stressed out and - you know, and there are real causes, but I'm not going to have a stroke because of this. What can someone do if they recognize that? Dr. MAYS: Part of what we're trying to do is to really learn about the ways in which when the brain notices this threat - we call it self-appraisal - so when the brain notices this threat, it's, like, to help individuals, first and foremost, to understand how responsive do I need to be. It's one thing to see the police, you know, pull up, and it's another thing for me to have someone following me around in a store. But we have to really help people to kind of get a sense of responding at a level that may be more commiserate with this sense of threat. The second thing is really to get - what we're learning about in the brain is a little bit of how it is that certain interventions - and those are things like meditation, mindfulness - you will hear people say, oh, you should do a tai chi and yoga and all these things. There are ways in which it really changes the brain, and it gets the brain to go to a place where it actually can relax, recharge itself. With African-Americans, who are experiencing this race-based discrimination, may need to have that recharge a little bit more. And so we need to figure out some of the ways that that can be done. There are simple things like affirmation. There are other things like thinking - and this really, you know, some people want to, you know, probably challenge us a little bit, but there is something that happens when people go to a spiritual place. So sometimes prayer for some people, for some people it's meditation, but there is a spiritual place that we can go to. And those are things that you can do in your life over time to help you to reduce your stress and to help you kind of have a sense of being able to meet challenges in a way in which those challenges don't involve your whole body responding in a full-pressed physiological response to incidents. So it's a lot of training that, I think, would help in terms of bringing people back to that place where, okay, I see this. I'm not stroking out over this. CHIDEYA: Finally, quickly, are you also reaching out to try to educate health care providers? Dr. MAYS: Oh, without a doubt. That is primary for us. We've just started talking to individuals in - who are running primary care practices to really think about giving advice that has to do with noticing race-based stress and coming up with some interventions to reduce that. CHIDEYA: Well, Vickie, thanks so much. Dr. MAYS: Thank you. CHIDEYA: Psychologist Vickie Mays directs the UCLA Center on Research, Education, Training and Strategic Communication on Minority Health Disparities.  FARAI CHIDEYA, host:  I'm Farai Chideya, and this is NEWS & NOTES.  Many of us have heard about the links between race and the shortened life expectancy of black men. But what lies behind the numbers and what makes a difference in changing black men's lives.  To help us dig into the issues, we've got psychologist Vickie Mays. She's the director of the UCLA Center on Research Education, Training and Strategic Communication on Minority Health Disparities.  Thanks for coming on.  Dr. VICKIE MAYS (Director, UCLA Center on Research Education, Training and Strategic Communication on Minority Health Disparities; Professor, Psychology, University of California): Thank you.  CHIDEYA: Well, Vickie, what do we know about the problem of health disparities among black men?  Dr. MAYS: We're at a stage where what we know is that they definitely exist. We're not trying to prove them any longer because when we look at life expectancy, despite the fact that many African-American men are moving up in the economic and social ladder, they're still not living that long.  I mean, it's pretty sad that an African-American man born in 1999 is expected to live to be 68. But, yet, a white man, born in that same time, is expected to live to be 75.  CHIDEYA: So what are we talking about with causes or possible causes?  Dr. MAYS: There's a range of things. And - I mean, there's the typical suspects where we talk about not enough exercise, diet, and things like that. But what we find is that there are individuals who are dieting, who have, you know, great exercise habits, and still seem to die early.  And so some of us have started asking this question of why is it that for African-American men, despite the fact that they may have all kind of life stresses in comparison to other ethnic groups who have those same life stresses, that they live longer and African-American don't?  One of the factors that we're starting to really pay attention to it is that of race-based discrimination. Race-based discrimination is something that when you think about it, it's all those little subtle things that happen every day - the feeling that, you know, someone's following you in the store, the feeling that, you know, you get passed over for a job, the feeling that, you know, despite all your best efforts, someone is looking at you as being less than, not equal to, they treat you differently, badly, unfairly.  CHIDEYA: So how does that translate in the body, that kind of generalized stress?  Dr. MAYS: Well, what happens - and, you know, you can kind of think about this in lots of ways - but, for example, if you feel that someone is treating you differently like, you know, when we think about that, what you'll find is that even though the incident occurred at that moment, later you're still telling somebody about it. You're still upset about it.  And what happens in the body is that your brain perceives that there is a problem. It perceives that there is danger - a threat that something is going to put you at peril. And then what happens is your body - and this is, you know, really back from more evolutionary times where, you know, we had to worry about being eaten by lions, and bears, and tigers, and things like that. But it's still the same principle of the body experiences a threat. When it experiences that sense of threat or something that is putting its survival at risk, it then goes into a mode where it gives you, for example, all the things that you would need to do to fight a big fight.

And this is NEWS & NOTES from NPR News. It's one of the great consumer products of the last century. Now, some scientists are saying that the miracle known as plastics can emit chemicals that are hazardous to our bodies. Jane Kay is an environmental reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle. She's been flowing this story and joins me now. Jane, welcome. JANE KAY (Environment Writer, \"San Francisco Chronicle\"): Thanks. CHIDEYA: So what exactly do we know about the unintended side effects of plastics? Ms. KAY: Well, most of our evidence comes from laboratories and studies on animals. And researchers are just beginning to find disturbing effects that make them wonder if trace levels could be hurting humans. CHIDEYA: Give me an example of the animal research first. Ms. KAY: Well, basically, we're looking at two families of chemicals that are used in plastics. Bisphenol A is an ingredient in something called polycarbonate plastic. And those are the really hard, brittle, rigid baby bottles, sports bottles, water bottles. They're actually - bisphenol A is also used as a lining inside of cans. And it has been found in the animal studies to alter the function of the thyroid gland and the brain and the pancreas and the prostate gland. It's a chemical that mimics estrogen, the hormone. And so of course, you know, that guides how people develop. The other chemical is - they're called phthalates. And these, of course, are chemicals that we are barely able to pronounce. And they are used as softeners in polyvinyl chloride, PVC. So they're in everything from toys, raincoats, shower curtains. They are pretty much all over the place. And the lapse studies on those are showing, as well, you know, interference with hormonal systems. In this case, disruption of testosterone production, malformation of sex organs in the lab animals, and this is causing worry. CHIDEYA: Now, when you talk about malformation of sex organs, without being too graphic, tell us what you're talking about and can it happen in humans? Ms. KAY: Well, now, what they're - in lab studies, they use biomarkers. And they measure how genitals develop - say, in males. And if there is - they can see if it is not a normal development. And there has only been one study on humans to see if there was a similar condition happening. And a scientist from the University of Rochester went to clinics around the country - in Minnesota, in California - and she - they measured the levels of phthalates in the urine of pregnant mothers. And then, once the babies were born, they measured the genital formation and they found conditions that were similar to what they were seeing in the phthalate - rats in the labs. And this, of course, has caused them concern. CHIDEYA: So does this affect the ability of these babies, once they grow up, to have kids of their own and to, you know, their reproductive health? Ms. KAY: Well, what - all they can do, of course - they don't know this, so all they can do is what has happened to the rodents. And with the rodents, they've seen undescended testicles. They've seen smaller penises. And of course, these are just symptoms of other kinds of reproductive problems. So that's a question they can't answer. There is a great lack of human study for both phthalates and bisphenol A. And of course, the manufacturers of the chemicals question these studies. And they say that they have studies of their own that don't show these kind of changes. And so there's a great controversy going on. They just say that there's just little or no human evidence to support these claims and they say that U. S. government agencies, you know, haven't removed products that contain these chemicals and they say, you know, nowhere else in the world are you seeing, you know, removal of bisphenol A. The European Union has banned some forms of phthalates in its child-care products and in its toys. And California, actually, has followed that lead. And there is a bill before Governor Schwarzenegger right now that would ban phthalates in toys and children care products for kids 3 and under that would be - it would be the sale distribution, that kind of thing. CHIDEYA: So when you talk about a bill like that, you must be talking about, potentially, millions of people whose lives will change in terms of the products that they get. Ms. KAY: Well, I don't know about that. We were doing a story on that. And we did some research in the European Union. And even the industry there said that, you know, people were still getting a wide array of products that they had been getting before. There are just other ways to make them.

There is that old saying, dead men tell no tales. Well, actually, that is not true. Dead men and women can tell a lot of tales. You just have to know how to listen. And by looking at the body, the right listener can tell an awful lot -the cause of death, how long ago it happened, what the person looked like, and in the case of a murder maybe even who done it. Being able to interpret what a body is telling you involves a little bit of art and a lot of science. By studying bones and decomposition rates, even what kinds of bugs might colonize a dead body, forensic scientists have added a lot of tools to be crime fighter's arsenal. And joining me now to talk more about it is one of the best forensic scientists in the world, Bill Bass. He is a forensic anthropologist and founder of the Body Farm. If you don't know what the Body Farm is, go to our Web site at sciencefriday. com and you can look - and you can see a video tour of the Body Farm. It's a little gruesome, so be ready for the, well, bitter shock in the Body Farm. Bill Bass' new book is called \"Beyond the Body Farm: A Legendary Bone Detective Explores Murders, Mysteries and Revolution in Forensic Science. \" Welcome to the show, Bill. Dr. BILL BASS (Author, \"Beyond the Body Farm: A Legendary Bone Detective Explores Murders, Mysteries and Revolution in Forensic Science\"): Thank you, sir. Thank you for having me. FLATOW: I'm very happy to have you. Tell us a bit about \"Beyond the Body Farm. \" Why did you call it beyond? Are you going in place where no one has gone before? Dr. BASS: \"Beyond Body Farm\" is a collection of cases that I have worked on in the past that have taken - you may well call them cold cases, maybe. It's taken 20 or 30 years to solve the case. And the theory behind it is what have been the scientific changes in the technology that forensic people have used in determining what happened to people. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Tell us what a standard technique is - when you come across a body that's, you know, tell us what you're looking for at the site and what you find there. Dr. BASS: Ira, when the police call me and ask me to identify a skeleton or a maggot-covered body or something like that, I think they're asking me two or three questions. They're asking me, can you determine who this individual is? In other words, they're seeking the identity of the deceased person. And also, they are asking any help that I can give them on the manner in which that person may have died. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. BASS: So, I think they're asking - they're also asking how long have they been dead. So they're asking a series of questions that we hope that we can answer as many, if not all, that they ask. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Our number: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're talking with Bill Bass, who is author of \"Beyond the Body Farm,\" also co-authored by John Jefferson. If you want to ask a question, that was our phone number. You can also go to \"Second Life. \" We're in the Science School area of \"Second Life\" and ask somebody with a SCIENCE FRIDAY T-shirt on. Good question there. How new is the science, you know, of looking at the bugs and investigating the sites - of the site. Is this relatively new technique? Dr. BASS: Well, if you look - if you're talking about bugs and entomology, that is entomology or forensic entomology is probably the most recent of the forensic fields. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. BASS: There have been individuals who have studied insects and their relationship to decay rates for, say, half a century or something like that. But there have been very few, until just the last, say, 20 years that have applied much of this to a study human situation and the deaths of humans. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. You tell a story of a woman in your book, \"Beyond the Body Farm,\" you were trying to identify. And in this case, the DNA evidence was actually wrong. Dr. BASS: That's right. You don't think about having false DNA reports, but we have one in the case of Leoma Patterson, who was a 50's-year-old grandmother who disappeared in '78 in one county here in east Tennessee. And the next spring, they found a dog-scattered skeleton in a neighboring county. And there was, in that case, a false DNA report that was done in the early 2000s. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. When I last met with you - it was old good 15 years ago, when we did this video that's on the Web site, on my sciencefriday. com Web site at the Body Farm - it was set up to investigate and to study what bodies look like in the wild, in natural situations of deterioration, so you can understand them when you met them in - outside of laboratory situation. Is the Body Farm still active in that kind of manner? Dr. BASS: It is. The Body Farm is active. Ira, most of the researching goes on out there on either master's thesis or doctoral dissertations. These are research project that the students have come up with. There are three long-term faculty projects. These are ones that have gone on for, say, five to six or seven years. But we have expanded - from what you and I saw before, we have expanded into, say, for example, the best means today of discovering a buried body is to call on a cadaver dog. A cadaver dog is trained to smell decaying compounds that are given off of bodies. And we decided we wanted to get into that in more depths. So we have four bodies buried at the Body Farm and we have them hooked up to pipes that we can get the smells, which are the compounds off of the individuals. We are now in the process of\u2026 (Soundbite of dog barking) FLATOW: Right on cue. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. BASS: That was my dog who is barking. FLATOW: It's okay. Go ahead. Dr. BASS: Are you with me? FLATOW: Yes. We're here. Go ahead. He barked right on cue, as you were talking about the dog. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. BASS: Yeah. We have devised a sniffer. This is a mechanical device that you can carry in your hand and walk across the ground. And it will pick up some of the compounds. When I say some of the compounds - we have found over 400 compounds given off of decaying bodies. FLATOW: Wow. Dr. BASS: Then, not all of those 400 are of equal value, we think, and so we have taken some 20 of the major compounds and we have devised a sniffer. Hopefully, we'll devise one, one of these days, that you can put on a vehicle and drive across a field, and it will tell you if Jimmy Hoffa is buried out there or something like that. FLATOW: Oh, yeah. That's still one unsolved case, is it not? Dr. BASS: That's right. You know, last year, the government spent quite a bit of money, digging up a farm in Southern Michigan, trying to find Jimmy Hoffa and he wasn't there, which got us sorry they hadn't called us because I think we could do it for a lot cheaper. FLATOW: Using the dogs, you think? Dr. BASS: Using the sniffer that we have, yes. FLATOW: Oh, can you make a mechanical sniffer? Dr. BASS: Yes, we have. FLATOW: That's what it is, I see. Dr. BASS: Yes, we have a mechanical sniffer that - I'm holding out for a dial on it that tells you whether the body you found is a male or female, but it will be a while before we get to that stage. FLATOW: And you think you can get it to be that accurate, that specific? Dr. BASS: Well, I don't know. I mean, I don't know whether there's any difference between the decay smell of a woman and that of a male. But, you know, that's certainly something we need to look at down the road. FLATOW: Well, tell us what then - that's a great a challenge. What other challenges lie ahead for you in this field? Dr. BASS: Oh, I think many - the criteria that we use to identify skeleton remains are based upon three anatomical collections that were started between 1900 and ran at about 1950. These were cadavers that were used in medical research, and instead of cremating the body or burying the body, three of the anatomists in the early part of the 19th century decided that they want to build a collection of known individuals. And that's where we start it all. Now, when the police ask me to identify individuals, they're not asking me to identify somebody that's 100 years old, they're asking me to identify somebody that is in the modern population. And so we decided that we needed to build up a collection of modern skeletons, so that those bodies that go through the Body Farm, the ultimate of that is all of them end up in a research or study collection. And we are fine tuning, let's say that we are fine tuning the techniques that you use to determine the age and the sex and the race and the statute, hand - all of those things that will aid the police in identifying an unknown individual. FLATOW: Did juries always believe the forensic - the bug evidence that you come up with? Dr. BASS: Well - I don't know that they always believe. I think it depends on the person. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. BASS: Some people tend to turn off a jury with their behavior patterns or not being able to answer questions that a jury - if you realize, the jury is made up of average people in the population. And if you go in with a very academic answer and things like that, I think that they probably turn off some of the people in the jury. The one problem I have had with insects are they're great predictor of how long you have been dead, if that body is outside where the insects can get to it. But not everybody dies outside, you see. People die in houses, and the decay goes whether there're insects there or not. The insects are one of nature's ways of reducing the body to its lowest denominator, which is the teeth and bone. FLATOW: You exhume the body of the Big Bopper. Tell us why you did that? Dr. BASS: Well, the Big Bopper was the man that wrote \"Chantilly Lace\" and died in an airplane crash in February the 3rd of 1959, in outside of Clear Lake, Iowa. There were four people in the plane, the pilot; the Big Bopper - who was a man named Jiles P. Richardson, he was a disc jockey from Beaumont, Texas; and Ritchie Valens and Buddy Holly were also on that plane. The Big Bopper was the one found the farthest from the plane - now, that wasn't very far, about 20 yards. As the plane ends up, it skids into the ground. The Big Bopper is found on the opposite side of a fence that where the airplane stopped. And the family has always wondered whether their loved one survived the crash and was walking away for help. Also, about three or four months after that crash, the Iowa farmer was out cleaning up the airplane debris in his field and he finds a pistol. That pistol was owned by Buddy Holly, and it had been fired a couple of times. And I don't know how rumors get started, but the rumor got started that the Big Bopper had been shot. Now, about three years ago, the Texas Historical Commission commissioned a statue, a life-size statue of the Big Bopper to be built. And the - when the Big Bopper was taken back to Beaumont to be buried, he was buried in a section of the cemetery that had only horizontal markers, so it was easier to mow. In order to put up that statue, they're going to have to move the Big Bopper from the horizontal section of the cemetery to the section of the cemetery that you had aboveground monuments. And so they were going to move him anyway. And his son saw an opportunity to see if they could answer the two questions: did my father survive the crash and was he walking away for help, and was he shot? FLATOW: Bill, let me interrupt you because I got to give out a little ID here. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News, talking with Bill Bass, author of \"Beyond the Body Farm. \" Go ahead. Dr. BASS: Okay. Well, he called me and asked me if I could do an autopsy and determine that and I told him, well, I think - I thought I could. And so in March of this year, John Jefferson, who's the writer with me of the book \"Beyond the Farm\" and I, went down and we did an autopsy. We did a full body X-ray of the Big Bopper. The Big Bopper, by the way, was in extremely good condition. He was buried in a dry coffin and\u2026 FLATOW: Bill, I got to ask you to cut to the\u2026 Dr. BASS: And when you look at him, and see the likeness between he and his son to show that they were - it was so good. And what we did, we X-rayed the entire body from top of the skull to the bottom of the feet, and there are multiple fractures from the top of the head to the bottom of the feet. There are compound fractures of the femur and the tibia, which meaning they broke and were not connected. So the answer to the first question was, no, he did not walk away from the plane and he was not walking away to seek help. He died the instant that plane crashed. And the second one, there is no evidence of any lead splatter or anything like that or lead wiped in the bones, and so he was not shot. FLATOW: Hmm. I got about a minute left. I know that you're going to expose to exhume Harry Houdini. Can you tell me why, in a minute? Dr. BASS: I can tell you why in a minute. I'm on a committee to identify him. During life, Houdini broke an ankle. And what we'll be looking for is not all the normal information on Houdini, but I'm looking to see if there is a heel fracture of an ankle. FLATOW: I thought Houdini may have died under mysterious circumstances. He was supposed to be punched in\u2026 Dr. BASS: There was a footprint on him last year that suggest that. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. BASS: Suggest he may have been poisoned instead of died from a ruptured appendix. FLATOW: Do you think you could find that? Dr. BASS: Oh, I think I can't find it, but they have toxicologists who will take samples and see if they can determine if there were any poisons in the body. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And that's going to happen when? Dr. BASS: Well, I don't know. That depends on the judicial system. The lawyer who is trying to do is, the man named Jim Starrs who teaches at George Washington University. And Jim likes to dig up cases like this from the past because of the advancement of the technology in forensics. And he thinks the technology now is a lot better than it was when Houdini died in the early 1900s, and so he's hoping that he can shed some light on that death. FLATOW: Well, I want to thank you Bill for taking time to be with us, and always fascinating to talk with you. Dr. BASS: Ira, thanks for having me back again. FLATOW: You're welcome. Dr. Bill Bass, author with John Jefferson of \"Beyond the Body Farm: A Legendary Bone Detective Explores Murders, Mysteries and the Revolution in Forensic Science. \"  IRA FLATOW, host:  For the rest of this hour, more crime, more forensic crime, this sort of done the old-fashioned CSI way you may be more familiar with, you know?  There is that old saying, dead men tell no tales. Well, actually, that is not true. Dead men and women can tell a lot of tales. You just have to know how to listen. And by looking at the body, the right listener can tell an awful lot -the cause of death, how long ago it happened, what the person looked like, and in the case of a murder maybe even who done it.  Being able to interpret what a body is telling you involves a little bit of art and a lot of science. By studying bones and decomposition rates, even what kinds of bugs might colonize a dead body, forensic scientists have added a lot of tools to be crime fighter's arsenal.  And joining me now to talk more about it is one of the best forensic scientists in the world, Bill Bass. He is a forensic anthropologist and founder of the Body Farm. If you don't know what the Body Farm is, go to our Web site at sciencefriday. com and you can look - and you can see a video tour of the Body Farm. It's a little gruesome, so be ready for the, well, bitter shock in the Body Farm.  Bill Bass' new book is called \"Beyond the Body Farm: A Legendary Bone Detective Explores Murders, Mysteries and Revolution in Forensic Science. \" Welcome to the show, Bill.  Dr. BILL BASS (Author, \"Beyond the Body Farm: A Legendary Bone Detective Explores Murders, Mysteries and Revolution in Forensic Science\"): Thank you, sir. Thank you for having me.  FLATOW: I'm very happy to have you. Tell us a bit about \"Beyond the Body Farm. \" Why did you call it beyond? Are you going in place where no one has gone before?  Dr. BASS: \"Beyond Body Farm\" is a collection of cases that I have worked on in the past that have taken - you may well call them cold cases, maybe. It's taken 20 or 30 years to solve the case. And the theory behind it is what have been the scientific changes in the technology that forensic people have used in determining what happened to people.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Tell us what a standard technique is - when you come across a body that's, you know, tell us what you're looking for at the site and what you find there.  Dr. BASS: Ira, when the police call me and ask me to identify a skeleton or a maggot-covered body or something like that, I think they're asking me two or three questions. They're asking me, can you determine who this individual is? In other words, they're seeking the identity of the deceased person. And also, they are asking any help that I can give them on the manner in which that person may have died.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. BASS: So, I think they're asking - they're also asking how long have they been dead. So they're asking a series of questions that we hope that we can answer as many, if not all, that they ask.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Our number: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're talking with Bill Bass, who is author of \"Beyond the Body Farm,\" also co-authored by John Jefferson. If you want to ask a question, that was our phone number. You can also go to \"Second Life. \" We're in the Science School area of \"Second Life\" and ask somebody with a SCIENCE FRIDAY T-shirt on. Good question there.  How new is the science, you know, of looking at the bugs and investigating the sites - of the site. Is this relatively new technique?  Dr. BASS: Well, if you look - if you're talking about bugs and entomology, that is entomology or forensic entomology is probably the most recent of the forensic fields.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. BASS: There have been individuals who have studied insects and their relationship to decay rates for, say, half a century or something like that. But there have been very few, until just the last, say, 20 years that have applied much of this to a study human situation and the deaths of humans.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. You tell a story of a woman in your book, \"Beyond the Body Farm,\" you were trying to identify. And in this case, the DNA evidence was actually wrong.  Dr. BASS: That's right. You don't think about having false DNA reports, but we have one in the case of Leoma Patterson, who was a 50's-year-old grandmother who disappeared in '78 in one county here in east Tennessee. And the next spring, they found a dog-scattered skeleton in a neighboring county. And there was, in that case, a false DNA report that was done in the early 2000s.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. When I last met with you - it was old good 15 years ago, when we did this video that's on the Web site, on my sciencefriday. com Web site at the Body Farm - it was set up to investigate and to study what bodies look like in the wild, in natural situations of deterioration, so you can understand them when you met them in - outside of laboratory situation. Is the Body Farm still active in that kind of manner?  Dr. BASS: It is. The Body Farm is active. Ira, most of the researching goes on out there on either master's thesis or doctoral dissertations. These are research project that the students have come up with. There are three long-term faculty projects. These are ones that have gone on for, say, five to six or seven years. But we have expanded - from what you and I saw before, we have expanded into, say, for example, the best means today of discovering a buried body is to call on a cadaver dog.  A cadaver dog is trained to smell decaying compounds that are given off of bodies. And we decided we wanted to get into that in more depths. So we have four bodies buried at the Body Farm and we have them hooked up to pipes that we can get the smells, which are the compounds off of the individuals. We are now in the process of\u2026  (Soundbite of dog barking)  FLATOW: Right on cue.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. BASS: That was my dog who is barking.  FLATOW: It's okay. Go ahead.  Dr. BASS: Are you with me?  FLATOW: Yes. We're here. Go ahead. He barked right on cue, as you were talking about the dog.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. BASS: Yeah. We have devised a sniffer. This is a mechanical device that you can carry in your hand and walk across the ground. And it will pick up some of the compounds. When I say some of the compounds - we have found over 400 compounds given off of decaying bodies.  FLATOW: Wow.  Dr. BASS: Then, not all of those 400 are of equal value, we think, and so we have taken some 20 of the major compounds and we have devised a sniffer. Hopefully, we'll devise one, one of these days, that you can put on a vehicle and drive across a field, and it will tell you if Jimmy Hoffa is buried out there or something like that.  FLATOW: Oh, yeah. That's still one unsolved case, is it not?  Dr. BASS: That's right. You know, last year, the government spent quite a bit of money, digging up a farm in Southern Michigan, trying to find Jimmy Hoffa and he wasn't there, which got us sorry they hadn't called us because I think we could do it for a lot cheaper.  FLATOW: Using the dogs, you think?  Dr. BASS: Using the sniffer that we have, yes.  FLATOW: Oh, can you make a mechanical sniffer?  Dr. BASS: Yes, we have.  FLATOW: That's what it is, I see.  Dr. BASS: Yes, we have a mechanical sniffer that - I'm holding out for a dial on it that tells you whether the body you found is a male or female, but it will be a while before we get to that stage.  FLATOW: And you think you can get it to be that accurate, that specific?  Dr. BASS: Well, I don't know. I mean, I don't know whether there's any difference between the decay smell of a woman and that of a male. But, you know, that's certainly something we need to look at down the road.  FLATOW: Well, tell us what then - that's a great a challenge. What other challenges lie ahead for you in this field?  Dr. BASS: Oh, I think many - the criteria that we use to identify skeleton remains are based upon three anatomical collections that were started between 1900 and ran at about 1950. These were cadavers that were used in medical research, and instead of cremating the body or burying the body, three of the anatomists in the early part of the 19th century decided that they want to build a collection of known individuals.  And that's where we start it all. Now, when the police ask me to identify individuals, they're not asking me to identify somebody that's 100 years old, they're asking me to identify somebody that is in the modern population. And so we decided that we needed to build up a collection of modern skeletons, so that those bodies that go through the Body Farm, the ultimate of that is all of them end up in a research or study collection. And we are fine tuning, let's say that we are fine tuning the techniques that you use to determine the age and the sex and the race and the statute, hand - all of those things that will aid the police in identifying an unknown individual.  FLATOW: Did juries always believe the forensic - the bug evidence that you come up with?  Dr. BASS: Well - I don't know that they always believe. I think it depends on the person.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. BASS: Some people tend to turn off a jury with their behavior patterns or not being able to answer questions that a jury - if you realize, the jury is made up of average people in the population. And if you go in with a very academic answer and things like that, I think that they probably turn off some of the people in the jury.  The one problem I have had with insects are they're great predictor of how long you have been dead, if that body is outside where the insects can get to it. But not everybody dies outside, you see. People die in houses, and the decay goes whether there're insects there or not. The insects are one of nature's ways of reducing the body to its lowest denominator, which is the teeth and bone.  FLATOW: You exhume the body of the Big Bopper. Tell us why you did that?  Dr. BASS: Well, the Big Bopper was the man that wrote \"Chantilly Lace\" and died in an airplane crash in February the 3rd of 1959, in outside of Clear Lake, Iowa. There were four people in the plane, the pilot; the Big Bopper - who was a man named Jiles P. Richardson, he was a disc jockey from Beaumont, Texas; and Ritchie Valens and Buddy Holly were also on that plane.  The Big Bopper was the one found the farthest from the plane - now, that wasn't very far, about 20 yards. As the plane ends up, it skids into the ground. The Big Bopper is found on the opposite side of a fence that where the airplane stopped. And the family has always wondered whether their loved one survived the crash and was walking away for help.  Also, about three or four months after that crash, the Iowa farmer was out cleaning up the airplane debris in his field and he finds a pistol. That pistol was owned by Buddy Holly, and it had been fired a couple of times. And I don't know how rumors get started, but the rumor got started that the Big Bopper had been shot.  Now, about three years ago, the Texas Historical Commission commissioned a statue, a life-size statue of the Big Bopper to be built. And the - when the Big Bopper was taken back to Beaumont to be buried, he was buried in a section of the cemetery that had only horizontal markers, so it was easier to mow. In order to put up that statue, they're going to have to move the Big Bopper from the horizontal section of the cemetery to the section of the cemetery that you had aboveground monuments.  And so they were going to move him anyway. And his son saw an opportunity to see if they could answer the two questions: did my father survive the crash and was he walking away for help, and was he shot?

I'm Ira Flatow. If you're a fan of television crime drama, you've probably seen the show \"Numb3rs. \" It's on Friday night on CBS, and it's one of the most popular shows on the network. Each week, the main character of Charlie helps his detective brother solve crimes, not by using those strange lights they do on one of the \"CSI\" shows, some - the liquids and whatever. His tool is using math. He puts math to work, because Charlie is a - the character is a brilliant mathematician professor at the made-up Cal Sci University. And his crime-fighting arsenal may include everything from the Riemann hypothesis to game theory to link analysis. He really is quite the mathematician. But maybe you're not, you know? Maybe you've found yourself wondering, hey, you know, I know that stuff on the other \"CSI\" shows. Real-time police don't have all those tools. How much, you know, use can real-time police make of all the mathematics and detectives make of all the math they see on these shows? Can math really help the police solve crimes? Well, joining me now to talk about it are my guests. They are co-authors of a new book out that's quite an interesting read. It's called \"The Numbers Behind Numb3rs. \" And let me introduce them. Gary Lorden he is the co-author. He's professor of mathematics at California Institute of Technology - a real place -and the math consultant to the television show \"Numb3rs. \" He joins us from KPCC in Pasadena. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Lorden. Dr. GARY LORDEN (Professor of Mathematics, California Institute of Technology; Co-author, \"The Numbers Behind Numb3rs\"): Thanks, Ira. It's a pleasure to be here. FLATOW: You're welcome. Keith Devlin is the NPR math guy. He's also co-author of the book \"The Numbers Behind Numb3rs. \" He's executive director of Stanford University's Center for the Study of Language and Information. He joins us of from Stanford. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Dr. KEITH DEVLIN (Executive Director, Stanford University Center for the Study of Language and Information; Co-author, \"The Numbers Behind Numb3rs\"): Hi, Ira. Nice talking to you again. FLATOW: Hi, how are you? Dr. DEVLIN: Better. Good. Thank you. FLATOW: How much - let me ask you, Gary. What do you do as a consultant on the show \"Numb3rs\"? Do you come up with the plot theme or, you know, they run it by you? Dr. LORDEN: The latter. What happens on the show, depending on which writers -they have over a dozen - are doing an episode is that they, either fairly early - while they're developing the idea - consult with me a little bit about it, or more typically, I see a version of the script at the stage a couple of weeks before they actually start shooting. And then, I'm supposed to see if the math that they're thinking of using is realistic enough, and if not, what to suggest instead. FLATOW: Do they stretch the math a lot? I mean, do you have to, you know, decide whether your integrity is compromised? Dr. LORDEN: Actually, it's not so much question of integrity as hype. Just like Dr. House and some of the lawyer shows, what is done on television always involves a superhuman - a superhero, and in this case it's the mathematician, which is of course, wonderful for me. The mathematician is able to do things that in the real world would require a lot more data and a lot more time. He's able to pull things together and come up with very insightful math that helps the FBI determine exactly who to go after. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. The first chapter of you book talks about geographic profiling. It's used to catch serial killers. Tell us what that is? Dr. LORDEN: Well, geographic profiling is an idea that carries mathematics into that sort of standard image we've all seen in movies and TV crime-fighting for a long time, where they have a map on a board some place and they have little pins on it showing the locations of some attacker. And the idea of geographic profiling is to try to use those locations to deduce mathematically where the most likely zone is in which the attacker lives or works, that is his home base. And that was actually done in a real case in Louisiana, a serial rape case. And the crime was solved with the help of a former Canadian - Royal Canadian Mounted policeman who happened to get a PhD and do a thesis in this mathematical method called geographical profiling. His name is Kim Rossmo. And the first episode of the show detailed how the same kind of math that Kim used; in fact, the same formula to solve the real case would solve the case on television. FLATOW: On the other hand, Keith Devlin, if you were a serial killer and you were a little bit savvy about math and knew about this technique, couldn't you thwart the pattern by doing something unexpected so it would not fit into it? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. DEVLIN: You know you might think that, but in fact, we feel that we have sort of free choice and we do what we want. But people, because of the way we're put together, tend out to be remarkably predictable. And, you know, I might hold off the cops for a few extra crimes by trying to hide my tracks, but just because I'm a human being - particularly if I'm a psychopathic human being who is particularly ritualistic about my behavior - it wouldn't take more than an extra few data points for those equations to catch me no matter what I do. People cannot behave randomly sufficiently well to thwart off mathematics. Mathematics will get them in the end. FLATOW: How did you convinced, both of you, how did you convinced the producers of a TV show to do something based on mathematics? I would think that will be almost mission impossible - not to mention another show. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. LORDEN: Well, that, actually, that convincing was done by the husband and wife team who created the show, Cheryl Heuton and Nick Falacci. They're still, kind of the head writers and do a lot of the episodes, and they live just a couple of miles from Pasadena - excuse me - from Caltech in Pasadena and they based the show on the idea of a Richard Feynman-like genius. Feynman was a Nobel Prize-winning physics professor at Caltech. And they wanted a younger version who would be - a mathematician, who would help his older brother who works for the FBI solve these crimes. And they pitched that idea to CBS. And CBS, in their great wisdom, thought that that would be an appealing idea and they commissioned a pilot, actually two pilots, the second of which was shot on campus - many scenes at Caltech. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. LORDEN: And so it worked. The focus group said, gee, we like the math. And so CBS took a fly around it, and the show's been consistently winning its timeslot at 10 o'clock on Friday nights. And most times, actually wins all the Friday night - has the most viewers of any show on Friday night. FLATOW: Hmm. Do you think you're doing a public service when you do this show? Dr. LORDEN: I think we all do, who are associated with the show, yes. Dr. DEVLIN: Yeah. You know, in fact, I - go ahead, Gary. Dr. LORDEN: Go ahead, Keith. Go ahead. Dr. DEVLIN: Okay. Now, in fact, I, you know, I saw a rough cut of the first pilot before it was ever broadcast. They were sort of circulating around mathematicians. And I was so hooked on the idea and the way they've done it that I e-mailed immediately Nick and Cheryl, who I've never met, and said this looks great. If you need any help from someone in the business, I'd be delighted to help. And in fact, in the first series, I did help out occasionally with some advice. But I've - I thought this was a great thing and I was very pleased that they accepted my offer to be part of it. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Do people actually tune in to see the math be the hero in this show? Dr. LORDEN: I think they do. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. LORDEN: We certainly do, and lots of other people tell us that they do. Lots of times, I'll be in an airport somewhere and encounter somebody. And if my wife brags that, you know, I work on the TV show \"Numb3rs,\" they'll say, oh, I love that show. I love the math, and so on. And these are people who, you know, never took calculus in their lives, have no idea about advanced mathematics. But the way the math is presented on the show, many people say it's engaging and makes them feel smart just to see and hear the way Charlie explains the math. And he does it in a brilliant way. It's nothing like\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. LORDEN: \u2026college or high school lecture. FLATOW: But I remember from some of the early shows - and maybe the first season, I remember one of the show is opening with something that had math that had nothing to do with the rest of the show. It was, I think, the Fibonacci series on a flower or something like that. They were sitting around in their little communal area and someone had a flower in a vase and just started talking about it. Dr. LORDEN: That was one of the great endings of the show. What the writers like to do, since the show really crucially involves the three people in this family - the wonderful actor Judd Hirsch plays the father of the FBI brother and the younger brother who's a mathematician - Rob Morrow and David Krumholtz play those parts. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. LORDEN: And the show often ends with them or some of the others involved -the FBI agents and so on - sitting around after the case is solved. And the one you're talking about with the flower was one where Charlie gets a little bit of a challenge from one of the female agents about, you know, really what is math, why do you use math so much, and what's it good for, and is it really that useful, and so on. Of course, she's just seen how he solved the case using it. And then, he goes in, Charlie does, to this wonderful explanation about mathematics is everywhere even in a flower, and he talks about the Fibonacci sequence and all the ways that it and the golden ratio that's involved in characterizing it appear in Parthenon and Rome and in the shape of a card that's used to advertise sweepstakes and so on and so forth. It's a wonderful scene, and the actor David Krumholtz was just thrilled to have the chance to do that scene. FLATOW: Are you familiar with the Richard Feynman statement about that that's saying, if I can see the beauty in a flower more than you do, it's because I appreciate the math and the other things behind it. Dr. LORDEN: Yeah. Feynman had a lot of those insights, and since Nick and Cheryl are great fans of Feynman and have read a great deal about him, they like to incorporate sort of Feynman-like touches in the way the characters on the show behave. It's not just Charlie. He has a beautiful fellow mathematician who actually was his PhD student, Amita, played by the wonderful actress Navi Rawat. And then, he has this sort of corky physicist, slightly older colleague who was a mentor of his in his student days, and that's played by Peter MacNicol. And between the three of them and the occasional other characters -in fact, in tonight's episode, they're introducing a new character who's sort of a rough, street\u2026 FLATOW: Oh, tell us about it. Dr. LORDEN: Well, he's a kind of street-smart electrical - excuse me -mechanical engineer. He's one of these guys that if you saw him on the street with the tattoos and stuff in a kind of scruffy jeans and T-shirt, you'd never think that he was a professor at a school like Caltech. CalSci is just a scarcely disguised version of Caltech. And so, the character is able to use some of the street smarts, it's - actually, I'm sorry. It's not tonight's episode, I think it's next week's episode\u2026 Dr. DEVLIN: Oh, a preview. Dr. LORDEN: \u2026where he has a lot of knowledge about cars and the way modifications of cars are used for things like street drag racing and so on and so forth. So it turns out that, you know, he can bring a lot more to the table when he consults with his colleagues, Larry and Charlie, from other sides of campus. And I think he's going to enrich a lot of the action on the show, the sort of human-interest stuff to see more of the faculty colleagues that Charlie, the mathematician, has. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. We're talking with Keith Devlin and Gary Lorden, who were co-authors of \"The Numbers Behind Numb3rs: Solving Crime with Mathematics,\" based on the TV show \"Numb3rs\" which is the E - and it has 3 backwards. Any - either of you two think of that or that's just the artistic department come up with? Dr. DEVLIN: That was the television people who did that. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. DEVLIN: I wish I had thought of that. I think it was maybe Tony Scott that's behind this who was the executive producer\u2026 Dr. LORDEN: When I first saw that in an e-mail from the public relations part of Caltech - I got an e-mail saying, well, you're head of the math department, maybe you want to come and meet with this producer. They're thinking of doing a pilot and want to do it at Caltech and so on and so forth, and the show is supposed to be called \"Numb3rs\" and with a 3 in it. And, of course, it wasn't backwards because it was just typed around an ordinary keyboard. And I looked at that and thought oh, gee, that's kind of hokey. And so when it turns out to be brilliant\u2026 FLATOW: All right. Dr. LORDEN: \u2026because we're in the age of Google and\u2026 FLATOW: There you go. Hang on. I've got to take a break. We have to take a break. We'll be right back in a short break. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking about \"The Numbers Behind Numb3rs: Solving Crime with Mathematics,\" with the authors Gary Lorden and Keith Devlin. And when I interrupted, you're about to give me the punch line of the story behind why \"Numb3rs\" - what you thought of the 3 in \"Numb3rs. \" Dr. LORDEN: Yeah, the brilliance of that conception is not only that it makes it sort of a catchy logo for the TV screen, but that in an age of Google, one of the things we really want to do with the show is encourage people, particularly students, who might, you know, be intrigued about some of the math on the show to go on the Internet and try to look up more about the Riemann hypothesis, for example, or the P versus NP problem or something like that that comes up on the show. And what they can do when they put in numb3rs with a 3 instead of an E is restrict all of their answers very readily on Google to being about the show or about our book, now, I would hope. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. LORDEN: And with just an E, if you type in numbers into Google, I don't know how many millions of returns you get, but there's a lot of Web sites that use the word numbers without the 3 in it. FLATOW: Let's go to the questions. Jolan(ph) in \"Second Life\" asks. This go right to the media, she says, I'm French and I watch \"Numb3rs. \" Is \"Numb3rs\" often realistic about solving crime by mathematics? In other words, the central question, do real detectives use numbers like these or did - or anybody have the power - these geniuses, these mathematicians that you have on the show? Dr. DEVLIN: Yeah, I mean, you know, Gary mentioned, totally. Garry said that -my old mentors that the - there's a type - there's the whole thing you're certainly hyped and it's exaggerated in terms of the timescale and one person doing it. But if you take that away and you factor it back down to, in principle, could this mathematics be used to solve that crime, the answer is very often yes. It wouldn't take - it would longer than the 42 minutes and it wouldn't take one person. It might take six months and a team of people, but, by and large, with one or two exceptions, when you see mathematics presented in the show, when you see Charlie say, I'm going to use (unintelligible) influence to solve this crime and help you solve this crime - if you sit back and think of it, if you got mathematical knowledge, you think, yeah, actually that's certainly possible. So factor out the - all of the hype side, the stuff that's required to make it a fast-paced episode, and the answer is yes, it's believable. FLATOW: Okay. Let's talk about one case, for example. Keith, you write in your book about the statistics for fighting crime, and one case in particular was really interesting. This was a nurse who seemed to have a lot of patients. Tell us about that one. Dr. DEVLIN: Yeah. And several of the - most of the chapters in the book are actually based on episodes of \"Numb3rs. \" But this is one where there's a real case that as far as you know hasn't really been reflected in the TV series. But of course, all the scriptwriters now have our book, and so I'm sure it's going to appear in the series. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. DEVLIN: This was a case in the mid-1990s in Massachusetts, where there was a nurse in a Veterans Affairs hospital. She was usually on the night shift. And her colleagues noticed that there seem to be more cardiac arrests when she was on duty. You know, there was - suspicions were aroused. And the suspicion was that - it's almost like fire fighters who start fires because they like the exercise, the (unintelligible) like the fun of fighting fires. They thought that she would love the excitement of trying to save these people. And sometimes, she was successful in saving them; often, she wasn't. But they suspected that she was actually causing these heart attacks by injecting them with a drug in the first place. So they looked at all the data - actually, eventually, they persuaded the state to put a grand jury together to investigate this - and they looked at the data. And sure enough, on the shifts when this person, Kristen Gilbert, was in charge of the ward, there were more deaths from cardiac arrests or more cases of cardiac arrests - some in deaths - some resulting in deaths, some not - than there were otherwise. The question was, was that just one of these flukes? Because these are small numbers, you know, you're talking about maybe one person, two people here, another couple the next month. So you're really only talking about six, seven, eight deaths. But it seems - the question is what is this - what is statistically significant? Was there something going on? Simply, looking at the charts and graphing them isn't going to tell you that. You have to do a detailed statistical analysis. And indeed, the grand jury commissioned a statistician to analyze the data. And the results of that was the chances of that increase in cardiac cases being purely due to chance was less than one in 100 million. In other words, it was a virtual certainty that something was causing them. Whether she was causing them was another issue, that's what the court have been trying to do in the trial. But it was certainly wasn't just a random fluctuation. Someone or something had been causing them deliberately. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let's talk a bit about something that you write about in the book. You write that - it has to do with the war on terror. And we know that the government has all kinds of data mining that it's doing. And you write that machine learning is, quote, \"perhaps the single most important tool within the law enforcement community's data mining arsenal when it comes to profiling, enhanced catching or preventing criminals and terrorists. \" Can you tell us what machine learning is? Dr. DEVLIN: Okay. That's - actually, the center that I direct at Stanford is actually the world's leader in doing that thing. It's where you - it's a branch of what was known as artificial - still is known as artificial intelligence. It means you have a computer program which you present lots of data, it could be data about - an obvious one is can you determine the profile of someone entering the country who's likely to be a terrorist? So you look up lots and lots of profiles of people entering the country and you let the computer compare that data with a list of known terrorists entering the country. And it looks for patterns; it looks for hidden patterns to see if you can come up with a set of criteria of characteristics that would be - that would tell you that that person, when they're trying to enter the country, was likely to be a criminal. So it's uncovering hidden patterns, but it's doing them by the computer itself examining the data. Human beings could do this well if they were faced with about 20 or 30 cases. But, you know, the immigration services have hundreds of thousands of data points to look out, and so you have to let computers find the patterns. It's not enough to expect a human being to find them. FLATOW: Let's go to Tom(ph) on line 3. Hi, Tom. TOM (Caller): Hey. Hi, Ira. FLATOW: How are you? TOM: Great. Thanks for taking my call. I really love your show. FLATOW: Thank you. TOM: Yeah. I was wondering, now that the FBI is taking over from Blackwater regarding their CEOs and other important people, diplomats and so on in Iraq, do you think they would use supercomputers, higher mathematics to calculate the odds of, say, an ambush in any particular time or place in, you know, Iraq, Afghanistan or anywhere else in the world? Dr. DEVLIN: You know, the Defense Department was doing that long before 9/11. They've been using computer methods, mathematical methods to try and highlight likely targets of terrorist attacks. They've been doing that for a long time. Dr. LORDEN: It's called threat assessment. And mathematicians - there were many thousands of them, PhD mathematicians, who are very high level - work for various agencies of the government and think tanks that worked for those agencies. And as Keith says, they've been doing all these kinds of assessments for a long time. And both Keith and I participated in classified work with some of those mathematicians that do it. And particularly since 9/11, the use of mathematical methods to fight terror is a very major effort within the U. S. government. FLATOW: You wrote in your book that it had predicted at least of the site for 9/11 - the Pentagon as being a high-profile target. Dr. DEVLIN: Yeah. That was actually an interesting case. There was small company in the Washington Beltway district with its small defense contract. It was commissioned by the Defense Department to develop a software system to try and produce one of these threat assessment matrices. And early in 2001, they ran this on test data and one of the targets that came right up to the top of the list was the Pentagon. And the irony is, with hindsight, is that when the people who developed that - this was a company associated with George Mason University - when they wrote up the reports of this, they actually said one of the targets that was found was the Pentagon. Of course, you would expect this when you're running test data, and everybody dismissed it. And with 20/20 vision, you know, it seems to sort of second-guess it. If I've been in their place, I've had dismissed it too. But what it shows was that although people with obvious - we'll tend to dismiss things that's being too obvious or too - out of the realms of possibility, mathematics doesn't have any prejudices. That mathematics looked at the data and said the Pentagon is a high-risk target. And by golly, it turned out to be right within six months of that report being written. Dr. LORDEN: Another great success - Oh, I'm sorry. I was going to say another great\u2026 FLATOW: Sure. Go ahead. Dr. LORDEN: \u2026another great success in the book that we describe in a chapter called Connecting the Dots is the use of graph theory, network's link analysis and so on. And this is something that I know for sure, from firsthand experience, is used in counterterror work in the government. And we talk about a stunning success, where it was actually used to find al-Zarqawi, or at least people close to al-Zarqawi, who was the head of al-Qaida in Iraq. And that was the basis for ultimately taking him out with bombs. So there are some really important successes. We can't obviously talk about the details in the book. But where the mathematical methods, some of which have been illustrated on the show, where you take points and lines - points are people; the lines are relationships between them or communications between them - and you construct what mathematicians call a graph or a network, and then you do all kinds of probabilistic analysis and all kinds of other analysis. We described one in the book, where social network analyst in private practice as a consultant for corporations, a man named Valdis Krebs, did an analysis and published it on the Web after 9/11. From just publicly available data and some of the standard ways of determining who are the important people in a network, he was able to pinpoint Mohamed Atta, who played a central role in the 9/11 attacks. FLATOW: When you say you can't talk about it, does that mean because you were actively involved in helping out here? Dr. LORDEN: Well, both Keith and I have consulted with organizations that are involved in very highly classified research, and so we know firsthand that some of our mathematical colleagues are not just at universities - although a lot of people at universities like us have helped - but there are full-time expert mathematicians who are working on things like basing an inference, social network analysis and so on as we speak. And when you see successes that are published in the media - or even sometimes you don't hear about them because they are not, you know, quite such striking figures as al-Zarqawi - a lot of those results depend upon mathematical, statistical, probabilistic data mining kinds of analyses. And so, the government gives grants to mathematicians at universities to work on methods for those things. So it's really a very large-scale effort. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Does any of that filtered down to the local level? Dr. LORDEN: Yes. I was actually talking to somebody about the book just the other day in an interview, and she asked something about that. And I said, well, you know, it's like all kinds of other things. If you are dealing with Wal-Mart as a costumer, then you know that when you purchase something, it goes into their computerized database and they are able to do incredible things with it that help them determine where to put things in the aisles in the store and how to advertise and how to price and all those kinds of things. When you go down to the mom-and-pop store on the corner, they may have a laptop but they're probably not using it to analyze your purchases, and I think it's similar with police. I've never actually consulted with police departments or even the FBI. I know from talking to some of the people associated with the show that, yes, they have used math on occasion, but surely not at the level that it's regularly used with mathematicians regularly working on cases for a very long period of time the way it is at the high level, for the National Security Agency or the CIA or so on. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Can you ever get to the point where quantum physics, quantum mathematics might be useful to solve\u2026 Dr. DEVLIN: Boy, I'm going to thought - went over to Gary, because I have no idea, and maybe Gary doesn't either. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. LORDEN: Well, yes. For example, one of my former students at Caltech, Peter Shor, is famous for, among other things, working on quantum computing. And we don't, as far as I know, physically have quantum computers yet. But my colleague, Professor Preskill, at Caltech and lots of others are concentrating a lot of research on that. And when we do have quantum computers, they're going to be among those deeply buried in the various agencies of the government machines - I assume the best ones, will be working on counterterror. So, yes, I think every possible tool, from theoretical physics or any other branch of science will be brought to bear. FLATOW: Talking with Keith Devlin and Gary Lorden, author of \"The Numbers Behind Numb3rs\" on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, with just a little bit of time left. What would you like to do that you can't do, that they keep telling you no? Tell us what\u2026 Dr. LORDEN: I would like to see - and I know David Krumholtz, the actor who plays Charlie, wonderful actor and he really loves doing the math and having it influence the audience. He's so proud of the fact, for example, that there is a program with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics in partnership with Texas Instruments, where 48,000 high school and junior high math teachers are signed up and regularly receive, from a special panel that the NCPM set up, problem sets that they give their students keyed to the episodes of \"Numb3rs,\" so that when a 14-year-old watches \"Numb3rs\" on a Friday night and comes to school the next week, they get math problems in class that are word problems about Agent Reeves did this and blah, blah, blah. So they really love it. And what I'd like to see - and I know Krumholtz feels the same way - is more illustrations of how a math professor functions in the rest of their time on campus, not just working for the FBI, but teaching, you know, interacting with students. And there've been a few scenes like that in the history of the show, but we'd like to see many more of them. And I think it would be a wonderful opportunity to show the excitement of doing mathematics because students can portray that very well. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And now that we're living in an era where you can watch these things whenever you want to, right on the Web site, you can assign stuff, you can make, you know, you can assign - if it's not for Friday night, some other night. Dr. DEVLIN: Yeah, and because that technology only exists because of the mathematics behind it. I mean, let's not forget that the very computer is a product of mathematics of the 19th century and then into the early 20th century. And just adding to what Gary said, you know, I - lots of people say that they can't do mathematics. But if you simply think of how the human brain developed through natural selection - natural selection doesn't produce 5 percents of the brains of the population that can do mathematics and 95 percent that don't. It produces a spectrum of ability. And once you've got a spectrum of ability, any one who is motivated and wants to do something can actually do pretty - can do better at it than when they start. And I think the key to mathematics is motivation, and that unpacks when you are talking to young people to it being cool. Young kids don't want to be seen doing something that's not cool. And try as though we might, people like Gary and I have never been able to succeed to make mathematics look cool. We look like mathematicians. Now, we've got Charlie, played by David Krumholtz, giving these wonderful, cool, sexy image to mathematics. And there's already evidence that's beginning to turn things around. And kids in school are saying, you know, it actually is cool to do mathematics. I'm interested in doing mathematics. I want to do it. Then if you've got those pieces in place, there's nothing on Earth that will stop them becoming good at mathematics because they're all on the same spectrum of ability as everybody else. FLATOW: Or maybe you should just spin it off and have a contest or a national math off of something based on \"Numb3rs,\" you know, using the \"Numb3rs\" logo. Dr. DEVLIN: I'll bet that's going to be fair to spinoffs for this. I mean, you know, Gary has already mentioned the huge NCTM project. I've used it in - I give courses for non-science majors at universities and colleges. I give talks in high schools. I often show clips from \"Numb3rs\" when I'm doing that. And it make - it does wonders for creating interest in the subject from groups who would historically and traditionally have thought of themselves and be thought of as not interested in doing mathematics and even worse, been classified as not capable of doing mathematics. FLATOW: Well, Keith, Gary, thank you both for taking time to be with us today. And good luck to you. Dr. DEVLIN: Okay, thanks. My pleasure, Ira. FLATOW: You're welcome. Keith -Dr. LORDEN: Thank you, Ira. It was great to be with you. FLATOW: As always. Keith Devlin is executive director of Stanford University's Center for the Study of Language and Information. He's also NPR's math guy. And Gary Lorden is professor of math at Caltech and a math consultant to the television show \"Numb3rs. \" The book is \"The Numbers Behind Numb3rs: Solving Crime with Mathematics. \" Really interesting stuff, good reading - I hope you all pick up a copy of it.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  If you're a fan of television crime drama, you've probably seen the show \"Numb3rs. \" It's on Friday night on CBS, and it's one of the most popular shows on the network. Each week, the main character of Charlie helps his detective brother solve crimes, not by using those strange lights they do on one of the \"CSI\" shows, some - the liquids and whatever. His tool is using math. He puts math to work, because Charlie is a - the character is a brilliant mathematician professor at the made-up Cal Sci University. And his crime-fighting arsenal may include everything from the Riemann hypothesis to game theory to link analysis.  He really is quite the mathematician. But maybe you're not, you know? Maybe you've found yourself wondering, hey, you know, I know that stuff on the other \"CSI\" shows. Real-time police don't have all those tools. How much, you know, use can real-time police make of all the mathematics and detectives make of all the math they see on these shows? Can math really help the police solve crimes?  Well, joining me now to talk about it are my guests. They are co-authors of a new book out that's quite an interesting read. It's called \"The Numbers Behind Numb3rs. \" And let me introduce them. Gary Lorden he is the co-author. He's professor of mathematics at California Institute of Technology - a real place -and the math consultant to the television show \"Numb3rs. \" He joins us from KPCC in Pasadena.  Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Lorden.  Dr. GARY LORDEN (Professor of Mathematics, California Institute of Technology; Co-author, \"The Numbers Behind Numb3rs\"): Thanks, Ira. It's a pleasure to be here.  FLATOW: You're welcome.  Keith Devlin is the NPR math guy. He's also co-author of the book \"The Numbers Behind Numb3rs. \" He's executive director of Stanford University's Center for the Study of Language and Information. He joins us of from Stanford.  Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Dr. KEITH DEVLIN (Executive Director, Stanford University Center for the Study of Language and Information; Co-author, \"The Numbers Behind Numb3rs\"): Hi, Ira. Nice talking to you again.  FLATOW: Hi, how are you?  Dr. DEVLIN: Better. Good. Thank you.  FLATOW: How much - let me ask you, Gary. What do you do as a consultant on the show \"Numb3rs\"? Do you come up with the plot theme or, you know, they run it by you?  Dr. LORDEN: The latter. What happens on the show, depending on which writers -they have over a dozen - are doing an episode is that they, either fairly early - while they're developing the idea - consult with me a little bit about it, or more typically, I see a version of the script at the stage a couple of weeks before they actually start shooting. And then, I'm supposed to see if the math that they're thinking of using is realistic enough, and if not, what to suggest instead.  FLATOW: Do they stretch the math a lot? I mean, do you have to, you know, decide whether your integrity is compromised?  Dr. LORDEN: Actually, it's not so much question of integrity as hype. Just like Dr. House and some of the lawyer shows, what is done on television always involves a superhuman - a superhero, and in this case it's the mathematician, which is of course, wonderful for me. The mathematician is able to do things that in the real world would require a lot more data and a lot more time. He's able to pull things together and come up with very insightful math that helps the FBI determine exactly who to go after.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. The first chapter of you book talks about geographic profiling. It's used to catch serial killers. Tell us what that is?  Dr. LORDEN: Well, geographic profiling is an idea that carries mathematics into that sort of standard image we've all seen in movies and TV crime-fighting for a long time, where they have a map on a board some place and they have little pins on it showing the locations of some attacker. And the idea of geographic profiling is to try to use those locations to deduce mathematically where the most likely zone is in which the attacker lives or works, that is his home base.  And that was actually done in a real case in Louisiana, a serial rape case. And the crime was solved with the help of a former Canadian - Royal Canadian Mounted policeman who happened to get a PhD and do a thesis in this mathematical method called geographical profiling. His name is Kim Rossmo. And the first episode of the show detailed how the same kind of math that Kim used; in fact, the same formula to solve the real case would solve the case on television.  FLATOW: On the other hand, Keith Devlin, if you were a serial killer and you were a little bit savvy about math and knew about this technique, couldn't you thwart the pattern by doing something unexpected so it would not fit into it?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. DEVLIN: You know you might think that, but in fact, we feel that we have sort of free choice and we do what we want. But people, because of the way we're put together, tend out to be remarkably predictable. And, you know, I might hold off the cops for a few extra crimes by trying to hide my tracks, but just because I'm a human being - particularly if I'm a psychopathic human being who is particularly ritualistic about my behavior - it wouldn't take more than an extra few data points for those equations to catch me no matter what I do. People cannot behave randomly sufficiently well to thwart off mathematics. Mathematics will get them in the end.  FLATOW: How did you convinced, both of you, how did you convinced the producers of a TV show to do something based on mathematics? I would think that will be almost mission impossible - not to mention another show.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. LORDEN: Well, that, actually, that convincing was done by the husband and wife team who created the show, Cheryl Heuton and Nick Falacci. They're still, kind of the head writers and do a lot of the episodes, and they live just a couple of miles from Pasadena - excuse me - from Caltech in Pasadena and they based the show on the idea of a Richard Feynman-like genius.  Feynman was a Nobel Prize-winning physics professor at Caltech. And they wanted a younger version who would be - a mathematician, who would help his older brother who works for the FBI solve these crimes. And they pitched that idea to CBS. And CBS, in their great wisdom, thought that that would be an appealing idea and they commissioned a pilot, actually two pilots, the second of which was shot on campus - many scenes at Caltech.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. LORDEN: And so it worked. The focus group said, gee, we like the math. And so CBS took a fly around it, and the show's been consistently winning its timeslot at 10 o'clock on Friday nights. And most times, actually wins all the Friday night - has the most viewers of any show on Friday night.  FLATOW: Hmm. Do you think you're doing a public service when you do this show?  Dr. LORDEN: I think we all do, who are associated with the show, yes.  Dr. DEVLIN: Yeah. You know, in fact, I - go ahead, Gary.  Dr. LORDEN: Go ahead, Keith. Go ahead.  Dr. DEVLIN: Okay. Now, in fact, I, you know, I saw a rough cut of the first pilot before it was ever broadcast. They were sort of circulating around mathematicians. And I was so hooked on the idea and the way they've done it that I e-mailed immediately Nick and Cheryl, who I've never met, and said this looks great. If you need any help from someone in the business, I'd be delighted to help. And in fact, in the first series, I did help out occasionally with some advice. But I've - I thought this was a great thing and I was very pleased that they accepted my offer to be part of it.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Do people actually tune in to see the math be the hero in this show?  Dr. LORDEN: I think they do.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. LORDEN: We certainly do, and lots of other people tell us that they do. Lots of times, I'll be in an airport somewhere and encounter somebody. And if my wife brags that, you know, I work on the TV show \"Numb3rs,\" they'll say, oh, I love that show. I love the math, and so on. And these are people who, you know, never took calculus in their lives, have no idea about advanced mathematics. But the way the math is presented on the show, many people say it's engaging and makes them feel smart just to see and hear the way Charlie explains the math. And he does it in a brilliant way. It's nothing like\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. LORDEN: \u2026college or high school lecture.  FLATOW: But I remember from some of the early shows - and maybe the first season, I remember one of the show is opening with something that had math that had nothing to do with the rest of the show. It was, I think, the Fibonacci series on a flower or something like that. They were sitting around in their little communal area and someone had a flower in a vase and just started talking about it.  Dr. LORDEN: That was one of the great endings of the show. What the writers like to do, since the show really crucially involves the three people in this family - the wonderful actor Judd Hirsch plays the father of the FBI brother and the younger brother who's a mathematician - Rob Morrow and David Krumholtz play those parts.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. LORDEN: And the show often ends with them or some of the others involved -the FBI agents and so on - sitting around after the case is solved. And the one you're talking about with the flower was one where Charlie gets a little bit of a challenge from one of the female agents about, you know, really what is math, why do you use math so much, and what's it good for, and is it really that useful, and so on.  Of course, she's just seen how he solved the case using it. And then, he goes in, Charlie does, to this wonderful explanation about mathematics is everywhere even in a flower, and he talks about the Fibonacci sequence and all the ways that it and the golden ratio that's involved in characterizing it appear in Parthenon and Rome and in the shape of a card that's used to advertise sweepstakes and so on and so forth. It's a wonderful scene, and the actor David Krumholtz was just thrilled to have the chance to do that scene.  FLATOW: Are you familiar with the Richard Feynman statement about that that's saying, if I can see the beauty in a flower more than you do, it's because I appreciate the math and the other things behind it.  Dr. LORDEN: Yeah. Feynman had a lot of those insights, and since Nick and Cheryl are great fans of Feynman and have read a great deal about him, they like to incorporate sort of Feynman-like touches in the way the characters on the show behave. It's not just Charlie. He has a beautiful fellow mathematician who actually was his PhD student, Amita, played by the wonderful actress Navi Rawat. And then, he has this sort of corky physicist, slightly older colleague who was a mentor of his in his student days, and that's played by Peter MacNicol. And between the three of them and the occasional other characters -in fact, in tonight's episode, they're introducing a new character who's sort of a rough, street\u2026  FLATOW: Oh, tell us about it.  Dr. LORDEN: Well, he's a kind of street-smart electrical - excuse me -mechanical engineer. He's one of these guys that if you saw him on the street with the tattoos and stuff in a kind of scruffy jeans and T-shirt, you'd never think that he was a professor at a school like Caltech. CalSci is just a scarcely disguised version of Caltech. And so, the character is able to use some of the street smarts, it's - actually, I'm sorry. It's not tonight's episode, I think it's next week's episode\u2026  Dr. DEVLIN: Oh, a preview.  Dr. LORDEN: \u2026where he has a lot of knowledge about cars and the way modifications of cars are used for things like street drag racing and so on and so forth. So it turns out that, you know, he can bring a lot more to the table when he consults with his colleagues, Larry and Charlie, from other sides of campus. And I think he's going to enrich a lot of the action on the show, the sort of human-interest stuff to see more of the faculty colleagues that Charlie, the mathematician, has.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. We're talking with Keith Devlin and Gary Lorden, who were co-authors of \"The Numbers Behind Numb3rs: Solving Crime with Mathematics,\" based on the TV show \"Numb3rs\" which is the E - and it has 3 backwards. Any - either of you two think of that or that's just the artistic department come up with?  Dr. DEVLIN: That was the television people who did that.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. DEVLIN: I wish I had thought of that. I think it was maybe Tony Scott that's behind this who was the executive producer\u2026  Dr. LORDEN: When I first saw that in an e-mail from the public relations part of Caltech - I got an e-mail saying, well, you're head of the math department, maybe you want to come and meet with this producer. They're thinking of doing a pilot and want to do it at Caltech and so on and so forth, and the show is supposed to be called \"Numb3rs\" and with a 3 in it. And, of course, it wasn't backwards because it was just typed around an ordinary keyboard. And I looked at that and thought oh, gee, that's kind of hokey. And so when it turns out to be brilliant\u2026  FLATOW: All right.  Dr. LORDEN: \u2026because we're in the age of Google and\u2026  FLATOW: There you go. Hang on. I've got to take a break. We have to take a break. We'll be right back in a short break. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking about \"The Numbers Behind Numb3rs: Solving Crime with Mathematics,\" with the authors Gary Lorden and Keith Devlin. And when I interrupted, you're about to give me the punch line of the story behind why \"Numb3rs\" - what you thought of the 3 in \"Numb3rs. \"  Dr. LORDEN: Yeah, the brilliance of that conception is not only that it makes it sort of a catchy logo for the TV screen, but that in an age of Google, one of the things we really want to do with the show is encourage people, particularly students, who might, you know, be intrigued about some of the math on the show to go on the Internet and try to look up more about the Riemann hypothesis, for example, or the P versus NP problem or something like that that comes up on the show. And what they can do when they put in numb3rs with a 3 instead of an E is restrict all of their answers very readily on Google to being about the show or about our book, now, I would hope.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. LORDEN: And with just an E, if you type in numbers into Google, I don't know how many millions of returns you get, but there's a lot of Web sites that use the word numbers without the 3 in it.  FLATOW: Let's go to the questions. Jolan(ph) in \"Second Life\" asks. This go right to the media, she says, I'm French and I watch \"Numb3rs. \" Is \"Numb3rs\" often realistic about solving crime by mathematics? In other words, the central question, do real detectives use numbers like these or did - or anybody have the power - these geniuses, these mathematicians that you have on the show?  Dr. DEVLIN: Yeah, I mean, you know, Gary mentioned, totally. Garry said that -my old mentors that the - there's a type - there's the whole thing you're certainly hyped and it's exaggerated in terms of the timescale and one person doing it. But if you take that away and you factor it back down to, in principle, could this mathematics be used to solve that crime, the answer is very often yes. It wouldn't take - it would longer than the 42 minutes and it wouldn't take one person. It might take six months and a team of people, but, by and large, with one or two exceptions, when you see mathematics presented in the show, when you see Charlie say, I'm going to use (unintelligible) influence to solve this crime and help you solve this crime - if you sit back and think of it, if you got mathematical knowledge, you think, yeah, actually that's certainly possible. So factor out the - all of the hype side, the stuff that's required to make it a fast-paced episode, and the answer is yes, it's believable.  FLATOW: Okay. Let's talk about one case, for example. Keith, you write in your book about the statistics for fighting crime, and one case in particular was really interesting. This was a nurse who seemed to have a lot of patients. Tell us about that one.  Dr. DEVLIN: Yeah. And several of the - most of the chapters in the book are actually based on episodes of \"Numb3rs. \" But this is one where there's a real case that as far as you know hasn't really been reflected in the TV series. But of course, all the scriptwriters now have our book, and so I'm sure it's going to appear in the series.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. DEVLIN: This was a case in the mid-1990s in Massachusetts, where there was a nurse in a Veterans Affairs hospital. She was usually on the night shift. And her colleagues noticed that there seem to be more cardiac arrests when she was on duty. You know, there was - suspicions were aroused. And the suspicion was that - it's almost like fire fighters who start fires because they like the exercise, the (unintelligible) like the fun of fighting fires. They thought that she would love the excitement of trying to save these people. And sometimes, she was successful in saving them; often, she wasn't. But they suspected that she was actually causing these heart attacks by injecting them with a drug in the first place.  So they looked at all the data - actually, eventually, they persuaded the state to put a grand jury together to investigate this - and they looked at the data. And sure enough, on the shifts when this person, Kristen Gilbert, was in charge of the ward, there were more deaths from cardiac arrests or more cases of cardiac arrests - some in deaths - some resulting in deaths, some not - than there were otherwise. The question was, was that just one of these flukes? Because these are small numbers, you know, you're talking about maybe one person, two people here, another couple the next month. So you're really only talking about six, seven, eight deaths. But it seems - the question is what is this - what is statistically significant? Was there something going on?  Simply, looking at the charts and graphing them isn't going to tell you that. You have to do a detailed statistical analysis. And indeed, the grand jury commissioned a statistician to analyze the data. And the results of that was the chances of that increase in cardiac cases being purely due to chance was less than one in 100 million. In other words, it was a virtual certainty that something was causing them. Whether she was causing them was another issue, that's what the court have been trying to do in the trial. But it was certainly wasn't just a random fluctuation. Someone or something had been causing them deliberately.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let's talk a bit about something that you write about in the book. You write that - it has to do with the war on terror. And we know that the government has all kinds of data mining that it's doing. And you write that machine learning is, quote, \"perhaps the single most important tool within the law enforcement community's data mining arsenal when it comes to profiling, enhanced catching or preventing criminals and terrorists. \" Can you tell us what machine learning is?  Dr. DEVLIN: Okay. That's - actually, the center that I direct at Stanford is actually the world's leader in doing that thing. It's where you - it's a branch of what was known as artificial - still is known as artificial intelligence. It means you have a computer program which you present lots of data, it could be data about - an obvious one is can you determine the profile of someone entering the country who's likely to be a terrorist?  So you look up lots and lots of profiles of people entering the country and you let the computer compare that data with a list of known terrorists entering the country. And it looks for patterns; it looks for hidden patterns to see if you can come up with a set of criteria of characteristics that would be - that would tell you that that person, when they're trying to enter the country, was likely to be a criminal.  So it's uncovering hidden patterns, but it's doing them by the computer itself examining the data. Human beings could do this well if they were faced with about 20 or 30 cases. But, you know, the immigration services have hundreds of thousands of data points to look out, and so you have to let computers find the patterns. It's not enough to expect a human being to find them.  FLATOW: Let's go to Tom(ph) on line 3. Hi, Tom.  TOM (Caller): Hey. Hi, Ira.  FLATOW: How are you?  TOM: Great. Thanks for taking my call. I really love your show.  FLATOW: Thank you.  TOM: Yeah. I was wondering, now that the FBI is taking over from Blackwater regarding their CEOs and other important people, diplomats and so on in Iraq, do you think they would use supercomputers, higher mathematics to calculate the odds of, say, an ambush in any particular time or place in, you know, Iraq, Afghanistan or anywhere else in the world?  Dr. DEVLIN: You know, the Defense Department was doing that long before 9/11. They've been using computer methods, mathematical methods to try and highlight likely targets of terrorist attacks. They've been doing that for a long time.  Dr. LORDEN: It's called threat assessment. And mathematicians - there were many thousands of them, PhD mathematicians, who are very high level - work for various agencies of the government and think tanks that worked for those agencies. And as Keith says, they've been doing all these kinds of assessments for a long time. And both Keith and I participated in classified work with some of those mathematicians that do it. And particularly since 9/11, the use of mathematical methods to fight terror is a very major effort within the U. S. government.  FLATOW: You wrote in your book that it had predicted at least of the site for 9/11 - the Pentagon as being a high-profile target.  Dr. DEVLIN: Yeah. That was actually an interesting case. There was small company in the Washington Beltway district with its small defense contract. It was commissioned by the Defense Department to develop a software system to try and produce one of these threat assessment matrices. And early in 2001, they ran this on test data and one of the targets that came right up to the top of the list was the Pentagon. And the irony is, with hindsight, is that when the people who developed that - this was a company associated with George Mason University - when they wrote up the reports of this, they actually said one of the targets that was found was the Pentagon.  Of course, you would expect this when you're running test data, and everybody dismissed it. And with 20/20 vision, you know, it seems to sort of second-guess it. If I've been in their place, I've had dismissed it too. But what it shows was that although people with obvious - we'll tend to dismiss things that's being too obvious or too - out of the realms of possibility, mathematics doesn't have any prejudices. That mathematics looked at the data and said the Pentagon is a high-risk target. And by golly, it turned out to be right within six months of that report being written.  Dr. LORDEN: Another great success - Oh, I'm sorry. I was going to say another great\u2026  FLATOW: Sure. Go ahead.  Dr. LORDEN: \u2026another great success in the book that we describe in a chapter called Connecting the Dots is the use of graph theory, network's link analysis and so on. And this is something that I know for sure, from firsthand experience, is used in counterterror work in the government. And we talk about a stunning success, where it was actually used to find al-Zarqawi, or at least people close to al-Zarqawi, who was the head of al-Qaida in Iraq. And that was the basis for ultimately taking him out with bombs.  So there are some really important successes. We can't obviously talk about the details in the book. But where the mathematical methods, some of which have been illustrated on the show, where you take points and lines - points are people; the lines are relationships between them or communications between them - and you construct what mathematicians call a graph or a network, and then you do all kinds of probabilistic analysis and all kinds of other analysis.  We described one in the book, where social network analyst in private practice as a consultant for corporations, a man named Valdis Krebs, did an analysis and published it on the Web after 9/11. From just publicly available data and some of the standard ways of determining who are the important people in a network, he was able to pinpoint Mohamed Atta, who played a central role in the 9/11 attacks.  FLATOW: When you say you can't talk about it, does that mean because you were actively involved in helping out here?  Dr. LORDEN: Well, both Keith and I have consulted with organizations that are involved in very highly classified research, and so we know firsthand that some of our mathematical colleagues are not just at universities - although a lot of people at universities like us have helped - but there are full-time expert mathematicians who are working on things like basing an inference, social network analysis and so on as we speak.  And when you see successes that are published in the media - or even sometimes you don't hear about them because they are not, you know, quite such striking figures as al-Zarqawi - a lot of those results depend upon mathematical, statistical, probabilistic data mining kinds of analyses. And so, the government gives grants to mathematicians at universities to work on methods for those things. So it's really a very large-scale effort.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Does any of that filtered down to the local level?  Dr. LORDEN: Yes. I was actually talking to somebody about the book just the other day in an interview, and she asked something about that. And I said, well, you know, it's like all kinds of other things. If you are dealing with Wal-Mart as a costumer, then you know that when you purchase something, it goes into their computerized database and they are able to do incredible things with it that help them determine where to put things in the aisles in the store and how to advertise and how to price and all those kinds of things.  When you go down to the mom-and-pop store on the corner, they may have a laptop but they're probably not using it to analyze your purchases, and I think it's similar with police. I've never actually consulted with police departments or even the FBI. I know from talking to some of the people associated with the show that, yes, they have used math on occasion, but surely not at the level that it's regularly used with mathematicians regularly working on cases for a very long period of time the way it is at the high level, for the National Security Agency or the CIA or so on.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Can you ever get to the point where quantum physics, quantum mathematics might be useful to solve\u2026  Dr. DEVLIN: Boy, I'm going to thought - went over to Gary, because I have no idea, and maybe Gary doesn't either.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. LORDEN: Well, yes. For example, one of my former students at Caltech, Peter Shor, is famous for, among other things, working on quantum computing. And we don't, as far as I know, physically have quantum computers yet. But my colleague, Professor Preskill, at Caltech and lots of others are concentrating a lot of research on that. And when we do have quantum computers, they're going to be among those deeply buried in the various agencies of the government machines - I assume the best ones, will be working on counterterror. So, yes, I think every possible tool, from theoretical physics or any other branch of science will be brought to bear.  FLATOW: Talking with Keith Devlin and Gary Lorden, author of \"The Numbers Behind Numb3rs\" on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, with just a little bit of time left. What would you like to do that you can't do, that they keep telling you no? Tell us what\u2026  Dr. LORDEN: I would like to see - and I know David Krumholtz, the actor who plays Charlie, wonderful actor and he really loves doing the math and having it influence the audience. He's so proud of the fact, for example, that there is a program with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics in partnership with Texas Instruments, where 48,000 high school and junior high math teachers are signed up and regularly receive, from a special panel that the NCPM set up, problem sets that they give their students keyed to the episodes of \"Numb3rs,\" so that when a 14-year-old watches \"Numb3rs\" on a Friday night and comes to school the next week, they get math problems in class that are word problems about Agent Reeves did this and blah, blah, blah. So they really love it.  And what I'd like to see - and I know Krumholtz feels the same way - is more illustrations of how a math professor functions in the rest of their time on campus, not just working for the FBI, but teaching, you know, interacting with students. And there've been a few scenes like that in the history of the show, but we'd like to see many more of them. And I think it would be a wonderful opportunity to show the excitement of doing mathematics because students can portray that very well.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And now that we're living in an era where you can watch these things whenever you want to, right on the Web site, you can assign stuff, you can make, you know, you can assign - if it's not for Friday night, some other night.  Dr. DEVLIN: Yeah, and because that technology only exists because of the mathematics behind it. I mean, let's not forget that the very computer is a product of mathematics of the 19th century and then into the early 20th century. And just adding to what Gary said, you know, I - lots of people say that they can't do mathematics. But if you simply think of how the human brain developed through natural selection - natural selection doesn't produce 5 percents of the brains of the population that can do mathematics and 95 percent that don't. It produces a spectrum of ability. And once you've got a spectrum of ability, any one who is motivated and wants to do something can actually do pretty - can do better at it than when they start.  And I think the key to mathematics is motivation, and that unpacks when you are talking to young people to it being cool. Young kids don't want to be seen doing something that's not cool. And try as though we might, people like Gary and I have never been able to succeed to make mathematics look cool. We look like mathematicians. Now, we've got Charlie, played by David Krumholtz, giving these wonderful, cool, sexy image to mathematics. And there's already evidence that's beginning to turn things around. And kids in school are saying, you know, it actually is cool to do mathematics. I'm interested in doing mathematics. I want to do it.  Then if you've got those pieces in place, there's nothing on Earth that will stop them becoming good at mathematics because they're all on the same spectrum of ability as everybody else.  FLATOW: Or maybe you should just spin it off and have a contest or a national math off of something based on \"Numb3rs,\" you know, using the \"Numb3rs\" logo.  Dr. DEVLIN: I'll bet that's going to be fair to spinoffs for this. I mean, you know, Gary has already mentioned the huge NCTM project. I've used it in - I give courses for non-science majors at universities and colleges. I give talks in high schools. I often show clips from \"Numb3rs\" when I'm doing that. And it make - it does wonders for creating interest in the subject from groups who would historically and traditionally have thought of themselves and be thought of as not interested in doing mathematics and even worse, been classified as not capable of doing mathematics.  FLATOW: Well, Keith, Gary, thank you both for taking time to be with us today. And good luck to you.  Dr. DEVLIN: Okay, thanks. My pleasure, Ira.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Keith - Dr. LORDEN: Thank you, Ira. It was great to be with you.  FLATOW: As always. Keith Devlin is executive director of Stanford University's Center for the Study of Language and Information. He's also NPR's math guy. And Gary Lorden is professor of math at Caltech and a math consultant to the television show \"Numb3rs. \" The book is \"The Numbers Behind Numb3rs: Solving Crime with Mathematics. \" Really interesting stuff, good reading - I hope you all pick up a copy of it.

Anyone who's ever fallen in love knows that sometimes you become so crazed with affection that you might fail to notice certain things about the object of your affection.  Our final story today is a tale of blind love with consequences. It's a story about world famous author and neurologist Doctor Oliver Sacks. Our narrator is NPR's science correspondent Robert Krulwich. ROBERT KRULWICH: So a few years ago, Oliver Sacks was sitting alone in his kitchen - I'd come to interview him. And as I walked in, I saw him holding a Q-tip, a cotton swab, and he was very tenderly brushing, almost caressing a little plant - it was a houseplant - but not the kind of plant an ordinary person would ever put in a pot, because it was so not pretty. Dr. OLIVER SACKS (Neurologist): Yeah. Well, it has no leaves; it has no foliage; it has no flowers; it simply consists of thin green stems about the size of a pencil lead.  KRULWICH: Imagine a dull green stalk with a bump on the top. It's not the kind of thing you'd buy on Valentine's Day, but Oliver gazed at this plant like a man in love. It had been given to him as a special gift by a professor at Brown University. And all this was four years ago. When we talked about this again recently, he recalled those Q-tip days and how upset he'd been. Dr. SACKS: Well, the plant has got infected with an insect, a so-called sapsucker. KRULWICH: And you were just washing it gently with cotton swabs? Dr. SACKS: And alcohol, daily, to keep it alive. It was putting up a valiant fight. I was helping it. KRULWICH: But why go to all this trouble over something. . . Dr. SACKS: Well, this plant is a survivor. KRULWICH: It turns out that these simple little branching stalks. . . Dr. SACKS: The plant's name is Psilotum. KRULWICH: Psilotum first evolved, first appeared on Earth, the science book said, four to 500 million years ago in the Silurian era. And Oliver, who loves a good story, read that these are such an old species that back when they started, everything alive was in the ocean. Everything. Dr. SACKS: Yes. I mean, there were seaweeds and animals in the sea, but the land was completely bare and strangely bare.  KRULWICH: So before this there was just rock, sky and water. Dr. SACKS: Absolutely. KRULWICH: And these plants collectively called Psilophytes, the book said, were the very first to stick their heads out of the water like true pioneers and create the first tiny blush of green at the edge of land all over the world. Before ferns, before lichen, they were the first terrestrial plants. Before they existed? Dr. SACKS: There was no green to see. And I love the idea that this thing was a survivor from half a billion years ago, that whereas all other plants have got more complicated and fussy and had leaves and flowers and seeds and cones and so forth, this thing preserved its simple purity. KRULWICH: To this day? I mean, can you find it somewhere in the wild? Dr. SACKS: Yeah. Psilotum is to be found everywhere in the wild. KRULWICH: It's just that nobody cares. The world's first land plant stayed so modest and so plain and so ignorable, nobody honors them except, of course, Oliver, whose Psilotum, arguably the only one in a pot in Greenwich Village, was suddenly attacked by insects who would not go away no matter what Oliver did. Dr. SACKS: The plant struggled and I struggled with it valiantly for, I think, six or seven years.  KRULWICH: At one point desperate, Oliver found a book with multi-page drawings of how the world looked 450 million years ago. Dr. SACKS: Showing these first Psilophytes on land, and I though that would sort of, you know, make the Psilotum feel at home.  KRULWICH: So he went to a Xerox machine and he copied the drawing. Dr. SACKS: I blew it up. I think I made a sort of a semicircle.  KRULWICH: And he stapled the pages together to kind of surround the plant. Dr. SACKS: And I think the plant appreciated it. It seemed to better. KRULWICH: For a while. But then. . . Dr. SACKS: One day, I think I'd been away for a couple of weeks, and when I came back it was covered with these horrid little white insects sucking it. And I said, I think, I think it's time, goodbye, and I dropped it down the incinerator. I hear almost a sob in my throat. (Soundbite of laughter)  KRULWICH: But not to worry because Oliver assumed his Psilotum was just one of many, many hiding unnoticed in the wild - until last year. He got a phone call from a biologist friend who told him that geneticists have looked for the very first time at the DNA of Psilotum, and discovered to their amazement that this plant. . . Dr. SACKS: Although it looks very similar to the plants of 400 million years ago, it is not in fact a primitive. KRULWICH: Psilotum is not an ancient plant. It looks ancient. Its shape, its size perfectly matches fossils from 500 million years ago. But in one of nature's way odd little accidents, inside it has modern DNA. So the plant fooled Oliver.  Dr. SACKS:  And I wasn't the only person that was fooled. I mean, many generations of botanists were fooled. KRULWICH: So when Oliver conducted his funeral by the incinerator, when he said goodbye to what he thought was a survivor, in fact he was a little late. The last true Psilophyte died about 350 million years ago. They'd already said goodbye. So in the end, it was a double loss. Yes, he lost a plant he really loved, but what he really lost was that story, that lovely story. Robert Krulwich, NPR News. (Soundbite of music)  COHEN: Jilted by the plant world, writer Oliver Sacks turned his affections back to the human brain. His new book, \"Musicophilia,\" is out later this month. It's about the brain and music.  ALEX COHEN, host:  Back now with DAY TO DAY.

KRULWICH: So when Oliver conducted his funeral by the incinerator, when he said goodbye to what he thought was a survivor, in fact he was a little late. The last true Psilophyte died about 350 million years ago. They'd already said goodbye. So in the end, it was a double loss. Yes, he lost a plant he really loved, but what he really lost was that story, that lovely story.  Robert Krulwich, NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)   COHEN: Jilted by the plant world, writer Oliver Sacks turned his affections back to the human brain. His new book, \"Musicophilia,\" is out later this month. It's about the brain and music. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2007 NPR.  All rights reserved.

David Heckerman and his colleagues at Microsoft were inspired by spam that most of us are just annoyed by those unwanted e-mails. But Doctor Heckerman finds inspiration in them. He says the study of spam may prove useful in developing an AIDS vaccine. Doctor Heckerman is at the Microsoft campus in Redman, Washington. Welcome. Dr. DAVID HECKERMAN (Manager, eScience Research Group, Microsoft Research): Thanks, James. HATTORI: Doctor Heckerman, you're both a physician and a computer scientist. Now we know Microsoft is in the forefront of battling spam but does that have to do with HIV? Dr. HECKERMAN: Well, it turns out our immune systems are a lot like spam filter, they're constantly watching for bad things such as viruses and other bugs and they usually stop them in their tracks. But just as some clever spammers mutate their e-mails to evade spam filters, HIV mutates itself to evade our immune system. HATTORI: So there are similarities between how spammers constantly change their tactics to evade these spam blockers and how the AIDS virus changes or mutates when it's in the human body? Dr. HECKERMAN: Exactly. For example, spammers will replace the letter I in Viagra with the number one, which looks like an I to us but it makes the spam filter miss the message. HIV actually changes itself to avoid the attack of our immune system. In the case of spam, what we tried to do is figure out what spammers are going to do next and prepare our filters for those changes. Similarly with HIV, we're trying to find HIV's escape pass using complex computer algorithms to prepare our immune system for those changes. And the way we prepare our immune system is with the vaccine. HATTORI: Yeah. So that's the goal of the research being done by you and your colleagues - to eventually come up with something that will lead to a vaccine. Dr. HECKERMAN: Exactly. HATTORI: What is it about HIV that makes it so difficult to combat - so difficult to find the vaccine? Dr. HECKERMAN: In one way, solving the HIV problem is a bit easier than solving the spam problem. In that, these dastardly spammers come up with some very tricky mutations whereas, fortunately for us, HIV is not so clever. However, there are some very tricky problems with dealing with HIV that makes it even harder to deal with than with spam. For example, with spam, we get to watch it mutate on minute-by-minute basis. With HIV, we typically only see a single snap shot of the virus after it's had a long time - maybe a year - to evade the immune system. And to find these hidden paths of HIV mutation, we have to run computer simulations - much like weather simulations - to see which mutational paths best fit the small amount of data that we can see. To run a single analysis would take one year on a single computer. But thanks to the super computers we have at Microsoft, we're able to do that in a fraction of a day. HATTORI: What else makes it difficult to find this vaccine? Dr. HECKERMAN: Well, one issue that makes both fighting spam and fighting HIV tough is that they are different in different parts of the world. And what makes the HIV problem even tougher is that each of us has a different immune system, so that HIV mutates differently in each of us. Because of this variability, we may not be able to build a single vaccine that works for everyone. But perhaps we can build a vaccine that will cover most people in a large region. To do this, we've developed computer algorithms that exploit the commonalities among the different kinds of HIV and the commonalities among our different immune systems. HATTORI: Will your research be used, eventually, in an actual vaccine trial soon? Dr. HECKERMAN: Yes. We're putting together some promising vaccine designs based on the new information we've gained from our computer simulations. And the next step will be to put these designs to the test in clinical trials. It'll be years before we have definitive results from those trials, but I'm optimistic.

I'm Alex Chadwick. ALEX COHEN, host:  I'm Alex Cohen. We've all heard about skyrocketing rates of diabetes in the U. S. But here is a truly troubling statistic: Nearly a quarter of all Native American adults suffers from diabetes. That's nearly three times the average of the rest of the country. Two sisters are trying to put an end to that. They're waging a battle against diabetes on the Navajo Nation; that's the largest reservation in the U. S. Arizona Public Radio's Daniel Kraker has this report. Ms. LITA SCOTT (Nurse): We lost a lot of family. We lost uncles, grandpas, aunts. DANIEL KRAKER: Few people have felt the scourge of diabetes on the reservation more than Lita Scott. Ms. SCOTT: Those are reminders for me and my family about where we have to go to prevent diabetes. And whenever I work, I always think about that.  KRAKER: Scott is the diabetes community health nurse in Winslow, Arizona, a small dusty town on the edge of the Navajo Reservation. She's a tiny woman, intense and passionate when she talks about diabetes' impact on her people. Shortly after she finished nursing school, her diabetic father suffered a heart attack. From that moment on, she has devoted her career to fighting the disease. So has her younger sister Laura. Ms. LAURA CLELAND: Does that feel good? Mr. HERMAN SCOTT: Yeah. Yeah. KRAKER: Laura Cleland is kneeling in a cramped office, massaging her father's feet. Herman Scott, now 70, is sitting barefoot, his blue jeans rolled up and a black cowboy hat perched on his head. Ms. CLELAND: When was it, Dad, '95, when you had your heart attack? Mr. SCOTT: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Ms. CLELAND: And he - (foreign language spoken) Mr. SCOTT: This side. Ms. CLELAND: This side had an ulcer. There was a blood clot, and an ulcer was formed there. And they were talking amputation. KRAKER: Every year there are about 86,000 diabetes-related amputations in the U. S. Native Americans have one of the highest rates in the world. Herman Scott was lucky. His ulcer healed. But his heart attack moved Laura Cleland to quit her job in Tulsa, Oklahoma and start a business distributing therapeutic shoes to 2,000 diabetics on the reservation. Mr. SCOTT: Is that too big? Ms. CLELAND: I think it's too big, Dad. Mr. SCOTT: Okay. Ms. CLELAND: We need to get a smaller size. KRAKER: Today she's sizing her dad for a new pair of what look like fancy black leather hiking boots. She pulls out a thick insert in the sole of the shoe.  Ms. CLELAND: What this does is that it really protects the feet from developing the calluses, which leads to ulcerations and then amputation if people aren't careful.  KRAKER: Since Cleland started, she has seen amputation rates among her patients slowly decline. But diabetes rates continue to escalate. They've gone up 70 percent in the past decade among Native American teenagers. Dr. FRANK ARMAO (Winslow Indian Health Care Center): It's no mystery why diabetes should have reared its ugly head when it did and become such a huge issue for the Navajo people. KRAKER: Frank Armao was the clinical director at Winslow Indian Health Care Center. He says it wasn't that long ago that under-nutrition was killing Navajo people. Dr. ARMAO: And suddenly you go from that situation to interstate highway comes through and there's fast food available, and I think that's a major - it's a divide in this epidemic. KRAKER: More than half of Navajo adults are now overweight and nearly half of children; add to that chronic poverty in the Reservation and inactive lifestyles and Armao says you have a perfect recipe for an epidemic. Dr. ARMEO: I think sometimes the people get the feeling like there's something wrong with them. It's a genetic thing, or it's, you know, some stereotype of being too lazy or too this or this, and really isn't. It's just a confluence of a lot of unfortunate circumstances. KRAKER: That's not to say there's nothing Navajo people can do to change those circumstances. But for decades many people say they felt powerless in the face of the disease. And that makes sisters Laura Cleland and Lita Scott's work even more unusual and more important. Lita Scott recently helped start a wellness and exercise center near her hometown on the reservation. And she's even started a tae kwon do program in Winslow for kids at risk for the disease. Type 2 diabetes, the variety most prevalent among Native Americans, historically has targeted mainly older adults. Now it's increasingly attacking Navajo kids. (Soundbite of tae kwon do class)  KRAKER: About 30 kids are lined up in starched white uniforms practicing kicks. Verna Bahi's(ph) nine-year-old daughter Lucy is one of the students. Bahi herself is a diabetic, so is her mother. But she hopes the tae kwon do classes will help give her daughter a different future. Ms. VERNA BAHI: Her way and her attitude have changed a lot. This is teaching my daughter how to stay healthy. KRAKER: Lucy Bahi is a tiny ray of hope in what can seem like an overwhelming plight. For Lita Scott, it's those stories that keep her going through 12-hour work days that keep her up until midnight studying for her master's degree. Ms. SCOTT: I believe in our culture. I believe that what we were taught traditionally still does apply to everyday life today. And in those teachings, there's always tomorrow. This is progress - what we're doing with the kids. It may not show today; it will show in 20 years what we have done. That's progress, and that's hope. Saving one life is hope. KRAKER: For NPR News, I'm Daniel Kraker.

KAREN GRIGSY BATES: A lot of women are frightened they might develop breast cancer, but despite that, they avoid going for screenings or exams that might help in early detection. Former CBS anchor Rene Syler is herself a breast cancer survivor. In an online interview with Black America Web, she says she understands that fear, but doesn't want it to get in the way of saving lives. (Soundbite of recorded interview in Black America Web) Ms. RENE SYLER (CBS Anchor, \"The Early Show\"): I've heard people say, I don't want to know. If I have cancer, I don't want to know. Why? Unidentified Female #1: Right. Ms. SYLER: Why would you not want to know that? Wouldn't you want to a fighting chance at success in beating the disease? BATES: Knowledge can be power, but sometimes it complicates the choices you have to make. A recent preliminary study by the University of Michigan's Comprehensive Cancer Center says black women's breast cancers often occur at a younger age and are more aggressive than they are for their white peers. Dr. CATHERINE LEE (Oncologist, University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center): We also found that African-American women were diagnosed at a higher stage. BATES: That's lead researcher for the Michigan Study oncologist Catherine Lee. Cancer stages go from one to four. A higher number indicates the disease has progressed further. Dr. Lee says annual imaging and exams are important parts of breast health. But as the Michigan Study and others have pointed out there are other pieces to this puzzle. Dr. LEE: These findings demonstrate that there is something else is going on - something biologic that is contributing to the outcomes of African-American women compared to white American women. BATES: That something else is the realization that African-American women have a greater proclivity for estrogen-receptive negative or ER-negative tumors. These tumors don't absorb the hormone-based therapies that successfully treat some tumors. Marcy Deveaux, an associate journalism professor at Cal State University-Northridge, describes herself as one of the lucky ones. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2003, but she caught it very early. Her tumor was so little, she say, it was classified T1, the smallest classification. Professor MARCY DEVEAUX (Journalism, California State University Northridge): Finding breast cancer so early now that they had to put a stage in between zero and one. BATES: That was good news for Deveaux. Discovering she was in that group of women who are ER-negative, wasn't. After frank discussions with her doctor, she knew what that meant. Prof. DEVEAUX: It means our tumors won't accept Tamoxifen. Some of those other drugs that are now sort of the wonder drugs that are being used. BATES: But if traditional therapies won't work for these kinds of breast tumors, what does? Deveaux's Beverly Hills oncologist, Dr. Philomena McAndrew, agrees options are limited. Dr. PHILOMENA McANDREW (Oncologist): Part of the reason is that we don't have specific targeted therapy that we can use in addition to the chemotherapy, the general chemotherapy that will act to further reduce the risk of spread overtime as well as reduce the risk of a new breast cancer in the other breast. BATES: Dr. McAndrew insists an ER-negative diagnosis is not a death sentence. Dr. McANDREW: Having a tumor that has aggressive features is not synonymous with the fact that their tumor is going to recur. Many - and most of those women are cured or are ultimately alive many years later without evidence of spread of the disease. BATES: Marcy Deveaux has learned through Dr. McAndrew and her own research that there are things she can control such as exercising daily, reducing her fat intake and drinking alcohol occasionally, if at all. She feels comfortable that these will lower her risk of recurrence and that time might be the biggest help of all. Dr. McANDREW: There are breakthroughs almost every month. I truly believe we will find, if not a cure, we will find a better way to manage this chronic disease hopefully in the next five years. BATES: Karen Grigsby Bates, NPR News.

Unidentified Woman #1: We can only take two dozen, if it's a (unintelligible) mostly, only six. There's actually some locations that haven't gone helium for a year now. FLATOW: That's because the lighter-then-air gas that fills the balloon is in short supply. In fact, we're in the midst of global helium shortage. And it's not just the party places that could feel the crunch; helium is used in a number of applications - from MRI machines to microchip production, from laser welding to launching spacecraft. Why the shortage? Our next guest calls it a perfect storm of events that created the shortfall. And he says it's going to be like this for a while. He joins me now to talk about why this is happening and whether party planners are the only ones who will come up short. Phil Kornbluth is executive vice president of Matheson Tri-Gas Global Helium, in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. He joins us today from his office. Welcome to the program. Mr. PHIL KORNBLUTH (Executive Vice President, Matheson Tri-Gas Global Helium): Good afternoon, Ira. Nice to talk to you. FLATOW: And if you'd like to talk with Phil and about the helium shortage, our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. Also, you can go to \"Second Life\" where Science School is, where lots of people have T-shirts on, SCIENCE FRIDAY t-shirts are discussing the issues. You know, I've been hearing about this for months, you know? Why suddenly is it making the news? Mr. KORNBLUTH: That's a good question, Ira. I mean, to be honest with you, there's been a shortage of helium since about April of 2006. And since then, there have been periods where the market was a little bit tighter, and periods where it was supplied a little bit better. But generally, we've been in short supply for about a year and a half already. FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. KORNBLUTH: So, it seems like lately, there's just been a lot of press. Party planner stores have been putting a lot of articles out and it's gotten a lot more publicity lately. FLATOW: The Macy's Thanksgiving Day people, I'm afraid people know about this. Mr. KORNBLUTH: Well, they do. And my understanding is that the Macy's people have done some advanced planning and they've reserved enough helium supply to make sure their event's going to go off without snags. FLATOW: Let's talk about the helium supply. Where does helium come from and how does it get put into the supply system? Mr. KORNBLUTH: Okay. Well, probably a surprise to most people is that helium -all the helium that's produced commercially is a by-product of natural gas processing. So, only in certain parts of the world, there's enough helium in the natural gas to enable you to recover it economically. FLATOW: So when they drill for natural gas, do they normally siphon off and store the helium or does it let - they just let it go into the atmosphere? Mr. KORNBLUTH: Most of the helium that's in natural gas is not recovered. You know, almost all natural gas has trace amounts of helium, but not enough to bother with. So, it would go through the pipeline with the natural gas and it would be a component of the gas that's burned that just doesn't burn. FLATOW: Hmm. That's interesting. So why now are - you know, is there a shortage? Mr. KORNBLUTH: Well, this shortage is pretty much supply-driven. I mean there is growth in the market, but the growth hasn't been outrageous, it's probably five percent growth. But the - what's really happened is there've been problems on the supply side. And, in particular, there's been a new plant in Algeria that came on later than expected, and with about half of the anticipated capacity. A new plant in Qatar has ramped up more slowly than expected. The world's largest source, which is an Exxon Mobil plant in Wyoming, has been running at about 80 to 85 percent of capacity since April of '07, due to an operating problem. And also, the U. S. Bureau of Land Management, which operates a pipeline that connects six of the helium refineries, has put some restrictions on those refineries in terms of how much crude helium they are able to take out of the pipeline to run through their plants. So, the world has actually lost some of its existing capacity because of those restrictions. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So, it's sort of like all the circumstances coming together -the perfect storm of helium. Mr. KORNBLUTH: Yeah, that's why I coined that term. It is just a number of things came together at the same time. And, you know, I've been in the business for a long time and this is really the most extended period of shortage. FLATOW: Let's talk about the other things besides balloons\u2026 Mr. KORNBLUTH: Mm-hmm. FLATOW: \u2026that we depend on for helium. Mr. KORNBLUTH: Well, helium has a lot of different applications and, of course, you mentioned MRI, which is the single biggest application. In that application, liquid helium, which is the coldest substance on the Earth, minus 452 degrees Fahrenheit, is used as refrigerant. And at liquid helium temperatures, the wires in the superconducting magnets lose their resistance to electricity. So, that's the largest application for helium. But it's also used as a shielding gas by welders and it's got some high-tech applications. It's used in the manufacture of semiconductors, optical fibers, and flat panel displays is a growing application. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. It's ironic since helium is one of the most abundant gases in the universe. Mr. KORNBLUTH: Yeah, it's - when you hear that it's one of those abundant gasses in the universe, you know, everybody's next question is always, okay, why is there a shortage? FLATOW: Let's go to the phones. 1-800-989-8255. Paul(ph) in San Francisco. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. PAUL (Caller): Thank you. I was curious at this shortage, particularly since it's going to go on, if it's spurned any types of new technologies or other elements that we're looking to replace helium. Mr. KORNBLUTH: Well, I think the biggest thing - you know, whenever there's a shortage of a commodity and helium is just another chemical commodity, prices go up and prices have gone up, and among other things, as a result of price increases, some of the bug users of helium are looking harder at helium recycling or helium recovery. So, you know, there are certain applications or you can recycle the helium and reduce its usage. Also, you know, the MRI manufacturers, compared to the early generation machines, the more recent generation machines are much, much more efficient in their helium usage. And there are substitutes for helium in welding. We can use different gasses than helium to do pretty much the same thing. So, you know, there definitely is a move to look for substitutes or to - in this increased interest in recycling, for sure. FLATOW: Here's a question from avatar in \"Second Life. \" Idelequest(ph) asks, helium shortage? I thought the U. S. has over 90 percent of the world helium reserve. Mr. KORNBLUTH: Well, I don't think that 90 percent figure is correct. I think, historically, the world produced most of the world's helium - U. S. , rather, produced most of the world's helium. And for many years, the only source outside of the U. S. was a plant in Poland. But what you're seeing now is, I believe, more of the new production that comes into being in the next few years will be related to LNG production. And there are very large natural gas fields in Qatar and Iran, and large gas deposits in eastern Siberia that have helium in them. And as those gas fields are brought into production, you will see more helium production outside of the U. S. But\u2026 FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. KORNBLUTH: \u2026there are large reserves in the U. S. , but there's also extremely large reserve elsewhere. FLATOW: That's a very big federal reserve, right? It's like an oil reserve but one for helium, save for, what, rainy days or - how does that work? Mr. KORNBLUTH: The government has a strategic stockpile of helium that is located near Amarillo, Texas in a depleted natural gas field called the Cliffside Field. And that strategic reserve was created by a bill that was passed in 1960. And there's still large quantity of helium stored there, over 20 bcf, and that's like three years world demand. So, there's a lot of helium in the strategic reserve. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. KORNBLUTH: The government is actually in the process of selling that reserve off and most of it will be gone sometime between - by 2015. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And if we run out of natural gas or the supply goes down, does that mean our potential for finding helium goes down with it? Mr. KORNBLUTH: Well, helium production is definitely tied to natural gas production. And at some point in the future, I think it's still quite a ways out when the world hits peak natural gas, it will probably hit peak helium. But I still think that's many years into the future. Unlike, you know, people talk about peak oil and, you know, there's actually a lot of people think we're getting close to peak oil in the world. But peak natural gas, peak helium are probably many years into the future. FLATOW: Hmm. And we're not then worried now or too many years into the future about medical facilities facing shortages for their uses. Mr. KORNBLUTH: No, I really think that's many, many years out and by that time, there may be new technology for MRI that doesn't require helium to cool magnets. FLATOW: One cynical question from Daneth(ph) \"Second Life\" who says, are we sure that market manipulation for profit is not involved here? I guess, by driving up the price of helium. Mr. KORNBLUTH: Yeah. You know, that's a good question. But I can tell you that this is a real shortage. There's - many of our customers who think that we have a secret stash of helium and that if they just offered us enough money, they can get more of it. The problem with helium - and this is kind of unique, it's a byproduct of natural gas production, and the investments required to develop the natural gas production are many, many times bigger than the investments required for the helium recovery. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. KORNBLUTH: So until energy companies make those investments in the natural gas production or LNG production, there's really nothing that a helium supplier can do to develop new helium production. FLATOW: Hmm. Mr. KORNBLUTH: So supply and demand has a little bit of a bottleneck here, and it's not as simple as just building a new helium plant because we feel like it. FLATOW: All right. Phil, thank you for taking time to talk with us today. And good luck to you. Mr. KORNBLUTH: Okay. Ira, thank you.

He may just end up giving you a vital organ which you need in order to stay alive. Paul Sucher experienced that firsthand shortly after Jamie Howard showed up at his home in Twin Falls, Idaho. Both men came by our studio today to share their remarkable story. Let's hit rewind and have a listen. Jamie, when you first rang the bell, what was your plan that day? Mr. JAMIE HOWARD (Salesman, Kirby Company): Obviously - I work for Kirby Scott Fetzer Corporation. My job is to sell vacuums - that's how I get paid. So initially, you offer to clean the carpet for free in the hopes that after seeing the product, they choose to buy one. So initially, of course, you go in. We're attempting to make money. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. HOWARD: I hadn't actually met Paul yet. Paul was not home. I met his girlfriend, Andy(ph), who actually works at CitiFinancial there in Twin Falls, Idaho. After speaking with her and finding out that they couldn't afford the Kirby because of medical reasons, I got inquisitive and just asked why. She told me that Paul had been on dialysis for almost three years. His kidneys have completely failed and he was dying. I mean, that's what happens. I got a little more, you know, in depth and asked why haven't they found him a donor. I didn't know anything about it. I didn't know how the process worked. I didn't know what - if anything - was. And she explained to me there's a list of over 500 people waiting for what's called a cadaver donor, which means, unfortunately, somebody has to die. STEWART: But they were an organ donor and then. . . Mr. HOWARD: Right. And they keep their body alive but they're brain dead. . . STEWART: Sure. Mr. HOWARD: . . . and then they harvest the organs so that other people could, you know, prolong their life. Well, he was, unfortunately, so far down the list that the reality was, after hearing the whole thing was he probably didn't have the time to be on the list long enough to get one. STEWART: Which is really interesting because you guys are both in your mid-30s, right? Mr. HOWARD: 35 apiece, yes. STEWART: So Paul, when did you first fall ill? When did you discover you had this issue with your kidneys? Mr. SUCHER: Approximately three years ago. STEWART: What happened? You were just not feeling well? Mr. SUCHER: You really don't know what's going on. You just become extremely fatigue, you get ill, you think it's going to go away like when you get anything - the common cold or the flu - and you delay going to see the doctor. And finally, when you get sick enough, you go in and they just tested my blood and said, you had full renal failure. Your kidneys aren't working and that's why you're sick. And at that point, they put you on emergency dialysis and you spend some time in intensive care and, you know, they get you going and treated again and you're able to live on dialysis. And then you try to get medically and financially qualified to get on a transplant list of some center. And we went through that for about a year. And I eventually became qualified and I sat on that list for a couple of years until Jamie came along. STEWART: So what were you thinking when your realized, gosh, time is just passing and passing and passing and I'm not getting this phone call about getting a kidney? Mr. SUCHER: You know, it's just kind of a mental thing. You just got to fight your way through it and go to work every day and try to get through life even though you're sick and hopefully some day something happens and they move you up the list. Fortunately, Jamie came along and I got a live donor, which I would encourage for anybody because that's really the way to go. It's the only way to get one quickly. STEWART: I would say, Jamie, you are a live one - definitely. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. HOWARD: Thank you. Yes. SMITH: So how did the conversation actually start when you were thinking that you might be able to give your kidney? Mr. HOWARD: Actually, after talking to Andy - like I said, when I got in a little deeper, she told me that he was O-positive. Believe it or not, O-positive is actually a very common blood type. The problem with O-positive, though, is they are universal donor, but they can only receive O-positive, which means any other blood type could get an organ from anybody else. O-positive people can only get an O-positive organ. When she told me that, I was like, okay, I'm O-positive. And, I mean, she just asked. I mean, this is her, you know, life partner. STEWART: Sure. Mr. HOWARD: This is her husband. I mean, five years, six years, kids. I mean, they shared kids together between two families or a mixed family. So - I mean, Paul has five kids - two of his own and, you know, three of hers. And so it came down to - she just asked. Would you consider being tested? And I was, like, well, you know, making small talk at this point, you know. That's something I have to think about, you know, but all right. So you're not buying the vacuum, okay, I'm going to go outside now, you know? I mean, my normal job. When I got outside, I got to thinking about it. I'm 35; Paul's 35. If I was in his position and I have three kids of my own, a wife. And I was - I didn't have future. Every day was the next day, okay, am I going to wake up tomorrow? I thought about it and I'm like, if I have the opportunity to help somebody, I have to take it. So I called my wife, first and foremost. She's the biggest part of my life other than my kids. And then I called my father, who is a doctor at Idaho Falls and has personally started four non-profit organizations over the years. So I've been around giving my whole life, asked their opinion, and then, of course, I prayed. And after praying, I - my little sister is like my guardian angel. She passed away. I had a complete calm feeling. And I just knew that that was what I supposed to do. So within 15 minutes of meeting Andy - I hadn't met Paul yet - I went in and told her if there's any way that I can help, I would be glad to. Because you have to understand even though I went through the massive amount of tests, you still may not match or could be. . . STEWART: Sure. Mr. HOWARD: . . . things wrong with you. There could be things wrong with your proteins in your kidney and it may not have worked. At that point, she called Paul and said, Paul, you might want to come home. There's a gentleman here that is willing to help if he can. So Paul came home. I met Paul. And you just met Paul. So after meeting Paul -you have to understand, Paul has a very large presence. Even though he was, you know, technically near death, most people at his stage of kidney failure are already on disability - full disability. Yet, Paul would go to dialysis three times a week at four in the morning, then go home, change, shower and go to work in order to support his family. And after, you know, meeting Paul, I was, like, there's no way that I could walk away from this and not try. So I met him on a Saturday. That Monday, I was in the hospital, started - when they had me start the test. And miraculously, 90 days later, I was almost a perfect match. And we went to Denver, Colorado - the University of Denver, Colorado - which was awesome - they were great to us - transplant center. And we both laid on the table, next to each other and the outcome is perfect because he's healthy. STEWART: When you walked in, Paul, and you told medical authorities, hey, I have a living donor here. Do they meet you with any skepticism like are you paying this guy? Mr. SUCHER: Very much so. STEWART: Do you have to buy 500 vacuums from him? Mr. SUCHER: Very much so. We actually had to fight with them over that. They were very skeptical. They're not used to goodwill donors stepping forward that are unrelated like that. Most of them are brothers or sisters or parents they proceed forward. The other problem with it is just there, you know, there's 500 people just on that list out of Denver. That's just the University of Colorado. So there are backlogs. Their workload's really heavy. So you basically just become part of the system and they kind of push you through. You've got two or three transplant coordinators handling the entire load to just at the hospital, which isn't even close to enough. And, you know, basically, you would just wait your way through the system if you didn't push. And we had to push. They attempted to schedule the surgery for 12 months down the road. And I was medically qualified, financially qualified. He was a full match. And they said, okay, we got you give you guys a year to get to know each other because you're not related, because of the skepticism involved. And that was very troubling for me. I'd been on dialysis (unintelligible) three years at that point. I was extremely ill. Inside of a year, a lot of things can happen. If anything else goes wrong with you, then you fall off - you can't even qualify for the surgery - if you get sick, if you get diabetes, if anything else, any complications arise. So we really had to get with them and push for it. And so with about a week, of a dozen phone calls, and then an extra flight to Denver that lasted just two days for Jamie and I, we went there and did some psychological evaluations and some additional blood testing. And we were able, in the very last meeting, to push it through and get it scheduled for August 8. On August 5th, we loaded up in the car and we drove 900 miles and got it done. SMITH: Paul, did you ever buy that vacuum cleaner? Mr. SUCHER: No, I did not. (Soundbite of laughter) SMITH: I think you need a new vacuum cleaner. Mr. HOWARD: Actually, they have a Kirby. It's an older model. They have a Kirby. So you know, it was an attempt to upgrade them but it's not about the vacuum anyway. And that's the ongoing joke now with all, you know, everything that we've talked about. SMITH: You're a better donor than a salesman. Mr. HOWARD: Yeah. I got sold. (Soundbite of laughter) STEWART: Jamie Howard and Paul Sucher, thanks for joining us, and good luck to both of you. Mr. HOWARD: Thank you. Mr. SUCHER: Thanks. SMITH: We'll post the video of that interview on our blog today. Look for it at npr. org/bryantpark.  ALISON STEWART, host:  And now, the best reason I've ever come across not to slam the door shut when a traveling salesman rings your bell. He may just end up giving you a vital organ which you need in order to stay alive. Paul Sucher experienced that firsthand shortly after Jamie Howard showed up at his home in Twin Falls, Idaho. Both men came by our studio today to share their remarkable story. Let's hit rewind and have a listen.  Jamie, when you first rang the bell, what was your plan that day?  Mr. JAMIE HOWARD (Salesman, Kirby Company): Obviously - I work for Kirby Scott Fetzer Corporation. My job is to sell vacuums - that's how I get paid. So initially, you offer to clean the carpet for free in the hopes that after seeing the product, they choose to buy one. So initially, of course, you go in. We're attempting to make money.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. HOWARD: I hadn't actually met Paul yet. Paul was not home. I met his girlfriend, Andy(ph), who actually works at CitiFinancial there in Twin Falls, Idaho. After speaking with her and finding out that they couldn't afford the Kirby because of medical reasons, I got inquisitive and just asked why. She told me that Paul had been on dialysis for almost three years. His kidneys have completely failed and he was dying. I mean, that's what happens. I got a little more, you know, in depth and asked why haven't they found him a donor.  I didn't know anything about it. I didn't know how the process worked. I didn't know what - if anything - was. And she explained to me there's a list of over 500 people waiting for what's called a cadaver donor, which means, unfortunately, somebody has to die.  STEWART: But they were an organ donor and then. . .  Mr. HOWARD: Right. And they keep their body alive but they're brain dead. . .  STEWART: Sure.  Mr. HOWARD: . . . and then they harvest the organs so that other people could, you know, prolong their life. Well, he was, unfortunately, so far down the list that the reality was, after hearing the whole thing was he probably didn't have the time to be on the list long enough to get one.  STEWART: Which is really interesting because you guys are both in your mid-30s, right?  Mr. HOWARD: 35 apiece, yes.  STEWART: So Paul, when did you first fall ill? When did you discover you had this issue with your kidneys?  Mr. SUCHER: Approximately three years ago.  STEWART: What happened? You were just not feeling well?  Mr. SUCHER: You really don't know what's going on. You just become extremely fatigue, you get ill, you think it's going to go away like when you get anything - the common cold or the flu - and you delay going to see the doctor. And finally, when you get sick enough, you go in and they just tested my blood and said, you had full renal failure. Your kidneys aren't working and that's why you're sick.  And at that point, they put you on emergency dialysis and you spend some time in intensive care and, you know, they get you going and treated again and you're able to live on dialysis. And then you try to get medically and financially qualified to get on a transplant list of some center. And we went through that for about a year. And I eventually became qualified and I sat on that list for a couple of years until Jamie came along.  STEWART: So what were you thinking when your realized, gosh, time is just passing and passing and passing and I'm not getting this phone call about getting a kidney?  Mr. SUCHER: You know, it's just kind of a mental thing. You just got to fight your way through it and go to work every day and try to get through life even though you're sick and hopefully some day something happens and they move you up the list. Fortunately, Jamie came along and I got a live donor, which I would encourage for anybody because that's really the way to go. It's the only way to get one quickly.  STEWART: I would say, Jamie, you are a live one - definitely.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. HOWARD: Thank you. Yes.  SMITH: So how did the conversation actually start when you were thinking that you might be able to give your kidney?  Mr. HOWARD: Actually, after talking to Andy - like I said, when I got in a little deeper, she told me that he was O-positive. Believe it or not, O-positive is actually a very common blood type. The problem with O-positive, though, is they are universal donor, but they can only receive O-positive, which means any other blood type could get an organ from anybody else. O-positive people can only get an O-positive organ.  When she told me that, I was like, okay, I'm O-positive. And, I mean, she just asked. I mean, this is her, you know, life partner.  STEWART: Sure.  Mr. HOWARD: This is her husband. I mean, five years, six years, kids. I mean, they shared kids together between two families or a mixed family. So - I mean, Paul has five kids - two of his own and, you know, three of hers. And so it came down to - she just asked. Would you consider being tested? And I was, like, well, you know, making small talk at this point, you know. That's something I have to think about, you know, but all right. So you're not buying the vacuum, okay, I'm going to go outside now, you know? I mean, my normal job.  When I got outside, I got to thinking about it. I'm 35; Paul's 35. If I was in his position and I have three kids of my own, a wife. And I was - I didn't have future. Every day was the next day, okay, am I going to wake up tomorrow? I thought about it and I'm like, if I have the opportunity to help somebody, I have to take it.  So I called my wife, first and foremost. She's the biggest part of my life other than my kids. And then I called my father, who is a doctor at Idaho Falls and has personally started four non-profit organizations over the years. So I've been around giving my whole life, asked their opinion, and then, of course, I prayed. And after praying, I - my little sister is like my guardian angel. She passed away. I had a complete calm feeling. And I just knew that that was what I supposed to do. So within 15 minutes of meeting Andy - I hadn't met Paul yet - I went in and told her if there's any way that I can help, I would be glad to. Because you have to understand even though I went through the massive amount of tests, you still may not match or could be. . .  STEWART: Sure.  Mr. HOWARD: . . . things wrong with you. There could be things wrong with your proteins in your kidney and it may not have worked. At that point, she called Paul and said, Paul, you might want to come home. There's a gentleman here that is willing to help if he can.  So Paul came home. I met Paul. And you just met Paul. So after meeting Paul -you have to understand, Paul has a very large presence. Even though he was, you know, technically near death, most people at his stage of kidney failure are already on disability - full disability. Yet, Paul would go to dialysis three times a week at four in the morning, then go home, change, shower and go to work in order to support his family. And after, you know, meeting Paul, I was, like, there's no way that I could walk away from this and not try.  So I met him on a Saturday. That Monday, I was in the hospital, started - when they had me start the test. And miraculously, 90 days later, I was almost a perfect match. And we went to Denver, Colorado - the University of Denver, Colorado - which was awesome - they were great to us - transplant center. And we both laid on the table, next to each other and the outcome is perfect because he's healthy.  STEWART: When you walked in, Paul, and you told medical authorities, hey, I have a living donor here. Do they meet you with any skepticism like are you paying this guy?  Mr. SUCHER: Very much so.  STEWART: Do you have to buy 500 vacuums from him?  Mr. SUCHER: Very much so. We actually had to fight with them over that. They were very skeptical. They're not used to goodwill donors stepping forward that are unrelated like that. Most of them are brothers or sisters or parents they proceed forward.  The other problem with it is just there, you know, there's 500 people just on that list out of Denver. That's just the University of Colorado. So there are backlogs. Their workload's really heavy. So you basically just become part of the system and they kind of push you through. You've got two or three transplant coordinators handling the entire load to just at the hospital, which isn't even close to enough. And, you know, basically, you would just wait your way through the system if you didn't push. And we had to push. They attempted to schedule the surgery for 12 months down the road. And I was medically qualified, financially qualified. He was a full match. And they said, okay, we got you give you guys a year to get to know each other because you're not related, because of the skepticism involved. And that was very troubling for me.  I'd been on dialysis (unintelligible) three years at that point. I was extremely ill. Inside of a year, a lot of things can happen.

It announced it is halting worldwide sales of its Sprint Fidelis leads because they may be prone to fracture. A lead is the tiny wire used to connect a defibrillator to heart. If the defibrillator registers a change in rhythm, it uses the lead to send a small, electronic jumpstart to the heart. Tiny tears in those wires may have contributed to the deaths of five people. Barnaby Feder is following the story for the New York Times. And Mr. Feder, this is tough news for Medtronic, but more importantly for patients with one of these leads. How many patients is that? Mr. BARNABY FEDER (Medical Devices Reporter, The New York Times): Well, Medtronic is estimating that there's 235,000 people out there who currently have these leads in them. There's, for 268,000 implanted since the device went on the market in 2004, but a number of those are no longer in patients for one reason or another. BLOCK: And what sort of failure rate are we talking about among those leads? Mr. FEDER: Very, very small. In Medtronic - in analyzing the faulty items that were returned to them, in fact found at 30 months - the period they were measuring - it had a survival rate at well over 99 percent. But when they analyzed data that was coming in through a remote monitoring system they have called CareLink, and through a trial they were running in a hospital, they found that it was slightly higher. Two point three percent of them were having failures within 30 months of implantation. And that was enough higher than its older Quattro device that they decided they needed to pull the newer Fidelis off the market. BLOCK: And what happens if one of these wires is faulty, if it fractures? What happens? Mr. FEDER: Well, there's a number of things that can happen. If it's a device that does pacing as well as has the defibrillating shocking capacity, the pacing could be thrown off, and the most uncomfortable thing is you could get unnecessary shocks. The most serious, but very, very rare would be that you didn't get a shock when you need it. Your heart started beating chaotically, irregularly. You needed that defibrillator shock to return to normalcy. And for some reason or another it didn't happened, that would be a deadly consequence. BLOCK: For people who are among this group, who have these Sprint Fidelis leads implanted, what is Medtronic - what is the FDA saying they should do? Mr. FEDER: Medtronic is saying you shouldn't do anything unless you actually have signs that your particular lead is faulty. And remember, that's a very small rate of defect here that they're finding. If there are signals that your device is not working properly - and what will happen is some of the readings will wander, they won't seem in the normal ranges that doctors are expecting, you might get a shock if it's already fairly advanced or one of these other symptoms that it's failing - then you need to have it taken out. But they're advising most people to not do anything unless you actually have some indication that you have a fracture developing in your lead. The reason for that is that taking a lead out is sometime dangerous. And, in fact, 1 to 7 percent, depending on which study you look at, of patients who have leads extracted have serious heart attacks or die in that procedure. So obviously, you don't want patients who don't need to have the lead extracted to go through that. BLOCK: For new patients, what is Medtronic saying doctors should do? Mr. FEDER: They're saying that doctors should implant them with the Medtronic defibrillator and Quattro leads. BLOCK: A different lead? Mr. FEDER: The older lead that is slightly thicker than this that has a very good safety record. And what has happened in the device industry - because the features of the main defibrillators are so similar between the three companies that dominate the business - is that they're competing on very kind of marginal improvements. And one of the things people thought is if you could design thinner leads, they might be more flexible and easier to put in. It's never really been proven that that's an advantage. And what happened now is when you started to see a disadvantage of getting them so thin that they were prone to fracture, you can go back to the older leads knowing that they have a very good safety record. And you really don't lose any functionality. BLOCK: Barnaby Feder reports on medical devices for the New York Times. Mr. Feder, thanks very much. Mr. FEDER: Thank you.

S. , there are two million tissue and organ transplants each year. And the majority of them, they're by the book. While the image of organ donation may be dramatic - the operating tables and the (unintelligible) transplant coolers, ambulances rushing organs from one hospital to another. Tissue or bone transplants are much more common and often as life-altering for the recipient. Brian Hamilton is the associate director of procurement for MTF Donor Services. He knows a thing or two about collecting transplant tissue. Good morning, Brian. Mr. BRIAN HAMILTON (Associate Director of Procurement, MTF Donor Services): Good morning. STEWART: So first question - I'm going to ask you a lot how-to questions without being too grisly, okay? (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. HAMILTON: Sure. Fine. STEWART: How long is skin tissue viable after it's removed from the donor? Mr. HAMILTON: It depends on how it's used. If it's fresh skin, it's going to be used within probably less than two to three weeks. If it's frozen, it can be kept maybe up to five years. But there is such a demand for what's called split-thickness skin grafts for burn patients that it doesn't sit around very long. STEWART: So two things there were very interesting. First of all, so people usually receiving these tissue donations, the skin, they're normally burn patients? What other patients who would need skin grafts? Mr. HAMILTON: The other type of application for skin would be wounds, patients who have sores from not being able to move that much. And then some of the newer applications are not for the surface of the skin, but for the dermis, which are under the skin. And these are for reconstruction where patients have lost a large amount of connective tissue to say, a traumatic injury, to cancer or to some other, you know, mechanism whereby they don't have any enough adequate tissue of their own to replace that. STEWART: And then the other thing you said - which was interesting - was it can be frozen. Mr. HAMILTON: Yeah. STEWART: So you can keep tissue and bone for long periods of time? You can store it? Mr. HAMILTON: Yes. In fact, the vast majority of bone and tendons that are transplanted today are freeze dried, and they have a period of approximately five years. But if you validate the process, you can keep them even longer. Again, the very high demand tissues for the procedures that are being done on a routine basis don't sit very long because they're, in essence, the waiting list. So as soon as those are cleared for release, they go out to the hospitals. They go to the clinicians, and then to the recipients. STEWART: With organ donation, I know there's a lot of issues about whether the donor and the recipient have certain criteria that match up. Is it the same with tissues? Mr. HAMILTON: No. We're very fortunate, because the vast majority of tissue transplants are acellular, they're not living when they're put in, but your own body - your cells then inhabit that tissue and make it alive again and make it yourself. So rejection is not something that we have to worry about. These patients did not receive any immunosuppression, and we don't worry about rejection like you would with a solid an organ transplant. LUKE BURBANK, host: In the story that I was reading leading up to the last interview we did, I read that something - like one body could be $100,000 worth of tissue and bone and things like that. I don't know if that's just on the black market, or if those are the kind of economics you guys deal with. But does that number sound right to you? Mr. HAMILTON: Well, no. You have to take to look downstream, so to speak. When, say, an organ procurement agency recovers a tissue donor for us, we pay what it costs them to do that. They figure out what their costs associated with the operating room, their staff and all those kind of things. Then, there's all the processing and quality assurance that goes into it, and then it's sent to the hospital. And then the hospital has a mark up in there as well. So if you go to the hospital and you have an aspirin and they charge you $5 for it, you think, well, I could buy aspirin for $. 04 at the drugstore. But there's all those costs associated - you know, the nursing services, all the non-billing services of hospitals and all along that process would have to be covered. So when someone tells me that you could generate $100,000 from a tissue donor, that may be the end result of all the tissue that's sent out with all the additional mark-ups. But, you know, tissue banks are not - at the tissue bank that I work for, you know, that's - I would say that's erroneous in the sense that, you know, people assume that it goes to one spot or one place. STEWART: Now, Brian, we heard that black-market story, which was really creepy and scary. But obviously, people who are involved in tissue banks, they have some sort of accreditation. Who usually gets involved in this kind of work? Mr. HAMILTON: Well\u2026 STEWART: Do they have to have any sort of a medical degree? Mr. HAMILTON: Yes. And there is a tremendous amount of regulation. The enforcement of the regulation by the FDA may be a little bit less than desirable, because they are, you know, challenged with all kinds of inspections of food and drugs and medical devices and things like that. But there's thousands of pages of regulation on tissue transplantation. The people who would do these recoveries, in general, are highly trained. And the FDA and the American Association of Tissue Banks - which is the industry standard - requires that these are knowledgeable and competent individuals, that you have training files on them, that they're maintained. And many of them are - may be medical residents. They may be operating room nurses, medical technologists. You know, most of these are folks who have backgrounds in medicine who are then trained in all the different aspects that are required for them to be knowledgeable and competent for the task that they're charged with. STEWART: Brian Hamilton is the associate director of procurement for MTF Donor Services. Thanks for explaining it all to us, Brian. Mr. HAMILTON: Oh, you're most welcome.

So if you go to the hospital and you have an aspirin and they charge you $5 for it, you think, well, I could buy aspirin for $. 04 at the drugstore. But there's all those costs associated - you know, the nursing services, all the non-billing services of hospitals and all along that process would have to be covered.  So when someone tells me that you could generate $100,000 from a tissue donor, that may be the end result of all the tissue that's sent out with all the additional mark-ups. But, you know, tissue banks are not - at the tissue bank that I work for, you know, that's - I would say that's erroneous in the sense that, you know, people assume that it goes to one spot or one place.  STEWART: Now, Brian, we heard that black-market story, which was really creepy and scary. But obviously, people who are involved in tissue banks, they have some sort of accreditation. Who usually gets involved in this kind of work?  Mr. HAMILTON: Well\u2026  STEWART: Do they have to have any sort of a medical degree?  Mr. HAMILTON: Yes. And there is a tremendous amount of regulation. The enforcement of the regulation by the FDA may be a little bit less than desirable, because they are, you know, challenged with all kinds of inspections of food and drugs and medical devices and things like that. But there's thousands of pages of regulation on tissue transplantation.  The people who would do these recoveries, in general, are highly trained. And the FDA and the American Association of Tissue Banks - which is the industry standard - requires that these are knowledgeable and competent individuals, that you have training files on them, that they're maintained. And many of them are - may be medical residents. They may be operating room nurses, medical technologists. You know, most of these are folks who have backgrounds in medicine who are then trained in all the different aspects that are required for them to be knowledgeable and competent for the task that they're charged with.  STEWART: Brian Hamilton is the associate director of procurement for MTF Donor Services. Thanks for explaining it all to us, Brian.  Mr. HAMILTON: Oh, you're most welcome.

If this is occurring in men who have stronger immune systems, will this cancer be as much of a problem? Is it a concern? Dr. MARTIN: Well, I think certainly the occurrence of these cases, which probably now number around 15, do represent a concern to us. We just don't know really what the future is going to hold. COHEN: Is there any treatment for K. S. ? Dr. MARTIN: Chemotherapy is available. The use of antiretroviral drugs per se that are usually used in HIV-infected individuals often results in regression of lesions, although in this case the K. S. has occurred despite effective antiretroviral therapy. So that potential line of agents has not been as successful in these individuals. COHEN: What about the men themselves who've been afflicted? I mean, these lesions had such a stigma back in the '80s. I would imagine it was very frightening for them when they all of a sudden discovered that they had these deep purple marks. Dr. MARTIN: Yeah. I think that is correct, although we do know that in these individuals their course of disease has not been very aggressive, and that is in contradistinction to what the typical course of disease was early in the epidemic. Nonetheless, you know, simply the presence of these lesions, with all the stigma that they have carried in the past, is certainly alarming for any patient who develops it. COHEN: And I understand that these men are typically younger than those who would more often be afflicted with K. S. ? Dr. MARTIN: If you're speaking of the occurrence of K. S. in the general population, I mean, for example, in Italy, there is a rather robust frequency of the virus that causes K. S. We see there, even without HIV disease, that K. S. will occur in elderly individuals, typically elderly men. The people that have been studied here in San Francisco are developing their K. S. at a younger age, which has really led to the concern, is this really causing an aging in the immune system such that perhaps they are developing diseases that would typically only be seen in older individuals? But I think it's important not to be alarmist. I think these individuals that have been studied so far represent a proof of concept that this can occur.

Next time you're sitting in a doctor's office and, you know, in that - in your socks and your, you know, paper gown, take a look around the exam room. Did you ever notice how much stuff comes from pharmaceutical companies? There's a plastic tissue box holder courtesy of one drug company. There's a pen touting the latest diabetes drug. There's a poster explaining heart disease brought to you by the maker of a blockbuster statin drug. The drug companies give a lot of gifts and you - and a lot of them are given to doctors. Your doctor may even buy lunch for his whole staff courtesy of a pharmaceutical company. He or she may speak at a local gathering of doctors with compensation by the same folks. The drug companies, the medical device makers, also pay for a lot of research and a lot of that research is done at universities and medical colleges. According to a new report out this week in JAM, or the Journal of the American Medical Association, at least 60 percent of med school department heads surveyed report receiving some money from drug companies for everything, from research to speaking fees to payment for sitting on a board. Is it possible that all that money exchanging hands might influence the research that's being done? Who's making sure that patients and science don't suffer? That's what we'll talk - we'll be talking about this hour. Our number 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. Let me introduce my guests. Daniel S. Greenberg is a science journalist who has written extensively about politics and business of science. His new book is \"Science for Sale: The Perils, Rewards, and Delusions of Campus Capitalism. \" He joins us from our NPR studios in Washington. Welcome back to Science Friday, Dan. Mr. DANIEL GREENBERG (Author, \"Science for Sale: The Perils, Rewards, and Delusions of Campus Capitalism\"): Hi, Ira. FLATOW: Hi there. Also along with us in Washington is Marjorie Powell. She's a senior assistant general counsel for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. You know them as PhRMA. Welcome to Science Friday, Ms. Powell. Ms. MARJORIE POWELL (Senior Assistant General Counsel, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America): Ira, it's nice to be here. FLATOW: Thank you. Eric Campbell is a senior scientist at the Institute for Health Policy at Mass General. He's also associate professor of health policy at Mass. General and Harvard Med School. He joins us from WBUR in Boston. Thank you for being with us today Dr. Campbell. Dr. ERIC CAMPBELL (Senior Scientist, Institute for Health Policy, Massachusetts General): Good afternoon, Ira. FLATOW: You're welcome. Dr. David Korn is a senior vice-president for Biomedical and Health Sciences Research at the Association of American Medical Colleges in Washington. He joins us from WR in Providence, Rhode Island. Thanks for talking with us today, Dr. Korn. Dr. DAVID KORN (Senior Vice-president for Biomedical and Health Sciences Research, Association of American Medical Colleges in Washington): Good afternoon. FLATOW: We're going to take a break. Stay with us. We'll get back to you all, talk about this important subject. Take your phone calls, 1-800-989-8255. Stay with us. If you got questions about doctors and funding of medical research, we'll be right back after this short break. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking about the medical research and their connection to universities and the money that flows between, and the independence of doctors, and researchers and how all that is playing out. With my guests: Daniel Greenberg, author of \"Science for Sale: The Perils, Rewards, and Delusions of Campus Capitalism;\" Marjorie Powell, who is senior assistant general counsel for PhRMA; Eric Campbell of Harvard Med School, and; David Korn of the Association of American Medical Colleges. Our number: 1-800-989-8255. Dan, can you lay out for us? Universities get money from private companies to do research - so what's the problem here? Mr. GREENBERG: Ira, there's a mix of institutions and goals that's bound to create conflict and concerns, and they certainly have. Universities are eager for industry money but they're wary about losing intellectual property. And they're also concerned about restrictions on publication, which the industry sometimes insists upon when it gives universities money for research. Industry wants academic sciences for their output and for marketing purposes. Journals seeking the hot papers that bring in the readers, that bring in the advertising, are another part of the mix here. And sometimes, they're not as careful as they should be in looking at the papers that are submitted for publication. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. CAMPBELL: And the government agencies responsible for ensuring integrity in scientific research and protection of the public are reluctant or ambivalent about cracking down and corner-cutting in the conduct of research and the protection of volunteers in medical research. Meanwhile, the public feels betrayed when scientists stray and the scientific community worries that ethical lapses will erode political support and grants. Maybe not all the ingredients necessary for the perfect storm, but certainly plenty of ingredients where a lot of trouble, and we've seen a good deal of it in recent years. FLATOW: Are you saying that the science that comes out of these relationships and interactions is not good science? Mr. GREENBERG: Oh, a lot of it is a very, very good science. But a lot of it involves some corner-cutting and, in particular, lack of proper protections for volunteers who are participating in clinical trials. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Another factor that we have is that pharmaceutical companies have been moving the clinical trials offshore where they are cheaper, and one might believe that FDA scrutiny isn't as intense as it might be in this country. So, there are concerns about the quality of the science coming out. FLATOW: You know when you talk about science - supposedly the independence of it, I - we talk sometimes to pollsters in a political season, and I say if polling is a science, how do we have a Republican pollster get one exam - one product that comes out and a different conclusion by the Democratic pollsters. And then I look at an article - I saw an article in April a year ago in the Washington Post talking about a schizophrenia drug test. And it says, comparison of schizophrenia drugs often favors the firm funding the study. They get different results from whoever does the study. It seems like the same polling question. Mr. GREENBERG: Well, Eric Campbell and his colleagues have done a quite a few good studies. They really are kind of landmarks studies about the relationship between the funding of a clinical trial and the outcome. And in general, it seems to be that the funder will get a much more favorable response in many of these trials. So, that's another ground for concern. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let me get some reaction from our other guests. Marjorie Powell, how do you react to these accusations? Ms. POWELL: Well, all of science is small steps forward, and every study has problems that could be fixed by the next study. That's one of the things we've learned through years and years of scientific development. I think it's fair to say that there are FDA regulations, there are NIH regulations that guide the development of clinical trails. And every institution that is doing clinical trials has an institutional review board that is focused solely on protection of the human subjects in that trial. Those review boards have an independent role that - so, I think, patients should not worry about the issue of participating in a trial. It's also true that the FDA requires multiple clinical trial sites so that they can look at information across different either academic or physician-in-practice clinical investigators. And the - they also require multiple trials for many, many drugs. So I don't think patients should be worried about the quality of the research going into those studies. Now, it is true that there is always a small number of investigators who may have difficulties complying with the requirements or following standard scientific procedures, but there are systems in place within the academic medical centers, the universities to pay attention to those kinds of concerns. FLATOW: Eric Campbell, are you satisfied that there's enough of a hands-off policy between drug companies who fund the research that the universities do to keep them independent and not askew the results? Dr. CAMPBELL: Well, at first, I agree with Dan. I think that there have been a lot of studies done that have looked at the nature of the relationship between the outcome of a study and the funder. And the research overwhelmingly shows that trust studies that are funded by companies are significantly more likely to yield pro-industry results than studies that are not funded by companies. There are some reasons for that. Those studies may be designed differently. They may be conducted in different ways. So we really don't know about the overall safety and efficacy of those trials. But I will say, you know, the IRBs are not necessarily independent. FLATOW: IRB? Dr. CAMPBELL: The Institutional Review Boards. They're the boards that oversee clinical research. We published a study in the New England Journal earlier this year where we showed that the majority of IRB members actually have some form of relationship with companies as well. So, the people that are sitting on the boards who are supposed to be overseeing actually have relationships themselves. And then just to put this in perspective, you know, it's medical schools - medical students have relationships, faculty members who do the research have relationships, department chairs who oversee the departments in which they work have relationships, the people who serve on the IRB boards have relationships, and they're frequent. So, the level of independence one could really question. FLATOW: What about Marjorie Powell saying that, you know, the FDA says it's okay. Dr. CAMPBELL: Well, I'm not going to comment on the overall ability of the FDA to manage this. I will note that the FDA has recently tightened up the nature of the relationships that people who serve on their committees to approve drugs can have. And, in fact, they still can be people who serve on committees who have relationships with drug companies. And these are the people that are making the decisions about the overall issue of efficacy and safety of drugs entering the market. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Ms. POWELL: Ira, this is Marjorie. Can I jump in on that? Because, in fact, the advisory boards provide advice to FDA, but the decision about whether a product can be approved and what uses it can be approved for for what patient population remains with the scientists and medical officers at the FDA. FLATOW: So, why have the advisory boards if the FDA scientists can just override them? Ms. POWELL: Well, in many instances, the FDA establishes an advisory board or submits information\u2026 FLATOW: Is this just - yeah. Ms. POWELL: \u2026to an advisory board because they have a particular scientific question that they would like to get some broader advice about. Sometimes that's for a specific drug, sometimes it's for a classive drugs, sometimes it's\u2026 FLATOW: But my question was why have the advisory board at all, if the FDA, as you say, doesn't have to listen to them? Ms. POWELL: Well, that advisory board is providing them with scientific advice that the FDA's decision makers are going to be listening to, but the authority isn't transferred from the FDA to the advisory board to make the approval decision. FLATOW: David Korn, you want a ring in on this? I mean, you - from what I understand, you would like the government to keep hands-off of any kind of regulation of this process, is that right? Dr. KORN: No. I think there is an established set of regulations that come from the Public Health Service through an agency that is specifically charged, for example, with the protection of human beings who participate in medical research. You know, we've covered a lot of ground here in the last 10 minutes. And I think - I'd like to just make a couple of suggestions. One of them is that guilt by association is easy to infer at least, and I think we have to be careful that we don't tar people because they have financial relationships with industry as something that's necessarily wrong. For example, let me explain what I mean. This country supports biomedical research more generously than any other country in the world. The budget of the National Institutes of Health is somewhere between $28 and $29 billion dollars. The public support for biomedical research is not because the average citizen is interested in furthering biomedical knowledge, it's because they all have experience with disease and they are very much interested in finding ways of preventing, treating and curing disease. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. KORN: The only way in our society that that can happen is for relationships between those who discover new knowledge - in this case, let's say, academic medical scientists - and the organizations that our society has created to translate that knowledge into human benefit. To determine how a discovery, like the one you just talked to with the gentleman from Stanford, whether than can or cannot be developed into something that will be of human benefit. So the existence of relationships is not surprising. I think it would be astonishing where there are not these relationships. FLATOW: I understand. You know, one question - a peripheral question that you raised is - you said that the NIH gets funds about $30 billion worth of research. Did I hear that correctly? Dr. KORN: It's somewhere between 28 and 29 billion. FLATOW: And people wonder, if they're funding so much of this medical research why the public is still paying five to 10 dollars a pill for something that comes out of the money that they spent on this publicly funded research. Ms. POWELL: Actually\u2026 FLATOW: Or why they may be tests that cost 2 or $300 that they or more, that they're being charged from money that comes out of this publicly funded research. Ms. POWELL: Ira, this is Marjorie. Let me jump in on that issue because I think it's important to remember that the NIH funding is spread across a lot of basic medical research. For example, your - when Doctor Wyss-Coray was talking about his Alzheimer's research, that's the kind of research that NIH would fund or perhaps even more basic medical studies. And then at some point, the pharmaceutical industry builds upon that research to both research and then develop a medicine. NIH typically doesn't get\u2026 FLATOW: And how does - do they pay NIH back for the money that NIH spent on it? Ms. POWELL: In most instances, NIH research doesn't actually get to the point of finding a compound that would be studied and potentially developed to become a new medicine. FLATOW: But if NIH sunk five or $10 million into their basic research, does PhRMA pay back NIH for that kind of money even though they've used the common knowledge that's generated from it? Ms. POWELL: The federal requirement is that institutions that receive NIH funding are supposed try and find ways to turn that into commercial development so they have an obligation to find companies - be they drug or device companies or other high-tech companies - to take their knowledge and turn it into productive uses for the public. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let me - I have to give an idea, we're talking about government funding, medicines - a whole gamut - this hour in TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Let me go back to Dan. You've been sitting and listening. Is there a way - we've heard David Korn say that this is probably the best way to do this. There's probably no other way of having a government and industry cooperation, university and corporate cooperation. Is there any other possible way? Mr. GREENBERG: Well, I think first of all, Ira, we should not take it face value. Many of these federal and institutional structures have been put in place to ensure the integrity of science in relation to helping the public. Institutional review boards which are responsible for assuring the safety of volunteers in medical experiments have repeatedly been found to be kind of rubberstamp operations at universities. There are serious efforts underway to improve their performance, but nobody thinks the performance is really very strong. And furthermore, you know, the pharmaceutical industry has been involved in many episodes that have led many, many people to be very wary of its assertions about commitment to the public interest. Consider the Vioxx trials. The lead author of one of the basic papers told the New York Times that Merck wrote the paper and then asked him to edit it. He never heard about a woman dying in the trial until later on. And Merck has lawsuits all over the country from families of Vioxx patients. Some say thousands died from using the drug. The structures were in place to assure that this didn't happen, nonetheless, it did. So I think we should be a little bit wary about saying everything is okay and the relationships are fine and they're properly regulated because, in fact, they're not. FLATOW: When did all of these change? You give a quote in your book, you know, about when industry and academia became so entwined. You quote Jonas Salk about the polio vaccine saying, quote, \"there is no patent, could you patent the sun\"? I mean\u2026 Mr. GREENBERG: Well, I don't know whether you can patent the sun, but I'm pretty sure if somebody could make money from it they would try very hard. It really all began with the biotechnology revolution around 1980 or in the late '70s, and then the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act, which is a little-known but very, very important law that governs economic activities and universities that receive federal research money. The law says that any university that receives federal research money must disclose any research findings that may have commercial value and then must pursue patents and try to find some commercial operation that will produce the goods. Universities don't make pills. They produce knowledge. So they have to go outside to existing companies, or in many instances, they will start spinoffs, that is companies usually headed by a professor and their faculty, often, the scientists who are involved in the discovery. And that's where it took off from. The odd fact is that the biotechnology industry, of which we hear so much, has been described by one of its leaders as the greatest money-losing industry in the history of the world. It has been living on equity. And if the sales don't come anywhere near the amount of money that's been invested, that's just a sidelight about the biotechnology industry. And as far as the number of drugs reaching the public, well, perhaps, it's very early in the development of these drugs. But so far, they are relatively few. FLATOW: All right. We're going to have to take a short break. We'll come back and talk lots more about the relationship between pharmaceutical industry and academic research and doctors. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Perhaps, you're in the medical field. You may be a doctor or a drug representative or you want to chime in on the discussion going on today. We invite you. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Also, you can go to \"Second Life,\" we have Science School going there. We're -look for the folks wearing the SCIENCE FRIDAY T-shirts over there and pick up a T-shirt and get to ask a question. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about medical research and the interaction between the pharmaceutical companies and academics and doctors. With my guests: David Korn, senior vice president at the Association of American Medical Colleges; Eric Campbell, who is senior scientist at the Institute for Health Policy at Mass General. Also with us is Marjorie Powell, senior assistant general counsel for PhRMA, Daniel Greenberg, author of \"Science for Sale: The Perils, Rewards and Delusions of Campus Capitalism. \" Our number, 1-800-989-8255. David Korn, if the drug companies pay a university to do a research, should it be a requirement that the university, own the intellectual property, own the data that comes out? Wouldn't that eliminate some of the squabbling over, you know, where the money goes? Dr. KORN: I would like to answer that, Ira, by saying that I think less than the issue of owning the data is the issue of accountability of those university faculty who are playing any sort of significant role in a particular study whether it's funded by the NIH or by a foundation or the industry or anyone else. And I agree that there have been instances of ghost authorship that is putting people's names on papers when those people have not, in fact, had full responsibility nor full accountability for the research. The association, which I'm now working, strongly condemns ghost authorship of any kind. FLATOW: When you say ghost authorship, are you saying that it has the name of one person on it but it was written by someone else? Mr. KORN: I'm saying that people\u2026 FLATOW: Give me a for example. Give me for example. Give me a fact. Mr. KORN: Well, Dan Greenberg gave you one example a moment ago about a particular paper relating to Vioxx where the first named author, apparently, from what we know, did not have much of a role in the actual design or conduct or interpretation of experimental data, but did, perhaps, help write the paper and certainly helped get the paper into a front-rank medical journal. That kind of practice, we believe at the association, is deplorable. It's an affront to academic ethics and it should cease. Ms. POWELL: And, Ira, Marjorie. We at PhRMA also believe that that's inappropriate. And we have established a set of principles that our companies adhere to that say that - that govern all of the relationships between researchers and the final authors of papers. And we feel very strongly that the authors of papers should be part of the research. They should have access to all of the research information. And, in fact, in most institutions, that's a requirement of the contracts between the funder of a clinical study and the institution. It's one of the things that the medical schools and the universities have required. But I think it's important to remember that the reason that we have as vibrant of research industry and as much improvement in longevity as we do in this country is the relationship between our academic institutions and the companies that are actually commercializing the knowledge that the academic institutions are generating. FLATOW: Dan, do you want to comment? Mr. GREENBERG: Well, I would point out that Billy Tauzin, the former congressman, who's head of a big PhRMA last year or the year before said, how can we stop getting bad publicity for the pharmaceutical industry, and he answered his own question saying, let's stop doing bad things. Many of the activities in the pharmaceutical industry, I think, really go against the grain of scientific integrity. Let's recall that two years ago, the director of NIH , after some consultancies were found there by members of the staff that hadn't been revealed to the administration there, prohibited any dealings by NIH staff with pharmaceutical companies. He even went down to the level of saying they can't even have any stock holdings, his suspicions were so great. So\u2026 Ms. POWELL: And what that does is it says that NIH can't draw upon the skills of people in academia who are doing a variety of research, some of it funded by NIH, some of it funded by commercial interest. If I were trying to design a study or making a medical or a product approval decision, I would want to know that the people designing the study, the people advising me, were current on all of the research and involved in and knowledgeable about that research. I think it makes sense to be looking for people with the best skills and then to try and build some structures to make sure that there is disclosure of relationships, so that people evaluating those recommendations can balance the recommendations from one person and another person. That's, in fact, why when I go to the doctor and get - told that I need an operation, I often say, I'd like to get a second opinion. Mr. GREENBERG: Well, I think Marjorie stated\u2026 Dr. CAMPBELL: Ira\u2026 Mr. GREENBERG: Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Dr. CAMPBELL: Yeah. Ira, this is Eric. I would like to comment. You know, it seems that the real impact here is - I think everybody recognizes that these relationships run a gamut of things from being related to research, and they're kind of different than relationships that are related to education, and they're kind of different than the relationships that are kind of related to just marketing university products. And I think everybody recognizes and knows. We know from studies that these relationships have benefits and they have risks. And I think the key is to establish policies which get the benefits and protect against the risks. And they're not a single class of environment for - of relationships and doing, you know, an all out ban, in my opinion, at universities, wouldn't be a way to go. We don't know. We haven't evaluated the impact of the NIH ban on relationships. We don't know impact it's had. Certainly, PhRMA doesn't know and I'm quite certain the NIH doesn't know. So I think we really need to think about these things in terms of what they're intended to do. And just a case in point, you know, in my mind, there's absolutely no rationale for why, you know, over 80 percent of clinical departments in medical schools receive money for - and food and beverages from drug companies for their faculty and their stuff. I mean, food and beverages? That's not research, and\u2026 I mean, I do a little bit of research and I don't ever recall requiring a Coke and bagel to do some research. In education, I have a Master's degree in education, and I don't ever recall my professor saying to me, now, the first thing you do is hand out sodas and bagels from the companies whose products you're about to teach your students about. So if we think about these things in terms of what they're intended to do, you know, it becomes clear about what should and shouldn't be done with relationship to each of the individual type off relationships\u2026 FLATOW: So you're just reflecting what goes on in typical doctors' offices where they - staff gets, you know, gets lunches, doctors get dinners, they get speaking fees, they get money for clinical - putting patients in clinical studies, things like that. There's - I guess, they're just starting of an earlier age for your students on. Dr. CAMPBELL: Right. Right. FLATOW: Welcome to the real world, you know? Dr. CAMPBELL: Right. They're clearly demonstrating it. You know, we know a recent study found that approximately a third of medical students get one gift or attend one industry-sponsored lunch every week. Now, we don't know if that's good or bad. But we certainly know it's occurring, and it's very frequent. FLATOW: Marcia Angell suggests - and she's written a lot about this relationship - she suggests a couple of steps, different things that could be done. And one of them is that institutions, she says, should not accept grants with strings attached, investigators should design and analyze their own studies, write their own papers and decide about publication. What's wrong with that? What's wrong - David Korn? Dr. KORN: I don't think there's anything wrong. And I think it's exactly what I said a few minutes ago that faculty who put your names on publications, regardless of who funds the study that they're reporting, have to have had full responsibility and accountability for the study from the inception to the writing of the paper to the publication. That's a very strong value that my colleagues and I believe should be the standard. And I believe that if - we believe that if every academic medical institution would enforce its own university policies on academic and research integrity, one could make a major step forward in getting rid of ghost authors and ghost research managers. Mr. GREENBERG: Mm-hmm. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Let me go to - get a caller or two. We're running out of time. Steven(ph) in Lyndon, New Jersey. Hi, Steven. STEVEN (Caller): Yes. Hi, how are you? FLATOW: Hi. STEVEN: hanks for taking my call. FLATOW: Go ahead. STEVEN: You know, there's a very simple solution to this problem that I think Americans don't want to face. And that is, do Americans want to pay for this, and then we can exclude the drug companies altogether in terms of the research and responsibilities associated with it. But I think not. I think they don't want to do that. And I think that Americans want Rolls-Royce medicine for Volkswagen prices. And that's what we've been moving to for the last 20 years. Now, one of your guests mentioned something about trials being done in Third World countries, and that is true. And I think everyone wants accountability. But I think what he failed to mention is the flipside of that. Trials are often done in First World countries. A lot of these trials are corroborated in Europe, in Japan, in Australia, and other countries that have great faculty and great facilities for doing these kinds of tests. I think what should do is we should look at this in a broad spectrum of things. I think that we don't even look at our government with this kind of a microscope. Lobbyists, in general, are paid - are basically paid lobbyists. So my thing is, if you can stop at it a governmental level, then you'd probably be able to stop at this particular level. But I do think - I do think that we are missing a big picture here, and I that this is part of a broader spectrum of American life. And I do think that we should look at it more so - we should scrutinize our government, the same way we scrutinizing the pharmaceutical companies and the things that are going on. Because there are a lot of things going on in our government that are associated with the lobbyists and what they're giving to our government officials. FLATOW: All right. STEVEN: Thank you. FLATOW: Steven, thanks for calling. Dr. CAMPBELL: Ira, this is Eric. I think my comment would be very simply that the American people - you're already paying for it. You're paying for all of this in the form of increased drug prices that you pay every time you go and fill a prescription. Ms. POWELL: Actually, Ira, it's important to remember that the drugs that we take, those pills that are saving so many lives or improving lives, are 10 cents out of every health care dollar. The largest portion of the health care dollar goes to a variety of other services - physicians, hospitals, laboratory tests - and it's the medicines that are in fact keeping us out of the hospital and saving some of those extra health care dollars and allowing us to live better. And I think it's also important to remember that the clinical trials need to be designed according to FDA requirements and that imposes a requirement on manufacturers as they're trying to develop new medicines to be actively involved in designing the trials. If all of the academic medical center researchers did only their own design trials, there wouldn't be people to help with the manufacturer-sponsored trials that are necessary to get new drugs approved. FLATOW: And I need to remind everybody, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. Any reaction? Dr. KORN: Ira, Ira. Dr. CAMPBELL: Yeah. I\u2026 FLATOW: One at a time. We'll you get in there. Dr. KORN: Ira, this is David Korn. Let me make a comment in response to that. The system we have in this country whether it's the best or not the best is one in which the federal government supports primarily fundamental research that no private entity is going to support because the knowledge that's created is not owned - cannot be owned by one or a few people; it's general knowledge that all can share. There's no one else in our society whose function is to produce generalizable knowledge. But this flipside of that is that the government is not funding industries, it is not making products probably with the one exception of the Defense Department which does fund products. When knowledge is generated, we have a system in which the private sector industry has to step forward and take those discoveries into products, tests, tools that benefit society. That's the system we have. The relationships are vital. They have to be principled. And\u2026 FLATOW: All right. Let me get some other comments because we're running out of time. Who else want to jump in? Dan\u2026 Mr. GREENBERG: Ira, I think one of the problems is that none of the sectors -that is the government, the university, the journals, the industry - have really lived up to their responsibilities. Dave raised an issue before of honorary ghost authorship as it's some - as it's referred to. There were hearings in Congress 25 years ago in which ghost authorship was described and deplored and the universities and their associations and probably his own association, too, said, well, the university should not engage in that. And here we are today talking about the problems of ghost authorship. I mean, why don't universities crack down on this? They had it within their capability. But many of them are quite lax and limp when it comes to looking after scientific integrity, though they are very, very vigorous and effective in chasing money. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. What - how would - Dan, how would you fix the system then? In a minute or two that we have left. Mr. GREENBERG: Well, I think you could say to the faculty that you will not participate in ghost authorship. And if ghost authorship comes to light as it did with the Vioxx paper, there will be sanctions and there will be consequences. At present, there aren't. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. KORN: I would agree. By the way, this is David Korn. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. KORN: I would strongly agree with Dan on that point. I think the universities have it within their power to change some of the practices that we've been talking about that are really deplorable. FLATOW: Do we need standards for all of them to follow, so that someone doesn't say, well, if I don't like the standards of this university, I'd go to the next one? Dr. KORN: I think that's\u2026 Dr. CAMPBELL: Well, it would be beneficial to have universities in harmony of this. But\u2026 FLATOW: Yes. Dr. CAMPBELL: \u2026these are not very, very complicated standards or prohibitions that have to be put in place. They're really quite simple. If you have a financial relationship with a commercial organization, this can be put into a database on the campus that's accessible by everybody so that if some hanky-panky is going on at least there will be a possibility of it being disclosed. FLATOW: All right. We're going to have to stop there. I want to thank all of you for taking time to talk with us today. Dan Greenberg, a science journalist and author of \"Science for Sale: The Perils, Rewards and Delusions of Campus Capitalism. \" Marjorie Powell, senior assistant general counsel for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. Eric Campbell, senior scientist at the Institute for health policy at Mass General Hospital, he's also associate professor at Mass General and at Harvard Med School. David Korn, senior vice president for Biomedical and Health Scientist Research at the Association of American Medical Colleges, thank you all for talking about this very important issue with us today. I'm Ira Flatow in New York.  IRA FLATOW, host:  For the rest of the hour, a look at these financial relationships between universities and private companies.  Next time you're sitting in a doctor's office and, you know, in that - in your socks and your, you know, paper gown, take a look around the exam room. Did you ever notice how much stuff comes from pharmaceutical companies? There's a plastic tissue box holder courtesy of one drug company. There's a pen touting the latest diabetes drug. There's a poster explaining heart disease brought to you by the maker of a blockbuster statin drug.  The drug companies give a lot of gifts and you - and a lot of them are given to doctors. Your doctor may even buy lunch for his whole staff courtesy of a pharmaceutical company. He or she may speak at a local gathering of doctors with compensation by the same folks. The drug companies, the medical device makers, also pay for a lot of research and a lot of that research is done at universities and medical colleges.  According to a new report out this week in JAM, or the Journal of the American Medical Association, at least 60 percent of med school department heads surveyed report receiving some money from drug companies for everything, from research to speaking fees to payment for sitting on a board.  Is it possible that all that money exchanging hands might influence the research that's being done? Who's making sure that patients and science don't suffer?  That's what we'll talk - we'll be talking about this hour. Our number 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK.  Let me introduce my guests.  Daniel S. Greenberg is a science journalist who has written extensively about politics and business of science. His new book is \"Science for Sale: The Perils, Rewards, and Delusions of Campus Capitalism. \" He joins us from our NPR studios in Washington.  Welcome back to Science Friday, Dan.  Mr. DANIEL GREENBERG (Author, \"Science for Sale: The Perils, Rewards, and Delusions of Campus Capitalism\"): Hi, Ira.  FLATOW: Hi there.  Also along with us in Washington is Marjorie Powell. She's a senior assistant general counsel for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. You know them as PhRMA.  Welcome to Science Friday, Ms. Powell.  Ms. MARJORIE POWELL (Senior Assistant General Counsel, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America): Ira, it's nice to be here.  FLATOW: Thank you.  Eric Campbell is a senior scientist at the Institute for Health Policy at Mass General. He's also associate professor of health policy at Mass. General and Harvard Med School. He joins us from WBUR in Boston. Thank you for being with us today Dr. Campbell.  Dr. ERIC CAMPBELL (Senior Scientist, Institute for Health Policy, Massachusetts General): Good afternoon, Ira.  FLATOW: You're welcome.  Dr. David Korn is a senior vice-president for Biomedical and Health Sciences Research at the Association of American Medical Colleges in Washington. He joins us from WR in Providence, Rhode Island. Thanks for talking with us today, Dr. Korn.  Dr. DAVID KORN (Senior Vice-president for Biomedical and Health Sciences Research, Association of American Medical Colleges in Washington): Good afternoon.  FLATOW: We're going to take a break. Stay with us. We'll get back to you all, talk about this important subject. Take your phone calls, 1-800-989-8255. Stay with us. If you got questions about doctors and funding of medical research, we'll be right back after this short break.  I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking about the medical research and their connection to universities and the money that flows between, and the independence of doctors, and researchers and how all that is playing out. With my guests: Daniel Greenberg, author of \"Science for Sale: The Perils, Rewards, and Delusions of Campus Capitalism;\" Marjorie Powell, who is senior assistant general counsel for PhRMA; Eric Campbell of Harvard Med School, and; David Korn of the Association of American Medical Colleges. Our number: 1-800-989-8255.  Dan, can you lay out for us? Universities get money from private companies to do research - so what's the problem here?  Mr. GREENBERG: Ira, there's a mix of institutions and goals that's bound to create conflict and concerns, and they certainly have. Universities are eager for industry money but they're wary about losing intellectual property. And they're also concerned about restrictions on publication, which the industry sometimes insists upon when it gives universities money for research.  Industry wants academic sciences for their output and for marketing purposes. Journals seeking the hot papers that bring in the readers, that bring in the advertising, are another part of the mix here. And sometimes, they're not as careful as they should be in looking at the papers that are submitted for publication.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. CAMPBELL: And the government agencies responsible for ensuring integrity in scientific research and protection of the public are reluctant or ambivalent about cracking down and corner-cutting in the conduct of research and the protection of volunteers in medical research.  Meanwhile, the public feels betrayed when scientists stray and the scientific community worries that ethical lapses will erode political support and grants. Maybe not all the ingredients necessary for the perfect storm, but certainly plenty of ingredients where a lot of trouble, and we've seen a good deal of it in recent years.  FLATOW: Are you saying that the science that comes out of these relationships and interactions is not good science?  Mr. GREENBERG: Oh, a lot of it is a very, very good science. But a lot of it involves some corner-cutting and, in particular, lack of proper protections for volunteers who are participating in clinical trials.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Another factor that we have is that pharmaceutical companies have been moving the clinical trials offshore where they are cheaper, and one might believe that FDA scrutiny isn't as intense as it might be in this country. So, there are concerns about the quality of the science coming out.  FLATOW: You know when you talk about science - supposedly the independence of it, I - we talk sometimes to pollsters in a political season, and I say if polling is a science, how do we have a Republican pollster get one exam - one product that comes out and a different conclusion by the Democratic pollsters. And then I look at an article - I saw an article in April a year ago in the Washington Post talking about a schizophrenia drug test. And it says, comparison of schizophrenia drugs often favors the firm funding the study. They get different results from whoever does the study. It seems like the same polling question.  Mr. GREENBERG: Well, Eric Campbell and his colleagues have done a quite a few good studies. They really are kind of landmarks studies about the relationship between the funding of a clinical trial and the outcome. And in general, it seems to be that the funder will get a much more favorable response in many of these trials. So, that's another ground for concern.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let me get some reaction from our other guests. Marjorie Powell, how do you react to these accusations?  Ms. POWELL: Well, all of science is small steps forward, and every study has problems that could be fixed by the next study. That's one of the things we've learned through years and years of scientific development. I think it's fair to say that there are FDA regulations, there are NIH regulations that guide the development of clinical trails. And every institution that is doing clinical trials has an institutional review board that is focused solely on protection of the human subjects in that trial. Those review boards have an independent role that - so, I think, patients should not worry about the issue of participating in a trial.  It's also true that the FDA requires multiple clinical trial sites so that they can look at information across different either academic or physician-in-practice clinical investigators. And the - they also require multiple trials for many, many drugs. So I don't think patients should be worried about the quality of the research going into those studies.  Now, it is true that there is always a small number of investigators who may have difficulties complying with the requirements or following standard scientific procedures, but there are systems in place within the academic medical centers, the universities to pay attention to those kinds of concerns.  FLATOW: Eric Campbell, are you satisfied that there's enough of a hands-off policy between drug companies who fund the research that the universities do to keep them independent and not askew the results?  Dr. CAMPBELL: Well, at first, I agree with Dan. I think that there have been a lot of studies done that have looked at the nature of the relationship between the outcome of a study and the funder. And the research overwhelmingly shows that trust studies that are funded by companies are significantly more likely to yield pro-industry results than studies that are not funded by companies.  There are some reasons for that. Those studies may be designed differently. They may be conducted in different ways. So we really don't know about the overall safety and efficacy of those trials. But I will say, you know, the IRBs are not necessarily independent.  FLATOW: IRB?  Dr. CAMPBELL: The Institutional Review Boards. They're the boards that oversee clinical research. We published a study in the New England Journal earlier this year where we showed that the majority of IRB members actually have some form of relationship with companies as well. So, the people that are sitting on the boards who are supposed to be overseeing actually have relationships themselves. And then just to put this in perspective, you know, it's medical schools - medical students have relationships, faculty members who do the research have relationships, department chairs who oversee the departments in which they work have relationships, the people who serve on the IRB boards have relationships, and they're frequent. So, the level of independence one could really question.  FLATOW: What about Marjorie Powell saying that, you know, the FDA says it's okay.  Dr. CAMPBELL: Well, I'm not going to comment on the overall ability of the FDA to manage this. I will note that the FDA has recently tightened up the nature of the relationships that people who serve on their committees to approve drugs can have. And, in fact, they still can be people who serve on committees who have relationships with drug companies. And these are the people that are making the decisions about the overall issue of efficacy and safety of drugs entering the market.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Ms. POWELL: Ira, this is Marjorie. Can I jump in on that? Because, in fact, the advisory boards provide advice to FDA, but the decision about whether a product can be approved and what uses it can be approved for for what patient population remains with the scientists and medical officers at the FDA.  FLATOW: So, why have the advisory boards if the FDA scientists can just override them?  Ms. POWELL: Well, in many instances, the FDA establishes an advisory board or submits information\u2026  FLATOW: Is this just - yeah.  Ms. POWELL: \u2026to an advisory board because they have a particular scientific question that they would like to get some broader advice about. Sometimes that's for a specific drug, sometimes it's for a classive drugs, sometimes it's\u2026  FLATOW: But my question was why have the advisory board at all, if the FDA, as you say, doesn't have to listen to them?  Ms. POWELL: Well, that advisory board is providing them with scientific advice that the FDA's decision makers are going to be listening to, but the authority isn't transferred from the FDA to the advisory board to make the approval decision.  FLATOW: David Korn, you want a ring in on this? I mean, you - from what I understand, you would like the government to keep hands-off of any kind of regulation of this process, is that right?  Dr. KORN: No. I think there is an established set of regulations that come from the Public Health Service through an agency that is specifically charged, for example, with the protection of human beings who participate in medical research. You know, we've covered a lot of ground here in the last 10 minutes. And I think - I'd like to just make a couple of suggestions. One of them is that guilt by association is easy to infer at least, and I think we have to be careful that we don't tar people because they have financial relationships with industry as something that's necessarily wrong.  For example, let me explain what I mean. This country supports biomedical research more generously than any other country in the world. The budget of the National Institutes of Health is somewhere between $28 and $29 billion dollars. The public support for biomedical research is not because the average citizen is interested in furthering biomedical knowledge, it's because they all have experience with disease and they are very much interested in finding ways of preventing, treating and curing disease.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. KORN: The only way in our society that that can happen is for relationships between those who discover new knowledge - in this case, let's say, academic medical scientists - and the organizations that our society has created to translate that knowledge into human benefit. To determine how a discovery, like the one you just talked to with the gentleman from Stanford, whether than can or cannot be developed into something that will be of human benefit. So the existence of relationships is not surprising. I think it would be astonishing where there are not these relationships.  FLATOW: I understand. You know, one question - a peripheral question that you raised is - you said that the NIH gets funds about $30 billion worth of research. Did I hear that correctly?  Dr. KORN: It's somewhere between 28 and 29 billion.  FLATOW: And people wonder, if they're funding so much of this medical research why the public is still paying five to 10 dollars a pill for something that comes out of the money that they spent on this publicly funded research.  Ms. POWELL: Actually\u2026  FLATOW: Or why they may be tests that cost 2 or $300 that they or more, that they're being charged from money that comes out of this publicly funded research.  Ms. POWELL: Ira, this is Marjorie. Let me jump in on that issue because I think it's important to remember that the NIH funding is spread across a lot of basic medical research. For example, your - when Doctor Wyss-Coray was talking about his Alzheimer's research, that's the kind of research that NIH would fund or perhaps even more basic medical studies. And then at some point, the pharmaceutical industry builds upon that research to both research and then develop a medicine. NIH typically doesn't get\u2026  FLATOW: And how does - do they pay NIH back for the money that NIH spent on it?  Ms. POWELL: In most instances, NIH research doesn't actually get to the point of finding a compound that would be studied and potentially developed to become a new medicine.  FLATOW: But if NIH sunk five or $10 million into their basic research, does PhRMA pay back NIH for that kind of money even though they've used the common knowledge that's generated from it?  Ms. POWELL: The federal requirement is that institutions that receive NIH funding are supposed try and find ways to turn that into commercial development so they have an obligation to find companies - be they drug or device companies or other high-tech companies - to take their knowledge and turn it into productive uses for the public.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let me - I have to give an idea, we're talking about government funding, medicines - a whole gamut - this hour in TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  Let me go back to Dan. You've been sitting and listening. Is there a way - we've heard David Korn say that this is probably the best way to do this. There's probably no other way of having a government and industry cooperation, university and corporate cooperation. Is there any other possible way?  Mr. GREENBERG: Well, I think first of all, Ira, we should not take it face value. Many of these federal and institutional structures have been put in place to ensure the integrity of science in relation to helping the public. Institutional review boards which are responsible for assuring the safety of volunteers in medical experiments have repeatedly been found to be kind of rubberstamp operations at universities. There are serious efforts underway to improve their performance, but nobody thinks the performance is really very strong.  And furthermore, you know, the pharmaceutical industry has been involved in many episodes that have led many, many people to be very wary of its assertions about commitment to the public interest. Consider the Vioxx trials. The lead author of one of the basic papers told the New York Times that Merck wrote the paper and then asked him to edit it. He never heard about a woman dying in the trial until later on.  And Merck has lawsuits all over the country from families of Vioxx patients. Some say thousands died from using the drug. The structures were in place to assure that this didn't happen, nonetheless, it did. So I think we should be a little bit wary about saying everything is okay and the relationships are fine and they're properly regulated because, in fact, they're not.  FLATOW: When did all of these change? You give a quote in your book, you know, about when industry and academia became so entwined. You quote Jonas Salk about the polio vaccine saying, quote, \"there is no patent, could you patent the sun\"? I mean\u2026  Mr. GREENBERG: Well, I don't know whether you can patent the sun, but I'm pretty sure if somebody could make money from it they would try very hard. It really all began with the biotechnology revolution around 1980 or in the late '70s, and then the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act, which is a little-known but very, very important law that governs economic activities and universities that receive federal research money.  The law says that any university that receives federal research money must disclose any research findings that may have commercial value and then must pursue patents and try to find some commercial operation that will produce the goods. Universities don't make pills. They produce knowledge. So they have to go outside to existing companies, or in many instances, they will start spinoffs, that is companies usually headed by a professor and their faculty, often, the scientists who are involved in the discovery. And that's where it took off from.  The odd fact is that the biotechnology industry, of which we hear so much, has been described by one of its leaders as the greatest money-losing industry in the history of the world. It has been living on equity. And if the sales don't come anywhere near the amount of money that's been invested, that's just a sidelight about the biotechnology industry. And as far as the number of drugs reaching the public, well, perhaps, it's very early in the development of these drugs. But so far, they are relatively few.  FLATOW: All right. We're going to have to take a short break. We'll come back and talk lots more about the relationship between pharmaceutical industry and academic research and doctors. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Perhaps, you're in the medical field. You may be a doctor or a drug representative or you want to chime in on the discussion going on today. We invite you. Our number, 1-800-989-8255.  Also, you can go to \"Second Life,\" we have Science School going there. We're -look for the folks wearing the SCIENCE FRIDAY T-shirts over there and pick up a T-shirt and get to ask a question.  Stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break.  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking this hour about medical research and the interaction between the pharmaceutical companies and academics and doctors. With my guests: David Korn, senior vice president at the Association of American Medical Colleges; Eric Campbell, who is senior scientist at the Institute for Health Policy at Mass General. Also with us is Marjorie Powell, senior assistant general counsel for PhRMA, Daniel Greenberg, author of \"Science for Sale: The Perils, Rewards and Delusions of Campus Capitalism. \" Our number, 1-800-989-8255.  David Korn, if the drug companies pay a university to do a research, should it be a requirement that the university, own the intellectual property, own the data that comes out? Wouldn't that eliminate some of the squabbling over, you know, where the money goes?  Dr. KORN: I would like to answer that, Ira, by saying that I think less than the issue of owning the data is the issue of accountability of those university faculty who are playing any sort of significant role in a particular study whether it's funded by the NIH or by a foundation or the industry or anyone else. And I agree that there have been instances of ghost authorship that is putting people's names on papers when those people have not, in fact, had full responsibility nor full accountability for the research. The association, which I'm now working, strongly condemns ghost authorship of any kind.  FLATOW: When you say ghost authorship, are you saying that it has the name of one person on it but it was written by someone else?  Mr. KORN: I'm saying that people\u2026  FLATOW: Give me a for example. Give me for example. Give me a fact.  Mr. KORN: Well, Dan Greenberg gave you one example a moment ago about a particular paper relating to Vioxx where the first named author, apparently, from what we know, did not have much of a role in the actual design or conduct or interpretation of experimental data, but did, perhaps, help write the paper and certainly helped get the paper into a front-rank medical journal. That kind of practice, we believe at the association, is deplorable. It's an affront to academic ethics and it should cease.  Ms. POWELL: And, Ira, Marjorie. We at PhRMA also believe that that's inappropriate. And we have established a set of principles that our companies adhere to that say that - that govern all of the relationships between researchers and the final authors of papers. And we feel very strongly that the authors of papers should be part of the research. They should have access to all of the research information.  And, in fact, in most institutions, that's a requirement of the contracts between the funder of a clinical study and the institution. It's one of the things that the medical schools and the universities have required. But I think it's important to remember that the reason that we have as vibrant of research industry and as much improvement in longevity as we do in this country is the relationship between our academic institutions and the companies that are actually commercializing the knowledge that the academic institutions are generating.  FLATOW: Dan, do you want to comment?  Mr. GREENBERG: Well, I would point out that Billy Tauzin, the former congressman, who's head of a big PhRMA last year or the year before said, how can we stop getting bad publicity for the pharmaceutical industry, and he answered his own question saying, let's stop doing bad things. Many of the activities in the pharmaceutical industry, I think, really go against the grain of scientific integrity.  Let's recall that two years ago, the director of NIH , after some consultancies were found there by members of the staff that hadn't been revealed to the administration there, prohibited any dealings by NIH staff with pharmaceutical companies. He even went down to the level of saying they can't even have any stock holdings, his suspicions were so great. So\u2026  Ms. POWELL: And what that does is it says that NIH can't draw upon the skills of people in academia who are doing a variety of research, some of it funded by NIH, some of it funded by commercial interest. If I were trying to design a study or making a medical or a product approval decision, I would want to know that the people designing the study, the people advising me, were current on all of the research and involved in and knowledgeable about that research.  I think it makes sense to be looking for people with the best skills and then to try and build some structures to make sure that there is disclosure of relationships, so that people evaluating those recommendations can balance the recommendations from one person and another person. That's, in fact, why when I go to the doctor and get - told that I need an operation, I often say, I'd like to get a second opinion.  Mr. GREENBERG: Well, I think Marjorie stated\u2026  Dr. CAMPBELL: Ira\u2026  Mr. GREENBERG: Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.  Dr. CAMPBELL: Yeah. Ira, this is Eric. I would like to comment. You know, it seems that the real impact here is - I think everybody recognizes that these relationships run a gamut of things from being related to research, and they're kind of different than relationships that are related to education, and they're kind of different than the relationships that are kind of related to just marketing university products.  And I think everybody recognizes and knows. We know from studies that these relationships have benefits and they have risks. And I think the key is to establish policies which get the benefits and protect against the risks. And they're not a single class of environment for - of relationships and doing, you know, an all out ban, in my opinion, at universities, wouldn't be a way to go. We don't know. We haven't evaluated the impact of the NIH ban on relationships. We don't know impact it's had. Certainly, PhRMA doesn't know and I'm quite certain the NIH doesn't know.  So I think we really need to think about these things in terms of what they're intended to do. And just a case in point, you know, in my mind, there's absolutely no rationale for why, you know, over 80 percent of clinical departments in medical schools receive money for - and food and beverages from drug companies for their faculty and their stuff. I mean, food and beverages? That's not research, and\u2026  I mean, I do a little bit of research and I don't ever recall requiring a Coke and bagel to do some research. In education, I have a Master's degree in education, and I don't ever recall my professor saying to me, now, the first thing you do is hand out sodas and bagels from the companies whose products you're about to teach your students about.  So if we think about these things in terms of what they're intended to do, you know, it becomes clear about what should and shouldn't be done with relationship to each of the individual type off relationships\u2026  FLATOW: So you're just reflecting what goes on in typical doctors' offices where they - staff gets, you know, gets lunches, doctors get dinners, they get speaking fees, they get money for clinical - putting patients in clinical studies, things like that. There's - I guess, they're just starting of an earlier age for your students on.  Dr. CAMPBELL: Right. Right.  FLATOW: Welcome to the real world, you know?  Dr. CAMPBELL: Right. They're clearly demonstrating it. You know, we know a recent study found that approximately a third of medical students get one gift or attend one industry-sponsored lunch every week. Now, we don't know if that's good or bad. But we certainly know it's occurring, and it's very frequent.  FLATOW: Marcia Angell suggests - and she's written a lot about this relationship - she suggests a couple of steps, different things that could be done. And one of them is that institutions, she says, should not accept grants with strings attached, investigators should design and analyze their own studies, write their own papers and decide about publication. What's wrong with that? What's wrong - David Korn?  Dr. KORN: I don't think there's anything wrong. And I think it's exactly what I said a few minutes ago that faculty who put your names on publications, regardless of who funds the study that they're reporting, have to have had full responsibility and accountability for the study from the inception to the writing of the paper to the publication. That's a very strong value that my colleagues and I believe should be the standard. And I believe that if - we believe that if every academic medical institution would enforce its own university policies on academic and research integrity, one could make a major step forward in getting rid of ghost authors and ghost research managers.  Mr. GREENBERG: Mm-hmm.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Let me go to - get a caller or two. We're running out of time. Steven(ph) in Lyndon, New Jersey. Hi, Steven.  STEVEN (Caller): Yes. Hi, how are you?  FLATOW: Hi.  STEVEN: hanks for taking my call.  FLATOW: Go ahead.  STEVEN: You know, there's a very simple solution to this problem that I think Americans don't want to face. And that is, do Americans want to pay for this, and then we can exclude the drug companies altogether in terms of the research and responsibilities associated with it. But I think not. I think they don't want to do that. And I think that Americans want Rolls-Royce medicine for Volkswagen prices. And that's what we've been moving to for the last 20 years.  Now, one of your guests mentioned something about trials being done in Third World countries, and that is true. And I think everyone wants accountability. But I think what he failed to mention is the flipside of that. Trials are often done in First World countries. A lot of these trials are corroborated in Europe, in Japan, in Australia, and other countries that have great faculty and great facilities for doing these kinds of tests.  I think what should do is we should look at this in a broad spectrum of things. I think that we don't even look at our government with this kind of a microscope. Lobbyists, in general, are paid - are basically paid lobbyists.  So my thing is, if you can stop at it a governmental level, then you'd probably be able to stop at this particular level. But I do think - I do think that we are missing a big picture here, and I that this is part of a broader spectrum of American life. And I do think that we should look at it more so - we should scrutinize our government, the same way we scrutinizing the pharmaceutical companies and the things that are going on. Because there are a lot of things going on in our government that are associated with the lobbyists and what they're giving to our government officials.  FLATOW: All right.  STEVEN: Thank you.  FLATOW: Steven, thanks for calling.  Dr. CAMPBELL: Ira, this is Eric. I think my comment would be very simply that the American people - you're already paying for it. You're paying for all of this in the form of increased drug prices that you pay every time you go and fill a prescription.  Ms. POWELL: Actually, Ira, it's important to remember that the drugs that we take, those pills that are saving so many lives or improving lives, are 10 cents out of every health care dollar. The largest portion of the health care dollar goes to a variety of other services - physicians, hospitals, laboratory tests - and it's the medicines that are in fact keeping us out of the hospital and saving some of those extra health care dollars and allowing us to live better.  And I think it's also important to remember that the clinical trials need to be designed according to FDA requirements and that imposes a requirement on manufacturers as they're trying to develop new medicines to be actively involved in designing the trials. If all of the academic medical center researchers did only their own design trials, there wouldn't be people to help with the manufacturer-sponsored trials that are necessary to get new drugs approved.  FLATOW: And I need to remind everybody, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  Any reaction?  Dr. KORN: Ira, Ira.  Dr. CAMPBELL: Yeah. I\u2026  FLATOW: One at a time. We'll you get in there.  Dr. KORN: Ira, this is David Korn. Let me make a comment in response to that. The system we have in this country whether it's the best or not the best is one in which the federal government supports primarily fundamental research that no private entity is going to support because the knowledge that's created is not owned - cannot be owned by one or a few people; it's general knowledge that all can share. There's no one else in our society whose function is to produce generalizable knowledge. But this flipside of that is that the government is not funding industries, it is not making products probably with the one exception of the Defense Department which does fund products.  When knowledge is generated, we have a system in which the private sector industry has to step forward and take those discoveries into products, tests, tools that benefit society. That's the system we have. The relationships are vital. They have to be principled. And\u2026  FLATOW: All right. Let me get some other comments because we're running out of time. Who else want to jump in? Dan\u2026  Mr. GREENBERG: Ira, I think one of the problems is that none of the sectors -that is the government, the university, the journals, the industry - have really lived up to their responsibilities. Dave raised an issue before of honorary ghost authorship as it's some - as it's referred to. There were hearings in Congress 25 years ago in which ghost authorship was described and deplored and the universities and their associations and probably his own association, too, said, well, the university should not engage in that. And here we are today talking about the problems of ghost authorship. I mean, why don't universities crack down on this? They had it within their capability. But many of them are quite lax and limp when it comes to looking after scientific integrity, though they are very, very vigorous and effective in chasing money.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. What - how would - Dan, how would you fix the system then? In a minute or two that we have left.  Mr. GREENBERG: Well, I think you could say to the faculty that you will not participate in ghost authorship. And if ghost authorship comes to light as it did with the Vioxx paper, there will be sanctions and there will be consequences. At present, there aren't.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. KORN: I would agree. By the way, this is David Korn.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. KORN: I would strongly agree with Dan on that point. I think the universities have it within their power to change some of the practices that we've been talking about that are really deplorable.  FLATOW: Do we need standards for all of them to follow, so that someone doesn't say, well, if I don't like the standards of this university, I'd go to the next one?  Dr. KORN: I think that's\u2026  Dr. CAMPBELL: Well, it would be beneficial to have universities in harmony of this. But\u2026  FLATOW: Yes.  Dr. CAMPBELL: \u2026these are not very, very complicated standards or prohibitions that have to be put in place. They're really quite simple. If you have a financial relationship with a commercial organization, this can be put into a database on the campus that's accessible by everybody so that if some hanky-panky is going on at least there will be a possibility of it being disclosed.  FLATOW: All right. We're going to have to stop there. I want to thank all of you for taking time to talk with us today.

I'm Farai Chideya. October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The good news: cancer rates for women are down, including from breast cancer. The bad news: African-American women are still 30 percent more likely to die of breast cancer than white women. It's part of a trend. In general, African-Americans are more likely to die from most cancers than any other race. This week, however, experts gathered for the first ever National Conference on African-Americans and Cancer. We've got two of the conference participants with us. Mary Hess is the founder and president of Minority Health Care Communications, and Dr. Natalie Joseph is an oncologist with Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. Welcome to you both. Ms. MARY HESS (Founder, President and Director, Minority Health Care Communications Inc. ): Thank you. Dr. NATALIE JOSEPH (Surgical Oncologist, Fox Chase Center, Philadelphia): Thank you very much. CHIDEYA: So, Dr. Joseph, what about the drop in cancer deaths? What's the cause of that? Dr. JOSEPH: Well, I think some of that has to do with more coordinated treatment. For many cancers these days, there are teams of physicians, including surgeons, radiation doctors and medical oncologists, who really come together in a more of a collaborative approach to individual patients. Also, we've had - seen great increases - or actually improvements I should say, in some of the chemotherapeutic agents that have been used, some of the surgical techniques, and I think all of those things together have certainly improved both our ability to treat cancer and, subsequently, their outcomes as well. CHIDEYA: Your specialties are colorectal cancer, breast cancer - those are the biggest drop-offs. What do you think is the reason that there was some ability to really help people and make sure that they stay cancer free? Dr. JOSEPH: Well, I think there have been huge screening efforts in both of those cancers - with mammography and some of the guidelines - with mammography, we're seeing a greater number of women whose diagnosis is made at a very early stage - at a stage where their cancer is very curable. And we're seeing the same thing in colorectal cancer as well. With efforts to push colonoscopy and early intervention, again, we're able to get cancers in an earliest stage where they can be cured. I think, also, there've been improvements and more standardization in surgical techniques. In colorectal cancer - actually, the first time in probably in the last 5 to 10 years, we've had some significant improvements in some of the chemotherapeutic agents that are used in treating that cancer which have really afforded significant improvements in survival; even for those patients who have metastatic disease we're seeing longer survival because of that. So I think there have also been\u2026 CHIDEYA: So when you say metastatic - sorry to interrupt you - you're talking about cancer that spread from where it started to other parts of the body. Dr. JOSEPH: Exactly. So once those - that percentage of patients who present to us with cancer that has already spread, we're even seen a longer survival with those patients as well because of that. There've also been some - there's been a push towards using more targeted agents so agents that are - chemotherapy agents that are very specific in that they target certain receptiors, and we're seeing that in both colon cancer and breast cancer. So I think it's really kind of a combination of many things that's leading to this improvement. CHIDEYA: Mary, let me talk to you. You are dealing with reaching out to the community, and one of the things that Dr. Joseph was talking about was better screening. How does what you do impact people's health, and what exactly is your strategy? Ms. HESS: Well, the National Conference on African-Americans and Cancer was founded on the premise that we have made great strides in therapeutics. You've heard Dr. Joseph talk about better results. The diagnostic techniques are much improved. We are able to impact people, you know, at a point where, in their disease, what they have, the cancer it's - earlier, it's easier to get to. But on the other end of it, we have people that are, especially among African-Americans, women that, while there are incidents of breast cancer, for example, isn't as high as any other racial types. These women are still more likely to die. In fact, they're 30 percent more likely to die. And so there's such a big disparity, and we think that someone - what comes into play is that there is a lack of access to care, and so the reason the conference was founded, well, the primary reasons was we saw the improvements. Everybody else, in effect, you know, there are improvements in the African-American population but in terms of getting to that magical five-year survival point where people are considered, you know, widely considered cured of their cancer, African-Americans are less likely to get to that point. And overall, they tend to have come into the care process. They engage with their doctor at a later point in their disease so that - again, we have a lot of catching up to do but there's a lot to be gained. CHIDEYA: Take this to a more personally level, when you think about what this issue means in terms of, for example, people not living as long once they're diagnosed in the African-American community. What does that mean to women? What does that mean to families? Ms. HESS: Well, for families, gosh, there's so many ways that cancer or any serious illness negatively impacts a family. For example, in the African-American community women play such a pivotal role there. They're the primary caregivers, they're often can be people that are taking in their elderly relatives, they may be taking care of a sister, they may have so many more responsibilities, many times they're also working outside of the house. So if you're a primary caregiver - the mother, for example, has breast cancer, then that's going to have an immediate impact on productivity on the mother's part. She's going to be sick, she's going to be going through a lot of debilitating therapy, a lot of medicine should be taken. There's also the cost of the medication and the other care that goes around it, you know, when someone goes to get their cancer therapy, to take their cancer medicine, they don't just go and get the medicine and then they come back home, they have to take other medicine to relieve the side effects. So the cost of the therapy is not just about medicine, it's also about a lack of productivity and medications that are used to relieve things like nausea. People are sick and they also may not be able to take care of the children and so it's quite devastating. CHIDEYA: So, Dr. Joseph, you are a surgical oncologist, you've have to deal with, I'm sure, some very severe cases. When you think about some of the patients that you've treated, as well as the research that you do, what stands out in your mind about what you can bring to individual women and to families? Dr. JOSEPH: Well, I think that - well, clearly, one of the first things we can offer is hope. I think one of the things that many times can be overwhelming to any patient, and particularly what we see kind of in the African-American community, is that a cancer diagnosis is very overwhelming, and, for many people they think of it as being a death sentence. But certainly, I think given, as they said, the diagnostic techniques that we have, surgical techniques such as the ones that I perform, and also the, you know, the other disciplines that offer, you know, other components of their treatment, I think that many of those patients, even though it may be kind of hard road to go through, can end up with a very good outcome. And so what we like to push for them is this isn't the end. There are certainly good treatments to offer you. It doesn't mean that, you know, you're not going to live to see, you know, your children or the rest of your family. And in fact, for those patients that were able to get in early, they have a very good chance of a good outcome. So I think we're really trying to push that for them. CHIDEYA: Now, Mary, I understand that you're doing a call to action for the African-American community. Tell me about that. Ms. HESS: Well, it's two parts. First of all, what happened during the conference on African-Americans for Cancer we had are audience that was very professional and also a very engaged audience. And I think, for a lot of people, there - it was a revelation that they were able to really network in a firm, but it's a very difficult work. I mean, if you're a cancer nurse, a cancer physician, a case worker, a social worker, you know, it takes a lot out of you to encounter people who are in pain, who, sadly, may not succeed in their fight against cancer. You engage with a lot of the damage. You know, those left behind, you have children that are going through a very tough time watching mommy or daddy, or you may also see the parents struggle with the child's sickness. So it does take a toll on you. And even professionally, you need to have that support. And I think one thing this conference did accomplish was that we are hoping that these folks who came and joined hands and sat next to each other for two days and listened to this information in the same room, also began to begin to form a network. So one of the goals was to get a network of concerned providers together and with the goal of the Call to Action - the Call to Action is really two pieces. One is the letter to President Bush. And we haven't finished the letter, we want to include all of the faculty who were present at the conference. So what we're doing right now is we have a basic letter, and we're actually getting input from all our faculty who represent many main disciplines, and we're going to forward that onward. And then secondly, we have a set of guidelines that we're working on a white paper, you could call it. And the guidelines are not treatment guidelines because, after all, the treatment for cancer is individualized and that really would rest between the provider and discuss it with the patient. But these guidelines are for services and support. And that's one of the biggest things that we see that's empty right now. And in the\u2026 CHIDEYA: Mary, let me just jump in. When you talk about services and support, one of the issues on the table is wealth and poverty. And in many cases, people who are diagnosed later, people who don't have a lot of economic resources, how do you deal with all these broader issues for people who may not even have regular access to health care? Ms. HESS: You have - you point out an excellent point. In fact, Harold Freeman, one of our speakers, said that poverty is the one - one of the number one reasons that there remains a disparity between African-Americans and their health care and other racial types. So going on that, yes, there are several things that could be done. And there's a model that we can look in terms of an example, which would be the HIV movement. We had HIV activists 25 years ago lobby in and create Ryan White, which is a funding sources - kind of by the federal government and Ryan White covers different types of needs that the patients have. For example, medication needs, also housing needs, also can even include child care, elder care. It can include transportation, nutritional counseling. And it's - it works very, very well, and it's refunded every year. This was really put in place in the case of the HIV epidemic, it was put in place as emergency measure because of the severity and the widespread nature of the HIV epidemic at that time. And it's been refunded every single year. It would be a possible model to use to alleviate some of the worst situations among the cancer epidemic, not jus in the African-American community, but all across the United States possibly. This could be modeled and after Ryan White, the CARE Act. So that is a possibility. CHIDEYA: So it sounds like you're really talking about fundamental push to really put this agenda up higher. Ms. HESS: That's correct. I mean, the whole reason why we launched the conference was to really begin - not just getting the primary care physicians involved, which of course, you know, we certainly want to have that. The continuity of care, the communication can really use enhancement between the oncology community and primary care. There's a lot of opportunity to enhance that. So\u2026 CHIDEYA: Mary, we're going to have to end it here. Thank you both so much. We've been speaking with Mary Hess, the founder and president of Minority Health Care Communications, and Dr. Natalie Joseph, an oncologist with Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. They joined us from the center's studios. Coming up ahead, our civil rights series continues with struggles in Africa, Haiti and South America.

Dr. JOSEPH: Well, I think that - well, clearly, one of the first things we can offer is hope. I think one of the things that many times can be overwhelming to any patient, and particularly what we see kind of in the African-American community, is that a cancer diagnosis is very overwhelming, and, for many people they think of it as being a death sentence. But certainly, I think given, as they said, the diagnostic techniques that we have, surgical techniques such as the ones that I perform, and also the, you know, the other disciplines that offer, you know, other components of their treatment, I think that many of those patients, even though it may be kind of hard road to go through, can end up with a very good outcome. And so what we like to push for them is this isn't the end. There are certainly good treatments to offer you. It doesn't mean that, you know, you're not going to live to see, you know, your children or the rest of your family. And in fact, for those patients that were able to get in early, they have a very good chance of a good outcome. So I think we're really trying to push that for them.  CHIDEYA: Now, Mary, I understand that you're doing a call to action for the African-American community. Tell me about that.  Ms. HESS: Well, it's two parts. First of all, what happened during the conference on African-Americans for Cancer we had are audience that was very professional and also a very engaged audience. And I think, for a lot of people, there - it was a revelation that they were able to really network in a firm, but it's a very difficult work. I mean, if you're a cancer nurse, a cancer physician, a case worker, a social worker, you know, it takes a lot out of you to encounter people who are in pain, who, sadly, may not succeed in their fight against cancer. You engage with a lot of the damage. You know, those left behind, you have children that are going through a very tough time watching mommy or daddy, or you may also see the parents struggle with the child's sickness.  So it does take a toll on you. And even professionally, you need to have that support. And I think one thing this conference did accomplish was that we are hoping that these folks who came and joined hands and sat next to each other for two days and listened to this information in the same room, also began to begin to form a network.  So one of the goals was to get a network of concerned providers together and with the goal of the Call to Action - the Call to Action is really two pieces. One is the letter to President Bush. And we haven't finished the letter, we want to include all of the faculty who were present at the conference. So what we're doing right now is we have a basic letter, and we're actually getting input from all our faculty who represent many main disciplines, and we're going to forward that onward.  And then secondly, we have a set of guidelines that we're working on a white paper, you could call it. And the guidelines are not treatment guidelines because, after all, the treatment for cancer is individualized and that really would rest between the provider and discuss it with the patient. But these guidelines are for services and support. And that's one of the biggest things that we see that's empty right now. And in the\u2026  CHIDEYA: Mary, let me just jump in. When you talk about services and support, one of the issues on the table is wealth and poverty. And in many cases, people who are diagnosed later, people who don't have a lot of economic resources, how do you deal with all these broader issues for people who may not even have regular access to health care?  Ms. HESS: You have - you point out an excellent point. In fact, Harold Freeman, one of our speakers, said that poverty is the one - one of the number one reasons that there remains a disparity between African-Americans and their health care and other racial types. So going on that, yes, there are several things that could be done.  And there's a model that we can look in terms of an example, which would be the HIV movement. We had HIV activists 25 years ago lobby in and create Ryan White, which is a funding sources - kind of by the federal government and Ryan White covers different types of needs that the patients have. For example, medication needs, also housing needs, also can even include child care, elder care. It can include transportation, nutritional counseling. And it's - it works very, very well, and it's refunded every year.  This was really put in place in the case of the HIV epidemic, it was put in place as emergency measure because of the severity and the widespread nature of the HIV epidemic at that time. And it's been refunded every single year. It would be a possible model to use to alleviate some of the worst situations among the cancer epidemic, not jus in the African-American community, but all across the United States possibly. This could be modeled and after Ryan White, the CARE Act. So that is a possibility.  CHIDEYA: So it sounds like you're really talking about fundamental push to really put this agenda up higher.  Ms. HESS: That's correct. I mean, the whole reason why we launched the conference was to really begin - not just getting the primary care physicians involved, which of course, you know, we certainly want to have that. The continuity of care, the communication can really use enhancement between the oncology community and primary care. There's a lot of opportunity to enhance that. So\u2026  CHIDEYA: Mary, we're going to have to end it here. Thank you both so much. We've been speaking with Mary Hess, the founder and president of Minority Health Care Communications, and Dr. Natalie Joseph, an oncologist with Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. They joined us from the center's studios.  Coming up ahead, our civil rights series continues with struggles in Africa, Haiti and South America.

This year, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development launched an effort to track the lives of more than 100,000 kids from birth to adulthood. The idea is to get information that would help prevent and treat some of America's most pressing health problems. Yvonne Maddox is deputy director of the institute and she's leading the effort. Welcome. Dr. YVONNE MADDOX (Deputy Director, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development): Thank you very much and pleased to be here. And it's great that you're letting your listeners know about our national children's study. CHIDEYA: Well, there have been a few long-term studies before. There was one about twins - Minnesota twin study. What makes this one special? How is it going to be recruited and conducted? Dr. MADDOX: One of the things that I must say first is that this is the first of its kind even though you talked about the Minnesota's twin study and there have been other longitudinal studies as well. But this is the first study of its type that focuses not only on this larger group of children but also is a sampling of all of the children who represent America. And this is really a critical point because if you're going to look at the factors that impact on our child's well being and growth, you cannot neglect or alleviate issues such as ethnicity, race, income, educational level, number of births, number of children who are born, perhaps, pre-term, number who are born with low birth weight. But one of the other things that's critical about this study is that we will be looking at these children from the time they are born until they're 21 years of age. With the grey hope that we will be able to identify some of the issues and - particularly some of the environmental issues that contributes to chronic diseases later in life. And we like to call this not only a - the national longitudinal study of children and their environment, but actually, it's a study that will look at the fill antecedence of adult disease because we believe that diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and even the epidemic that we're having now with obesity, they actually began in utero and the uterine environment may contribute to these long-term chronic diseases or it may be a combination of the uterine environment as well as the built environment such as in the toxic exposures that a child may face. But also the school ground that the child plays in, these built conditions will also impact on the child's behavior and their maturation and growth. CHIDEYA: Well, Ms. Maddox, when you imagine a child going through this study, what are we really talking about? Is it that someone is going to come and observe the checkups? Is someone just going to read the charts? What exactly does it mean for a child who is involved? Dr. MADDOX: This is - as I said, this is an observational study. It's longitudinal, which means that over the period of 21 years, we will be making visits not only to the home, but oftentimes to the school, to the boys and girls club that a child may be involved with. But it begins with some very basic test taken early in life. We'll be taking samples of hair, of teeth, of skin, these are very not invasive tests so it will be - give us an opportunity to not only collect samples to be able to measure enzymes and various other elements that are critical to interpreting health outcomes. But it will give us a chance to ask questions of not only the child, but of the family to look at social issues and environmental issues that associate with behavior and behavioral interventions that might be necessary to improve the child's well-being. CHIDEYA: You have been at the institute for almost 13 years directing budget over a billion dollars. How did you find the passion for doing this kind of work? Dr. MADDOX: Well, in order to make research meaningful and to put it in action, you need to be in a health policy or leadership role in which you can impact the results of research. The other thing on a very personal level is that I have a PhD in physiology and biophysics. I intended, as I graduated from undergraduate school, which by the way was an historical black college in Richmond, Virginia. I really had planned to go to medical school, in fact, got accepted into medical school. And my father was the oldest of three children and my father became very, very ill and actually developed congestive heart failure. And I knew that I wouldn't be able to go to medical school right away because I had two younger brothers and sisters to work with. But I knew that I wanted to keep the dream alive to stay connected to medical work and to do something in the medical field. So instead of going to medical school, I took a job right away working in a laboratory and this had developed a thrill for discovery and a passion for doing research. And I think a lot of us who go into research are sometimes sparked or spurred to go in this direction because we've had some personal interaction or some personal story to tell, and mine was I decided, well, I'm going to know more about development and know why someone has congestive heart failure as my dad had. So the passion just was transmitted over a lifetime to what I do now. CHIDEYA: Well, Miss Maddox, thanks so much for your time. Dr. MADDOX: Thank you and thank you so much.

When we turn to astronomers to sort through news of visible heavenly bodies, we usually hear about predictable phenomena, eclipses, for example. So it's unusual for us to hear about something so unusual that it's really surprising to the experts. But that is certainly the case with Comet Holmes, which had a huge outburst in late October, and which has gotten bigger and dimmer since. Alan MacRobert is a senior editor at Sky & Telescope magazine in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He joins us now. Are you surprised about Comet Holmes? Mr. ALAN MacROBERT (Senior editor, Sky & Telescope magazine): Well, we certainly were. This thing brightened by a factor of a million way out beyond the orbit of Mars for no known reason. SIEGEL: And how visible is it in the sky? MR. MacROBERT: A big part of the significance of this is that anybody can go out and see it and enjoy it. You don't have to be a trained astronomer. You don't have to have a Ph. D. in physics. Just go out, look northeast, find the constellation Perseus, and there it is. It's a big fuzzy puff ball of a thing among the ten point stars. You don't even need a dark sky for this. SIEGEL: Well, why would a comet undergo a great outburst? MR. MacROBERT: Well, one theory that astronomers are pretty sure is wrong is that it got hit by a meteorite. The thing is, comets do go through these sorts of inexplicable outbursts fairly often, and there just aren't enough meteorites out there to account for it. Space is just very, very empty. Another possibility is that the comet has a hard, frozen crust, sort of like a snow bank at the end of February, when it's black with dirt, but it's still snowy on the inside, and that pressure builds up inside it and the crust all of a sudden broke. SIEGEL: Well, considering how Comet Holmes took us by surprise, do we have any idea how long it's likely to remain visible? MR. MacROBERT: Nobody knows. Eventually, it is going to fade out. That much we are sure of. However, this comet did it once before in 1892, when it was first discovered. And that year, it did it twice. After it faded out, two months later it erupted again. SIEGEL: This strikes me as the kind of celestial event that a few millennia ago, this could really throw people off looking at something like this up in the sky and make them think things about what was going on up there. MR. MacROBERT: Well, people thought the universe revolved them. And that if there was some kind of a sign going on up in the heavens, it must mean that the king was going to be overthrown or that he was going to overthrow somebody else or that bad news was coming our way. And, in fact, this was a frozen dirt ball out in space that went through an eruption. And it really doesn't care about us. SIEGEL: But a sitting king might be careful just the same with this happening right now. MR. MacROBERT: Always a good idea. SIEGEL: Always a good idea.

I'm Ira Flatow. We're all wired for music, according to my next guest. Think about your own experiences with music and, you know, you'll see what he means. From the earliest songs you remembered to the music of your teenage years, you know, music can bring back those memories just hearing a little bit of a song, to the tunes you play today to get you through a workout or a tough time, or the music that helps you celebrate or worship or dance. We each have a soundtrack for our lives, and you don't have to be able to make music or even understand it in an educated way to appreciate it. In his new book, \"Musicophilia,\" Oliver Sacks says that for all of us, our auditory systems, our nervous systems are exquisitely tuned for music. He's here with us today to make that case and to talk about what happens when the wiring goes bad, when we lose the power to perceive music. Can't get it out of our heads, you know? How did that happened? You know, you hear it when it isn't really there. Sometimes, some people see music in full color. We're also going to talk about the healing power of music. How it can reach people with a wide array of neurological disorders from amnesia to epilepsy to Alzheimer's, when little or nothing else can get through to them. So if you'd like to talk about music with Dr. Sacks, our number is 1-800-989\u2014 8255, 1-800-989-TALK. You can surf over to our Web site at sciencefriday. com and meet some avatars wearing SCIENCE FRIDAY T-shirts over in \"Second Life\" in Science School, so a lot of different ways to interact with us. Let me formally introduce Dr. Sacks. He's a neurologist and author. His most recent book is \"Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain\" is just out. His other books include \"An Anthropologist on Mars: The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,\" and \"Awakening. \" You're familiar with him. He's professor of clinical neurology and clinical psychology at Columbia University Medical Center and a Columbia University artist in New York. He joins us here in our NPR's studios. Welcome back to program. Dr. OLIVER SACKS (Author, \"Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain\"): It's nice to be here again. FLATOW: You know, they created a special title for you up there in Columbia, didn't they? Dr. SACKS: It seems so, yeah. FLATOW: You were allowed to do anything you want to now. Dr. SACKS: Well, not entirely, but I'll certainly commute between the two campuses and be a sort of in-between figure between medicine and art. FLATOW: What are some the things you like to do most there? Tell me. Dr. SACKS: Well, I'm - the things I like to do most are to see patients, which I was doing this morning, and to write about them, and to talk about them, and to think about them. FLATOW: Now, you talk about a lot of your patients in this book, and some of them, well, they all have to do with music. What made you decide to go on this music bender, if I may put\u2026 Dr. SACKS: Well, I mean, apart from sort of personal involvement with music as a physician back in the 1960s, when I saw the patients I later wrote about in \"Awakenings\" deeply in Parkinsonian patients who couldn't move or speak unless there was music, this was my first glimpse of the therapeutic power of music. And, subsequently, I saw that in many other conditions, although, often different sorts of music working in different ways. And I've also been consulted over the years by people with various musical problems\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. SACKS: \u2026as you've mentioned, from not perceiving it to not being able to stop it or hallucinating it. But I think the final thing for me is the fact that on the last 10 years, basically, there's been an amazing technological advances so that the functional brain imagery we could can at the brain when people are listening to music, imagining music, composing music, and we have a much clearer idea now of what goes on than we did 10 years ago. FLATOW: Well, I want to get in to all of that because it's also interesting. But let me start with the first - one of the major points that you make in your book is that our brains are wired for music the same way we're wired for language. Dr. SACKS: Well, and even more extensively, there's no particular music center but there are many different parts of the brain, many networks, many systems -in the auditory parts of the brain, the visual parts, the executive parts, the motor parts - and there are like 20 or 30 different parts of the brain which are recruited for musical experience and performance. And this is much wider than for speech, which is the reason why if people lose language in aphasia, they still have music available. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And you quote Steven Pinker in the foreword of your book, in the preface saying, you know, there's really no biological reason for we, as an animal, to be so - have music such an integral part of ourselves. Would you agree with that? Dr. SACKS: No, I think, I disagree rather strongly, although, really, one can only speculate. But music occurs and is central in every culture we know of, we have known of. There are musical instruments which go back 50,000 years - bone flutes, which have much the same tonal intervals as we have now. We have things like - something which is exclusively human and doesn't have an analog, and speech is our movement synchronized with beat, with rhythm. One sees every child spontaneously starts to dance\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. SACKS: \u2026or to keep time. You don't see this in a chimpanzee. This seems to be an exclusively human thing. And it wouldn't have been preserved - I mean, to invert the argument - if it hadn't been useful. I mean, Darwin thinks of music in terms of courtship he felt was - had a strong evolutionary sexual selection. I also wonder about a cultural selection because music is so powerful for bonding people together. FLATOW: Right. You say it's not only what - that we appreciate music on an emotional level, but that we have a, quote, \"largely unconscious structural appreciation of music. \" What do you mean by that? Dr. SACKS: Well, with experience as with language, I think, as it were the grammar of music or particular music, the rules, the laws, the way it is going, come to one, and so much of listening to music is anticipation. And one can whistle along sometimes with a piece one has never heard. You were almost composing it with the composer. He's hinting all the while as to where it's going. And if one gets a sudden sense of shock or dissonance that there's a surprise. FLATOW: You say - you talked about having a musician's brain. Are the brains of musicians really different than the brains of non-musicians? Dr. SACKS: Well, everyone's brains are different, but the brains of musicians are grossly different. A man called Schlaug, Gottfried Schlaug at Harvard have shown that various structures in the brain, the corpus callosum, big band between the hemisphere's auditory cortex, motor cortex, visual cortex are all visibly enlarged or so visibly enlarged in musicians that you could look at a brain and say, I think that's a musician's brain, but you couldn't say it's a mathematician's brain or an artist's brain. FLATOW: So which came first: that the brain shape make you a musician or that being a musician changed the shape of your brain? Dr. SACKS: Well, it's probably not a neither/or, but we do know that a lot of training, like the Suzuki method, can make a lot of difference in a year. On the other hand, it's obvious that, you know, the Mozarts of this world are born as well as made. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let's talk about some of the patients and some of your own experiences with music. And I think - let's start with a thing that all of us have experienced. It's that tune you get into your head, and when you hear it, you could have it - you were talking about people having it for days, weeks, months. Dr. SACKS: Yeah. FLATOW: The brain worm, is that what you call it? Dr. SACKS: Well, the music industry originally called it an earworm. I somehow like the term of a brain worm, which I imagined it boring into the brain, and certainly it goes round and round in the brain. I mean, I think, all of us have a sort of involuntary tunes, which go through the head in which often pleasant and sometimes and usually associated with thoughts or moods. With a brain worm, this has gone wrong. And you will have a fragment of tune which gets into a loop and goes and round and round and loses all sense, all connection. And it's very difficult to stop sometimes. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. It just had to go away on its own or\u2026 Dr. SACKS: Yes, I\u2026 FLATOW: Can you talk yourself out of it? Dr. SACKS: Some people can or they will sing it through to the end or they will sort of slap cold water on their face or jump up and down, but sometimes, you just have to wait for it to go away. FLATOW: Is there one that's, you know, should we start one now? (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: If you got a tune, let's get everybody in our audience for the rest of the day tuning in their heads. The Sara Lee theme, you know? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. SACKS: Well, yeah. Well, actually, as you said that, I thought of da-da-da-da. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. SACKS: I\u2026 FLATOW: Beethoven's Fifth\u2026 Dr. SACKS: Just thought about a Beethoven rhyme. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: All right. We'll have the whole country on Beethoven. Let's talk about, you write about musical hallucinations. One of your patients talked about musical hallucination. Dr. SACKS: Yeah. Well, a hallucination is quite different from imagery or brain worms. With a hallucination, you suddenly hear it as if it's for real. It's just like perception - indistinguishable. People are very startled. They look around and say, hey, you know, you heard that? FLATOW: Right. Dr. SACKS: They look for a radio or something, and only if they can't find an external source, they then realize that something unprecedented is happening in their brain or their mind. And they're often very scared because it's just unprecedented, it's uncontrollable, and people say\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. SACKS: \u2026you know, hearing things, am I crazy? In fact, this is not at all like hearing voices. It's not at all like a psychotic hallucination. It tends mostly to occur, not exclusively, mostly in people who are pretty deaf. And it's as if when the hearing parts of the brain aren't getting their usual input, their usual nourishment, then they dig down into memory and they activate themselves. So usually, these hallucinations are usually of popular songs, hymns, whatever one has heard in early life. FLATOW: I hear music and there's no one there\u2026 Dr. SACKS: Right. FLATOW: \u2026a volume in that song. But you also talk about how when you recall music, some people just hear instruments, some people can hear a whole orchestra, and that you can recall it as if it were live. You know, live being played live. You talk about whether Beethoven or it was Bach who lost his hearing who would have gone nuts if he hadn't been able to do that. Dr. SACKS: Yeah. Well, I mean, I would think most professional musicians, and especially conductors and composers, you know, could do that. And when Beethoven lost his hearing or became deaf, whatever - however wretched this made him in other ways, it certainly didn't disable him as a musician. In fact, it may even have heightened his musical imagery because deafness tends to heighten the sensitivity of the auditory parts of the brain. FLATOW: And in some people you write about, it can be so strong that they swear there's the radio on or something like that. Dr. SACKS: Yeah. Well, then there's a hallucination. But I don't think Beethoven hallucinated. I think there may be a sort of continuum between image and hallucination, but they're pretty different. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're talking with the incomparable Oliver Sacks, author of \"Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain\" just out in hardcover, and I know it has a cover that you hate on, that you hate looking at your own picture, right? Dr. SACKS: Well, you know - once is enough. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Fame is a heavy burden. Stay with us. We're going to come right back and take your phone calls, talking with Oliver Sacks about \"Musicophilia. \" We'll be right back. Share with us your, you know, your musical recollections, things that drive you nutty, maybe some experiences of your own. 1-800-989-8255. We'll be right back. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour with Oliver Sacks, who really needs no introduction. You know him from all his books in the past. His latest book is \"Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain\" out this year by Knopf. Our number: 1-800-989-8255. Also, we're in \"Second Life. \" You can meet an avatar there and get to know and ask questions and send us a question here also via \"Second Life. \" Let's talk about something that's really fascinating. And you talk about it in the book, and I really didn't know about it, that it existed until I read about it in the book. That's the orthopedic surgeon who was struck by a lightning and had suddenly an onset of musical interest that never he had before. He never had it before in his life. Dr. SACKS: No. He was in his early 40s and really had very little interest in music, apparently not much talent, didn't have a piano in the house. But about three weeks after he'd been struck, which gave him a cardiac arrest, basically have killed him for a minute. FLATOW: Had that out-of-body experience, the whole thing. Dr. SACKS: Yeah, absolutely. FLATOW: Yeah, yeah. Dr. SACKS: And then he thought, you know, it's all over. But about three weeks later over the course of a weekend basically, he got transformed and he developed what you call as an insatiable passion for hearing piano music, then for playing piano music and then for composing piano music. And he acted on this straight away. He got a piano, he got a piano teacher. He continued to work as a surgeon, but he started getting up very early, and all his time was spent with music. He said his wife wasn't best pleased, and this has continued for 15 years. FLATOW: Wow. Dr. SACKS: There's really been a transformation and a slight mystical or exalted feeling which goes with it. He feels he may have been saved for the specific purpose of delivering this. He talks - he says he feels he tunes into heaven for his music. FLATOW: Now, how do you as a scientist explain this? Dr. SACKS: Well, I asked him and he said, as a doctor, I can't explain. I think it's spiritual. And I said, well, fine, but might not anything spiritual have to operate via the nervous system. So he says, okay. I would suspect there's been some activation or reorganization of structures around the temporal lobes of the brain, the right temporal lobes, which are especially concerned with musical patterns and sometimes with mystical or religious feelings. I think something happened there. FLATOW: Hmm. You mentioned the tools we have today, the ability to actually image the brain as it's working in helping these things. Tell us how useful that is to you as someone studying music and neurology. Dr. SACKS: Well, I think it would be useful here. Originally, he wasn't inclined to allow any sort of investigation, but he will allow it now, and I think we could actually watch his brain while music is coming to him. He'll say it comes from heaven, you know, I might say (unintelligible)\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. SACKS: \u2026heaven is in the temporal lobes, hell as well. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Well - either a music center in the brain or is it distributed? Dr. SACKS: It's widely distributed\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. SACKS: \u2026but elaborate - the final synthesis and their emotional components probably especially have to do with temporal lobe and its connections. FLATOW: If I'm listening to a song, I'm humming or - is it actually playing in my brain? Dr. SACKS: Oh, it's absolutely playing in your brain. And even if you don't make any movement to keep time, the rhythm is playing in your brain, so there's - it's really a little internal performance. FLATOW: Because we hear scientists talk about we create our own memories, you know, as if they're real, could we create our own music experiences as if they're real also? Dr. SACKS: Well, this is what happens in a hallucination. FLATOW: Yeah. It it's in the hallucination, yeah. Dr. SACKS: But even a shorter that - whenever we visualize anything, the visual cortex gets active and imagination is very real and hallucination even more so. FLATOW: Let's go to Janet(ph) in Tucson, Arizona. Hi, Janet. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. JANET (Caller): Hello. FLATOW: Hi, Janet. You got to turn your radio off. JANET: Ira, it's off. I'm on my cell phone. FLATOW: Hi. Go for it. JANET: Okay. Well, I come from a real musical family. I'm actually related to Felix Mendelssohn. And our music is so much part of my life. I'm a vocalist. And my husband's son, my step-grandson is - cannot stand music in any form. It just freaks him out completely. And I was wondering if you'd ever heard anything like this. I mean, the kid is 7 years old, and he cannot stand any kind of music? FLATOW: He writes - you write about that in your book. Dr. SACKS: Well, not enough, you know? Quite a lot of people have been telling me about musicophobia\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. SACKS: \u2026and a hatred of music or - and I think I probably should have written more. I wonder what goes on in that 7-year-old. Is he averse to all music? JANET: Yes, all music. He can't stand it. I'm wondering if it's a function of some form of autism because Asperger's runs in that side of the family. Dr. SACKS: Does he recognize the music he dislikes? JANET: He just doesn't like any kind of music at all. Dr. SACKS: Okay. JANET: If there's any kind of music at all, he can't stand it. Dr. SACKS: Okay. Because there are some people with a rare disorder called amusia, and these people don't have pitch discrimination. They can't hit tones and semitones. They don't really hear music as such. They may just hear it as noise. One of my patients with this said it's like pots and pans being thrown around at the kitchen and this would certainly make one hates music. FLATOW: But one of your patients had a cure, did she not, for this problem - who hated music? I thought - maybe I thought I read that in the book, you know? Dr. SACKS: Well, this was another patient, a composer who had distortion of a somewhat deaf at the high-end. FLATOW: Oh, I see. Dr. SACKS: And with him, things got better. But, I mean, one needs to sort out what's going on with your boy. FLATOW: Could he grow out of it? I mean\u2026 Dr. SACKS: Well, I hope he can grow out of it. He'll be helped out because, you know, there's a huge source of joy and, you know, one would say innocent joy in music. FLATOW: Can a mother like Janet do anything - take her son\u2026 Dr. SACKS: Well, I think she needs to sort of find out what's happening and whether the audiologist will do this or the psychiatrist or the neurologist. FLATOW: Good luck, Janet. Dr. SACKS: Good luck. JANET: Thank you very much. Dr. SACKS: Right. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's go to - back to phones to Jane(ph) in Columbus. Hi, Jane. JANE (Caller): Hi. I wanted to mention - I don't have a question, but I do have a comment. I had a dear aunt lived with me. She was in her 90s\u2026 FLATOW: We lost her. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: We lost everybody on the phone. I saw her question, she said she had an aunt who lived with her in her 90s and she was getting Alzheimer's disease. Dr. SACKS: She says - she was saying that? FLATOW: And yes, she said it on the screener. And she was very close and - but she could still hear the music. Dr. SACKS: Yeah. Well, however severe Alzheimer's is, the musical parts of the brain, the many networks are very robust and they tend to survive something like Alzheimer's so that even if someone can't understand language\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. SACKS: \u2026and stay out of it generally, they'll still recognize music, respond to it, join in and have their moods and their memories stimulated. Music is tremendously important, I think, for people with Alzheimer's. FLATOW: Yeah. I had an aunt who had some sort of dementia before that we knew what these things were, you know, years ago\u2026 Dr. SACKS: Yeah. FLATOW: \u2026gave the names. But as she regressed, she sort of regressed to being a teenager in her mind and she started singing arias. She was a world-class singer and she hadn't sung them in years and people love to just come listen to her sing. Dr. SACKS: Oh, that's fascinating. I'd like to make that a footnote in the next edition. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Yeah, it was very funny. What are the - let's talk about some of the other kinds of patients. You've had a patient with extraordinary talent for music but severe deficits in other cognitive activities. Dr. SACKS: Well, one sometimes see this in people with Williams syndrome, this is a rare congenital syndrome where people are often precocious and gifted in language and music, and they're very sociable but they're rather retarded in many other ways with low, low IQs. FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah. Dr. SACKS: They can't usually function independently. But people with Williams syndrome, all of them, 100 percent of them, are enraptured by music. They're almost helplessly delighted or anguished or overwhelmed by it. A lot of them are musically talented. All of them are enraptured, but the other thing is one can have a musical savant. These are usually people who have autism, and interestingly at least half of the musical savants are also blind. And blindness disposes to musicality as well. FLATOW: The last time you were on our program a couple of years ago, we got into music therapy, and that to coin a phrase, it really struck a cord in a lot of our listeners. And I'm struck by the wide range of patients, people with an array of neurological conditions who can, as you talked about in your book, be reached by music. Dr. SACKS: Yeah. Well, as I say, I first saw this with the Parkinsonian people who really have this motor problem, and for them, it's the rhythm which is important. The music doesn't have to be familiar or affect them in other ways. For people with Alzheimer's, it needs to be a familiar song which has -especially which has associations and resonance and stirs memory and mood. For people who've lost language, people who have aphasia, may often find they can sing and get a lyric with that. I mean, this can delight them\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. SACKS: \u2026which shows that language is there, although it may be embedded in the song. And there are ways now - although it's a lot of work - of disembedding the language so they can reacquire it, sometimes with a different part of the brain with the right side of the brain. And one sees that people with Tourette's syndrome, with Huntington's chorea, with autism, with all sorts of conditions, can respond very powerfully to music. FLATOW: I have a question here from \"Second Life,\" from Rosemerta. She says I have a soundtrack in my brain pretty much all the time, and I feel lost without it. But I have gotten the impression that not everyone has this experience of always having music in their heads. Dr. Sacks, do you have an opinion on that? Dr. SACKS: Well, I think this lady probably has it to an unusual extent. I have a cousin, a composer, who once said he had a 24 hour classical Muzak in his mind. I don't know whether this lady is herself a musician. But I think most people get tunes intermittently in the mind, which are not consciously summoned but which usually have some sort of association with their thoughts. I think all of us have a sort of - many of us have a sort of musical companionship throughout our life. FLATOW: When we hear music that is calming and soothing and revokes - evokes, you know, maybe the day you were out on the beach or something, are there actual runner's high, like, are their endorphins that are released? Is there sort of real feeling, you know? Is there a brain chemistry going on that created that soothing, you think? Dr. SACKS: Yes. There's quite a lot of work on this and, you know, both the physiology of thrills and chills, but also of calming music. You can investigate it electrically by doing EEGs or by brain imaging, or by looking at some of the chemicals. I mean, the changes are very real, and David(ph) what he was doing with so\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to the phones, to Dan in Toledo. Hi, Dan. DAN (Caller): Hi. FLATOW: Hi, there. DAN: Thank you. I had heard that Hendrix was one of these people that had optical and audio nerves crossed, so he\u2026 FLATOW: Whoops - can you see the music, I think, what he was going to talk about. There are other people who see colors and things like that. Dr. SACKS: Okay. Well, quite a number of people have some crossing of the senses, as this man puts it, in which they will involuntarily and automatically have see things, smells things, taste things as they hear them or vice versa. One of the commonest is to see colors with music, and this is not just a metaphor. It's not just a poetic association. This is totally real, so real that people who have this can't imagine how it would be to be otherwise. I mean, I saw this. I am - when the composer, Michael Torke came to visit me, he told me that when he was 5, he said to his piano teacher, I love that blue piece. His piano teacher\u2026 FLATOW: Oh, really? Dr. SACKS: \u2026said, blue? And he said, yeah, D major, blue. And his piano teacher shook his head and said, well, not for me. You know, Michael says that 40 years later, he still remembers the shock of finding that someone didn't have it. Ten years later, he met a - as a teenager, he met someone else who saw colors with keys, but the colors weren't the same as his. FLATOW: Right. Oh, that's funny. We're talking with Oliver Sacks this hour, author of \"Musicophilia: Tales of Music and Brain,\" out this month, on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. Bring us up to date on Clive. When you were here two years ago, he first started telling us your interest in Clive and his amnesia. Tell us - remind us who he is and what happened. Dr. SACKS: Okay. Well, yeah. Clive was really the beginning of the book. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. SACKS: Clive was a - is a gifted musician who had a catastrophic illness, an encephalitis, in 1985, and this caused him to lose his memory for events in his life. So within a few seconds, memory of things is lost and memory is deleted backwards, so that he's almost lost his - much of his autobiography. And he's in a sort of terrified, confused state for much of the time, because he doesn't recognize his surroundings. He feels he's just broken up from a death-like state. But his memory for music or rather his ability to sing, to perform on the piano or the organ, to conduct a choir, an entire choir or orchestra, is totally spared. I mean, he remains a marvelous musician at a professional level, although\u2026 FLATOW: Still? Dr. SACKS: Still. Although if you ask him, you know, do you know such and such a piece of music, he may not be able to - he'll say no, or he'll say he doesn't know it or he's never heard of Beethoven. But you start him on something, and it's all there, so basically that the performances and the procedure are all there. And they're all there because they utilize different forms of memory, forms of memory deep in the brain, in the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, and these are not affected by amnesia. And they're not affected by Alzheimer's either. FLATOW: So you're saying that Clive has a seven-second memory is I think\u2026 Dr. SACKS: Yes. Right. FLATOW: \u2026gone down or up, or is it still getting bigger? Dr. SACKS: It's - the latest thing was said to be\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Well, it doesn't really matter. Dr. SACKS: I mean, but it is a few seconds. FLATOW: Yeah. And the other - two fascinating things that you said is one is that he can - you can put him up in front of an orchestra, right, and he can conduct the whole orchestra. Dr. SACKS: Yeah. FLATOW: Does he remember having done that when he's finished? Dr. SACKS: No. No. No. Seven seconds later, he will - yeah. And if you ask him to start again, he would do it again without any memory that he did it before. FLATOW: And also, he had an unusual relationship about remembering his wife\u2026 Dr. SACKS: Yeah. FLATOW: \u2026right? Dr. SACKS: The two of them got married. They were very passionately in love. She's a singer as well, as well as a very good writer. She's written a beautiful book about him. They got married a couple of months before this. And emotional memory, and especially his love for her, again, seems all there. But each time he sees her, he greets her as if almost as if he's seeing her for the first time, and with a gospel of relief as if she's been away forever, even though she might been away for 10 seconds. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255, talking with Oliver Sacks, author of \"Musicophilia. \" What does that mean, \"Musicophilia\"? Dr. SACKS: At least, love of music. FLATOW: Comes from? The philia part. Dr. SACKS: The philia part, the love part, yeah. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Were you always in love with music? Dr. SACKS: I think so, yes. FLATOW: So you were - you said you're a pretty good musician. Dr. SACKS: Well, no, I don't say that. But I was brought up in a sort of musical household, and music brought the family together. And I loved it, and I love almost all music, with one or two exceptions. FLATOW: So you're really writing about something you love, is it now? Dr. SACKS: Yeah. FLATOW: That's the best part of writing. Dr. SACKS: Yeah. I'm always writing about something I love. FLATOW: We're talking with Oliver Sacks this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. We're going to go take a break now and come back and talk lots more with him. Maybe, you have a reminiscence of a musical event that's been there in your mind or you have something you'd like to share us. Give us a call: 1-800-989-8255, or go to \"Second Life,\" where lots of folks were asking questions in Science City, so - Science School is the spot where you want to be. Stay with us. We'll be right back. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Oliver Sacks, author of \"Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain,\" a really excellent book and is also - a lot of fun to read and, you know, Dr. Sacks is such a great writer. What is it about the brain that it can survive all these injuries that happen to it, but the music is still there? Dr. SACKS: Well, it's because so many different parts of the brain are recruited for listening to music and remembering music. And some of them may get damaged, but others are still there. But also, the brain is very plastic. And if one part gets damaged, other parts can take over. You see this with many things. FLATOW: But to me, it's a recording in there. It's not that simple. I mean, if the recording part gets damaged - if put a whole in my, you know, LP, that's going to be a skip in that spot. You're saying that it's not so simple that other parts may be able to fill that in. Dr. SACKS: Yeah, though I think it's not like a phonograph or, you know, I think that the pitch, the rhythm and all songs, all songs are put in separately, and absolutely one - you may miss one part, but others will fill in. FLATOW: Isn't that amazing that we - that so much of the brain is involved in music that is not, you know? Dr. SACKS: Well, you know, one would like to ask Steven Pinker, who feels that music is used less and, you know, why this should be so. I mean, I think the question has to be put, why are we so musical if music is of no utility. FLATOW: How much research is actually going on in studying music and the brain? Not very much, I would imagine? Dr. SACKS: Well, until a few years ago, not very much. I know I used to look at physiology books and neuroscience books and I didn't find it. But now, a lot is going on, at least in certain places, in Harvard and especially in Montreal. Montreal is the sort of the music neuroscience center of the world, in the heart of the West. FLATOW: Harvard heard, yeah? Dr. SACKS: Yeah. FLATOW: Yeah. So what's the frontier? What's the frontier of understanding, the cutting edge, so to speak? Dr. SACKS: Well, almost all the scientists interested in music are musicians themselves and so they know it from the inside as well as investigating from the outside, which is very, very, unusual. And so they're really looking at every aspect of music. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So you have to be a musician to really study it better? Dr. SACKS: You don't have to be, but it's nice if you are, because they deal both, as I say, both sides - inside and outside. FLATOW: All right. I'm going to give you the blank check question I give sometimes, Dr. Sacks. Now, don't be afraid. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: That is if I gave you a blank check and you could write any amount of money in it and perform any task or create some sort of research, what would you do with it? Dr. SACKS: Well, I'm very excited now by music, and I would like to see sort of music research hugely funded. FLATOW: Okay. Now, tell me where you would focus. You know, I'm now the executive committee, giving you this money, and I want you to fill out the proposal. What part of the brain or what - what are you going to hone in on that you would like to know? Dr. SACKS: I think one would like to know what musical training can do, not only for the musical parts of the brain but for other parts of the brain. This has been a sort of a hot topic. You know, people talked about the Mozart effect, but a little Mozart under the pillow doesn't do anything. That it looks as if musical training may not only increase one's musicality, but have bonuses in other cognitive areas. FLATOW: Such as, you know, it tweaks up other parts of the brain? Dr. SACKS: One's reading abilities as a child, one's abilities to recall, some of one's logical abilities; some of one's mathematical abilities, supposedly, are increased. FLATOW: So if we do our homework by music, listening to music, is that better or worst? Dr. SACKS: It depends. I mean\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. SACKS: \u2026some of us can't bear a musical background and have to listen. I think other people sort of do better. Nietzsche used to concerts with his notebook and he would\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. SACKS: \u2026say (unintelligible) makes me a better philosopher. So I would actually divide them on and I would put half into the early part of life, but the other half, I think, into music therapy of all sorts to try and validate it, because it's either disregarded now or overhyped. And one needs to carefully investigate it and define both its powers and its limitations. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Do we know how music forms the synapses and, you know, the wiring in the brain. Is that clear at all? Dr. SACKS: Well, we, I mean, this is part of the general problem of learning\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. SACKS: \u2026and we know roughly, but we really don't have the instruments to look down at that level, although actually one worker in Boston has shown, you know, looking at the synaptic level, have shown changes with five-finger exercises even in a few minutes. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. I'm talking with Oliver Sacks, author of \"Musicophilia. \" 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Where do you - so, where are you going to go from here? You've finished this book. You have another interest, (unintelligible). Dr. SACKS: I do, and it's - the next book is going to be a visual book. And one of the subjects will be the visual hallucinations associated with visual impairment, which I think are very similar to the musical ones associated with deafness. FLATOW: Because you wrote a book about vision with the blind people. I\u2026 Dr. SACKS: Well, I keep coming back. But I'm not finished with the subject. FLATOW: Isn't it - I mean, the brain is like the final frontier, isn't it? Dr. SACKS: Right, and that a huge amount of the brain is devoted to vision, as a huge amount is devoted to music. FLATOW: As much, do you think? Dr. SACKS: I think probably so, yes. FLATOW: Well, I'm - we had you on two years ago, when you started on this quest about music. Now, you're telling us about vision. I want you to reserve the holiday season. You always come back on a holiday season to talk about your next book. So I want to thank you very much. Dr. SACKS: Okay. Thanks, and I hope I could do that. FLATOW: So do I. Oliver Sacks, author of \"Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain,\" a terrific, interesting - make a great gift for this holiday season. Stay with us, we're going to switch gears and come back and talk about the robotic care race. We'll be right back.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  We're all wired for music, according to my next guest. Think about your own experiences with music and, you know, you'll see what he means. From the earliest songs you remembered to the music of your teenage years, you know, music can bring back those memories just hearing a little bit of a song, to the tunes you play today to get you through a workout or a tough time, or the music that helps you celebrate or worship or dance. We each have a soundtrack for our lives, and you don't have to be able to make music or even understand it in an educated way to appreciate it.  In his new book, \"Musicophilia,\" Oliver Sacks says that for all of us, our auditory systems, our nervous systems are exquisitely tuned for music. He's here with us today to make that case and to talk about what happens when the wiring goes bad, when we lose the power to perceive music.  Can't get it out of our heads, you know? How did that happened? You know, you hear it when it isn't really there. Sometimes, some people see music in full color. We're also going to talk about the healing power of music. How it can reach people with a wide array of neurological disorders from amnesia to epilepsy to Alzheimer's, when little or nothing else can get through to them.  So if you'd like to talk about music with Dr. Sacks, our number is 1-800-989\u2014 8255, 1-800-989-TALK. You can surf over to our Web site at sciencefriday. com and meet some avatars wearing SCIENCE FRIDAY T-shirts over in \"Second Life\" in Science School, so a lot of different ways to interact with us.  Let me formally introduce Dr. Sacks. He's a neurologist and author. His most recent book is \"Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain\" is just out. His other books include \"An Anthropologist on Mars: The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,\" and \"Awakening. \" You're familiar with him. He's professor of clinical neurology and clinical psychology at Columbia University Medical Center and a Columbia University artist in New York. He joins us here in our NPR's studios.  Welcome back to program.  Dr. OLIVER SACKS (Author, \"Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain\"): It's nice to be here again.  FLATOW: You know, they created a special title for you up there in Columbia, didn't they?  Dr. SACKS: It seems so, yeah.  FLATOW: You were allowed to do anything you want to now.  Dr. SACKS: Well, not entirely, but I'll certainly commute between the two campuses and be a sort of in-between figure between medicine and art.  FLATOW: What are some the things you like to do most there? Tell me.  Dr. SACKS: Well, I'm - the things I like to do most are to see patients, which I was doing this morning, and to write about them, and to talk about them, and to think about them.  FLATOW: Now, you talk about a lot of your patients in this book, and some of them, well, they all have to do with music. What made you decide to go on this music bender, if I may put\u2026  Dr. SACKS: Well, I mean, apart from sort of personal involvement with music as a physician back in the 1960s, when I saw the patients I later wrote about in \"Awakenings\" deeply in Parkinsonian patients who couldn't move or speak unless there was music, this was my first glimpse of the therapeutic power of music. And, subsequently, I saw that in many other conditions, although, often different sorts of music working in different ways. And I've also been consulted over the years by people with various musical problems\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. SACKS: \u2026as you've mentioned, from not perceiving it to not being able to stop it or hallucinating it. But I think the final thing for me is the fact that on the last 10 years, basically, there's been an amazing technological advances so that the functional brain imagery we could can at the brain when people are listening to music, imagining music, composing music, and we have a much clearer idea now of what goes on than we did 10 years ago.  FLATOW: Well, I want to get in to all of that because it's also interesting. But let me start with the first - one of the major points that you make in your book is that our brains are wired for music the same way we're wired for language.  Dr. SACKS: Well, and even more extensively, there's no particular music center but there are many different parts of the brain, many networks, many systems -in the auditory parts of the brain, the visual parts, the executive parts, the motor parts - and there are like 20 or 30 different parts of the brain which are recruited for musical experience and performance. And this is much wider than for speech, which is the reason why if people lose language in aphasia, they still have music available.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And you quote Steven Pinker in the foreword of your book, in the preface saying, you know, there's really no biological reason for we, as an animal, to be so - have music such an integral part of ourselves. Would you agree with that?  Dr. SACKS: No, I think, I disagree rather strongly, although, really, one can only speculate. But music occurs and is central in every culture we know of, we have known of. There are musical instruments which go back 50,000 years - bone flutes, which have much the same tonal intervals as we have now. We have things like - something which is exclusively human and doesn't have an analog, and speech is our movement synchronized with beat, with rhythm. One sees every child spontaneously starts to dance\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. SACKS: \u2026or to keep time. You don't see this in a chimpanzee. This seems to be an exclusively human thing. And it wouldn't have been preserved - I mean, to invert the argument - if it hadn't been useful. I mean, Darwin thinks of music in terms of courtship he felt was - had a strong evolutionary sexual selection. I also wonder about a cultural selection because music is so powerful for bonding people together.  FLATOW: Right. You say it's not only what - that we appreciate music on an emotional level, but that we have a, quote, \"largely unconscious structural appreciation of music. \" What do you mean by that?  Dr. SACKS: Well, with experience as with language, I think, as it were the grammar of music or particular music, the rules, the laws, the way it is going, come to one, and so much of listening to music is anticipation. And one can whistle along sometimes with a piece one has never heard. You were almost composing it with the composer. He's hinting all the while as to where it's going. And if one gets a sudden sense of shock or dissonance that there's a surprise.  FLATOW: You say - you talked about having a musician's brain. Are the brains of musicians really different than the brains of non-musicians?  Dr. SACKS: Well, everyone's brains are different, but the brains of musicians are grossly different. A man called Schlaug, Gottfried Schlaug at Harvard have shown that various structures in the brain, the corpus callosum, big band between the hemisphere's auditory cortex, motor cortex, visual cortex are all visibly enlarged or so visibly enlarged in musicians that you could look at a brain and say, I think that's a musician's brain, but you couldn't say it's a mathematician's brain or an artist's brain.  FLATOW: So which came first: that the brain shape make you a musician or that being a musician changed the shape of your brain?  Dr. SACKS: Well, it's probably not a neither/or, but we do know that a lot of training, like the Suzuki method, can make a lot of difference in a year. On the other hand, it's obvious that, you know, the Mozarts of this world are born as well as made.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let's talk about some of the patients and some of your own experiences with music. And I think - let's start with a thing that all of us have experienced. It's that tune you get into your head, and when you hear it, you could have it - you were talking about people having it for days, weeks, months.  Dr. SACKS: Yeah.  FLATOW: The brain worm, is that what you call it?  Dr. SACKS: Well, the music industry originally called it an earworm. I somehow like the term of a brain worm, which I imagined it boring into the brain, and certainly it goes round and round in the brain. I mean, I think, all of us have a sort of involuntary tunes, which go through the head in which often pleasant and sometimes and usually associated with thoughts or moods.  With a brain worm, this has gone wrong. And you will have a fragment of tune which gets into a loop and goes and round and round and loses all sense, all connection. And it's very difficult to stop sometimes.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. It just had to go away on its own or\u2026  Dr. SACKS: Yes, I\u2026  FLATOW: Can you talk yourself out of it?  Dr. SACKS: Some people can or they will sing it through to the end or they will sort of slap cold water on their face or jump up and down, but sometimes, you just have to wait for it to go away.  FLATOW: Is there one that's, you know, should we start one now?  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: If you got a tune, let's get everybody in our audience for the rest of the day tuning in their heads. The Sara Lee theme, you know?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. SACKS: Well, yeah. Well, actually, as you said that, I thought of da-da-da-da.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. SACKS: I\u2026  FLATOW: Beethoven's Fifth\u2026  Dr. SACKS: Just thought about a Beethoven rhyme.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: All right. We'll have the whole country on Beethoven. Let's talk about, you write about musical hallucinations. One of your patients talked about musical hallucination.  Dr. SACKS: Yeah. Well, a hallucination is quite different from imagery or brain worms. With a hallucination, you suddenly hear it as if it's for real. It's just like perception - indistinguishable. People are very startled. They look around and say, hey, you know, you heard that?  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. SACKS: They look for a radio or something, and only if they can't find an external source, they then realize that something unprecedented is happening in their brain or their mind. And they're often very scared because it's just unprecedented, it's uncontrollable, and people say\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. SACKS: \u2026you know, hearing things, am I crazy?  In fact, this is not at all like hearing voices. It's not at all like a psychotic hallucination. It tends mostly to occur, not exclusively, mostly in people who are pretty deaf. And it's as if when the hearing parts of the brain aren't getting their usual input, their usual nourishment, then they dig down into memory and they activate themselves. So usually, these hallucinations are usually of popular songs, hymns, whatever one has heard in early life.  FLATOW: I hear music and there's no one there\u2026  Dr. SACKS: Right.  FLATOW: \u2026a volume in that song. But you also talk about how when you recall music, some people just hear instruments, some people can hear a whole orchestra, and that you can recall it as if it were live. You know, live being played live. You talk about whether Beethoven or it was Bach who lost his hearing who would have gone nuts if he hadn't been able to do that.  Dr. SACKS: Yeah. Well, I mean, I would think most professional musicians, and especially conductors and composers, you know, could do that. And when Beethoven lost his hearing or became deaf, whatever - however wretched this made him in other ways, it certainly didn't disable him as a musician. In fact, it may even have heightened his musical imagery because deafness tends to heighten the sensitivity of the auditory parts of the brain.  FLATOW: And in some people you write about, it can be so strong that they swear there's the radio on or something like that.  Dr. SACKS: Yeah. Well, then there's a hallucination. But I don't think Beethoven hallucinated. I think there may be a sort of continuum between image and hallucination, but they're pretty different.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're talking with the incomparable Oliver Sacks, author of \"Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain\" just out in hardcover, and I know it has a cover that you hate on, that you hate looking at your own picture, right?  Dr. SACKS: Well, you know - once is enough.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Fame is a heavy burden. Stay with us. We're going to come right back and take your phone calls, talking with Oliver Sacks about \"Musicophilia. \" We'll be right back.  Share with us your, you know, your musical recollections, things that drive you nutty, maybe some experiences of your own. 1-800-989-8255. We'll be right back.  I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking this hour with Oliver Sacks, who really needs no introduction. You know him from all his books in the past. His latest book is \"Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain\" out this year by Knopf.  Our number: 1-800-989-8255. Also, we're in \"Second Life. \" You can meet an avatar there and get to know and ask questions and send us a question here also via \"Second Life. \"  Let's talk about something that's really fascinating. And you talk about it in the book, and I really didn't know about it, that it existed until I read about it in the book. That's the orthopedic surgeon who was struck by a lightning and had suddenly an onset of musical interest that never he had before. He never had it before in his life.  Dr. SACKS: No. He was in his early 40s and really had very little interest in music, apparently not much talent, didn't have a piano in the house. But about three weeks after he'd been struck, which gave him a cardiac arrest, basically have killed him for a minute.  FLATOW: Had that out-of-body experience, the whole thing.  Dr. SACKS: Yeah, absolutely.  FLATOW: Yeah, yeah.  Dr. SACKS: And then he thought, you know, it's all over. But about three weeks later over the course of a weekend basically, he got transformed and he developed what you call as an insatiable passion for hearing piano music, then for playing piano music and then for composing piano music. And he acted on this straight away. He got a piano, he got a piano teacher. He continued to work as a surgeon, but he started getting up very early, and all his time was spent with music. He said his wife wasn't best pleased, and this has continued for 15 years.  FLATOW: Wow.  Dr. SACKS: There's really been a transformation and a slight mystical or exalted feeling which goes with it. He feels he may have been saved for the specific purpose of delivering this. He talks - he says he feels he tunes into heaven for his music.  FLATOW: Now, how do you as a scientist explain this?  Dr. SACKS: Well, I asked him and he said, as a doctor, I can't explain. I think it's spiritual. And I said, well, fine, but might not anything spiritual have to operate via the nervous system. So he says, okay. I would suspect there's been some activation or reorganization of structures around the temporal lobes of the brain, the right temporal lobes, which are especially concerned with musical patterns and sometimes with mystical or religious feelings. I think something happened there.  FLATOW: Hmm. You mentioned the tools we have today, the ability to actually image the brain as it's working in helping these things. Tell us how useful that is to you as someone studying music and neurology.  Dr. SACKS: Well, I think it would be useful here. Originally, he wasn't inclined to allow any sort of investigation, but he will allow it now, and I think we could actually watch his brain while music is coming to him. He'll say it comes from heaven, you know, I might say (unintelligible)\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. SACKS: \u2026heaven is in the temporal lobes, hell as well.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Well - either a music center in the brain or is it distributed?  Dr. SACKS: It's widely distributed\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. SACKS: \u2026but elaborate - the final synthesis and their emotional components probably especially have to do with temporal lobe and its connections.  FLATOW: If I'm listening to a song, I'm humming or - is it actually playing in my brain?  Dr. SACKS: Oh, it's absolutely playing in your brain. And even if you don't make any movement to keep time, the rhythm is playing in your brain, so there's - it's really a little internal performance.  FLATOW: Because we hear scientists talk about we create our own memories, you know, as if they're real, could we create our own music experiences as if they're real also?  Dr. SACKS: Well, this is what happens in a hallucination.  FLATOW: Yeah. It it's in the hallucination, yeah.  Dr. SACKS: But even a shorter that - whenever we visualize anything, the visual cortex gets active and imagination is very real and hallucination even more so.  FLATOW: Let's go to Janet(ph) in Tucson, Arizona.  Hi, Janet. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  JANET (Caller): Hello.  FLATOW: Hi, Janet. You got to turn your radio off.  JANET: Ira, it's off. I'm on my cell phone.  FLATOW: Hi. Go for it.  JANET: Okay. Well, I come from a real musical family. I'm actually related to Felix Mendelssohn. And our music is so much part of my life. I'm a vocalist. And my husband's son, my step-grandson is - cannot stand music in any form. It just freaks him out completely. And I was wondering if you'd ever heard anything like this. I mean, the kid is 7 years old, and he cannot stand any kind of music?  FLATOW: He writes - you write about that in your book.  Dr. SACKS: Well, not enough, you know? Quite a lot of people have been telling me about musicophobia\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. SACKS: \u2026and a hatred of music or - and I think I probably should have written more. I wonder what goes on in that 7-year-old. Is he averse to all music?  JANET: Yes, all music. He can't stand it. I'm wondering if it's a function of some form of autism because Asperger's runs in that side of the family.  Dr. SACKS: Does he recognize the music he dislikes?  JANET: He just doesn't like any kind of music at all.  Dr. SACKS: Okay.  JANET: If there's any kind of music at all, he can't stand it.  Dr. SACKS: Okay. Because there are some people with a rare disorder called amusia, and these people don't have pitch discrimination. They can't hit tones and semitones. They don't really hear music as such. They may just hear it as noise. One of my patients with this said it's like pots and pans being thrown around at the kitchen and this would certainly make one hates music.  FLATOW: But one of your patients had a cure, did she not, for this problem - who hated music? I thought - maybe I thought I read that in the book, you know?  Dr. SACKS: Well, this was another patient, a composer who had distortion of a somewhat deaf at the high-end.  FLATOW: Oh, I see.  Dr. SACKS: And with him, things got better. But, I mean, one needs to sort out what's going on with your boy.  FLATOW: Could he grow out of it? I mean\u2026  Dr. SACKS: Well, I hope he can grow out of it. He'll be helped out because, you know, there's a huge source of joy and, you know, one would say innocent joy in music.  FLATOW: Can a mother like Janet do anything - take her son\u2026  Dr. SACKS: Well, I think she needs to sort of find out what's happening and whether the audiologist will do this or the psychiatrist or the neurologist.  FLATOW: Good luck, Janet.  Dr. SACKS: Good luck.  JANET: Thank you very much.  Dr. SACKS: Right.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's go to - back to phones to Jane(ph) in Columbus.  Hi, Jane.  JANE (Caller): Hi. I wanted to mention - I don't have a question, but I do have a comment. I had a dear aunt lived with me. She was in her 90s\u2026  FLATOW: We lost her.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: We lost everybody on the phone. I saw her question, she said she had an aunt who lived with her in her 90s and she was getting Alzheimer's disease.  Dr. SACKS: She says - she was saying that?  FLATOW: And yes, she said it on the screener. And she was very close and - but she could still hear the music.  Dr. SACKS: Yeah. Well, however severe Alzheimer's is, the musical parts of the brain, the many networks are very robust and they tend to survive something like Alzheimer's so that even if someone can't understand language\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. SACKS: \u2026and stay out of it generally, they'll still recognize music, respond to it, join in and have their moods and their memories stimulated. Music is tremendously important, I think, for people with Alzheimer's.  FLATOW: Yeah. I had an aunt who had some sort of dementia before that we knew what these things were, you know, years ago\u2026  Dr. SACKS: Yeah.  FLATOW: \u2026gave the names. But as she regressed, she sort of regressed to being a teenager in her mind and she started singing arias. She was a world-class singer and she hadn't sung them in years and people love to just come listen to her sing.  Dr. SACKS: Oh, that's fascinating. I'd like to make that a footnote in the next edition.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Yeah, it was very funny. What are the - let's talk about some of the other kinds of patients. You've had a patient with extraordinary talent for music but severe deficits in other cognitive activities.  Dr. SACKS: Well, one sometimes see this in people with Williams syndrome, this is a rare congenital syndrome where people are often precocious and gifted in language and music, and they're very sociable but they're rather retarded in many other ways with low, low IQs.  FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah.  Dr. SACKS: They can't usually function independently. But people with Williams syndrome, all of them, 100 percent of them, are enraptured by music. They're almost helplessly delighted or anguished or overwhelmed by it. A lot of them are musically talented. All of them are enraptured, but the other thing is one can have a musical savant. These are usually people who have autism, and interestingly at least half of the musical savants are also blind. And blindness disposes to musicality as well.  FLATOW: The last time you were on our program a couple of years ago, we got into music therapy, and that to coin a phrase, it really struck a cord in a lot of our listeners. And I'm struck by the wide range of patients, people with an array of neurological conditions who can, as you talked about in your book, be reached by music.  Dr. SACKS: Yeah. Well, as I say, I first saw this with the Parkinsonian people who really have this motor problem, and for them, it's the rhythm which is important. The music doesn't have to be familiar or affect them in other ways.  For people with Alzheimer's, it needs to be a familiar song which has -especially which has associations and resonance and stirs memory and mood. For people who've lost language, people who have aphasia, may often find they can sing and get a lyric with that. I mean, this can delight them\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. SACKS: \u2026which shows that language is there, although it may be embedded in the song. And there are ways now - although it's a lot of work - of disembedding the language so they can reacquire it, sometimes with a different part of the brain with the right side of the brain. And one sees that people with Tourette's syndrome, with Huntington's chorea, with autism, with all sorts of conditions, can respond very powerfully to music.  FLATOW: I have a question here from \"Second Life,\" from Rosemerta. She says I have a soundtrack in my brain pretty much all the time, and I feel lost without it. But I have gotten the impression that not everyone has this experience of always having music in their heads. Dr. Sacks, do you have an opinion on that?  Dr. SACKS: Well, I think this lady probably has it to an unusual extent. I have a cousin, a composer, who once said he had a 24 hour classical Muzak in his mind. I don't know whether this lady is herself a musician. But I think most people get tunes intermittently in the mind, which are not consciously summoned but which usually have some sort of association with their thoughts.  I think all of us have a sort of - many of us have a sort of musical companionship throughout our life.  FLATOW: When we hear music that is calming and soothing and revokes - evokes, you know, maybe the day you were out on the beach or something, are there actual runner's high, like, are their endorphins that are released? Is there sort of real feeling, you know? Is there a brain chemistry going on that created that soothing, you think?  Dr. SACKS: Yes. There's quite a lot of work on this and, you know, both the physiology of thrills and chills, but also of calming music. You can investigate it electrically by doing EEGs or by brain imaging, or by looking at some of the chemicals. I mean, the changes are very real, and David(ph) what he was doing with so\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to the phones, to Dan in Toledo. Hi, Dan.  DAN (Caller): Hi.  FLATOW: Hi, there.  DAN: Thank you. I had heard that Hendrix was one of these people that had optical and audio nerves crossed, so he\u2026  FLATOW: Whoops - can you see the music, I think, what he was going to talk about. There are other people who see colors and things like that.  Dr. SACKS: Okay. Well, quite a number of people have some crossing of the senses, as this man puts it, in which they will involuntarily and automatically have see things, smells things, taste things as they hear them or vice versa. One of the commonest is to see colors with music, and this is not just a metaphor. It's not just a poetic association. This is totally real, so real that people who have this can't imagine how it would be to be otherwise.  I mean, I saw this. I am - when the composer, Michael Torke came to visit me, he told me that when he was 5, he said to his piano teacher, I love that blue piece. His piano teacher\u2026  FLATOW: Oh, really?  Dr. SACKS: \u2026said, blue? And he said, yeah, D major, blue. And his piano teacher shook his head and said, well, not for me. You know, Michael says that 40 years later, he still remembers the shock of finding that someone didn't have it. Ten years later, he met a - as a teenager, he met someone else who saw colors with keys, but the colors weren't the same as his.  FLATOW: Right. Oh, that's funny. We're talking with Oliver Sacks this hour, author of \"Musicophilia: Tales of Music and Brain,\" out this month, on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow.  Bring us up to date on Clive. When you were here two years ago, he first started telling us your interest in Clive and his amnesia. Tell us - remind us who he is and what happened.  Dr. SACKS: Okay. Well, yeah. Clive was really the beginning of the book.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. SACKS: Clive was a - is a gifted musician who had a catastrophic illness, an encephalitis, in 1985, and this caused him to lose his memory for events in his life. So within a few seconds, memory of things is lost and memory is deleted backwards, so that he's almost lost his - much of his autobiography. And he's in a sort of terrified, confused state for much of the time, because he doesn't recognize his surroundings. He feels he's just broken up from a death-like state. But his memory for music or rather his ability to sing, to perform on the piano or the organ, to conduct a choir, an entire choir or orchestra, is totally spared.  I mean, he remains a marvelous musician at a professional level, although\u2026  FLATOW: Still?  Dr. SACKS: Still. Although if you ask him, you know, do you know such and such a piece of music, he may not be able to - he'll say no, or he'll say he doesn't know it or he's never heard of Beethoven. But you start him on something, and it's all there, so basically that the performances and the procedure are all there. And they're all there because they utilize different forms of memory, forms of memory deep in the brain, in the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, and these are not affected by amnesia. And they're not affected by Alzheimer's either.  FLATOW: So you're saying that Clive has a seven-second memory is I think\u2026  Dr. SACKS: Yes. Right.  FLATOW: \u2026gone down or up, or is it still getting bigger?  Dr. SACKS: It's - the latest thing was said to be\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah. Well, it doesn't really matter.  Dr. SACKS: I mean, but it is a few seconds.  FLATOW: Yeah. And the other - two fascinating things that you said is one is that he can - you can put him up in front of an orchestra, right, and he can conduct the whole orchestra.  Dr. SACKS: Yeah.  FLATOW: Does he remember having done that when he's finished?  Dr. SACKS: No. No. No. Seven seconds later, he will - yeah. And if you ask him to start again, he would do it again without any memory that he did it before.  FLATOW: And also, he had an unusual relationship about remembering his wife\u2026  Dr. SACKS: Yeah.  FLATOW: \u2026right?  Dr. SACKS: The two of them got married. They were very passionately in love. She's a singer as well, as well as a very good writer. She's written a beautiful book about him. They got married a couple of months before this. And emotional memory, and especially his love for her, again, seems all there. But each time he sees her, he greets her as if almost as if he's seeing her for the first time, and with a gospel of relief as if she's been away forever, even though she might been away for 10 seconds.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255, talking with Oliver Sacks, author of \"Musicophilia. \" What does that mean, \"Musicophilia\"?  Dr. SACKS: At least, love of music.  FLATOW: Comes from? The philia part.  Dr. SACKS: The philia part, the love part, yeah.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Were you always in love with music?  Dr. SACKS: I think so, yes.  FLATOW: So you were - you said you're a pretty good musician.  Dr. SACKS: Well, no, I don't say that. But I was brought up in a sort of musical household, and music brought the family together. And I loved it, and I love almost all music, with one or two exceptions.  FLATOW: So you're really writing about something you love, is it now?  Dr. SACKS: Yeah.  FLATOW: That's the best part of writing.  Dr. SACKS: Yeah. I'm always writing about something I love.  FLATOW: We're talking with Oliver Sacks this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. We're going to go take a break now and come back and talk lots more with him. Maybe, you have a reminiscence of a musical event that's been there in your mind or you have something you'd like to share us. Give us a call: 1-800-989-8255, or go to \"Second Life,\" where lots of folks were asking questions in Science City, so - Science School is the spot where you want to be. Stay with us. We'll be right back.  I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Oliver Sacks, author of \"Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain,\" a really excellent book and is also - a lot of fun to read and, you know, Dr. Sacks is such a great writer.  What is it about the brain that it can survive all these injuries that happen to it, but the music is still there?  Dr. SACKS: Well, it's because so many different parts of the brain are recruited for listening to music and remembering music. And some of them may get damaged, but others are still there. But also, the brain is very plastic. And if one part gets damaged, other parts can take over. You see this with many things.  FLATOW: But to me, it's a recording in there. It's not that simple. I mean, if the recording part gets damaged - if put a whole in my, you know, LP, that's going to be a skip in that spot. You're saying that it's not so simple that other parts may be able to fill that in.  Dr. SACKS: Yeah, though I think it's not like a phonograph or, you know, I think that the pitch, the rhythm and all songs, all songs are put in separately, and absolutely one - you may miss one part, but others will fill in.  FLATOW: Isn't that amazing that we - that so much of the brain is involved in music that is not, you know?  Dr. SACKS: Well, you know, one would like to ask Steven Pinker, who feels that music is used less and, you know, why this should be so. I mean, I think the question has to be put, why are we so musical if music is of no utility.  FLATOW: How much research is actually going on in studying music and the brain? Not very much, I would imagine?  Dr. SACKS: Well, until a few years ago, not very much. I know I used to look at physiology books and neuroscience books and I didn't find it. But now, a lot is going on, at least in certain places, in Harvard and especially in Montreal. Montreal is the sort of the music neuroscience center of the world, in the heart of the West.  FLATOW: Harvard heard, yeah?  Dr. SACKS: Yeah.  FLATOW: Yeah. So what's the frontier? What's the frontier of understanding, the cutting edge, so to speak?  Dr. SACKS: Well, almost all the scientists interested in music are musicians themselves and so they know it from the inside as well as investigating from the outside, which is very, very, unusual. And so they're really looking at every aspect of music.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So you have to be a musician to really study it better?  Dr. SACKS: You don't have to be, but it's nice if you are, because they deal both, as I say, both sides - inside and outside.  FLATOW: All right. I'm going to give you the blank check question I give sometimes, Dr. Sacks. Now, don't be afraid.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: That is if I gave you a blank check and you could write any amount of money in it and perform any task or create some sort of research, what would you do with it?  Dr. SACKS: Well, I'm very excited now by music, and I would like to see sort of music research hugely funded.  FLATOW: Okay. Now, tell me where you would focus. You know, I'm now the executive committee, giving you this money, and I want you to fill out the proposal. What part of the brain or what - what are you going to hone in on that you would like to know?  Dr. SACKS: I think one would like to know what musical training can do, not only for the musical parts of the brain but for other parts of the brain.  This has been a sort of a hot topic. You know, people talked about the Mozart effect, but a little Mozart under the pillow doesn't do anything. That it looks as if musical training may not only increase one's musicality, but have bonuses in other cognitive areas.  FLATOW: Such as, you know, it tweaks up other parts of the brain?  Dr. SACKS: One's reading abilities as a child, one's abilities to recall, some of one's logical abilities; some of one's mathematical abilities, supposedly, are increased.  FLATOW: So if we do our homework by music, listening to music, is that better or worst?  Dr. SACKS: It depends. I mean\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. SACKS: \u2026some of us can't bear a musical background and have to listen. I think other people sort of do better. Nietzsche used to concerts with his notebook and he would\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. SACKS: \u2026say (unintelligible) makes me a better philosopher. So I would actually divide them on and I would put half into the early part of life, but the other half, I think, into music therapy of all sorts to try and validate it, because it's either disregarded now or overhyped. And one needs to carefully investigate it and define both its powers and its limitations.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Do we know how music forms the synapses and, you know, the wiring in the brain. Is that clear at all?  Dr. SACKS: Well, we, I mean, this is part of the general problem of learning\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. SACKS: \u2026and we know roughly, but we really don't have the instruments to look down at that level, although actually one worker in Boston has shown, you know, looking at the synaptic level, have shown changes with five-finger exercises even in a few minutes.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. I'm talking with Oliver Sacks, author of \"Musicophilia. \" 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Where do you - so, where are you going to go from here? You've finished this book. You have another interest, (unintelligible).  Dr. SACKS: I do, and it's - the next book is going to be a visual book. And one of the subjects will be the visual hallucinations associated with visual impairment, which I think are very similar to the musical ones associated with deafness.  FLATOW: Because you wrote a book about vision with the blind people. I\u2026  Dr. SACKS: Well, I keep coming back. But I'm not finished with the subject.  FLATOW: Isn't it - I mean, the brain is like the final frontier, isn't it?  Dr. SACKS: Right, and that a huge amount of the brain is devoted to vision, as a huge amount is devoted to music.  FLATOW: As much, do you think?  Dr. SACKS: I think probably so, yes.  FLATOW: Well, I'm - we had you on two years ago, when you started on this quest about music. Now, you're telling us about vision. I want you to reserve the holiday season. You always come back on a holiday season to talk about your next book. So I want to thank you very much.  Dr. SACKS: Okay. Thanks, and I hope I could do that.  FLATOW: So do I. Oliver Sacks, author of \"Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain,\" a terrific, interesting - make a great gift for this holiday season. Stay with us, we're going to switch gears and come back and talk about the robotic care race. We'll be right back. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2007 NPR.

According to a new report in the journal Science this week, the volcano under Yellowstone - and you did know there was a volcano under Yellowstone, did you not, the giant caldera - it is rising. Now, don't panic. Scientists say there is no evidence that the volcano is going to erupt anytime soon. But they have documented some recent changes. And joining me now to talk about the super volcano is my guest, Jake Lowenstern who is a scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. He's research geologist at the U. S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Dr. JAKE LOWENSTERN (Scientist-In-Charge, Yellowstone Volcano Observatory; Research Geologist, U. S. Geological Survey): Hi, nice to be here. FLATOW: Are people surprised to hear that there are volcanoes - there's a volcano under Yellowstone? Dr. LOWENSTERN: Many people are. It's not - doesn't look like a typical volcano, so some people are taken by surprise. FLATOW: What do you mean it's not a typical volcano? Dr. LOWENSTERN: Well, most people think of the strato-cones, the kinds of volcanoes we have on the West Coast in Oregon and Washington - nice, conical features. Those are what you call constructional features where everything's build up by the eruption of lava and ash and makes a constructional feature. But calderas are destructional features. They are what happens when the ground collapses when you remove a lot of underground magma and put it out into the atmosphere. FLATOW: So tell us why we - we're not worrying people today, knowing there's a volcano under there. Dr. LOWENSTERN: Well, the main reason is that we know from a variety of studies over the past 70 years or so, plus geologic evidence, that Yellowstone in particular and many calderas around the world do this kind of up and down. They - between 1920s and 1970s, Yellowstone rose about 80 centimeters, a couple of feet. And the lake was tilted and it drowned some shorelines to the south. And so this is a kind of behavior that goes on and the volcano can also go down with time and that's also been noted over the last 20 years. So the volcano is a very active system, very dynamic, very fascinating to look at. FLATOW: And so why - and so that accounts, I guess, for why there's all that hot water and stuff. Dr. LOWENSTERN: Sure. Yellowstone - underneath Yellowstone, at a depth of five, six, seven miles is a big magma chamber of partially molten rock. And there's - it's a kind of a mush down there of crystals and molten material. And a lot of heat comes off of that. It's one of the biggest heat anomalies on Earth in terms of heat that's rising off this deep magma system. And when that heat gets intercepted by the groundwater system, it causes that water to boil and that's why you get the geysers and hot springs and the mud pots of Yellowstone. FLATOW: What do you learn? Why is there an observatory - a volcano observatory there? Dr. LOWENSTERN: Hello? FLATOW: Can you hear me? Dr. LOWENSTERN: Hello? FLATOW: Hi there. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Dr. LOWENSTERN: Hello? FLATOW: Hi. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: We're having\u2026 Dr. LOWENSTERN: Hello? FLATOW: We're trying to reach Jake Lowenstern. Dr. LOWENSTERN: I don't seem to hear anybody. FLATOW: Oh, well let's see if we redial him back, just like they say in the movies, what we have here is a - have a failure to communicate. Let's see if any of our phones are working. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're talking about Yellowstone National Park. If you'd like to give us a call and talk about it, maybe you've been there, maybe you've wondered what's going on below the surface. Dr. Lowenstern was saying that the magma is there - it rises, it falls, but it's not in any - don't worry it's not in any jeopardy of erupting. In fact, if I read it correctly, their - the last big eruption - let me look this up a little bit, the last big eruption was over 600,000 years ago. So you really don't have to worry that if you go to Yellowstone that you're going to have a huge eruption there. I think we have him back. Dr. Lowenstern, are you there? Dr. LOWENSTERN: I am. FLATOW: I don't know what the - the ether is doing to our phone connection this week. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: I was asking you, so you have an observatory there to watch the - watch what's going on? Dr. LOWENSTERN: Right. The U. S. Geos runs five volcano observatories around the country. And we have one at Yellowstone. It's a partnership with the National Park and the University of Utah. FLATOW: Yeah. And how fast is this inflation working? Is it going slowly or is it moving very quickly? Dr. LOWENSTERN: Well, as far as we know, this is the fastest rate that has been measured at Yellowstone. So there's been about - I think it's about three inches a year, I think, is the uplift rate that has been measured over the past couple of years. And so we've only been able to really track this thing carefully for about the - for the past 15 years or so where we really can look on it on a day-to-day or year-to-year basis. And in that period of time, this is the fastest that's been observed at Yellowstone. FLATOW: So it doesn't worry you then that it's rising the fastest ever? Dr. LOWENSTERN: Well, we don't really see any of the other indications that would cause us to worry. We're not having a lot of earthquakes at Yellowstone. There's no explosion out of the geyser system, they aren't a lot those. And actually, when volcanoes erupt, sometimes they do have this kind of deformation, but it's usually a little bit faster than what we're seeing at Yellowstone, though we observed a range of behaviors. FLATOW: And what would happen if it did erupt? Dr. LOWENSTERN: Well, there's a whole range of things that could happen - ranging from small lava domes to large lava flows. Yellowstone have some very big ones. And then some of the largest eruptions we know of on Earth have occurred out of the Yellowstone system and other similar large calderas. And so there's a whole spectrum, the most common kind of eruption would be some sort of a lava flow that would have big effect within the park, not so big effect nationally. FLATOW: Anne(ph) in Walnut Creek, California. Hi, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. ANNE (Caller): Hi, Ira, I have admired your program for years. I would like to ask a serious question. And I'm not being antagonistic and I'm not trying to take anything away from your guest. This has been talked about for years, and is it that it reached the level like a tipping point or it got to - it was coming from people of more status, or has something changed? FLATOW: Good question. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. LOWENSTERN: Well, it wasn't until the late 1960s, early 1970s, when it was really understood through some careful work by one of my U. S. Geos colleagues in Menlo Park that this was happening at Yellowstone, that we had this, sort of alive volcanic system that had put out these enormous eruptions - several of them. And so first, that had to happen. And the geological community had to learn about it. And then it took a little while for some of the documentaries on television to get a hold of it. And so I'd say in the last 10 years, you know, it's become much more of a known story in the general community. FLATOW: Are you happy with the - what you've heard today, Anne? ANNE: Well, no. You know, as a resident of planet Earth, it makes me very nervous because I've come to the realization that there are a lot of stories that are under the surface or under the accepted approved surface\u2026 FLATOW: Good choice of words on this one. ANNE: Yeah. FLATOW: Under the surface, yes. We're talking about the volcanoes and the one in Yellowstone this hour. TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. You think they are hiding something, Anne? ANNE: Well, I - no, I think that there's too much fear in the scientific community and in the media to talk about stuff and consequently, we are being way under-informed. FLATOW: You think they were - they might be afraid to make us fearful about stuff. ANNE: No, I think that - well, that too, but I think mostly that people in the scientific community who are, quote, \"successful,\" unquote, are more fearful of losing their status than they are of informing us. FLATOW: Well, let's me ask Dr. Lowenstern about that. Dr. LOWENSTERN: Well, all I can say is that pretty much everything we do becomes public right away. And you can look at all of the data from the seismographs at Yellowstone, the ground-up list that's going, it's all online. I wish more people looked at it. I wish we got more press in talking about it. And I'm always delighted to talk about it because I think it's pretty fascinating. That's why I have a career doing this stuff. But, you know, if you don't get enough of it, I understand. FLATOW: Is there another place in the country like it at all? Dr. LOWENSTERN: Well, we have a Long Valley Caldera in California, the east side of the Sierra has very similar sorts of activity as what happens at Yellowstone. It doesn't have the thermal features and so people don't know it that way. But it's had recent eruptions even in the past 5, 600 years. So it's another one of these systems. There's one in Northern New Mexico that hasn't erupted for about 50,000 years - that's Jemez. And then there's the Taupo system in New Zealand, and all sorts of other systems around the world. FLATOW: The fact that this is a caldera, which is a collapsed sort of volcano, right? Dr. LOWENSTERN: Mm-hmm. FLATOW: Does that mean it might once have been high above the ground? It's a big volcano and collapsed down? Dr. LOWENSTERN: Well, in the case of Yellowstone, it was rocky mountain terrain. And there are a couple of different mountain ranges that probably ranged to up to 12,000 feet high or so and were essentially swallowed up during some of these big eruptions. So it was never a big cone like some of these volcanoes were\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. LOWENSTERN: \u2026but it - definitely, there was a lot of topography that's been removed. FLATOW: Now, what are you going to watch for? You're now watching this. What things are you going to be looking out for? Dr. LOWENSTERN: Well, we're always looking out for earthquakes and different kinds of earthquakes, ones that might be more volcanic-like than the typical rupturing of the ground that occurs in tectonic areas. And we're - well, we try to measure the temperatures and the amount of heat and gas that comes out of the Yellowstone system. And so we're trying to develop new ways to do that. And to put it all together so we can look at the - in all of the things that are happening at Yellowstone and try to see how they interact with each other. If magma comes in, how does it affect the ground deformation, how does it affect the earthquakes, how does it affect the fluids that come out of the ground. FLATOW: Right. Well, we're talking about it this week. So expect a few more visitors. Dr. LOWENSTERN: Okay. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Thank you. Get those airplanes out. Thanks for taking time to be with us, Jake. Dr. LOWENSTERN: Oh, my pleasure. Thank you. FLATOW: Jake Lowenstern is a scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory.

Dr. LOWENSTERN: Well, we're always looking out for earthquakes and different kinds of earthquakes, ones that might be more volcanic-like than the typical rupturing of the ground that occurs in tectonic areas. And we're - well, we try to measure the temperatures and the amount of heat and gas that comes out of the Yellowstone system. And so we're trying to develop new ways to do that. And to put it all together so we can look at the - in all of the things that are happening at Yellowstone and try to see how they interact with each other. If magma comes in, how does it affect the ground deformation, how does it affect the earthquakes, how does it affect the fluids that come out of the ground.  FLATOW: Right. Well, we're talking about it this week. So expect a few more visitors.  Dr. LOWENSTERN: Okay.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Thank you. Get those airplanes out. Thanks for taking time to be with us, Jake.  Dr. LOWENSTERN: Oh, my pleasure. Thank you.  FLATOW: Jake Lowenstern is a scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. He is a research geologist at the U. S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California.

I'm Farai Chideya. On yesterday's show, we explored controversial new research about how AIDS traveled to the United States. Today, news about what was a promising AIDS vaccine. Until recently, scientists had high hopes for a vaccine made by the pharmaceutical giant Merck. Then, researchers learned that some who got that vaccine still got the AIDS virus. The clinical trials have been halted, subjects are learning whether they were given the vaccine or a placebo, and scientists are trying to figure out what went wrong. Soon, we'll hear what this means for communities at high risk for AIDS. But first, we speak with NPR science correspondent Brenda Wilson. Brenda, welcome. BRENDA WILSON: Thank you. CHIDEYA: So, can you tell us more about the vaccine that was being tested? WILSON: Well, it had shown great promise in the laboratories. The vaccine was constructed of elements of the virus that had been disabled, so that in fact it could not cause HIV, and also included a cold virus at no - and it was combined. And when they injected blood cells in test tubes with this vaccine, you know, the blood cells attacked HIV. But it turned out that when they started testing them in humans as early as September, Merck said, okay, they called a halt because it was clear people were becoming infected, and people who got the vaccine, and people who got the placebo, of course. But people who got the vaccine were becoming infected. CHIDEYA: Were they becoming infected at higher rates than the placebo group? WILSON: Yes. I mean, that was what they subsequently found out when they - examined the data. It - in the Americas, where the trial has been underway since, I guess, 2004, they had up to 49 people who had gotten the vaccine, who became infected, compared to 33 people who got the placebo. And then, when you look at a subset of that, 21 people who got the vaccine had a high immunity to the cold virus, which was really, you know, raised a lot of questions. It was almost twice as many people who had a high immunity to the cold virus. CHIDEYA: That's significant because the cold virus was used as part of making the vaccine. Was that counterintuitive to the scientists? WILSON: Anything that they say is only speculative. They really don't know what may have happened. But one of the theories is that, perhaps, the vaccine stimulated the immune system in the wrong way. So, that by increasing the number of CD4 or helper cells, cells which attack foreign bodies when they enter the body, may have in fact provided targets for HIV, which made people much more susceptible to being infected. CHIDEYA: It's my understanding that none of the people in the South African group who participated in the test were told whether they got the vaccine or the placebo. WILSON: You're very seldom, in any sort of clinical experiment, told whether you got the medicine or not, because being told whether you got something can sometimes change the way you behave. People who think they got the vaccine, which is one of the questions they have to ask here in looking at the higher rates of infection - did people figure out in the Americas, as well as in South Africa that they have gotten the vaccine because, you know, when you got a vaccine, you can get really very sort(ph) spot. So, there is some, you know, it's possible that people speculated that they in fact got the vaccine and were safer, even though people in clinical experiments like this are counseled that there's no way of knowing that there are potential risks. But human nature, being what it is, people still - you know, you can never predict how people are going to behave. So, they're not told when they're given the medicine, and that's why you also have sort of a control group as well. CHIDEYA: So, how might this affect research around AIDS vaccines, even around prevention? WILSON: I think it's going to slow it down, but Dr. Anthony Fauci at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases says that it won't stop investigations of AIDS vaccines. There are some that are underway that will have to be, you know, stopped until they've determined what happened, and that could take a long time. But then, vaccines that do not use the cold virus, for example - it is possible that they can continue with those kinds of investigations. CHIDEYA: Well, Brenda, thanks so much. WILSON: Thank you.

She co-chaired the team conducting the AIDS vaccine test with Merck. Welcome, Susan. Dr. SUSAN BUCHBINDER (Co-chair, STEP Study): Thank you. CHIDEYA: So, your team worked with Merck to do the test. How did that work? Dr. BUCHBINDER: Well, we're part of a global network of investigators that's sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. It's the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. And the HVTN or this trial network joined together with Merck to test this HIV vaccine, to see if we could prevent HIV infection or hopefully control the infection if someone were later exposed to HIV. CHIDEYA: Now, you worked on the test affecting people in the Americas. Tell me a little bit about how long that went on in duration and who you targeted. Dr. BUCHBINDER: Sure. So, we first started enrolling study volunteers in December of 2004 and had completed enrollment this - earlier this year. We've enrolled 3,000 individuals in North and South America, and the Caribbean and Australia for this particular trial. And then earlier this year, we started a sister study in South Africa that was also slated to enroll 3,000 volunteers. CHIDEYA: The sister study in South Africa has gotten a lot of notice for the concept that people may be discouraged by this withdrawal of this vaccine. Do you think that this could have a psychological effect on people, either viewing medicine as - particularly clinical trials - as safe, or for their own self-protection to prevention? Dr. BUCHBINDER: So, what I think is very important is that we need all of the prevention tools we have available and we need to develop new tools to try to prevent new infections. There are about 11,000 new infections each and every day in the world, and we desperately need new prevention strategies for those populations who are most at risk. What we were really pleased about was that this was - this has been a global effort to try to find an effective HIV vaccine. And this specific study got us an answer, and a very important answer, to the question about whether this most promising vaccine might actually provide some protection. We were very disappointed that it didn't provide protection, but I think that people should be heartened by the fact that we had built in a number of safety measures in the trials, so that the data were being looked at quite regularly. And at our first look at the data to see whether or not protection was being provided, we found that the - there was no protection being provided, and so we stopped the vaccinations here in the United States and throughout the America, this part of the STEP study, but also in the sister trial Phambili that was taking place in South Africa. CHIDEYA: It wasn't just though that it wasn't affected, the infection rates were actually slightly higher among people who had gotten the vaccine. Were you surprised by that, and how do you react as a scientist to that? Dr. BUCHBINDER: Well, I think we were all surprised to see that the number of infections was somewhat higher in the vaccine group compared to the placebo group. And I first want to reiterate that the vaccine itself does not cause HIV infection. But what we're looking very closely at is whether or not this vaccine might be generating an immune response that makes people more susceptible to infection if they're later exposed. And we don't know the answer to that question yet. Again, we build in many safety measures within these studies to be monitoring number of infections in both groups. And we caught this trend at the earliest possible time that it could've been caught, and again, stopped additional vaccinations at that time, and are now exploring the three possible explanations for this increase in numbers. And the three possible explanations are that it may be due to the vaccine, it may be due to other differences between the vaccine and placebo groups that are completely unrelated to the vaccine, or it could be a chance event, because that the number of infections that we saw on either group was still relatively small and the follow-up is relatively short. CHIDEYA: So you say that the vaccine may, in one scenario, have increased susceptibility, but it doesn't cause AIDS. Explain the science behind that, why this vaccine could not cause AIDS? Dr. BUCHBINDER: Sure. So we don't use any whole or killed HIV in making the vaccine. The vaccine is actually using a carrier protein - it's a weakened cold virus. And in that - into that weakened cold virus, there is some information about HIV, but it's synthetic. It's not the whole virus. It's not pieces of the virus. There's no way that it can recombine to actually cause infection. And what we again saw was that there was somewhat increased number of infections in the vaccine group compared to the placebo group, but these were all in individuals who had had exposures to HIV through other practices, through sexual contact or drug use. CHIDEYA: Susan, when you think about this case, there is scientific reality and then there is historical reality - emotional reality. African-Americans have not always been on the kinder side of medicine - you have things like the Tuskegee syphilis experiments. And there is a perception that the medical establishment is not always going to look out for the interest of African-Americans or for people, in general, who were not privileged. Will this, regardless of what you've just told us, undermine your ability to get people for clinical trials? Dr. BUCHBINDER: Well, I think it's really important to acknowledge that medical science has not treated a number of vulnerable populations well previously. And that that's really been a travesty and really can't be allowed to happen again. I think we've been really encouraged by the support that we've gotten from communities that are most totally impacted by this epidemic in contributing in many ways to the design and conduct of the study and are relying on, again, very diverse input as we pour over the data and try to understand what this trial is telling us and how to move forward. So I would agree with you that I think that there has been - there've been real concerns about trust in the medical establishment. We've worked very closely with communities in designing, building and implementing these trials, and we will continue to work very closely with diverse communities because it's really critical that communities that are most heavily impacted by this epidemic be a fundamental core part of all of the trials that we design to try to build new prevention strategies because those are the communities that are going to be in great need of additional prevention strategies. CHIDEYA: Well, Susan, thank you so much. Dr. BUCHBINDER: Thank you very much.

Most people want to destroy cockroaches, but scientists want to understand them. Some researchers specifically wanted to find out more about how these creatures make group decisions. So they sent in the robo-roaches. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has the story. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: Cockroaches like to be with other cockroaches. Dr. JOSE HALLOY (Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium): Cockroaches are gregarious insects so they live in groups, and they don't have such sophisticated societies as ants or bees. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Jose Halloy is a scientist in Belgium who studies group decision-making in animals. He says cockroaches do make simple choices. They like to rest together. Put them in a habitat that has two identical little shelters, shadowed places where they can hang out, and here's what happens. Dr. HALLOY: They all gather together in the same shadow, below the same shelter. So there is a mechanism that makes the system choose one of the shelters. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That mechanism isn't one cockroach king decreeing this is our shelter. Instead, the group decision emerges from every individual following some simple rules. Halloy and his colleagues suspected the rules were this. Wander around randomly, but spend more time in a place. If you sense that it is, A, dark, and B, has other cockroaches. To test this theory, they built a robot cockroach. Dr. HALLOY: It doesn't look at all like a cockroach. It looks like an electronic matchbox because, in fact, it has to look like a cockroach from a cockroach's perspective. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Which means it has to smell like a cockroach. When the scientists coded the boxy robot with a chemical - a cockroach smell - the real roaches didn't run away. Dr. HALLOY: The cockroaches are not at all stressed by the robot because they are perceived as cockroaches. So the cockroach is just accepting that kind of strange buddy. And that's the start of the game. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The first part of the game was this. Make the robots follow those simple rules, look for dark, look for buddies. The robots had wheels plus a light sensor and an infrared sensor to see nearby roaches. Before long, the robots and the cockroaches were huddled together under the same roof. Dr. HALLOY: The robots and the cockroaches behave as a group. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So then Halloy and his colleagues said, okay, let's change one of the rules that the robots follow. Dr. HALLOY: It's their preference for darkness. We change the preference for darkness. We make the robots prefer lighter places than darker ones. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And they let the roaches and robots choose between two different shelters: one dark, one filled with light. When they did that, most of the time, they'd find the whole group in the brighter place, even though, normally, roaches would go for the darker one. Basically, the whole group made a bad cockroach decision, because just a few of its members were following a different program. Halloy and his colleagues have published their experiment in the journal Science. He says don't hold your breath for a robot roach that might lure your kitchen pests into a trap. Dr. HALLOY: The robot technology is very, very, very low compared to what the insects can do. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The robots can't climb up walls or wander through pipes. Still, even if it's not good pest control, other researchers say it's good science. Dr. IAIN COUZIN (Mathematical Biologist, Princeton University): I think it's a really fascinating idea to integrate robots within animal groups. In actual fact, I really feel that this is the future of doing this type of research. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Iain Couzin is a Princeton University professor who studies group decisions. He says scientists have simulated animal behavior with computer programs. Simple rules can produce virtual schools of fish or flocks of birds. But how do you know these made-up rules are really the ones that the animals use? Dr. COUZIN: There's a danger in that, you know, you create these rules and you get what appears to be the right phenomena, but there's no real way of testing that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says interactive robots could let scientists do those tests. Couzin wants to go to robots that would swim with the fishes. And Jose Halloy says he'd like to branch out from his work on cockroaches and create a robot chicken. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  Here are two words to make your blood run cold: robot cockroach. Most people want to destroy cockroaches, but scientists want to understand them. Some researchers specifically wanted to find out more about how these creatures make group decisions. So they sent in the robo-roaches.  NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has the story.  NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: Cockroaches like to be with other cockroaches.  Dr. JOSE HALLOY (Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium): Cockroaches are gregarious insects so they live in groups, and they don't have such sophisticated societies as ants or bees.  GREENFIELDBOYCE: Jose Halloy is a scientist in Belgium who studies group decision-making in animals. He says cockroaches do make simple choices. They like to rest together. Put them in a habitat that has two identical little shelters, shadowed places where they can hang out, and here's what happens.  Dr. HALLOY: They all gather together in the same shadow, below the same shelter. So there is a mechanism that makes the system choose one of the shelters.  GREENFIELDBOYCE: That mechanism isn't one cockroach king decreeing this is our shelter. Instead, the group decision emerges from every individual following some simple rules. Halloy and his colleagues suspected the rules were this. Wander around randomly, but spend more time in a place. If you sense that it is, A, dark, and B, has other cockroaches.  To test this theory, they built a robot cockroach.  Dr. HALLOY: It doesn't look at all like a cockroach.

And it may have helped cause the death of Donda West, the mother of rap star Kanye West. On Friday, the 58-year-old reportedly had cosmetic surgery. She died only hours after being released from the care of her surgeon, Dr. Jan Adams. The Los Angeles County Coroner's Office is looking into the cause of her death. Could this be a cautionary tale about the rising popularity of cosmetic surgery or is this an isolated case? For more, we've got Dr. Brian Evans. He had a team of surgeons at Cosmetic Physicians of Beverly Hills. Dr. Evans, welcome. Dr. BRIAN EVANS (Plastic Surgeon, Cosmetic Physicians of Beverly Hills): Welcome. Good morning. CHIDEYA: So at this point, we don't know for sure what caused Donda West's death, and I'm not going to ask you to try to figure out that case. But we do know she was in surgery for at least five and a half hours. Is that typical? Dr. EVANS: You know, every surgery has a different approach and the surgeon has a different plan. So it's really not fair to comment on this particular case whether or not this was typical or atypical without actually knowing all of the details surrounding the case and what the pre-operative plan was for the surgery. CHIDEYA: There has been a lot of discussion of whether or not she, in fact, ignored a conversation with another doctor about resolving some health issues before she went into surgery. How big of an issue was this? How sure should you be that you're in top physical shape or, at least, as much as you can be, before you go ahead with cosmetic surgery? Dr. EVANS: I think any surgery in general and in particular an elective surgery, it is absolutely imperative that, you know, a complete workup is performed. And, you know, at that time, you know, once the necessary lab values - EKG, chest x-ray, et cetera - are reviewed and then you and the patient can make an intelligent decision. You know, often as plastic surgeons, we are, at times, faced with a patient that may not tell you all of the information. So again, it's extremely critical that you spend a lot of face-to-face, one-on-one time and discuss in depth what the goals are and get a good feel for what the patient is interested in. CHIDEYA: Now, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, African-Americans had more than 783,000 cosmetic procedures last year. That's just seven percent of the total. But in the last three years, the number of African-Americans having plastic surgery went up more than 60 percent. Why do you think that there has been this movement towards African-Americans who haven't always been totally whole hot for cosmetic surgery, getting on the bandwagon? Dr. EVANS: Well, I think in general, there's been an increase in awareness for plastic surgery. Some of that, we can thank for for the TV shows. I mean, that has really brought plastic surgery to the forefront. And I think a lot of the fears have been addressed with that. And there's also a growing trend, especially in Southern California that people want to look their best and sometimes, they feel that some of these, you know, these goals can be achieved through plastic surgery. CHIDEYA: Just to be real, do people take this too lightly? A lot of people like, oh, you know, maybe I'll go ahead with this done and that done and then I'll be up and about in a couple of days. If you're talking about something like, say, a tummy tuck, that's not just like going and getting a pedicure, is it? Dr. EVANS: Absolutely. Plastic surgery is definitely something not to be taken lightly. It's a serious operation. It requires anesthesia. It requires a recovery period. And those are things that need to be discussed with your physician at the time during your initial consultation. CHIDEYA: If you go for a fairly major procedure or, you know, an invasive procedure like a tummy tuck, what can you expect afterwards in terms of your recovery? Dr. EVANS: Well, with any surgery, there's going to be some discomfort. And there is pain involved. And it's going to take a few days until you're back on your feet. CHIDEYA: Now, you actually provided us with a list of questions that a potential patient should ask when considering a cosmetic surgery. We posted the full list on our Web site, nprnewsandnotes. org. But I want to get you to elaborate on a few of these suggestions. Number one, is the doctor board-certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. Why is that important? Dr. EVANS: Being board-certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery requires that physicians go through a rigorous training and meets all of the criteria, so that they're at least, recognized in their specialty that they have received an adequate amount of training. CHIDEYA: Now, you had another one: What are the risks of the procedure? Asking that - it seems pretty obvious to ask, but do you trust that you'll get accurate answer? I mean, what makes you sure that you're going to get a good answer for the kind of procedure that you're having? And does the risk depend to a certain degree on your specific health issues? Dr. EVANS: Absolutely. There's several factors. I mean, clearly, if you have a lot of pre-existing conditions, that can impact your ultimate result with your surgery. So those things need to be discussed in detail. And it is the physician's obligation, you know, to really go over in detail as to whatever, what the risks are, what the benefits are and all of the potential complications. I personally feel that the more educated the patient is, the better decision that can be made with, you know, with whatever procedure they're interested in. CHIDEYA: You also have here, does the doctor have before and after pictures and any examples of complications that can occur. So you go in, you ask someone, well, what could be the downside. Is that important? Dr. EVANS: Absolutely. Reviewing before and after photos, both the good and the bad, or we, as plastic surgeons, we try to show, you know, the glamorous side of plastic surgery. And, you know, it is a surgical specialty and risk and complications and things can occur. Unfortunately, that is part of the practice. You know, we try to minimize that as much as possible, but, you know, I believe that it is important to share both the good and the bad so that we have a very realistic expectation. I think that it gives way to a much better doctor-patient relationship in the long run, when they clearly understand that this potentially, you know, adverse outcome may occur. CHIDEYA: Very briefly, you're on of few black plastic surgeons well known, do you worry about your own practice in light of this death? Dr. EVANS: I think in general, I think any time there's an unfortunate incident and it can affect the plastic surgery community as a whole. I don't think it affects one person individually anymore than the community as a whole. And I think it's important that we all try to practice safe medicine as we can. In whatever field, there are, you know, unfortunate incidents. CHIDEYA: Doctor Evans, thanks. Dr. EVANS: Thank you.

My next guest interviewed seven former presidential science advisers to find out what they thought about their term as scientist-in-chief. How has the job of science adviser changed over the years and from president to president? And joining me now more to talk about it is Roger Pielke Jr. He is the author of that Nature commentary, also of the book, \"The Honest Broker: Making Sense of Science in Policy and Politics. \" He's a former director of the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research, professor in the environmental studies program in the University of Colorado in Boulder. He joins us by phone. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Pielke. Dr. ROGER PIELKE (Author, \"The Honest Broker: Making Sense of Science in Policy and Politics;\" Environmental Studies Program Professor, University of Colorado Boulder): Thank you. Touched to be here. FLATOW: Well, thank you. Also with us is one of the science advisers Dr. Pielke interviewed: Neal Lane. He served under President Clinton. He's also a former director of the National Science Foundation. And he is the Malcolm Gillis University professor and senior fellow at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. And he joins us by phone from Houston. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Lane. Dr. NEAL LANE (Former Presidential Science Adviser; Professor and Senior Fellow, James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy, Rice University): Thank you, Ira. Very nice to be with you today. FLATOW: You're very welcome. How has, Dr. Pielke, do science advisers really make a difference in the administrations? Dr. PIELKE: The role of science adviser has taken on a lot of different forms since President Eisenhower first elevated the position from the Department of Defense up into the White House. And science advisers have had an enormous difference. Probably, most importantly in the thread that runs through science advice from the 1950s is its role that the office plays in the budgetary process. The science adviser is a key point for allocating resources and setting priorities, with the Office of Management and Budget, for how the country spends its finite research dollars. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Neal Lane, you agree? Dr. LANE: I agree. The role has changed considerably. And certainly, the formal partnership and the informal relation between OSTP and the science adviser and then the Office of Management and Budget is extremely important to the budget process for science technology activities throughout the government. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. We're talking about science advisers this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. The reason why I asked this is because a few years ago, I heard David Gergen give a talk at Cal Tech back in 1997 and he was an adviser, not the science adviser. He was a political adviser to four presidents - Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Clinton. And I want to play for you an edited excerpt of a speech that he gave in which it was pretty critical of how the White House did not put much weight on the input of science advisers - at least during the term that he was there - and how science advisers really did not vigorously advanced their opinions to the White House staff. So here's a little bit of what he had to say. (Soundbite of archived speech) Mr. DAVID GERGEN (Professor of Public Service and Director of the Center for Public Leadership, Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government; Editor-at-Large, U. S. News & World Report; Former Presidential Political Adviser): I have a hard time remembering memos that I thought were critical to the formation of policy. Well, there are a lot of legislative issues that come through a White House, and yet I must tell you, I don't think the science adviser - with some exception - is seen as a critical player in a lot of those issues. Yes, their advice goes through. The scientific advisory boards that the presidents have -they have wonderfully good people on them frequently, but they don't have sufficient impact inside the process. I have been to many morning meetings. Daily meetings in the White House start at 7:30 or whatever, and they'll be - the staff will be there, 25 or 30 people. And the science adviser will be there at that table. And that is the last time I see the science adviser that day. And as again the next morning at 7:30 or 8 o'clock, I see the science adviser. And I keep asking myself, why had we run the public business this way? You know, there are so many issues in which that science adviser ought to be there. FLATOW: And, John Marburger, is that your experience? And I had John Marburger on. Dr. JOHN MARBURGER (Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy): \u2026what meetings David Gergen was in, but he's certainly isn't in the same kinds of meetings I am. FLATOW: And there you have it, John Marburger had just become the science adviser. And I asked him if that reflected at the way he was. He saw his role as science adviser and what happened in the White House, and he said, as you've heard, he says that's not what happened while I was there. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Neal Lane, do you agree with Marburger? Or do you agree with David Gergen, who said they really didn't speak up very much and they didn't have much impact. Dr. LANE: No, you know, I have a high regard for David Gergen, but his comments were strange to me. Now, of course, I didn't see Gergen in the White House because I wasn't there at the same time. But after the morning staff meeting, at least my experience was that a good bit of the rest of my day on many days was spent on the West Wing. So they may be - may have been meetings with John Podesta, the chief of staff, or with the person who's running the Council on Environmental Quality, or Gene Sperling on economic issues or the vice president; meetings on budget, meetings on a number of issues, in my case, nanotechnology, and on another occasion, a meeting having to do with missile defense. So a good bit of my time, may be more than I would've liked, was taken up with meetings in the West Wing with senior people around the president and, of course, sometimes with the president. And obviously, that's a special occasion for all of us and we try to be on our best behavior and give our best advice at such time. So I don't, you know, David Gergen's comments don't resonate with me. FLATOW: Roger Pielke, did you find that they reflected what you found out from all the science advisers you interviewed. Dr. PIELKE: Right, the ones - the seven science advisers we talked to painted a picture that was very unique to each presidency, each science adviser - the relationship between the two of them. You go from Ed David, who was a science adviser to Richard Nixon who saw his position abolished by Richard Nixon, to Jack Marburger who's the current science adviser who saw his position demoted and his office moved down the street, to some of the stories that Neal Lane told us of very active engagement. George Keyworth, who was science adviser to Ronald Reagan, was deeply involved in the strategic defense initiative - almost to a exclusion of other scientific topics. So it's important to recognize that the science adviser serves at the pleasure of the president, and the president's personality and relationship with the individual makes a huge difference as to what issues the science adviser actually participates in. FLATOW: We have to take a short break. We'll come back, talk lots more about presidents' science advisers with Neal Lane and Roger Pielke, Jr. , take your questions. Stay with us. We'll be right back. I'm Ira Flatow, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: We're talking today about presidential science advisers with my guests, Roger Pielke Jr. , professor in the environmental studies program with the University of Colorado in Boulder; Neal Lane, served as science adviser to President Clinton. He's also former director of the National Science Foundation. He is now professor at Rice University. Our number: 1-800-989-8255. Roger, did you finish your thought about the science advisers when we went to the break there? Dr. PIELKE: Yes. FLATOW: Do they have a diminished role today because you make a point in your piece that there so much other advice coming from all different directions? Dr. PIELKE: Yeah, I would say that diminished isn't right because I don't think at any time in history the science adviser had a very large role. The position was created 50 years ago this month, when President Eisenhower installed James Killian in the aftermath of Sputnik to show the American public that the U. S. was on top of scientific issues dealing with missiles in the Soviet Union. But almost immediately after that, the science adviser took on a role that is remarkably similar to today. So if there was a golden age of science advisers, it was remarkably short. And science advisers slipped into these very unique roles that have gone up and down over time. But at no time would you have seen a science adviser who has a position like, say, Karl Rove, does in the current administration. FLATOW: Neal Lane, would you agree that it's just about being steady? Dr. LANE: Well, I certainly agree. I never saw my role as similar to Karl Rove. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. LANE: But I would agree with Roger in that I don't think the role has diminished. Probably, the time when the role was most powerful was when it wasn't really called science adviser, it was wartime adviser. Vannevar Bush, who had not only the advisory role, but he also had the money and the priority setting. I think the science adviser, for most of the history, has served the role it does today. Science technology is central to everything. The science adviser really has to bring to the president all of the knowledge base and all the advice coming from these various agencies that Roger talks about in his piece, and be a sort of honest broker, to use Roger's book title, in getting that information to the president. So the science adviser gives confidential advice to the president. He or she serves as director of OSTP, which is the knowledge base for science technology in the White House. And he serves as the president's spokesperson on science and technology matters. I think probably the science adviser in the future will be even more important than that role has been on the past because of the point Roger makes in his piece, the complexity of science and technology. It just connects with everything that has to do with people's lives and with every important policy issue. So I look for the role to be increasingly important, but also increasingly complicated in the years to come. FLATOW: Ryan(ph) in Portland, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. RYAN (Caller): Hello. FLATOW: Hi, there. RYAN: Yeah, my comment - I just want to get the opinion of the guests about the current president who has really denied an awful lot of science. He just doesn't seem to put any faith in it, from issues ranging from global warming to the intelligence design versus the evolution debate. And I just want to hear their opinion. It's like how did - what does the science adviser do when the president just doesn't believe science? Dr. LANE: I'm happy to comment. FLATOW: Go ahead, Neal. Dr. LANE: You want me to lead off, Ira? FLATOW: Sure. Dr. LANE: Well, first of all, let me say that I'm familiar with - I'm unfamiliar with that kind of White House. That was not the kind of White House I worked in, and my predecessor, Jack Gibbons, you can bet was intimately involved on all the discussions about climate change. And had the advice of an expert, Rosina Bierbaum, and her predecessors in OSTP. So no question about what they were fully consulted, and I can show you a pile of memos, if you like it, on that. The current administration has been different, and I can resonate with the comments or questions that are made. But I will also have to say, the science adviser can only give advice to the president and that advice really needs to be confidential advice. And then the president does what he does and says what he says, really not further influenced by any of his aides. So I can imagine it's a very frustrating job for Jack Marburger, but I think that's the situation we've been in for a while. FLATOW: Roger, has there ever been as much scrutiny of science advisers as there has been under this administration? Dr. PIELKE: I'll give you a yes and no to that. Richard Nixon, as I mentioned, got rid of the office. And so to answer the caller, what do you when a president decides that he doesn't want a particular set of advice or\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. PIELKE: \u2026information, in that case, it took an act of Congress to get the science adviser back into the White House. So I think it's very idiosyncratic. It depends on the nature of the president and the way they receive advice. The current administration is widely reported to have a very narrow circle of advisers. Whether it's issue of going to war in Iraq or stem cell policy, this is the nature of this particular presidency. And I agree with Neal that looking back over, say, the Clinton administration, it was a very different approach to how expertise was managed and used. FLATOW: So if you're a science adviser or a potential adviser and you get the call from the White House to come on over, you sign up, right? You then signed up for this administration, that you will go along and be very quiet, at least, publicly, about the policy because you are a spokesperson. Dr. LANE: That's absolutely correct. And if the president actually said something factually wrong about science, then maybe that just goes by. But if the science adviser gets questioned about that, that puts the science adviser in a dilemma. He or she has just got to figure out how to protect the president as best as you can and protect your own integrity and the integrity of your office. That's, sometimes, is very hard. FLATOW: Do you think there could ever a case where you think that your integrity is on the line there that you might find yourself having to resign over the policies taken by a White House? Dr. LANE: That could be the case. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Roger, has that ever happened? Dr. PIELKE: It has never happened, but it's certainly could be the case. And in that respect, the science adviser is not unlike any other presidential appointee. At some point, if the policies of the administration are such that the individual can't support them, then they always have that option to leave the administration. FLATOW: And as you point out, there have been other cases where the science has been politicized in other administrations. Dr. PIELKE: If you look across history, you'll find that as science and technology have increasingly played a role in policy issues - whether it's aluminum tubes and the debate over the war in Iraq, stem cell policy, climate change - the more political importance that science and technology takes on, the more politicized scientific debates become. But even so, you can look back even to the Eisenhower administration and see many of the earlier incarnations of the same sort of debates we see over science today. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Neal, a question comes in from Bauer(ph) in \"Second Life,\" who says, Jimmy Carter was a scientist and understood anything he read. Is the typical office holder even capable of understanding the things that are needed for making these kinds of decisions? \" Dr. LANE: Well, I think, I think no matter what the background of the president is - of course you want a president who is intelligent, knows a lot and understands how to sort out the differing opinions. But the complexity of science, engineering technology issues today is such that the president, I believe, must have, immediate at hand, an adviser and a body of expertise, like the Office of Science and Technology Policy I talked about earlier, that can respond quickly and give him correct understanding what science is, and even, perhaps, policy options in a way that Roger has talked about to cut through, then a lot of the otherwise time-consuming make-work. FLATOW: But if the president's not interested in hearing what the real science is, it doesn't matter what you say to him. Dr. LANE: Well, that's right. And, you know, that's hard. We can only know - if we're not inside the White House, we can only know from outside how it appears. And it certainly appears in the current administration that there was not only a lack of interest there, but also a lack of respect for science, because many of the things the administration has done were, I think, unique in the history of the presidency. They - the idea of falsifying statements about the facts of science in ways that mislead the public are somewhat unusual. And that's why many of us spoke out on 2004. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So calling forward, Roger Pielke, what do you think, then, the role of a science adviser should be? Dr. PIELKE: One thing that, that struck me most when I was writing the piece for Nature was how expertise in government has literally exploded. I quote William Golden, who wrote, in 1950, one the architects of the science adviser position, that the government could look to between 20 and 200 top scientists to provide advice. Today, there's more than 18,000 scientists who serve on actual, formal advisory committees to the government. That's not counting all of the non-governmental organizations, international organizations, independent scientists that are out there, ready and willing to provide advice. So it seems to me that - I agree with Neal. Looking to the future, the management of all of these wonderful expertise is going to become more and more important. The president simply cannot be on top of all of these topics all the time, and has to lean on experts. As far as policy making goes, if policy is not connected to cause-and-effect relationships about the real world, those policies aren't going to do what they're intended to do, and we'll, see some bad failures. So it's utmost important that expertise gets brought into the policy process in a way that's accurate and to contribute to effective policy making. FLATOW: Stephen(ph) in Phoenix. Hi, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. STEPHEN (Caller): Hi. Neal -I appreciate your, your time, I'm sorry, it's Mr. Pielke and Mr. Lane and Ira, right? FLATOW: It's Friday. Okay. STEPHEN: I use science daily to save the lives of my patients. I'm an infectious disease doctor. You know, our current administration is hostile to science, I think. And I agree with everything you've said. Daily, there's doctors and scientists that are taken to task for raising quality issues, either at hospitals or at drug companies or in the government. And I just want to know what we scientists can do or doctors or people that raise quality issues about being muzzled? You know, how can we prevent this? I mean, the stem cell research, global warming - it seems common sense has just gone out the window. We're teaching creationism in schools and, you know, and those kids have to know science to stop bioterrorism agents or build things. You know, they're not going to have that background. Dr. LANE: Well, this is Neal. Can - may I comment on that? FLATOW: Sure, please. Dr. LANE: So you - thank you very much for the question. It gives me a chance to give my civic scientist speech. but I'll avoid that temptation. I think there is no magic bullet here that scientists - and I include medical scientists, the physicians, engineers, technical professionals, all other kinds - really need, more than ever, to get outside their labs and their offices some of the time and interact with the public. Get into a dialogue with the general public. Only that way are we going to establish the sort of mutual respects and understand with the public and their elected representatives that we need. We'll have to work at this over a long period of time. It's nothing that's just going to be suddenly fixed, because this is not just a problem with one individual who happens to be president of the United States. In fact, we never said this individual is personally responsible for all the things that are going on that we've been talking about here. It does represent, though, some disturbing trends in our larger society. And that has something to do with the quality of education and leadership that we've enjoyed - that we lack, actually, in this nation over some period. FLATOW: This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Neal Lane, professor at the Rice University; also with Roger Pielke who's author of the \"Honest Broker: Making Sense of Science in Policy and Politics. \" Our number:s 1-800-998-255. Let's see if we can get another call or two in here. Let's go this time to Oakland. Hi, Hugh(ph). Welcome to Science Friday. HUGH (Caller): Hi, this is Hugh in Oakland. My father worked for years for NASA in the international division, which is a small division of NASA and which in turn is a small division of the government. What they found often was that things would be said either in the Senate or to the public through the science adviser that the administration in power did not want to say publicly. And usually, that meant two things. One, concerning NASA, that the science adviser would be the hatchet man for cutting an already small agency's budget. And that was pretty much with any administration. And then, secondly, there's a lot of industry input into science policy. And that would often be done through the Science Office. So I'd like your guests' comments both about that, but I'd also like to point out to the public that they can pay attention in any administration about what they really mean by what the science adviser is saying and not the administration itself. FLATOW: Neal, did you find that to be true? Dr. LANE: I think it's generally correct that the science adviser is often a spokesperson for a particular policy that the administration has, and that may be a policy that he or she agrees with or not. That's different from, you know, being asked to misstate scientific fact or, that one really couldn't do, I think, under the circumstances. But it is not uncommon for the science adviser to state a policy and defend a policy that he or she might not personally like. And - you know, our caller talks about NASA. I mean, what an extraordinary agency with a history of accomplishment, and yet an agency that's been put through some really difficult times. And now, of course, is in, I think, some serious trouble when we really ought to be paying a little more attention to the future opportunities in space. FLATOW: Roger, any last comment? Dr. PIELKE: Yeah. I would say that the overall budget for research and development in this country is extremely fortunate to have the science adviser because ultimately, budget decisions are made in a political way. But having the science adviser as kind of the chief budget officer working with OMB, looking at that helps to ensure that scientific judgments on priorities get put into the process in a way that maybe wouldn't if there wasn't this cross-cutting look at the budget process. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. LANE: I agree with that. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Well, thank you both, gentlemen, for taking\u2026 Dr. LANE: Thank you. FLATOW: \u2026taking time to be with us. Dr. PIELKE: Thank you. FLATOW: Thanks for coming on and have a happy holiday season to you. Dr. LANE: Thank you, Ira. Come see us at Rice University. Dr. PIELKE: Happy holiday. FLATOW: I will come down there. Neal Lane served as science adviser under President Clinton. He is the Malcolm Gillis University professor and senior fellow at the James Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice. Roger Pielke Jr. is the author of the \"Honest Broker: Making Sense of Science in Policy and Politics. \" He is a professor in environmental studies program at the University of Colorado in Boulder. I want to thank them again for joining us today.  IRA FLATOW, host:  Up next, we're going to look at the ever changing role of presidential science advisers, for a commentary in the journal Nature this week. My next guest interviewed seven former presidential science advisers to find out what they thought about their term as scientist-in-chief. How has the job of science adviser changed over the years and from president to president?  And joining me now more to talk about it is Roger Pielke Jr. He is the author of that Nature commentary, also of the book, \"The Honest Broker: Making Sense of Science in Policy and Politics. \" He's a former director of the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research, professor in the environmental studies program in the University of Colorado in Boulder. He joins us by phone.  Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Pielke.  Dr. ROGER PIELKE (Author, \"The Honest Broker: Making Sense of Science in Policy and Politics;\" Environmental Studies Program Professor, University of Colorado Boulder): Thank you. Touched to be here.  FLATOW: Well, thank you. Also with us is one of the science advisers Dr. Pielke interviewed: Neal Lane. He served under President Clinton. He's also a former director of the National Science Foundation. And he is the Malcolm Gillis University professor and senior fellow at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. And he joins us by phone from Houston.  Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Lane.  Dr. NEAL LANE (Former Presidential Science Adviser; Professor and Senior Fellow, James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy, Rice University): Thank you, Ira. Very nice to be with you today.  FLATOW: You're very welcome. How has, Dr. Pielke, do science advisers really make a difference in the administrations?  Dr. PIELKE: The role of science adviser has taken on a lot of different forms since President Eisenhower first elevated the position from the Department of Defense up into the White House. And science advisers have had an enormous difference. Probably, most importantly in the thread that runs through science advice from the 1950s is its role that the office plays in the budgetary process. The science adviser is a key point for allocating resources and setting priorities, with the Office of Management and Budget, for how the country spends its finite research dollars.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Neal Lane, you agree?  Dr. LANE: I agree. The role has changed considerably. And certainly, the formal partnership and the informal relation between OSTP and the science adviser and then the Office of Management and Budget is extremely important to the budget process for science technology activities throughout the government.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. We're talking about science advisers this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  The reason why I asked this is because a few years ago, I heard David Gergen give a talk at Cal Tech back in 1997 and he was an adviser, not the science adviser. He was a political adviser to four presidents - Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Clinton. And I want to play for you an edited excerpt of a speech that he gave in which it was pretty critical of how the White House did not put much weight on the input of science advisers - at least during the term that he was there - and how science advisers really did not vigorously advanced their opinions to the White House staff. So here's a little bit of what he had to say.  (Soundbite of archived speech)  Mr. DAVID GERGEN (Professor of Public Service and Director of the Center for Public Leadership, Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government; Editor-at-Large, U. S. News & World Report; Former Presidential Political Adviser): I have a hard time remembering memos that I thought were critical to the formation of policy. Well, there are a lot of legislative issues that come through a White House, and yet I must tell you, I don't think the science adviser - with some exception - is seen as a critical player in a lot of those issues. Yes, their advice goes through. The scientific advisory boards that the presidents have -they have wonderfully good people on them frequently, but they don't have sufficient impact inside the process.  I have been to many morning meetings. Daily meetings in the White House start at 7:30 or whatever, and they'll be - the staff will be there, 25 or 30 people. And the science adviser will be there at that table. And that is the last time I see the science adviser that day. And as again the next morning at 7:30 or 8 o'clock, I see the science adviser. And I keep asking myself, why had we run the public business this way? You know, there are so many issues in which that science adviser ought to be there.  FLATOW: And, John Marburger, is that your experience?  And I had John Marburger on.  Dr. JOHN MARBURGER (Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy): \u2026what meetings David Gergen was in, but he's certainly isn't in the same kinds of meetings I am.  FLATOW: And there you have it, John Marburger had just become the science adviser. And I asked him if that reflected at the way he was. He saw his role as science adviser and what happened in the White House, and he said, as you've heard, he says that's not what happened while I was there.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Neal Lane, do you agree with Marburger? Or do you agree with David Gergen, who said they really didn't speak up very much and they didn't have much impact.  Dr. LANE: No, you know, I have a high regard for David Gergen, but his comments were strange to me. Now, of course, I didn't see Gergen in the White House because I wasn't there at the same time. But after the morning staff meeting, at least my experience was that a good bit of the rest of my day on many days was spent on the West Wing.  So they may be - may have been meetings with John Podesta, the chief of staff, or with the person who's running the Council on Environmental Quality, or Gene Sperling on economic issues or the vice president; meetings on budget, meetings on a number of issues, in my case, nanotechnology, and on another occasion, a meeting having to do with missile defense.  So a good bit of my time, may be more than I would've liked, was taken up with meetings in the West Wing with senior people around the president and, of course, sometimes with the president. And obviously, that's a special occasion for all of us and we try to be on our best behavior and give our best advice at such time. So I don't, you know, David Gergen's comments don't resonate with me.  FLATOW: Roger Pielke, did you find that they reflected what you found out from all the science advisers you interviewed.  Dr. PIELKE: Right, the ones - the seven science advisers we talked to painted a picture that was very unique to each presidency, each science adviser - the relationship between the two of them. You go from Ed David, who was a science adviser to Richard Nixon who saw his position abolished by Richard Nixon, to Jack Marburger who's the current science adviser who saw his position demoted and his office moved down the street, to some of the stories that Neal Lane told us of very active engagement.  George Keyworth, who was science adviser to Ronald Reagan, was deeply involved in the strategic defense initiative - almost to a exclusion of other scientific topics.  So it's important to recognize that the science adviser serves at the pleasure of the president, and the president's personality and relationship with the individual makes a huge difference as to what issues the science adviser actually participates in.  FLATOW: We have to take a short break. We'll come back, talk lots more about presidents' science advisers with Neal Lane and Roger Pielke, Jr. , take your questions. Stay with us. We'll be right back.  I'm Ira Flatow, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: We're talking today about presidential science advisers with my guests, Roger Pielke Jr. , professor in the environmental studies program with the University of Colorado in Boulder; Neal Lane, served as science adviser to President Clinton. He's also former director of the National Science Foundation. He is now professor at Rice University.  Our number: 1-800-989-8255.  Roger, did you finish your thought about the science advisers when we went to the break there?  Dr. PIELKE: Yes.  FLATOW: Do they have a diminished role today because you make a point in your piece that there so much other advice coming from all different directions?  Dr. PIELKE: Yeah, I would say that diminished isn't right because I don't think at any time in history the science adviser had a very large role. The position was created 50 years ago this month, when President Eisenhower installed James Killian in the aftermath of Sputnik to show the American public that the U. S. was on top of scientific issues dealing with missiles in the Soviet Union. But almost immediately after that, the science adviser took on a role that is remarkably similar to today.  So if there was a golden age of science advisers, it was remarkably short. And science advisers slipped into these very unique roles that have gone up and down over time. But at no time would you have seen a science adviser who has a position like, say, Karl Rove, does in the current administration.  FLATOW: Neal Lane, would you agree that it's just about being steady?  Dr. LANE: Well, I certainly agree. I never saw my role as similar to Karl Rove.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. LANE: But I would agree with Roger in that I don't think the role has diminished. Probably, the time when the role was most powerful was when it wasn't really called science adviser, it was wartime adviser. Vannevar Bush, who had not only the advisory role, but he also had the money and the priority setting.  I think the science adviser, for most of the history, has served the role it does today. Science technology is central to everything. The science adviser really has to bring to the president all of the knowledge base and all the advice coming from these various agencies that Roger talks about in his piece, and be a sort of honest broker, to use Roger's book title, in getting that information to the president.  So the science adviser gives confidential advice to the president. He or she serves as director of OSTP, which is the knowledge base for science technology in the White House. And he serves as the president's spokesperson on science and technology matters.  I think probably the science adviser in the future will be even more important than that role has been on the past because of the point Roger makes in his piece, the complexity of science and technology. It just connects with everything that has to do with people's lives and with every important policy issue.  So I look for the role to be increasingly important, but also increasingly complicated in the years to come.  FLATOW: Ryan(ph) in Portland, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  RYAN (Caller): Hello.  FLATOW: Hi, there.  RYAN: Yeah, my comment - I just want to get the opinion of the guests about the current president who has really denied an awful lot of science.

And that has something to do with the quality of education and leadership that we've enjoyed - that we lack, actually, in this nation over some period.  FLATOW: This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Neal Lane, professor at the Rice University; also with Roger Pielke who's author of the \"Honest Broker: Making Sense of Science in Policy and Politics. \" Our number:s 1-800-998-255. Let's see if we can get another call or two in here. Let's go this time to Oakland. Hi, Hugh(ph). Welcome to Science Friday.  HUGH (Caller): Hi, this is Hugh in Oakland. My father worked for years for NASA in the international division, which is a small division of NASA and which in turn is a small division of the government. What they found often was that things would be said either in the Senate or to the public through the science adviser that the administration in power did not want to say publicly. And usually, that meant two things.  One, concerning NASA, that the science adviser would be the hatchet man for cutting an already small agency's budget. And that was pretty much with any administration. And then, secondly, there's a lot of industry input into science policy. And that would often be done through the Science Office. So I'd like your guests' comments both about that, but I'd also like to point out to the public that they can pay attention in any administration about what they really mean by what the science adviser is saying and not the administration itself.  FLATOW: Neal, did you find that to be true?  Dr. LANE: I think it's generally correct that the science adviser is often a spokesperson for a particular policy that the administration has, and that may be a policy that he or she agrees with or not. That's different from, you know, being asked to misstate scientific fact or, that one really couldn't do, I think, under the circumstances. But it is not uncommon for the science adviser to state a policy and defend a policy that he or she might not personally like. And - you know, our caller talks about NASA. I mean, what an extraordinary agency with a history of accomplishment, and yet an agency that's been put through some really difficult times. And now, of course, is in, I think, some serious trouble when we really ought to be paying a little more attention to the future opportunities in space.  FLATOW: Roger, any last comment?  Dr. PIELKE: Yeah. I would say that the overall budget for research and development in this country is extremely fortunate to have the science adviser because ultimately, budget decisions are made in a political way. But having the science adviser as kind of the chief budget officer working with OMB, looking at that helps to ensure that scientific judgments on priorities get put into the process in a way that maybe wouldn't if there wasn't this cross-cutting look at the budget process.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. LANE: I agree with that.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Well, thank you both, gentlemen, for taking\u2026  Dr. LANE: Thank you.  FLATOW: \u2026taking time to be with us.  Dr. PIELKE: Thank you.  FLATOW: Thanks for coming on and have a happy holiday season to you.  Dr. LANE: Thank you, Ira. Come see us at Rice University.  Dr. PIELKE: Happy holiday.  FLATOW: I will come down there. Neal Lane served as science adviser under President Clinton. He is the Malcolm Gillis University professor and senior fellow at the James Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice. Roger Pielke Jr. is the author of the \"Honest Broker: Making Sense of Science in Policy and Politics. \" He is a professor in environmental studies program at the University of Colorado in Boulder. I want to thank them again for joining us today. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2007 NPR.  All rights reserved.

It's a new and very strange dinosaur. And when we say new, of course, we mean newly discovered; it's old. Scientists have just completed reconstruction of an elephant-sized beast whose skull and jaw are unlike anything they have ever seen. NPR's Christopher Joyce has more on what's being called the Mesozoic Cow. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: Paleontologist Paul Sereno has a reputation for finding new kinds of dinosaurs in out-of-the-way places. His latest discovery comes from Niger, where it had been buried a hundred and ten million years ago during the Mesozoic era. Sereno spent years piecing together the creature's bones. When he got the head and jaw together, he was shocked. PAUL SERENO: Well, the first thing that comes to my mind is this is the weirdest dinosaur I've ever seen. It's some kind of Darth Vader dinosaur when you look at the skull. You put the skin on it, it does look like, you know - most people think it looks like a vacuum, and they I think quite appropriately want to put that muzzle close to the ground and are wondering what it is vacuuming up. JOYCE: The skin is a plastic rendering of what the animal, called Nigersaurus taqueti, looked like. Sereno calls Nigersaurus an extreme dinosaur - one of nature's more bizarre experiments. SERENO: It has jaws wider than the skull; there's no other animal that's done that; all the teeth up front in some type of conveyer belt fashion to create these shears. JOYCE: These shearing teeth are aligned across the front of the wide, boxy mouth like a row of sharpened piano keys. Sereno says the animal probably used the top and bottom rows like scissors to graze on low-growing ferns or primitive plants like horsetail. Its mouth held as many as five replacements for each tooth at any one time and probably lost a row every month. CT: the organs that help it keep its balance, like the semicircular canals in our own ears. From the positioning of those organs, it looked as if the animal spent most of its time with its head pointed almost straight down. That's different from the way the big long-necked dinosaurs are usually depicted. Combined with the mower-like teeth, it reinforces the idea of a ground-level grazer. Paleontologist Larry Witmer of Ohio University says the scientists couldn't have figured that out without C. T. scanning. LAWRENCE WITMER: What it's done for paleontology is opened up really whole new vistas for questions that we could ask about dinosaurs. Things that we never even thought we could ask we can now even answer. JOYCE: Nigersaurus has more surprises. Sereno gives a tour of its long, bony spine. SERENO: So the animal is about 30 feet long. We're standing at the base of the neck here and it rises above our heads. When you see the vertebrae in front of us, there's more air in each one of these vertebrae in the neck and in the back than there is bone. JOYCE: In fact, many of the bones that make up the skull and jaw are remarkably thin and light. Sereno says he doesn't quite know what to make of that on such a big animal. It certainly wouldn't work on a mammal. SERENO: Every mammal that has gone into serious chewing, like a cow, has made the skull more robust; they enhance the jaw muscles. This is breaking a lot of rules. And so I am serving it up to the - I'm serving notice to the scientific community, to the biomechanics out there, you got to explain this one. JOYCE: The fossil reconstruction of Nigersaurus is on display at the National Geographic Society in Washington, D. C. , where Sereno is an explorer in residence when he's not teaching at the University of Chicago. Sereno describes the dinosaur in the latest issue of the online journal of the Public Library of Science. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

It covers a man - thought and all - like a cloak. It is meat for the hungry, drink for the thirsty, heat for the cold, and cold for the hot. But sleep is not as advertized for most Americans. So - this being America - new products are being advertized that promise to make you a satisfied sleeper and a repeat customer. Jon Mooallem writes about mattress, Z drugs, and other products that promise to put you to sleep in a story in today's New York Times magazine that will not put you to sleep. It's called the sleep industrial complex. Mooallem writes that folks at select comforts are onto a good thing with their sleep number bed. Mr. JON MOOALLEM (Writer): The bed that they're selling - this air-filled bed that you can sort of inflate each half to, you know, just the right level of firmness or softness is one of many kinds of beds that's really popular now that they call alternative bedding. And it's beds that are not made of the same steel springs that, basically, American have been sleeping for a hundred years or more. And those kinds of beds, they really changed a lot in the industry. And you've had a lot of ripple effects in terms of both the way, you know, they're made and the way they're marketed. HANSEN: In the mattress industry as a whole, they don't seem to be cashing on in this new idea that consumers need a certain kind of mattress in order to get effective sleep. Mr. MOOALLEM: I think they really feel like they've been skipped over in a lot of this. You know, somehow, the link to thinking that buying a better mattress is going to help you do that. Just people really haven't made that yet. And so I think the mattress industry is really trying to engage consumers in a, you know, argument to say we are selling something that can help you. HANSEN: The way that humans sleep - talk about it in terms of the popularity of the sleeping pills - the Ambien and the Lunesta, and they are being advertized on television. And their effect seems to be, what the anthropologist calls and what you talked about in your article, the lie-down-and-die way of sleeping and it works because it makes people forget. It works around these concepts of amnesia. Mr. MOOALLEM: Well, that's one theory. I mean, there's - I talk about one Ambien study where the improvements were pretty meager. You know, people taking Ambien spent 88 percent of their time to sleep versus 82 percent of their time in bed asleep, which, over eight hours, would be about, I think, less than 30 minutes. And it's not just Ambien. You know, that's pretty common results for most sleeping pill studies. There were also just some recent surveys of many, many studies that showed people fell asleep 12 minutes faster on average in all these studies and had 11 minutes more sleep. And so, the mystery is given that the improvements are usually that small, why is that people in these studies also report feeling that they've slept so much better. Something seems to be out of whack. There seems to be a dissonance there. And one explanation is that because many of these drugs are known to block the formation of memory as you take them, they create this kind of amnesia, this kind of nighttime amnesia, that's changing your subjective impression of how you slept. So you think about, you know, how do you know that you've slept well. You can gauge it by absence. You know that you weren't rolling. You know that you weren't up thinking, you know, that you weren't too hot or too cold. And you know, as one psychologist or neurologist put it to me, the amnesia can kind of knock all of these things out and just sort of, you know, erase it so that, you know, you think well. I went to bed at 10:15 and now it's seven in the morning and I don't remember anything, so I must have slept, you know, really great. So that is one theory out there. I mean, the other theory is just that the pills are doing something, you know, in a physiological level that the clinicians just don't realize they should be measuring. And we just don't know what it is. HANSEN: Mm-hmm. Do you think human sabotage sleep? I mean, the whole idea that we're afraid, we're not going to get the sleep, produces that reaction, that any fear producer? I mean, you end up getting worked up about wanting to go to sleep. Mr. MOOALLEM: Yeah, I think that does, in fact, literally happen, you know, according to many of the therapists I talked to. One put it pretty simply. He said, you know, with sleep, the harder you try, the worse you do. It really does seem like the expectations are pretty unbendable and they're - in ways, they're unrealistic. You mentioned this anthropologist who calls it the lie-down-and-die model. You climb into bed, you turn off the light, you close your eyes and then, you know, next thing you know it, it's the morning. And that's not really the way it seems people sleep in many other parts of the world and the way people slept even in America in the past. HANSEN: How did they sleep? Mr. MOOALLEM: Well, I talked to one historian named Roger Ekkerchin(ph). One thing that he found is you know, hundreds - I think maybe even thousands, of references to what he calls a segmented pattern of sleep, where, basically, people would go to bed and then in the middle of the night, they'd get up and do something for an hour or so. Some people would just sort of lie there are and talk. Or some doctors recommended that people have sex during that time because they thought women might conceive more easily then. Some people would go out and work or tend to their animals and then they'd go back to bed. So the idea that sleep is the sort of on/off phenomenon in that, it's this one interrupted block. It's not something that is, you know, universal or even really historically accurate. HANSEN: Hmm. So after all the research you did for this article, have you changed your approach at all to getting yourself a good night sleep? Mr. MOOALLEM: Yeah. I guess I have, actually. I mean, for example, the last night I woke up, you know, early in the morning. And I think, in the past, I might have sort of jolted up and looked at the clock, and just had a sinking feeling like, you know, no. What am I going to do now. There's a big difference in being in that situation and just sort of dreading having to wait until the sun comes up versus just sort of trusting that your body will put you back to sleep. HANSEN: Jon Mooallem's story about the business of sleep is called \"The Sleep Industrial Complex. \" It's the cover story of today's New York Times magazine. And he joined us from the studios of KQED in San Francisco. Jon, thanks a lot. Mr. MOOALLEM: Thank you.  LIANE HANSEN, host:  Cervantes wrote: blessing on him that invented sleep.

I'm Alex Cohen. MADELEINE BRAND, host: I'm Madeleine Brand. In a few minutes, Detroit reacts angrily but non-violently to being called the most dangerous city in America. COHEN: But first, a few of the wives of soldiers killed in Iraq are getting pregnant and having children after the deaths of their husbands. They're using in-vitro fertilization. The Department of Veterans Affairs knows of only four women who have done this. One of them is Maria Sutherland. She lives in the small town of North Pole, Alaska. Libby Casey of member station KUAC in Fairbanks, Alaska reports. LIBBY CASEY: Maria Sutherland says her five-month-old son is just like his father. Ms. MARIA SUTHERLAND: His personality already. He's just always smiling, a happy little baby. He's got the same receding hairline already. They look the same to me. Hi. You look just your daddy, don't you? CASEY: The Sutherlands moved to Alaska five years ago, into their dream home, with lots of open space and the wood burning stove. It's a house full of life - a dog, three cats, and the constant hum of laundry. Maria says nearly everything looks the same since her husband deployed to Iraq in 2005. Ms. SUTHERLAND: I don't think I've touched anything the way Stephen hung everything up. It's still in the place where he left it. This over here is our last family picture that we took together. It's Christmas of 2004. CASEY: But there are some additions - baby pictures of little Stephen Sutherland II. They sit above a beautiful wooden urn that holds the ashes of his dad, Staff Sergeant Stephen Sutherland. Next to it is the flag that flew over Alaska's state capital at half-mast when Staff Sergeant Sutherland was killed in a vehicle roll-over near Rowa(ph), Iraq two years ago. The Sutherlands were trying to get pregnant before Stephen deployed. Maria had had a tubal ligation though, so in-vitro fertilization was their best option. Maria says Stephen wanted her to be able to have their baby even if something happened to him. Ms. SUTHERLAND: Unfortunately, you know, he only ended up with the one-way ticket. You know, it's different having something to wake up in the morning and look at the baby and just being able to know that (unintelligible). . . CASEY: The fertility clinic told Maria to wait a year after Stephen's death to decide if she really wanted to get pregnant. She talked to lawyers and counselors and got letters of support from her in-laws. She also talked to their sons, 18-year-old Omar, and 15-year-old Victor. They have regular family meetings, and Maria says she hasn't done anything without consulting them. Her boys supported the idea. Ms. SUTHERLAND: I'm very proud of them. I know that when the baby was getting ready to be born, I mean, we were all scared. I know at one time Victor said that he was scared of being an older brother because he didn't know what to do and he didn't want to let his dad down. And I think Victor should be very, very proud of himself. He's a natural. (Soundbite of baby) Ms. SUTHERLAND: What was that? You want your brother to hold you? Oh. Bubba, he wants you to hold him. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. SUTHERLAND: He's great with the baby. CASEY: Stephen wasn't Victor and Omar's biological father. Maria says she was doubtful at first that the handsome young soldier would date a single mom with small children. But Stephen fell in love with the whole family. He took the boys fishing and camping and shared their taste in music. Victor liked him right away. VICTOR: I thought he was like seven feet tall when I first met him. I mean, like, he was always just tossing me, you know, and carrying me and playing with me. And, like, it wasn't as if he was my mom's boyfriend. It was he was already our dad and he was already preparing for that role. CASEY: It took Omar longer to warm up to his mom's boyfriend. OMAR: I didn't like him. He was always funny and stuff, just I - I never thought that they'd be together. CASEY: But once the boys saw that Stephen wasn't going anywhere, they agreed to be adopted by him, officially becoming a family. Victor says he hopes they can step up for their little brother just like Stephen did for them. VICTOR: But my dad was just so understanding that he could take off his dad shoes and put on his friend shoes. And you could talk to him in that sense and you could tell him anything. Hopefully one of us - or both of us - can be like that with Stephen and just help him get through his life. And it's going to be hard without dad because, you know, he had some pretty big shoes to fill. But as long as I can be his friend, I think I'll be able to do good. CASEY: The Sutherland family says having a baby has brought them closer. In a time of incredible of sadness they have something to look forward to: watching Baby Stephen grow up and learn about his father. For NPR News, I'm Libby Casey.

COHEN: But first, a few of the wives of soldiers killed in Iraq are getting pregnant and having children after the deaths of their husbands. They're using in-vitro fertilization.  The Department of Veterans Affairs knows of only four women who have done this. One of them is Maria Sutherland. She lives in the small town of North Pole, Alaska.  Libby Casey of member station KUAC in Fairbanks, Alaska reports.  LIBBY CASEY: Maria Sutherland says her five-month-old son is just like his father.  Ms. MARIA SUTHERLAND: His personality already. He's just always smiling, a happy little baby. He's got the same receding hairline already. They look the same to me. Hi. You look just your daddy, don't you?  CASEY: The Sutherlands moved to Alaska five years ago, into their dream home, with lots of open space and the wood burning stove. It's a house full of life - a dog, three cats, and the constant hum of laundry.  Maria says nearly everything looks the same since her husband deployed to Iraq in 2005.  Ms. SUTHERLAND: I don't think I've touched anything the way Stephen hung everything up. It's still in the place where he left it. This over here is our last family picture that we took together. It's Christmas of 2004.  CASEY: But there are some additions - baby pictures of little Stephen Sutherland II. They sit above a beautiful wooden urn that holds the ashes of his dad, Staff Sergeant Stephen Sutherland. Next to it is the flag that flew over Alaska's state capital at half-mast when Staff Sergeant Sutherland was killed in a vehicle roll-over near Rowa(ph), Iraq two years ago.  The Sutherlands were trying to get pregnant before Stephen deployed. Maria had had a tubal ligation though, so in-vitro fertilization was their best option. Maria says Stephen wanted her to be able to have their baby even if something happened to him.  Ms. SUTHERLAND: Unfortunately, you know, he only ended up with the one-way ticket. You know, it's different having something to wake up in the morning and look at the baby and just being able to know that (unintelligible). . .  CASEY: The fertility clinic told Maria to wait a year after Stephen's death to decide if she really wanted to get pregnant. She talked to lawyers and counselors and got letters of support from her in-laws. She also talked to their sons, 18-year-old Omar, and 15-year-old Victor. They have regular family meetings, and Maria says she hasn't done anything without consulting them. Her boys supported the idea.  Ms. SUTHERLAND: I'm very proud of them. I know that when the baby was getting ready to be born, I mean, we were all scared. I know at one time Victor said that he was scared of being an older brother because he didn't know what to do and he didn't want to let his dad down. And I think Victor should be very, very proud of himself. He's a natural.  (Soundbite of baby)  Ms. SUTHERLAND: What was that? You want your brother to hold you? Oh. Bubba, he wants you to hold him.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. SUTHERLAND: He's great with the baby.  CASEY: Stephen wasn't Victor and Omar's biological father. Maria says she was doubtful at first that the handsome young soldier would date a single mom with small children. But Stephen fell in love with the whole family. He took the boys fishing and camping and shared their taste in music. Victor liked him right away.  VICTOR: I thought he was like seven feet tall when I first met him. I mean, like, he was always just tossing me, you know, and carrying me and playing with me. And, like, it wasn't as if he was my mom's boyfriend. It was he was already our dad and he was already preparing for that role.  CASEY: It took Omar longer to warm up to his mom's boyfriend.  OMAR: I didn't like him. He was always funny and stuff, just I - I never thought that they'd be together.  CASEY: But once the boys saw that Stephen wasn't going anywhere, they agreed to be adopted by him, officially becoming a family. Victor says he hopes they can step up for their little brother just like Stephen did for them.  VICTOR: But my dad was just so understanding that he could take off his dad shoes and put on his friend shoes. And you could talk to him in that sense and you could tell him anything. Hopefully one of us - or both of us - can be like that with Stephen and just help him get through his life. And it's going to be hard without dad because, you know, he had some pretty big shoes to fill. But as long as I can be his friend, I think I'll be able to do good.  CASEY: The Sutherland family says having a baby has brought them closer. In a time of incredible of sadness they have something to look forward to: watching Baby Stephen grow up and learn about his father.  For NPR News, I'm Libby Casey.

I'm Ira Flatow. What happens if we were to disappear? I mean, all of us, everybody on Earth. You know, so many times you've heard environmentalists talking about saving the world. What if they mean, well, if we have to save the world, to keep the world safe, we humans can't be here? Because the world it seems will, you know, maybe it will go on just fine without us. At least that seems to be the message of a new book called \"The World Without Us. \" Some things like head lice or cattle might be in trouble without humans, that, by and large, the world would survive and might be argued, it might be better off ecologically and environmentally without us in it. This is an archived division of SCIENCE FRIDAY, so please don't try to call in. Joining me now to talk about what might happen on Earth if humans were to suddenly vanish is my guest, the author of \"The World Without Us,\" Alan Weisman. He's a journalist and senior editor and producer in Homeland Productions Radio. Thanks for talking with us today, Mr. Weisman. Mr. ALAN WEISMAN (Author, \"The World Without Us\"): Thank you, Ira. Good to be here. FLATOW: What made you decide to take us off the Earth here? Mr. WEISMAN: Well, I actually don't want to take us off the Earth, but theoretically removing us from the Earth helps to solve a problem that lot of us who write about the environment constantly confront, which is the more deeply and completely we report it, the more overwhelmed are leaders or listeners sometimes feel and sometimes they just don't want to face it because it just seems so depressing or so scary. And I realize that if I just, you know, disarm the concern about - sooner, we'll all going to die. If this, you know, this keeps going this way. If I just kill everybody off in the beginning and then let everybody stick around to see what happens next, they might just sort of relax and enjoy it. They would think that, you know, this is kind of a fantasy and I posed some remote possibilities how this could happen. Say a Homo sapien specific virus just picked us off and left everything else. Let's say that AIDS were airborne rather than, you know, passed by fluids. Well, a lot of people believe in the rapture maybe - you know, a spiritual figure or a space aliens take us away to heaven or to some place across the galaxy. But just suppose that the Earth woke up tomorrow and everything else was here, intact, as it is today, except for us. What happens next? FLATOW: And, you know, you came up, I think, with some - initially, some very surprising things that would happen, like the cockroaches would go away. Mr. WEISMAN: The cockroaches would go away from our northern cities because it turns out, I'm informed, that they depend on the heat inside buildings to get through the winter. So if people were gone, the power plants are off, the heat goes off, the cockroaches have no refuge to take and they would be cold. But in the tropics, places like Florida, they would still have to deal with cockroaches. FLATOW: And would be a disruption in the whole chain of the food system. Mr. WEISMAN: Well, definitely. The - by food system, you mean, agriculture? FLATOW: Agriculture would go away and food that we eat, that we feed inadvertently to rats and other kinds of animals who depend on it. Well, definitely. There are urban rats who live a lot on human refuge. They would be hurting for food. In fact, they would become food themselves, because there would be a lot of raptors and other predators that would be - populate in the cities very soon and they would find hungry rats everywhere looking around in the surface for something to eat. At the same time, our agricultural fields - I trace in this book what the succession back to a natural force environment, for example, would be in fields that have both never been fertilized before such as in New England - parts of New England, essentially where I live in Western Massachusetts, where farmers moved on better soils and longer-growing seasons as the United States march westward and also places that have received liberal amounts of herbicides, pesticides and chemical fertilizers over the years forest succession would proceed differently in those cases. But in any event, a lot of those crops that we have planted, they would be gone and some of the vegetables and things that we are used to - like cauliflower and broccoli and carrots - they would revert back to wilder forms that wouldn't be very recognizable to us. Well, carrots are an interesting example because they would revert back to Queen Anne's lace, which we know is a flower, not as an edible root. FLATOW: You start out with New York City, I guess, because it's a really interesting place to watch what happens when the people disappear, and you talked about how important - what happens with water when it's allowed to get into places that we have no control over anymore? Mr. WEISMAN: Well, in the previous chapter, I show how our houses are something that are certainly vulnerable to water. Anybody who's ever had a roof leak knows about that. But even our big cement cities, same thing happens. But in the case is New York - and I imagine several other cities - it would actually start underneath the city, not on the roof. Subway engineers took me through the bowels of the city and showed me how the history of the city can be seen down there in the rushing water that is coming out of the ground all the time. New York used to be a hilly city. The name Manhattan refers to hills - it's an old Algonquian term Manahetta(ph) - and there were 40-some streams and rivers on the surface that would, of course, drain water away to the sea. When those hills got smashed down to superimpose the grid on the cities, the rivers were pushed underground. And even on a sunny day, they're pumping about 13 million gallons of groundwater in a rising water table, up, out of the city into the sea. If the power went off, nearly 800 pumps would go silent and the subways would flood. And then the columns that are holding up the streets would start to rust, then start to corrode, and they give it about two decades before they would start to collapse. And the streets would start to crater and some of that water would then become surface water once again. And at the same time the foundations in a lot of buildings would start to become waterlogged and they would also corrode and eventually become destabilized, because they were built to be standing in water. FLATOW: Then you say that eventually our skyscrapers would be just blown over by the wind. Mr. WEISMAN: Well, a destabilized skyscraper would be very susceptible to high winds and of course New York, being a coastal city, has been hit by hurricanes before. There's some speculation that we may be seeing more hurricanes around the East Coast and perhaps more powerful ones in the decades to come. And a destabilized skyscraper - we all know that skyscrapers will sway in the wind -this will - if it topples, it will probably do the same thing as the big tree does when it topples in the forest. It takes down some other trees standing around it with it. And that's actually going to be kind of good for the succession of forests in the city. New York was once completely forest that, of course, and trees will be already colonizing in the streets. They'll be growing in the leaf litter that will be filling the gutters in the streets, because no one will be raking the streets, and no one will be unclogging in the sewers that will probably have plastic bags stuck over the top of them. And the crumbling concrete will have a line to the soil, which will make it less acidic, so more and more plants, types of plants will be able to colonize. FLATOW: Hmm. And you also talked about how quickly, you know, New York is famous, also for its majestic bridges. How quickly the bridges will crumble? Mr. WEISMAN: The bridges will not exactly crumble, as they will begin to fall into the bodies of water below them. Because a bridge has to be maintained all the time. That means painting it and that means clearing the debris that will gather in the expansion joints. Now, bridges which are made up of metal usually - except for the very old ones, the stone ones, they expand and contract. And in the winter time, they expansion joints are open and if they fill with debris, or if they filled with rust, which occupies a lot more space than metal does, they will clog and in the summer, there'll be no place for the bridge to expand. But it has to, so it starts draining at the very bolts that - connected to piers of concrete or connected to the bedrock on either end on the mainland or Manhattan or Staten Island. And eventually, when those bolts sheer off, the bridge it will just start to walk around until finally one end of it collapses. FLATOW: Wendy(ph) in Spring Creek, Nevada. Hi. Welcome to Science Friday. WENDY (Caller): Hi. I love your show. I listen to it every week. I just love it. It's great. FLATOW: Thank you. WENDY: What is going to happen to all the atomic energy plants throughout the world when this thing happens? FLATOW: Good question. GUEST: That is a good question. And I have a whole chapter on that, Wendy. The - our atomic bombs aren't going to be much of a problem because they need propulsion that only we can provide to slam a couple of pieces of uranium together or to implode plutonium fast enough so it will explode. And therefore, when corrosion finally exposes the radioactive materials to the elements, they will just be very radioactive. But the plants are much more of a concern to me because there's a lot more radioactive materials in them. And what happens with the nuclear plant - I visit - I mean, two interesting examples. I go to Chernobyl, which of course has already had a bad accident. And I go to the newest one that we have in the United States, Palo Verde in Arizona. Palo Verde is very typical that if the plant suddenly were to shutdown, if a human personnel we're not there, it would shutdown, but a failsafe generators, diesel generators would come on to keep the water circulating around the reactors, which cools them. That diesel is only about a seven-day supply. So once that stops, if there were no human beings, the water around the reactors would start to evaporate because the reactors are very hot and depending on how much fuels in the reactor cycle, it would either catch fire or it would melt down. Now, we have 441 nuclear plants in the world and many of them have multiple reactors. So, those would be a lot of Chernobyls that the ecosystem would have to deal with. I mean, the present Chernobyl, of course, many of us know that the area right around the plant strangely enough has greater biodiversity than the area outside of the evacuated zones because there are no human beings there. So the animals and plants are rushing in. FLATOW: Even being radioactive, they survive. Mr. WEISMAN: Yeah. Well, the studies are showing that their life spans - the species that have been studied, their life spans seemed to be abbreviated and some of them may not do very well. No one really knows how the radiation will tumble down through generations and whether its effects - genetic effects will be cumulative. I really think that our nuclear plants would cause a tremendous problem in - whether we are here or not. The fact that so much of a radioactive wastes is just sitting alongside them in temporary storage until we figure out what to do with is was a fact that really came to me during the research I did all over the world for this book. FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour with Alan Weisman, author of \"The World Without Us. \" We're going to go to break and will come back and talk a little bit more with you. So stay with us. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Alan Weisman, author of \"The World Without Us,\" a meticulously written book. You know, in writing the book, you had to learn so much about how to build these things that eventually decay 1000, 2000 years from now, whatever\u2026 Mr. WEISMAN: Mm-hmm. FLATOW: Is there anything left of us to know that we were even here. Mr. WEISMAN: Oh, lots of things. FLATOW: Now, what will stay around? I imagine the plastics will last forever. Mr. WEISMAN: Yeah. There's a whole chapter on plastics, which was really one of those staggering journalistic experiences to learn amazing fact after amazing fact. A plastic isn't that old. It was invented in the beginning of the 20th century, but it didn't really enter the mainstream until, after World War II. And yet, now, we've got, you know, more than a billion tons of this stuff. There is so much of it out there. And it turns out that much of it ends up in the ocean. Perhaps, most of it. Because, you know, everything eventually erodes - goes to the sea. The plastic is much lighter than rocks, so it's getting there a lot faster. There are continent-size rafts of this stuff floating around in our oceans and wave action is breaking it up. And all the plastic, except for the little bit that's been incinerated, all the plastics ever made is still there. If it breaks up in the ocean into smaller and smaller particles, if it breaks up in land of ultra-violet heat, the plastic that is UV-sensitive, it still is there. It's just in smaller bits. And in the ocean, smaller and smaller creatures are mistaking it for something organic and they're eating it. And their systems will get clogged up if they eat too much of it or a piece that's too big for them to digest. And we don't know what the repercussions of this is going to be. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. WEISMAN: It was pretty enormous to find this out. Also, I'm assured by plastic experts that because of the hydrocarbon with various added elements to give it different kinds of properties, eventually, microbes will figure out how to digest it, but this could take thousands, hundreds of thousands, even millions of years. And it's, you know, just like it took microbes that long to figure out how to digest the lignin and cellulose in trees, until that happened, trees didn't decay. They eventually got buried and eventually got so compressed by what buried them that they turn into coal. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. WEISMAN: Well, this probably going to happen to plastic as well. FLATOW: Let's go to the phone for some questioning. Let's go to Malcolm(ph) in Cody, Wyoming. Hi, Malcolm. MALCOLM (Caller): Hi, there. FLATOW: Hi. MALCOLM: My question was if you addressed global warming at all. If we get to the tipping point where even if we're gone, if that's going to leave an impact in a long term. I'll take my question off the air. FLATOW: Okay, thanks for the call. Mr. WEISMAN: Okay, thanks. Yeah, I had to address global warming because, you know, the future is kind of a moving target right now. We're not sure where it's going. There are several different models and I point to a couple of different possibilities in various sections of the book of what we might expect. For example, the forest I mentioned before that will eventually cover New York City again and we know that it's going to be a combination of native species and combination of exotic species that we have introduced over time into New York. But, if the seas keep rising because of global warming, how much of Manhattan, for example, will be above the water. Certain parts of it, like Washington Heights, for example, or the hill in Central Park probably will be. But with the foliage there be native foliage or will we be looking at palmettos. We'll be seeing magnolia trees coming in there. Some of the models - and Ira, I know this has been discussed a lot on your show - indicate, you know, steadily warming temperatures. Some of them believe that we could be ushering in an ice age very quickly, particularly if cold freshwater from Greenland inundates the ocean conveyor and suddenly shuts that down or slows it down considerably. So, I looked at a few different models like this and tried to speculate or - I got experts to speculate, I'm just a journalist myself - and some of them also pointed out to some models that suggested some of these things might cancel out each other\u2026 FLATOW: Hmm. Mr. WEISMAN: \u2026if the temperatures stay stable for a while. FLATOW: And you did mention that eventually - even though we have high CO2 levels in there rising - that that will eventually lower itself as people are gone. Mr. WEISMAN: Well, if we were gone and smokestacks tomorrow stopped issuing more buried carbon into - or formally buried carbon - into the atmosphere, that would be an enormous relief, I think, for the ecosystem as we know it. I mean, the Earth has, in the past, have this much carbon in its atmosphere and it was a really different planet at that time. I think the last time was about 700,000 years ago and we know that there were, you know, tropical vegetations growing in Greenland and in Antarctica. Possibly, we would be looking at that again. But the consensus that I got from atmosphere scientists I talked to is that it would probably take around a hundred thousand years for all the carbon that we have put into the atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial revolution to be absorbed by a combination of ocean, the action of the biosphere plants, et cetera, and geologic cycles itself. You know, rain will dissolve carbon dioxide and then the carbolic acid will then dissolve rocks and eventually the stuff precipitates out in the form of limestone, shells, all sorts of things. Most of that would probably happen during the first thousand years, it takes the sea a thousand years to turn over, but again, we're looking at models of something that no one has ever witnessed before. So scientists are doing their best to try to get in all the variables into this huge ecosystem model, to predict what's going to happen. FLATOW: Let's go the phones. To Melody(ph) in Syracuse, New York. Hi, Melody. MELODY (Caller): Hi. I know that Northern Europe has a tremendous human imprint left on it and I was thinking of places like The Netherlands, with the dykes, and so many places. Have you thought about the impact there, how long will it take the dykes to collapse or erode? Mr. WEISMAN: My best guess, because I did not get to The Netherlands for this, but I did look at other dyke and dam systems elsewhere, is that all the dykes and the dams require human maintenance. And if human beings would not maintain it - for example, I went to one of the biggest pieces of infrastructure on Earth, the Panama Canal. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. WEISMAN: And a tropical river, which - you know, this is the rainforest there, which runs into what is the canal is being held back by a series of earthen dams. Earthen dams or cement dams, it doesn't matter. These dams will all fail without human maintenance. They have to be opened, the floodgates\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Mr. WEISMAN: \u2026has to be opened from time to time to let currents through or let the tides through, or they will erode and - if they are not being maintained. And yes, Holland will definitely eventually flood again, if those dykes are not maintained. FLATOW: But\u2026 Mr. WEISMAN: We haven't built anything permanent that will hold back the sea. FLATOW: Well, let's talk about what you saw as the most permanent, most permanent kinds of structures. Could they be the oldest - you mentioned the ones that are made - that are masonry or made out of stone. Will they virtually last almost for eons? Mr. WEISMAN: Well, I think their building blocks will certainly last. Stone, of course, is the stuff of the Earth itself\u2026 FLATOW: The pyramids, either in Egypt or in South America, things like that. Are they going to be around much longer than anything we have built here? Mr. WEISMAN: The pyramid - I mean, just consider it now a mountain, you know. It used to have marble all over it, which was carded away by the Arabs to build Alexandria, but - or to built Cairo, I'm sorry. But today, it is just eroding like any other mountain and it'll probably be around a million years or more. Probably much more, but its going to get steadily, steadily lower. I would say that some of our most resilient structures will be like Machu Picchu, those not only made out of stone, but those stones are fit together so beautifully that\u2026 FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. WEISMAN: \u2026they're not that dependent on mortar, they're dependent on gravity to hold them together, and they're going to be pretty resilient. In New York City, I mentioned that St. Paul's Chapel, the oldest building in the city, which is across the street from the World Trade Center, it's built out of Manhattan schist, the same thing island's made out of. So, that's going to be around for a long time. And even if eventually it topples, well, it's building blocks will be there. But concrete and steel, they're not going to last that long. Steel corrodes and the steel rebar inside of concrete, it expands and it just - it flakes away the concrete pretty fast. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And of course, then you have things like earthquakes. They could shake up a lot of things. Mr. WEISMAN: Well, absolutely. And of course in the case of Manhattan, eventually, there's going to be another ice age. There've been a lot of them and no matter what we're doing to the atmosphere, once that dies down, the ice will scrape the island clean again. Thinking about that, I did go visit some of the underground infrastructure that human beings have created there, some underground cities in central Turkey that go down at least 18 stories. They keep discovering more. And a glacier going over the top of that would probably just bury it a little deeper. How did you know where to stop? Mr. WEISMAN: There are a lot of ways to think about the planet and what it is that we do to it. But most important, ultimately, was the fact that I really wasn't suggesting that we have been horrible for the planet and that the planet would be much better off without us. I think that we are a valuable species as valuable as any other species. I think that we have grown so powerful that we can go so far and dig so deep and harvest so much. And most of all, there are so many of us that our impact really has to come back into better balance of nature. And that's why I wrote this book. The question is do we want to manage it or have nature do it for us? FLATOW: Alan Weisman, author of \"The World without Us,\" a terrific read, something you should pick up this weekend. Thank you very much for\u2026 Mr. WEISMAN: Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: \u2026taking time to be with us.  IRA FLATOW, host:  From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.

FLATOW: You start out with New York City, I guess, because it's a really interesting place to watch what happens when the people disappear, and you talked about how important - what happens with water when it's allowed to get into places that we have no control over anymore?  Mr. WEISMAN: Well, in the previous chapter, I show how our houses are something that are certainly vulnerable to water. Anybody who's ever had a roof leak knows about that. But even our big cement cities, same thing happens. But in the case is New York - and I imagine several other cities - it would actually start underneath the city, not on the roof. Subway engineers took me through the bowels of the city and showed me how the history of the city can be seen down there in the rushing water that is coming out of the ground all the time.  New York used to be a hilly city. The name Manhattan refers to hills - it's an old Algonquian term Manahetta(ph) - and there were 40-some streams and rivers on the surface that would, of course, drain water away to the sea. When those hills got smashed down to superimpose the grid on the cities, the rivers were pushed underground. And even on a sunny day, they're pumping about 13 million gallons of groundwater in a rising water table, up, out of the city into the sea.  If the power went off, nearly 800 pumps would go silent and the subways would flood. And then the columns that are holding up the streets would start to rust, then start to corrode, and they give it about two decades before they would start to collapse. And the streets would start to crater and some of that water would then become surface water once again. And at the same time the foundations in a lot of buildings would start to become waterlogged and they would also corrode and eventually become destabilized, because they were built to be standing in water.  FLATOW: Then you say that eventually our skyscrapers would be just blown over by the wind.  Mr. WEISMAN: Well, a destabilized skyscraper would be very susceptible to high winds and of course New York, being a coastal city, has been hit by hurricanes before. There's some speculation that we may be seeing more hurricanes around the East Coast and perhaps more powerful ones in the decades to come. And a destabilized skyscraper - we all know that skyscrapers will sway in the wind -this will - if it topples, it will probably do the same thing as the big tree does when it topples in the forest. It takes down some other trees standing around it with it. And that's actually going to be kind of good for the succession of forests in the city. New York was once completely forest that, of course, and trees will be already colonizing in the streets.  They'll be growing in the leaf litter that will be filling the gutters in the streets, because no one will be raking the streets, and no one will be unclogging in the sewers that will probably have plastic bags stuck over the top of them. And the crumbling concrete will have a line to the soil, which will make it less acidic, so more and more plants, types of plants will be able to colonize.  FLATOW: Hmm. And you also talked about how quickly, you know, New York is famous, also for its majestic bridges. How quickly the bridges will crumble?  Mr. WEISMAN: The bridges will not exactly crumble, as they will begin to fall into the bodies of water below them. Because a bridge has to be maintained all the time. That means painting it and that means clearing the debris that will gather in the expansion joints. Now, bridges which are made up of metal usually - except for the very old ones, the stone ones, they expand and contract. And in the winter time, they expansion joints are open and if they fill with debris, or if they filled with rust, which occupies a lot more space than metal does, they will clog and in the summer, there'll be no place for the bridge to expand. But it has to, so it starts draining at the very bolts that - connected to piers of concrete or connected to the bedrock on either end on the mainland or Manhattan or Staten Island. And eventually, when those bolts sheer off, the bridge it will just start to walk around until finally one end of it collapses.  FLATOW: Wendy(ph) in Spring Creek, Nevada. Hi. Welcome to Science Friday.  WENDY (Caller): Hi. I love your show. I listen to it every week. I just love it. It's great.  FLATOW: Thank you.  WENDY: What is going to happen to all the atomic energy plants throughout the world when this thing happens?  FLATOW: Good question.  GUEST: That is a good question. And I have a whole chapter on that, Wendy. The - our atomic bombs aren't going to be much of a problem because they need propulsion that only we can provide to slam a couple of pieces of uranium together or to implode plutonium fast enough so it will explode. And therefore, when corrosion finally exposes the radioactive materials to the elements, they will just be very radioactive. But the plants are much more of a concern to me because there's a lot more radioactive materials in them.  And what happens with the nuclear plant - I visit - I mean, two interesting examples. I go to Chernobyl, which of course has already had a bad accident. And I go to the newest one that we have in the United States, Palo Verde in Arizona. Palo Verde is very typical that if the plant suddenly were to shutdown, if a human personnel we're not there, it would shutdown, but a failsafe generators, diesel generators would come on to keep the water circulating around the reactors, which cools them. That diesel is only about a seven-day supply. So once that stops, if there were no human beings, the water around the reactors would start to evaporate because the reactors are very hot and depending on how much fuels in the reactor cycle, it would either catch fire or it would melt down.  Now, we have 441 nuclear plants in the world and many of them have multiple reactors. So, those would be a lot of Chernobyls that the ecosystem would have to deal with. I mean, the present Chernobyl, of course, many of us know that the area right around the plant strangely enough has greater biodiversity than the area outside of the evacuated zones because there are no human beings there. So the animals and plants are rushing in.  FLATOW: Even being radioactive, they survive.  Mr. WEISMAN: Yeah. Well, the studies are showing that their life spans - the species that have been studied, their life spans seemed to be abbreviated and some of them may not do very well. No one really knows how the radiation will tumble down through generations and whether its effects - genetic effects will be cumulative. I really think that our nuclear plants would cause a tremendous problem in - whether we are here or not. The fact that so much of a radioactive wastes is just sitting alongside them in temporary storage until we figure out what to do with is was a fact that really came to me during the research I did all over the world for this book.  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour with Alan Weisman, author of \"The World Without Us. \"  We're going to go to break and will come back and talk a little bit more with you. So stay with us.  I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Alan Weisman, author of \"The World Without Us,\" a meticulously written book.  You know, in writing the book, you had to learn so much about how to build these things that eventually decay 1000, 2000 years from now, whatever\u2026  Mr. WEISMAN: Mm-hmm.  FLATOW: Is there anything left of us to know that we were even here.  Mr. WEISMAN: Oh, lots of things.  FLATOW: Now, what will stay around? I imagine the plastics will last forever.  Mr. WEISMAN: Yeah. There's a whole chapter on plastics, which was really one of those staggering journalistic experiences to learn amazing fact after amazing fact. A plastic isn't that old. It was invented in the beginning of the 20th century, but it didn't really enter the mainstream until, after World War II.  And yet, now, we've got, you know, more than a billion tons of this stuff. There is so much of it out there. And it turns out that much of it ends up in the ocean. Perhaps, most of it. Because, you know, everything eventually erodes - goes to the sea. The plastic is much lighter than rocks, so it's getting there a lot faster. There are continent-size rafts of this stuff floating around in our oceans and wave action is breaking it up.  And all the plastic, except for the little bit that's been incinerated, all the plastics ever made is still there. If it breaks up in the ocean into smaller and smaller particles, if it breaks up in land of ultra-violet heat, the plastic that is UV-sensitive, it still is there. It's just in smaller bits. And in the ocean, smaller and smaller creatures are mistaking it for something organic and they're eating it. And their systems will get clogged up if they eat too much of it or a piece that's too big for them to digest. And we don't know what the repercussions of this is going to be.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Mr. WEISMAN: It was pretty enormous to find this out. Also, I'm assured by plastic experts that because of the hydrocarbon with various added elements to give it different kinds of properties, eventually, microbes will figure out how to digest it, but this could take thousands, hundreds of thousands, even millions of years. And it's, you know, just like it took microbes that long to figure out how to digest the lignin and cellulose in trees, until that happened, trees didn't decay. They eventually got buried and eventually got so compressed by what buried them that they turn into coal.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Mr. WEISMAN: Well, this probably going to happen to plastic as well.  FLATOW: Let's go to the phone for some questioning. Let's go to Malcolm(ph) in Cody, Wyoming. Hi, Malcolm.  MALCOLM (Caller): Hi, there.  FLATOW: Hi.  MALCOLM: My question was if you addressed global warming at all. If we get to the tipping point where even if we're gone, if that's going to leave an impact in a long term. I'll take my question off the air.  FLATOW: Okay, thanks for the call.  Mr. WEISMAN: Okay, thanks. Yeah, I had to address global warming because, you know, the future is kind of a moving target right now. We're not sure where it's going. There are several different models and I point to a couple of different possibilities in various sections of the book of what we might expect.  For example, the forest I mentioned before that will eventually cover New York City again and we know that it's going to be a combination of native species and combination of exotic species that we have introduced over time into New York. But, if the seas keep rising because of global warming, how much of Manhattan, for example, will be above the water. Certain parts of it, like Washington Heights, for example, or the hill in Central Park probably will be. But with the foliage there be native foliage or will we be looking at palmettos. We'll be seeing magnolia trees coming in there.  Some of the models - and Ira, I know this has been discussed a lot on your show - indicate, you know, steadily warming temperatures. Some of them believe that we could be ushering in an ice age very quickly, particularly if cold freshwater from Greenland inundates the ocean conveyor and suddenly shuts that down or slows it down considerably. So, I looked at a few different models like this and tried to speculate or - I got experts to speculate, I'm just a journalist myself - and some of them also pointed out to some models that suggested some of these things might cancel out each other\u2026  FLATOW: Hmm.  Mr. WEISMAN: \u2026if the temperatures stay stable for a while.  FLATOW: And you did mention that eventually - even though we have high CO2 levels in there rising - that that will eventually lower itself as people are gone.  Mr. WEISMAN: Well, if we were gone and smokestacks tomorrow stopped issuing more buried carbon into - or formally buried carbon - into the atmosphere, that would be an enormous relief, I think, for the ecosystem as we know it. I mean, the Earth has, in the past, have this much carbon in its atmosphere and it was a really different planet at that time. I think the last time was about 700,000 years ago and we know that there were, you know, tropical vegetations growing in Greenland and in Antarctica. Possibly, we would be looking at that again.  But the consensus that I got from atmosphere scientists I talked to is that it would probably take around a hundred thousand years for all the carbon that we have put into the atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial revolution to be absorbed by a combination of ocean, the action of the biosphere plants, et cetera, and geologic cycles itself. You know, rain will dissolve carbon dioxide and then the carbolic acid will then dissolve rocks and eventually the stuff precipitates out in the form of limestone, shells, all sorts of things.  Most of that would probably happen during the first thousand years, it takes the sea a thousand years to turn over, but again, we're looking at models of something that no one has ever witnessed before. So scientists are doing their best to try to get in all the variables into this huge ecosystem model, to predict what's going to happen.  FLATOW: Let's go the phones. To Melody(ph) in Syracuse, New York. Hi, Melody.  MELODY (Caller): Hi. I know that Northern Europe has a tremendous human imprint left on it and I was thinking of places like The Netherlands, with the dykes, and so many places. Have you thought about the impact there, how long will it take the dykes to collapse or erode?  Mr. WEISMAN: My best guess, because I did not get to The Netherlands for this, but I did look at other dyke and dam systems elsewhere, is that all the dykes and the dams require human maintenance. And if human beings would not maintain it - for example, I went to one of the biggest pieces of infrastructure on Earth, the Panama Canal.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Mr. WEISMAN: And a tropical river, which - you know, this is the rainforest there, which runs into what is the canal is being held back by a series of earthen dams. Earthen dams or cement dams, it doesn't matter. These dams will all fail without human maintenance. They have to be opened, the floodgates\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. WEISMAN: \u2026has to be opened from time to time to let currents through or let the tides through, or they will erode and - if they are not being maintained. And yes, Holland will definitely eventually flood again, if those dykes are not maintained.  FLATOW: But\u2026  Mr. WEISMAN: We haven't built anything permanent that will hold back the sea.  FLATOW: Well, let's talk about what you saw as the most permanent, most permanent kinds of structures. Could they be the oldest - you mentioned the ones that are made - that are masonry or made out of stone. Will they virtually last almost for eons?  Mr. WEISMAN: Well, I think their building blocks will certainly last. Stone, of course, is the stuff of the Earth itself\u2026  FLATOW: The pyramids, either in Egypt or in South America, things like that. Are they going to be around much longer than anything we have built here?  Mr. WEISMAN: The pyramid - I mean, just consider it now a mountain, you know. It used to have marble all over it, which was carded away by the Arabs to build Alexandria, but - or to built Cairo, I'm sorry. But today, it is just eroding like any other mountain and it'll probably be around a million years or more. Probably much more, but its going to get steadily, steadily lower. I would say that some of our most resilient structures will be like Machu Picchu, those not only made out of stone, but those stones are fit together so beautifully that\u2026  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Mr. WEISMAN: \u2026they're not that dependent on mortar, they're dependent on gravity to hold them together, and they're going to be pretty resilient. In New York City, I mentioned that St. Paul's Chapel, the oldest building in the city, which is across the street from the World Trade Center, it's built out of Manhattan schist, the same thing island's made out of. So, that's going to be around for a long time. And even if eventually it topples, well, it's building blocks will be there. But concrete and steel, they're not going to last that long. Steel corrodes and the steel rebar inside of concrete, it expands and it just - it flakes away the concrete pretty fast.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And of course, then you have things like earthquakes. They could shake up a lot of things.  Mr. WEISMAN: Well, absolutely. And of course in the case of Manhattan, eventually, there's going to be another ice age. There've been a lot of them and no matter what we're doing to the atmosphere, once that dies down, the ice will scrape the island clean again. Thinking about that, I did go visit some of the underground infrastructure that human beings have created there, some underground cities in central Turkey that go down at least 18 stories. They keep discovering more. And a glacier going over the top of that would probably just bury it a little deeper. How did you know where to stop?  Mr. WEISMAN: There are a lot of ways to think about the planet and what it is that we do to it. But most important, ultimately, was the fact that I really wasn't suggesting that we have been horrible for the planet and that the planet would be much better off without us. I think that we are a valuable species as valuable as any other species. I think that we have grown so powerful that we can go so far and dig so deep and harvest so much. And most of all, there are so many of us that our impact really has to come back into better balance of nature. And that's why I wrote this book. The question is do we want to manage it or have nature do it for us?  FLATOW: Alan Weisman, author of \"The World without Us,\" a terrific read, something you should pick up this weekend. Thank you very much for\u2026  Mr. WEISMAN: Thank you, Ira.  FLATOW: \u2026taking time to be with us. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2007 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Ira Flatow. For 17 years, one award has saluted the strange and silly in science.  Giving awards for achievements that first make you laugh and then make you think. This year, our post-Thanksgiving selection of highlights from the 17th First Annual Ig Nobel Awards. We won't be taking calls this hour, so please don't try to call in. But if you want more information about what we're talking about, go to our Web site at sciencefriday. com, where you'll find links to our topic. The Ig Nobel awards are presented each year by the science humor magazine the Annals of Improbable Research. In the past, they've honored the inventor of the pink plastic lawn flamingo, saluted research into why woodpeckers don't get headaches - I like that - and given the inventor of karaoke a peace prize. What's untapped this year? Well I don't know, but it taste like chicken. We take you now to the Sanders Theatre at Harvard University, where Marc Abrahams, ringleader of the Ig's is preparing to take the stage.

KAREN: Marc Abrahams. Unidentified Man #5: Marc Abrahams. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. MARC ABRAHAMS (Editor, Annals of Improbable Research): Thank you, Karen. We are gathered here tonight to honor some remarkable individuals and groups. Every winner has done something that, first, makes people laugh and then makes them think. The Ig Nobel Prize ceremony is produced by the science humor magazine, the Annals of Improbable Research. It's cosponsored, probably, by the Harvard-Radcliffe Science Fiction Association, by the Harvard-Radcliffe Society of Physics Students and by the Harvard Computer Society. Tonight, 10 prizes will be given. The achievements speak for themselves all too eloquently. And now, Professor Jean Berko Gleason will deliver the traditional Ig Nobel welcome, welcome speech. (Soundbite of applause) Dr. JEAN BERKO GLEASON (Psychology, Radcliffe-Harvard University): Welcome. Welcome. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: The editors of the Annals of Improbable Research have chosen a theme for this year's ceremony. And this year's theme is chicken. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: To honor the theme of chicken, we have a keynote speech. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: Our keynote speech is delivered by the man, who, in certain respect, is the world's top authority on chicken. Please welcome, Doug Zongker. (Soundbite of applause) Dr. DOUG ZONGKER (Senior Software Engineer, Google): Chicken. Chicken, chicken, chicken. Chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken. Chicken. Chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken. Chicken. Chicken, chicken. Chicken, chicken, chickens, chicken, chickens, chickens, chickens, chickens, chicken, chickens, chickens, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken.

(Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: Sanders Theater regulations prohibit the flying or the throwing of chickens. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: And now let's get it over with. Ladies and gentlemen the awarding of the 2007 Ig Nobel Prizes. We're giving our 10 prizes. The winners come from many nations on five continents. These year's winners have truly earned their prizes. Karen, tell them what they've won. (Soundbite of laughter) KAREN: Thank you. Oh, this year's Ig Nobel Prize winners each win an Ig Nobel Prize. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: What else? KAREN: A piece of paper, saying they've won an Ig Nobel Prize signed by several Nobel laureates. Mr. ABRAHAMS: And what else? KAREN: Ah. That's it. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: How wonderful. Thank you, Karen. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: This is the coveted Ig Nobel Prize. FLATOW: Ten prizes are awarded each year. Winners travel to the Ig ceremony at their own expense. Some winners embrace the awards, others just try to hide from it, and some just - well, they just don't know what to think. Mr. ABRAHAMS: And now, our winners. First, the medicine prize. (Soundbite of music) Mr. ABRAHAMS: Ig Nobel Medicine Prize this year is awarded to Brian Witcombe of Gloucester in the U. K. and Dan Meyer of Antioch, Tennessee in the U. S. for their penetrating medical report \"Sword Swallowing and Its Side Effects. \" (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: Here are Brian Witcombe and Dan Meyer. (Soundbite of applause) Dr. BRIAN WITCOMBE (Radiologist; Winner, Ig Nobel Medicine Prize): Ladies and gentlemen, knowledge often advances when people from different fields of activity come together to look at an issue of mutual interests from different perspectives. And so it was with this study. A semi-retired hospital radiologist, who had an occasional interest in patients with swallowing disorders, that's me, came into contact with one of the world's greatest sword swallowers, Dan Meyer. Dan Meyer is not only an outstanding sword swallower with the U. S. record for swallowing swords underwater\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. WITCOMBE: \u2026but he also maintains a comprehensive database of over 100 sword swallowers in more than 16 countries. And this formed the basis of our survey. I am extremely grateful for Dan for his energetic and meticulous and sometimes humorous input, and we are both, of course, extremely grateful for those that bestowed this great honor upon us. Finally, we are also grateful to our peer reviewer, Dr. Katherine Gribanick(ph), a London consultant cardiothoracic anesthetist who recommended publication of paper to the British Medical Journal editors, saying our paper was a cut above many others\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. WITCOMBE: \u2026add it to the incisive body of literature on sword swallowing. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. WITCOMBE: And she wrote it, made its points well and would keep the BMJ at the cutting edge of sword-swallowing literature. (Soundbite of applause) Dr. WITCOMBE: And finally, we're, of course, grateful to all the members of the sword-swallowing fraternity and our medical colleagues. Mr. ABRAHAMS: Oh. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: The Peace Prize\u2026 (Soundbite of music) Mr. ABRAHAMS: The Ig Nobel Peace Prize is awarded this year to the Air Force Wright Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio, USA, for instigating research and development on a chemical weapon, the so-called, gay bomb\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: \u2026that will make enemy soldiers become sexually irresistible to each other. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: The winners could not or would not be with us tonight. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: But we have a demonstration. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: I'm afraid the V-chip of monitor has called off our demonstration. (Soundbite of booing) FLATOW: We'll be right back with more Ig action right after this break. Stay with us. I'm Ira Flatow. And this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. No, we're not chicken. Oh, well, maybe we are. But anyway, here comes more Ig silliness. We now return you to Harvard Sanders Theatre for highlights from this year's 17th First Annual Ig Nobel Awards. Mr. ABRAHAMS: And now, it's time for the win-a-date-with-a-Nobel-laureate contest. (Soundbite of cheering) KAREN: He's shapely, he's sassy and he is smarter than you. (Soundbite of laughter) KAREN: Robert B. Laughlin won the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics for explaining how a strong magnetic field can cause electrons to melt into a rich, creamy quantum fluid. (Soundbite of laughter) KAREN: Raised amidst the walnuts and other nuts in the San Joaquin Valley, Laughlin enjoys playing the piano, taking apart vacuum cleaners, and watching quasi particles behaving badly. (Soundbite of laughter) KAREN: If you think a cool, quantum cocktail with a twist of fractional charge sounds like the perfect nightcap, Bob is that bartender for you. (Soundbite of laughter) KAREN: Please give a warm, win-a-date welcome to Robert Laughlin. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: All right, now let's see which lucky audience member will win a date with this Nobel laureate. When you entered the hall, you were handed an attractive, printed program. Pick it up, open it and look through it. See if you find a picture of a chicken confusedly standing in a crosswalk. If you have that picture in your program, then you've won a date, come on up and claim your prize. (Soundbite of a woman screaming) Mr. ABRAHAMS: Take it up back, kids, that's okay. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: Now, get set for something special - the 24/7 lectures. We have invited several of the world's top thinkers to try to tell us very briefly what they're thinking about. Each 24/7 lecturer will explain her or his topic twice. First, a complete technical description in 24 seconds, and then after a brief pause, a clear summary that anyone can understand in seven words. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: The 24-second time limit will be enforced by Mr. John Barrett, our referee. Now, let's have the first group of 24/7 lecturers. Will the poultry inspectors bar the doors? (Soundbite of cheering) Mr. ABRAHAMS: The first 24/7 lecture will be delivered by Massimo Marcone, assistant professor of food science at the University of Guelph. His topic: food science. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: First, a complete technical description in 24 seconds. On your mark, get set, go. Professor MASSIMO MARCONE (Food Science, University of Guelph): Food science is an interdisciplinary applied science, which uses principled experimental designs, statistical analysis in the examination of all aspects of foods, from harvest of the ingredients to their behavior during formulation, processing, storage and evaluation as consumer food products. It incorporates concepts from a variety of fields, including chemistry, microbiology and processing and engineering. In a nutshell, food science is concerned with all quality, nutritional, sensory, cultural and safety aspects of foods. (Soundbite of cheering) Mr. ABRAHAMS: A clear summary that anyone can understand in seven words. On your mark, get set, go. Prof. MARCONE: Foods that don't kill make you fatter. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: The Physics Prize\u2026 (Soundbite of cheering) Mr. ABRAHAMS: This year's Ig Nobel Physics Prize is presented to Mahadevan of Harvard University and Enrique Cerda Villablanca of Universidad de Santiago de Chile for studying how sheets become wrinkled. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: Here are Mahadevan and Professor Villablanca's sister, Mariella. (Soundbite of cheering) Ms. MARIELLA VILLABLANCA: My brother dedicates his Ig Nobel Prize to all the wrinkled people in the world\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. VILLABLANCA: \u2026especially to our beautiful grandmother. Thank you. (Soundbite of cheering) Professor L. MAHADEVAN (Applied Mathematics, Harvard University): Wrinkle, wrinkle on my skin, how I wonder did you begin? By sagging and swelling and shrinking too, while stretching and bending or mixed into a brew, until, aha, a formula that sits on a pin. How infinitely familiar, how far from (unintelligible) environment is. And no one reminds us of this every day besides our children. So I thank them all particularly our two (unintelligible). Wrinkle, wrinkle on my skin, where I wonder did I sin? Celebrated an art drapery until, aha, pruned by surgery and then just a has-been. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: The Chemistry Prize. (Soundbite of music) Mr. ABRAHAMS: The Ig Nobel Chemistry Prize of this year is presented to Mayu Yamamoto of the International Medical Center of Japan for developing a way to extract vanillin, the flavor and fragrance of vanilla, from cow dung. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: Here is Mayu Yamamoto. (Soundbite of applause) Ms. MAYU YAMAMOTO (Researcher, Yamamoto of the International Medical Center): Thank you. Peace, mate. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. YAMAMOTO: What kind of smell you encounter when the cow dung are heated? Can you imagine that? It's a very strange and sweet. Please eat ice cream with cow dung. Thank you. (Soundbite of cheering) Mr. ABRAHAMS: Now, here is a special tribute to Mayu Yamamoto. Please welcome, Gus Rancatore, the owner of Toscanini's ice cream. (Soundbite of cheering) Mr. GUS RANCATORE (Owner, Toscanini's Ice Cream): Thank you very much. This was a very difficult year in the ice cream business. There were dramatic increases in dairy costs and real estate costs, and Ms. Yamamoto's achievement stood out like a lantern. And Toscanini's was inspired enough to imitate her achievement. And we have samples for the laureates. (Soundbite of cheering) Unidentified Group: Eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it\u2026 (Soundbite of cheering) Mr. ABRAHAMS: The next 24/7 lecture will be delivered by Jill Lepore, professor of history at Harvard University. Her topic: history. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: First, a complete technical description of the subject in 24 seconds. On your mark, get set, go. Professor JILL LEPORE (History, Harvard University): History is in an enduring travel to an archive repository or a library, bring in pencil, fill out little (unintelligible); be the chicken scratch of letters, diaries, love notes, speeches, scrapbooks, (unintelligible), unopened mails, stranger and wondrous people you've never met and never will but you probably should could have. Find out everything you can about how they understood why hens lay eggs. Think about it. Think about it some more, and then make up some cock-and-ball story. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: And now a clear summary that anyone can understand in seven words. On your mark, get set, go. Prof. LEPORE: History is the study of dead people. (Soundbite of cheering) Mr. ABRAHAMS: The next 24/7 lecture will be delivered by Fariba Houman, the interim director of human subjects administration at the Harvard School of Public Health. Her topic: research ethics. First, a complete technical description in 24 seconds. On your mark, get set, go. Dr. FARIBA HOUMAN (Interim Director, Human Subjects Committee, Harvard School of Public Health): The ethical conduct of non-exempt human subjects research is governed by set of rules fortified by 45-C and 446; in a phase two trial of avian flu vaccine in a cohort of handlers - animal handlers of broiler chickens. (Soundbite of cheering) Mr. ABRAHAMS: And now, a clear summary that anyone can understand in seven words. On your mark, get set go. Dr. HOUMAN: Research on animal handlers needs IRB approval. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: The final 24/7 lecture will be delivered by Nobel laureate William Lipscomb. His topic: chicken. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: First, complete technical summary in 24 seconds. On your mark, get set, go. Dr. WILLIAM LIPSCOMB (Nobel Laureate): It is very surprising how many references there are in the Internet for chicken. (Soundbite of audience) Dr. LIPSCOMB: Unbelievable. I could go through them, but I don't have much time here. (Soundbite of audience laughing) Dr. LIPSCOMB: No one has asked why a chicken crosses the road - to go across the road. (Soundbite of whistle) Dr. LIPSCOMB: Uh-oh. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: And now, a sclear summary that anyone can understand in seven words. On your mark, get set, go. Dr. LIPSCOMB: Chicken lays egg. It's a standing ovation. (Soundbite of laughter and applause) FLATOW: The Igs are a tribute to the good, the bad and the ugly in science - or at least the strange, silly and the unusual. Where else would levitating frogs, pink plastic flamingos and the beauty preferences of chicken find the highest honors? The awards were handed out on early October at Harvard's Sanders Theatre. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: The biology prize. The Ig Nobel biology prize this year is presented to Dr. Johanna E. M. H. van Bronswijk of Eindhoven University of Technology in The Netherlands for doing a census of all the mites, insects, spiders, pseudoscorpions, crustaceans, bacteria, algae, ferns and fungi with whom we share our beds each night. Here is Professor van Bronswijk. (Soundbite of applause) Dr. JOHANNA E. M. H. van BRONSWIJK (Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands): So my products of energy studies that I started as a student 30 years ago, I found that you never sleep alone. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. van BRONSWIJK: Nature does not stop at the windowsill. We're only organism in the midst of millions in the dwelling community. In the seat you are using now\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. van BRONSWIJK: \u2026mites are following your sweat to the far sites of the cushions. It's little worse on the chairs because they're textile, which also the - also seats have this problem. Our daily production of one to one-and-a-half gram skin scales feeds mites, fungi, bacteria and algae. Hence, when humidity in air or textiles is little higher, also, book lice and wood flies sometimes, one or two young cockroaches\u2026 Ms. SWEETY-POO: Please stop. Dr. van BRONSWIJK: \u2026(unintelligible). Ms. SWEETY-POO: \u2026I'm bored. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. SWEETY-POO: Please stop. I'm bored. Dr. van BRONSWIJK: It is with much pleasure that I accept the prize\u2026 Ms. SWEETY-POO: Please stop. I'm bored. Dr. van BRONSWIJK: \u2026and hope it will help public understanding\u2026 Ms. SWEETY-POO: Please stop. I'm bored. Dr. van BRONSWIJK: \u2026of the natural processes we belong to. Ms. SWEETY-POO: Please stop. I'm bored. Dr. van BRONSWIJK: Thank you. (Soundbite of applause) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow and this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Ten prizes are award each year. Winners travel to the Ig ceremony at their own expense. The creators of the award say they intended to spur public curiosity and interest in science, or maybe they're just funny. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: The Economics Prize. The Ig Nobel Economics Prize this year is awarded to Kuo Cheng Hsieh of Taichung, Taiwan for patenting a device in the year 2001 that catches bank robbers by dropping a net over them. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: The Ig Nobel board of governors has attempted repeatedly to send people to locate Mr. Hsieh, but none of them were able to - he seems to have vanished mysteriously. If anyone knows the whereabouts of this poor man, please get in touch with us. It was suggested to us - and we hope this is not the case - that there is a possibility that the gentleman was trapped inside his own machine. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: And\u2026 (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: Thank you. The Linguistics Prize. (Soundbite of music) Mr. ABRAHAMS: the Ig Nobel Linguistics Prize is awarded to Juan Manuel Toro, Josep B. Trobalon and Nuria Sebastian-Galles of Universitat de Barcelona for showing that rats sometimes cannot tell the difference between a person speaking Japanese backwards and a person speaking Dutch backwards. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. LAUGHLIN: The winners could not travel to the ceremony. And so they prepared a video acceptance speech. Here on video is Juan Manuel Toro. Dr. JUAN MANUEL TORO (Universitat de Barcelona): The basic idea is that for everybody, it's very easy to discriminate between an English sentence such as this one and a Spanish sentence (speaking in Spanish). But it is not so easy to discriminate between them when they are played backwards as in here. (Soundbite of recorded voice played backwards) Dr. TORO: This basically because in backwards speech, some very important prosaic features are lost. But the real interesting point is that the same processing constraints are found in human adults, in human infant, in tamarin monkeys and even in rats. So anyway, for us, it's a pleasure and an honor to join the club of the Ig Nobel winners and thank you so much for the prize. Ciao. (Soundbite of applause) FLATOW: We'll be right back with more Ig action right after this break. Stay with us. I'm Ira Flatow and this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. Don't try to adjust your set. We now return you to your regularly scheduled Ig Nobel Awards, already in progress. The awards feature a human spotlight, plenty of paper airplanes, Nobel laureates wielding trumpets, a V-chip monitor to screen out potentially offensive material and an onstage experiment, in which the award's major domo eats a never ending bowl of soup. Unidentified Woman #4: Ig. Unidentified Woman #5: Ig. Unidentified Group: Ig Nobel. Unidentified Woman #4: Ig. Unidentified Man #5: Ig. Unidentified Group: Ig Nobel. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: The Nutrition Prize. The Ig Noble Nutrition Prize is awarded to Brian Wansink of Cornell University for exploring the seemingly boundless appetites of human beings by feeding them with a self-refilling, bottomless bowl of soup. Here is Professor Wansink. Dr. BRIAN WANSINK (Marketing and Nutritional Science, Cornell University): An ode to a soup bowl. Oh, say can you see my soup bowl refill? But because it's not empty, I keep eating still. I've eaten 14 ounces, but little do I know there's a tube in the bottom and I've got six quarts to go. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. WANSINK: Some geek in a red apron just told me to stop. I'm starving, I tell him, the soup is still at the top. Now, do we eat with our eyes? Our eyes do the cheating. It's a psychology of food. It explains my book mindless eating. So if you use a bowl's bottom to tell you you're through, you'll find six quarts later, the last laugh's on you. (Soundbite of applause) FLATOW: These awards are given out by the science humor magazine, the Annals of Improbable Research. You can find out more about the awards and the magazine at improbable. com. A team of genuine Nobel laureates hand out the awards to the winners, who receive a handmade price, a certificate, and untold glory and fame. Mr. ABRAHAMS: We are honored to have with us several past winners of Ig Nobel prizes who have kindly joined us tonight. We'll ask each of them to come up and very briefly say a word. First, the 2006 Ig Nobel Acoustics Prize was awarded to the team who conducted experiments to learn why it is that people dislike the sound of fingernails scraping on a blackboard. Please welcome back Lynn Halpern. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: When she shows up, you can welcome her properly. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. HERSCHBACH: You'll hear her first. Mr. ABRAHAMS: Yes. Dudley points out we will hear her - okay. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: The 2005 - if it's especially good, that's fine. But the 2005 Ig Noble Economics Prize was awarded to the inventor of an alarm clock that runs away and hides repeatedly, thus insuring that people do get out of bed. Please welcome back, Gauri Nanda. (Soundbite of applause) Dr. GAURI NANDA (Massachusetts Institute of Technology): So for generations, roosters have been waking us up and chickens can wake us up too but most of us don't have that option. So I made an alarm clock that runs away. (Soundbite of alarm) Dr. NANDA: So it'll actually fall to the floor when you hit the snooze button and then run around the room, so you kind of have to go and find it. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. NANDA: Just turn it off. Thank you. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: The 1996 Ig Nobel Art Prize was awarded to the creator of the plastic pink flamingo. Please welcome back Don Featherstone and his wife Nancy Featherstone. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. DON FEATHERSTONE (Artist): Oh, he thinks he's a chicken. I'm happy to say the pink flamingo look like it was going to be - going the way of the dodo bird. And the factory closed and it remained that way for about a year. But a man out in New Hartford, New York, just purchased the dice and is now on full production. (Soundbite of cheering) Mr. FEATHERSTONE: So like the phoenix, the flamingo has reared its tacky little head and started to work on the state of New York now. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. FEATHERSTONE: Thank you. Mr. ABRAHAMS: The 1999 Ig Nobel Entomology Prize was awarded to Dr. Robert Lopez for his series of experiments in obtaining ear mites from cats and inserting them carefully into his own ear and then observing and analyzing what happened after that. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: I'm very sorry to report that Dr. Lopez passed away earlier this year. His daughter, Jen, is with us tonight and her two sons. Jen? I wonder if you would stand and take a bow. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: The Literature Prize. The Ig Nobel Literature Prize this year is presented to Glenda Browne of Blaxland, Blue Mountains, Australia for her study of the word the and of the many ways the word the causes problems for anyone who tries to put things into alphabetical order. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: Here is Glenda Browne. Ms. GLENDA BROWNE (Freelance Indexer): Thank you. I work as an indexer, the person who creates the A-to-Z access points at the back of books, magazines, Web sites, journals, online help - just about anywhere. Few people know that indexers exist and even fewer know that we worry ceaselessly about how to alphabetize our entries so you can find what you need. The is a case in point. It's a funny little word that sometimes matters and sometimes doesn't. You start the Bible and the Beatles at B, but The Hague and the Camel's Hump is an ugly one at T. And that's before you get to terms like the pill, the Beatle the deaf, the undead. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. BROWNE: So, no worries, here's my guide to the rules: When following a title, the goes at the end, then you start with a lowercase letter. But in index, the first lines put the at the front, somehow they think that works better. In corporate bodies, the is often left out. It's part of the name, but it has not much clout. They didn't place names, they use important to show you must trust the rules for surely they know. With love to John, Bill and Jenny back home, to all the indexers around the world from Indexel, the indexer Ancy(ph) and friends and family\u2026 Ms. SWEETY-POO: Please stop. I'm bored. Ms. BROWNE: To my sister Carol for being here, and for saying an Ig Nobel is the best award you could ever win. Thank you. Mr. ABRAHAMS: And now, it is my honor to introduce our presiding monarch, ladies and gentlemen, please rise for the king and queen. Their majesties, the king and perhaps the queen of Swedish meatballs. (Soundbite of music) Mr. ABRAHAMS: You may be seated. Your majesties, you may be seated. Thank you. Now it's time for the nano lectures. Two of the world's great scientists will explain the inner workings of chickens. (Soundbite of cheering) Each nano lecture is a maximum of 30 seconds long. The 30-second time limit will be enforced by our referee, Mr. John Barrett. Mr. Barrett? Mr. JOHN BARRETT (Ig Nobel Referee): Gentlemen, keep it clean. Mr. ABRAHAMS: Thank you. The first nano lecture will be presented by Dudley Herschbach. Professor Herschbach will explain in 30 seconds or less the chemistry of chickens. Ready, set, go. Dr. HERSCHBACH: I dedicate this lecture to Albert Einstein. He liked to say nobody expected me to lay golden eggs. Today, the global population of chickens is about 25 billion. All are superb biochemists, especially the hens. They're able to solve a problem that stumped Einstein and has tormented generations of scientists. How can you unscramble an egg or restore Humpty Dumpty? Usually\u2026 (Soundbite of whistle) Dr. HERSCHBACH: \u2026it's said to be thermodynamically impossible because of inescapable entropy. Mr. ABRAHAMS: Thank you. Dr. HERSCHBACH: But just feed a scrambled egg\u2026 Mr. ABRAHAMS: Our next\u2026 Dr. HERSCHBACH: \u2026to a hen, give her about a day and she'll deliver a nice, new egg. Mr. ABRAHAMS: Our next nano lecture will be delivered by\u2026 (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: Our next nano-lecture and our final nano lecture will be delivered by Kees Moeliker, the curator of birds at the Natural History Museum of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. He will explain in 30 seconds or less chickens and ducks, chickens and ducks. Ready, set, go. Mr. KEES MOELIKER (Curator, Natural History Museum of Rotterdam): This is not a chicken. This is a duck. It is the Ig duck. This duck got me the Ig Nobel Prize 2003 because I saw the first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard duck. To the best of my knowledge, his behavior has not been observed in chickens. Thank you. (Soundbite of cheering) Mr. ABRAHAMS: And now, the final prize of the evening, the Aviation Prize. The Ig Nobel Aviation Prize is awarded to Patricia Agostino, Santiago Plano and Diego Golombek of the Universidad Nacional de Quilmes, Argentina for their discovery that Viagra aids jetlag recovery in hamsters. Here is Professor Golombek. (Soundbite of cheering) Dr. DIEGO GOLOMBEK (Biology, Universidad Nacional de Quilmes): Thank you. I have a message from your International Hamster Frequent Travelers Association that says thank you scientists for fulfilling all of our needs. We are Syrian hamsters, that's a lot of time zones away and we have a lot of sex life so we have both our desires fulfilled. And I have a message from the Laboratory Rat and Mice Society that says, why not us. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. GOLOMBEK: Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues and my students for performing wonderful research that make - made us laugh and then think and also for going to the drugstore to get the Viagra for all of us. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. GOLOMBEK: Thank you. (Soundbite of applause) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow and this is TALK OF THE NATION: Science Friday from NPR News. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: And now, Professor Jean Berko Gleason will deliver the traditional Ig Nobel, Goodbye, goodbye speech. Dr. GLEASON: Goodbye. Goodbye. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: And we ask now - all of the new Ig Nobel winners and the past Ig Nobel winners and the lectures join the Nobel laureates at center stage for a pointless photo-opportunity. If you could move up to the front. (Soundbite of applause) KAREN: Hooray. (Soundbite of music) KAREN: I think there are more. (Soundbite of music) KAREN: Okay. I guess that's it. Mr. ABRAHAMS: Everybody please put your hands together, whack them together. Shower these people with self-esteem. (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: On behalf now of the Harvard-Radcliffe Science Fiction Association and the Harvard-Radcliffe Society of Physics Students and the Harvard Computer Society, especially on behalf of the Annals of Improbable Research, we want to thank you very much for coming tonight. Thank you to all of the people here, who took a lot of time out to do this. And\u2026 (Soundbite of applause) Mr. ABRAHAMS: \u2026please just remember this final thought: If you didn't win an Ig Nobel Prize this year, and especially if you did: better luck next year. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. ABRAHAMS: Thank you. Good night. (Soundbite of applause) FLATOW: That's all from us. Our thanks to Mark Abrahams and the folks at the Annals of Improbable Research. You can find out more at improbable. com.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  For 17 years, one award has saluted the strange and silly in science.  Giving awards for achievements that first make you laugh and then make you think.  This year, our post-Thanksgiving selection of highlights from the 17th First Annual Ig Nobel Awards.  We won't be taking calls this hour, so please don't try to call in. But if you want more information about what we're talking about, go to our Web site at sciencefriday. com, where you'll find links to our topic.  The Ig Nobel awards are presented each year by the science humor magazine the Annals of Improbable Research. In the past, they've honored the inventor of the pink plastic lawn flamingo, saluted research into why woodpeckers don't get headaches - I like that - and given the inventor of karaoke a peace prize. What's untapped this year? Well I don't know, but it taste like chicken.  We take you now to the Sanders Theatre at Harvard University, where Marc Abrahams, ringleader of the Ig's is preparing to take the stage.  (Soundbite of music)  KAREN: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 17th First Annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony.  (Soundbite of music)  KAREN: Hello, people. You're welcome to come to the stage.

KAREN: Marc Abrahams.  Unidentified Man #5: Marc Abrahams.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. MARC ABRAHAMS (Editor, Annals of Improbable Research): Thank you, Karen. We are gathered here tonight to honor some remarkable individuals and groups. Every winner has done something that, first, makes people laugh and then makes them think.  The Ig Nobel Prize ceremony is produced by the science humor magazine, the Annals of Improbable Research. It's cosponsored, probably, by the Harvard-Radcliffe Science Fiction Association, by the Harvard-Radcliffe Society of Physics Students and by the Harvard Computer Society. Tonight, 10 prizes will be given. The achievements speak for themselves all too eloquently.  And now, Professor Jean Berko Gleason will deliver the traditional Ig Nobel welcome, welcome speech.  (Soundbite of applause)  Dr. JEAN BERKO GLEASON (Psychology, Radcliffe-Harvard University): Welcome. Welcome.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: The editors of the Annals of Improbable Research have chosen a theme for this year's ceremony. And this year's theme is chicken.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: To honor the theme of chicken, we have a keynote speech.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: Our keynote speech is delivered by the man, who, in certain respect, is the world's top authority on chicken. Please welcome, Doug Zongker.  (Soundbite of applause)  Dr. DOUG ZONGKER (Senior Software Engineer, Google): Chicken. Chicken, chicken, chicken. Chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken. Chicken. Chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken. Chicken. Chicken, chicken. Chicken, chicken, chickens, chicken, chickens, chickens, chickens, chickens, chicken, chickens, chickens, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: As you know, the theme of tonight's ceremony is chicken.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: Sanders Theater regulations prohibit the flying or the throwing of chickens.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: And now let's get it over with.  Ladies and gentlemen the awarding of the 2007 Ig Nobel Prizes.  We're giving our 10 prizes. The winners come from many nations on five continents. These year's winners have truly earned their prizes.  Karen, tell them what they've won.  (Soundbite of laughter)  KAREN: Thank you.  Oh, this year's Ig Nobel Prize winners each win an Ig Nobel Prize.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: What else?  KAREN: A piece of paper, saying they've won an Ig Nobel Prize signed by several Nobel laureates.  Mr. ABRAHAMS: And what else?  KAREN: Ah. That's it.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: How wonderful. Thank you, Karen.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: This is the coveted Ig Nobel Prize.  FLATOW: Ten prizes are awarded each year. Winners travel to the Ig ceremony at their own expense. Some winners embrace the awards, others just try to hide from it, and some just - well, they just don't know what to think.  Mr. ABRAHAMS: And now, our winners. First, the medicine prize.  (Soundbite of music)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: Ig Nobel Medicine Prize this year is awarded to Brian Witcombe of Gloucester in the U. K. and Dan Meyer of Antioch, Tennessee in the U. S. for their penetrating medical report \"Sword Swallowing and Its Side Effects. \"  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: Here are Brian Witcombe and Dan Meyer.  (Soundbite of applause)  Dr. BRIAN WITCOMBE (Radiologist; Winner, Ig Nobel Medicine Prize): Ladies and gentlemen, knowledge often advances when people from different fields of activity come together to look at an issue of mutual interests from different perspectives. And so it was with this study.  A semi-retired hospital radiologist, who had an occasional interest in patients with swallowing disorders, that's me, came into contact with one of the world's greatest sword swallowers, Dan Meyer. Dan Meyer is not only an outstanding sword swallower with the U. S. record for swallowing swords underwater\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. WITCOMBE: \u2026but he also maintains a comprehensive database of over 100 sword swallowers in more than 16 countries. And this formed the basis of our survey. I am extremely grateful for Dan for his energetic and meticulous and sometimes humorous input, and we are both, of course, extremely grateful for those that bestowed this great honor upon us.  Finally, we are also grateful to our peer reviewer, Dr. Katherine Gribanick(ph), a London consultant cardiothoracic anesthetist who recommended publication of paper to the British Medical Journal editors, saying our paper was a cut above many others\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. WITCOMBE: \u2026add it to the incisive body of literature on sword swallowing.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. WITCOMBE: And she wrote it, made its points well and would keep the BMJ at the cutting edge of sword-swallowing literature.  (Soundbite of applause)  Dr. WITCOMBE: And finally, we're, of course, grateful to all the members of the sword-swallowing fraternity and our medical colleagues.  Mr. ABRAHAMS: Oh.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: The Peace Prize\u2026  (Soundbite of music)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: The Ig Nobel Peace Prize is awarded this year to the Air Force Wright Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio, USA, for instigating research and development on a chemical weapon, the so-called, gay bomb\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: \u2026that will make enemy soldiers become sexually irresistible to each other.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: The winners could not or would not be with us tonight.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: But we have a demonstration.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: I'm afraid the V-chip of monitor has called off our demonstration.  (Soundbite of booing)  FLATOW: We'll be right back with more Ig action right after this break. Stay with us.  I'm Ira Flatow. And this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  No, we're not chicken. Oh, well, maybe we are. But anyway, here comes more Ig silliness. We now return you to Harvard Sanders Theatre for highlights from this year's 17th First Annual Ig Nobel Awards.  Mr. ABRAHAMS: And now, it's time for the win-a-date-with-a-Nobel-laureate contest.  (Soundbite of cheering)  KAREN: He's shapely, he's sassy and he is smarter than you.  (Soundbite of laughter)  KAREN: Robert B. Laughlin won the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics for explaining how a strong magnetic field can cause electrons to melt into a rich, creamy quantum fluid.  (Soundbite of laughter)  KAREN: Raised amidst the walnuts and other nuts in the San Joaquin Valley, Laughlin enjoys playing the piano, taking apart vacuum cleaners, and watching quasi particles behaving badly.  (Soundbite of laughter)  KAREN: If you think a cool, quantum cocktail with a twist of fractional charge sounds like the perfect nightcap, Bob is that bartender for you.  (Soundbite of laughter)  KAREN: Please give a warm, win-a-date welcome to Robert Laughlin.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: All right, now let's see which lucky audience member will win a date with this Nobel laureate.  When you entered the hall, you were handed an attractive, printed program. Pick it up, open it and look through it. See if you find a picture of a chicken confusedly standing in a crosswalk. If you have that picture in your program, then you've won a date, come on up and claim your prize.  (Soundbite of a woman screaming)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: Take it up back, kids, that's okay.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: Now, get set for something special - the 24/7 lectures. We have invited several of the world's top thinkers to try to tell us very briefly what they're thinking about. Each 24/7 lecturer will explain her or his topic twice. First, a complete technical description in 24 seconds, and then after a brief pause, a clear summary that anyone can understand in seven words.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: The 24-second time limit will be enforced by Mr. John Barrett, our referee. Now, let's have the first group of 24/7 lecturers.  Will the poultry inspectors bar the doors?  (Soundbite of cheering)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: The first 24/7 lecture will be delivered by Massimo Marcone, assistant professor of food science at the University of Guelph. His topic: food science.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: First, a complete technical description in 24 seconds. On your mark, get set, go.  Professor MASSIMO MARCONE (Food Science, University of Guelph): Food science is an interdisciplinary applied science, which uses principled experimental designs, statistical analysis in the examination of all aspects of foods, from harvest of the ingredients to their behavior during formulation, processing, storage and evaluation as consumer food products. It incorporates concepts from a variety of fields, including chemistry, microbiology and processing and engineering. In a nutshell, food science is concerned with all quality, nutritional, sensory, cultural and safety aspects of foods.  (Soundbite of cheering)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: A clear summary that anyone can understand in seven words. On your mark, get set, go.  Prof. MARCONE: Foods that don't kill make you fatter.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: The Physics Prize\u2026  (Soundbite of cheering)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: This year's Ig Nobel Physics Prize is presented to Mahadevan of Harvard University and Enrique Cerda Villablanca of Universidad de Santiago de Chile for studying how sheets become wrinkled.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: Here are Mahadevan and Professor Villablanca's sister, Mariella.  (Soundbite of cheering)  Ms. MARIELLA VILLABLANCA: My brother dedicates his Ig Nobel Prize to all the wrinkled people in the world\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. VILLABLANCA: \u2026especially to our beautiful grandmother. Thank you.  (Soundbite of cheering)  Professor L. MAHADEVAN (Applied Mathematics, Harvard University): Wrinkle, wrinkle on my skin, how I wonder did you begin? By sagging and swelling and shrinking too, while stretching and bending or mixed into a brew, until, aha, a formula that sits on a pin.  How infinitely familiar, how far from (unintelligible) environment is. And no one reminds us of this every day besides our children. So I thank them all particularly our two (unintelligible). Wrinkle, wrinkle on my skin, where I wonder did I sin? Celebrated an art drapery until, aha, pruned by surgery and then just a has-been.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: The Chemistry Prize.  (Soundbite of music)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: The Ig Nobel Chemistry Prize of this year is presented to Mayu Yamamoto of the International Medical Center of Japan for developing a way to extract vanillin, the flavor and fragrance of vanilla, from cow dung.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: Here is Mayu Yamamoto.  (Soundbite of applause)  Ms. MAYU YAMAMOTO (Researcher, Yamamoto of the International Medical Center): Thank you. Peace, mate.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. YAMAMOTO: What kind of smell you encounter when the cow dung are heated? Can you imagine that? It's a very strange and sweet. Please eat ice cream with cow dung. Thank you.  (Soundbite of cheering)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: Now, here is a special tribute to Mayu Yamamoto. Please welcome, Gus Rancatore, the owner of Toscanini's ice cream.  (Soundbite of cheering)  Mr. GUS RANCATORE (Owner, Toscanini's Ice Cream): Thank you very much. This was a very difficult year in the ice cream business. There were dramatic increases in dairy costs and real estate costs, and Ms. Yamamoto's achievement stood out like a lantern. And Toscanini's was inspired enough to imitate her achievement. And we have samples for the laureates.  (Soundbite of cheering)  Unidentified Group: Eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it\u2026  (Soundbite of cheering)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: The next 24/7 lecture will be delivered by Jill Lepore, professor of history at Harvard University. Her topic: history.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: First, a complete technical description of the subject in 24 seconds. On your mark, get set, go.  Professor JILL LEPORE (History, Harvard University): History is in an enduring travel to an archive repository or a library, bring in pencil, fill out little (unintelligible); be the chicken scratch of letters, diaries, love notes, speeches, scrapbooks, (unintelligible), unopened mails, stranger and wondrous people you've never met and never will but you probably should could have. Find out everything you can about how they understood why hens lay eggs. Think about it. Think about it some more, and then make up some cock-and-ball story.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: And now a clear summary that anyone can understand in seven words. On your mark, get set, go.  Prof. LEPORE: History is the study of dead people.  (Soundbite of cheering)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: The next 24/7 lecture will be delivered by Fariba Houman, the interim director of human subjects administration at the Harvard School of Public Health. Her topic: research ethics.  First, a complete technical description in 24 seconds. On your mark, get set, go.  Dr. FARIBA HOUMAN (Interim Director, Human Subjects Committee, Harvard School of Public Health): The ethical conduct of non-exempt human subjects research is governed by set of rules fortified by 45-C and 446; in a phase two trial of avian flu vaccine in a cohort of handlers - animal handlers of broiler chickens.  (Soundbite of cheering)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: And now, a clear summary that anyone can understand in seven words. On your mark, get set go.  Dr. HOUMAN: Research on animal handlers needs IRB approval.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: The final 24/7 lecture will be delivered by Nobel laureate William Lipscomb. His topic: chicken.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: First, complete technical summary in 24 seconds. On your mark, get set, go.  Dr. WILLIAM LIPSCOMB (Nobel Laureate): It is very surprising how many references there are in the Internet for chicken.  (Soundbite of audience)  Dr. LIPSCOMB: Unbelievable. I could go through them, but I don't have much time here.  (Soundbite of audience laughing)  Dr. LIPSCOMB: No one has asked why a chicken crosses the road - to go across the road.  (Soundbite of whistle)  Dr. LIPSCOMB: Uh-oh.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: And now, a sclear summary that anyone can understand in seven words. On your mark, get set, go.  Dr. LIPSCOMB: Chicken lays egg. It's a standing ovation.  (Soundbite of laughter and applause)  FLATOW: The Igs are a tribute to the good, the bad and the ugly in science - or at least the strange, silly and the unusual. Where else would levitating frogs, pink plastic flamingos and the beauty preferences of chicken find the highest honors? The awards were handed out on early October at Harvard's Sanders Theatre.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: The biology prize. The Ig Nobel biology prize this year is presented to Dr. Johanna E. M. H. van Bronswijk of Eindhoven University of Technology in The Netherlands for doing a census of all the mites, insects, spiders, pseudoscorpions, crustaceans, bacteria, algae, ferns and fungi with whom we share our beds each night.  Here is Professor van Bronswijk.  (Soundbite of applause)  Dr. JOHANNA E. M. H. van BRONSWIJK (Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands): So my products of energy studies that I started as a student 30 years ago, I found that you never sleep alone.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. van BRONSWIJK: Nature does not stop at the windowsill. We're only organism in the midst of millions in the dwelling community. In the seat you are using now\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. van BRONSWIJK: \u2026mites are following your sweat to the far sites of the cushions. It's little worse on the chairs because they're textile, which also the - also seats have this problem. Our daily production of one to one-and-a-half gram skin scales feeds mites, fungi, bacteria and algae. Hence, when humidity in air or textiles is little higher, also, book lice and wood flies sometimes, one or two young cockroaches\u2026  Ms. SWEETY-POO: Please stop.  Dr. van BRONSWIJK: \u2026(unintelligible).  Ms. SWEETY-POO: \u2026I'm bored.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. SWEETY-POO: Please stop. I'm bored.  Dr. van BRONSWIJK: It is with much pleasure that I accept the prize\u2026  Ms. SWEETY-POO: Please stop. I'm bored.  Dr. van BRONSWIJK: \u2026and hope it will help public understanding\u2026  Ms. SWEETY-POO: Please stop. I'm bored.  Dr. van BRONSWIJK: \u2026of the natural processes we belong to.  Ms. SWEETY-POO: Please stop. I'm bored.  Dr. van BRONSWIJK: Thank you.  (Soundbite of applause)  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow and this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  Ten prizes are award each year. Winners travel to the Ig ceremony at their own expense. The creators of the award say they intended to spur public curiosity and interest in science, or maybe they're just funny.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: The Economics Prize.  The Ig Nobel Economics Prize this year is awarded to Kuo Cheng Hsieh of Taichung, Taiwan for patenting a device in the year 2001 that catches bank robbers by dropping a net over them.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: The Ig Nobel board of governors has attempted repeatedly to send people to locate Mr. Hsieh, but none of them were able to - he seems to have vanished mysteriously. If anyone knows the whereabouts of this poor man, please get in touch with us. It was suggested to us - and we hope this is not the case - that there is a possibility that the gentleman was trapped inside his own machine.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: And\u2026  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: Thank you. The Linguistics Prize.  (Soundbite of music)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: the Ig Nobel Linguistics Prize is awarded to Juan Manuel Toro, Josep B. Trobalon and Nuria Sebastian-Galles of Universitat de Barcelona for showing that rats sometimes cannot tell the difference between a person speaking Japanese backwards and a person speaking Dutch backwards.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. LAUGHLIN: The winners could not travel to the ceremony. And so they prepared a video acceptance speech. Here on video is Juan Manuel Toro.  Dr. JUAN MANUEL TORO (Universitat de Barcelona): The basic idea is that for everybody, it's very easy to discriminate between an English sentence such as this one and a Spanish sentence (speaking in Spanish). But it is not so easy to discriminate between them when they are played backwards as in here.  (Soundbite of recorded voice played backwards)  Dr. TORO: This basically because in backwards speech, some very important prosaic features are lost. But the real interesting point is that the same processing constraints are found in human adults, in human infant, in tamarin monkeys and even in rats. So anyway, for us, it's a pleasure and an honor to join the club of the Ig Nobel winners and thank you so much for the prize. Ciao.  (Soundbite of applause)  FLATOW: We'll be right back with more Ig action right after this break. Stay with us.  I'm Ira Flatow and this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. Don't try to adjust your set. We now return you to your regularly scheduled Ig Nobel Awards, already in progress.  The awards feature a human spotlight, plenty of paper airplanes, Nobel laureates wielding trumpets, a V-chip monitor to screen out potentially offensive material and an onstage experiment, in which the award's major domo eats a never ending bowl of soup.  Unidentified Woman #4: Ig.  Unidentified Woman #5: Ig.  Unidentified Group: Ig Nobel.  Unidentified Woman #4: Ig.  Unidentified Man #5: Ig.  Unidentified Group: Ig Nobel.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: The Nutrition Prize. The Ig Noble Nutrition Prize is awarded to Brian Wansink of Cornell University for exploring the seemingly boundless appetites of human beings by feeding them with a self-refilling, bottomless bowl of soup.  Here is Professor Wansink.  Dr. BRIAN WANSINK (Marketing and Nutritional Science, Cornell University): An ode to a soup bowl. Oh, say can you see my soup bowl refill? But because it's not empty, I keep eating still. I've eaten 14 ounces, but little do I know there's a tube in the bottom and I've got six quarts to go.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. WANSINK: Some geek in a red apron just told me to stop. I'm starving, I tell him, the soup is still at the top. Now, do we eat with our eyes? Our eyes do the cheating. It's a psychology of food. It explains my book mindless eating. So if you use a bowl's bottom to tell you you're through, you'll find six quarts later, the last laugh's on you.  (Soundbite of applause)  FLATOW: These awards are given out by the science humor magazine, the Annals of Improbable Research. You can find out more about the awards and the magazine at improbable. com.  A team of genuine Nobel laureates hand out the awards to the winners, who receive a handmade price, a certificate, and untold glory and fame.  Mr. ABRAHAMS: We are honored to have with us several past winners of Ig Nobel prizes who have kindly joined us tonight. We'll ask each of them to come up and very briefly say a word.  First, the 2006 Ig Nobel Acoustics Prize was awarded to the team who conducted experiments to learn why it is that people dislike the sound of fingernails scraping on a blackboard. Please welcome back Lynn Halpern.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: When she shows up, you can welcome her properly.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. HERSCHBACH: You'll hear her first.  Mr. ABRAHAMS: Yes. Dudley points out we will hear her - okay.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: The 2005 - if it's especially good, that's fine. But the 2005 Ig Noble Economics Prize was awarded to the inventor of an alarm clock that runs away and hides repeatedly, thus insuring that people do get out of bed. Please welcome back, Gauri Nanda.  (Soundbite of applause)  Dr. GAURI NANDA (Massachusetts Institute of Technology): So for generations, roosters have been waking us up and chickens can wake us up too but most of us don't have that option. So I made an alarm clock that runs away.  (Soundbite of alarm)  Dr. NANDA: So it'll actually fall to the floor when you hit the snooze button and then run around the room, so you kind of have to go and find it.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. NANDA: Just turn it off. Thank you.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: The 1996 Ig Nobel Art Prize was awarded to the creator of the plastic pink flamingo. Please welcome back Don Featherstone and his wife Nancy Featherstone.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. DON FEATHERSTONE (Artist): Oh, he thinks he's a chicken. I'm happy to say the pink flamingo look like it was going to be - going the way of the dodo bird. And the factory closed and it remained that way for about a year. But a man out in New Hartford, New York, just purchased the dice and is now on full production.  (Soundbite of cheering)  Mr. FEATHERSTONE: So like the phoenix, the flamingo has reared its tacky little head and started to work on the state of New York now.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. FEATHERSTONE: Thank you.  Mr. ABRAHAMS: The 1999 Ig Nobel Entomology Prize was awarded to Dr. Robert Lopez for his series of experiments in obtaining ear mites from cats and inserting them carefully into his own ear and then observing and analyzing what happened after that.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: I'm very sorry to report that Dr. Lopez passed away earlier this year. His daughter, Jen, is with us tonight and her two sons. Jen? I wonder if you would stand and take a bow.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: The Literature Prize. The Ig Nobel Literature Prize this year is presented to Glenda Browne of Blaxland, Blue Mountains, Australia for her study of the word the and of the many ways the word the causes problems for anyone who tries to put things into alphabetical order.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: Here is Glenda Browne.  Ms. GLENDA BROWNE (Freelance Indexer): Thank you. I work as an indexer, the person who creates the A-to-Z access points at the back of books, magazines, Web sites, journals, online help - just about anywhere. Few people know that indexers exist and even fewer know that we worry ceaselessly about how to alphabetize our entries so you can find what you need. The is a case in point. It's a funny little word that sometimes matters and sometimes doesn't. You start the Bible and the Beatles at B, but The Hague and the Camel's Hump is an ugly one at T. And that's before you get to terms like the pill, the Beatle the deaf, the undead.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. BROWNE: So, no worries, here's my guide to the rules: When following a title, the goes at the end, then you start with a lowercase letter. But in index, the first lines put the at the front, somehow they think that works better. In corporate bodies, the is often left out. It's part of the name, but it has not much clout. They didn't place names, they use important to show you must trust the rules for surely they know. With love to John, Bill and Jenny back home, to all the indexers around the world from Indexel, the indexer Ancy(ph) and friends and family\u2026  Ms. SWEETY-POO: Please stop. I'm bored.  Ms. BROWNE: To my sister Carol for being here, and for saying an Ig Nobel is the best award you could ever win. Thank you.  Mr. ABRAHAMS: And now, it is my honor to introduce our presiding monarch, ladies and gentlemen, please rise for the king and queen. Their majesties, the king and perhaps the queen of Swedish meatballs.  (Soundbite of music)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: You may be seated. Your majesties, you may be seated. Thank you. Now it's time for the nano lectures. Two of the world's great scientists will explain the inner workings of chickens.  (Soundbite of cheering)  Each nano lecture is a maximum of 30 seconds long. The 30-second time limit will be enforced by our referee, Mr. John Barrett. Mr. Barrett?  Mr. JOHN BARRETT (Ig Nobel Referee): Gentlemen, keep it clean.  Mr. ABRAHAMS: Thank you. The first nano lecture will be presented by Dudley Herschbach. Professor Herschbach will explain in 30 seconds or less the chemistry of chickens. Ready, set, go.  Dr. HERSCHBACH: I dedicate this lecture to Albert Einstein. He liked to say nobody expected me to lay golden eggs. Today, the global population of chickens is about 25 billion. All are superb biochemists, especially the hens. They're able to solve a problem that stumped Einstein and has tormented generations of scientists. How can you unscramble an egg or restore Humpty Dumpty? Usually\u2026  (Soundbite of whistle)  Dr. HERSCHBACH: \u2026it's said to be thermodynamically impossible because of inescapable entropy.  Mr. ABRAHAMS: Thank you.  Dr. HERSCHBACH: But just feed a scrambled egg\u2026  Mr. ABRAHAMS: Our next\u2026  Dr. HERSCHBACH: \u2026to a hen, give her about a day and she'll deliver a nice, new egg.  Mr. ABRAHAMS: Our next nano lecture will be delivered by\u2026  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: Our next nano-lecture and our final nano lecture will be delivered by Kees Moeliker, the curator of birds at the Natural History Museum of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. He will explain in 30 seconds or less chickens and ducks, chickens and ducks. Ready, set, go.  Mr. KEES MOELIKER (Curator, Natural History Museum of Rotterdam): This is not a chicken. This is a duck. It is the Ig duck. This duck got me the Ig Nobel Prize 2003 because I saw the first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard duck. To the best of my knowledge, his behavior has not been observed in chickens. Thank you.  (Soundbite of cheering)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: And now, the final prize of the evening, the Aviation Prize. The Ig Nobel Aviation Prize is awarded to Patricia Agostino, Santiago Plano and Diego Golombek of the Universidad Nacional de Quilmes, Argentina for their discovery that Viagra aids jetlag recovery in hamsters. Here is Professor Golombek.  (Soundbite of cheering)  Dr. DIEGO GOLOMBEK (Biology, Universidad Nacional de Quilmes): Thank you. I have a message from your International Hamster Frequent Travelers Association that says thank you scientists for fulfilling all of our needs. We are Syrian hamsters, that's a lot of time zones away and we have a lot of sex life so we have both our desires fulfilled. And I have a message from the Laboratory Rat and Mice Society that says, why not us.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. GOLOMBEK: Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues and my students for performing wonderful research that make - made us laugh and then think and also for going to the drugstore to get the Viagra for all of us.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. GOLOMBEK: Thank you.  (Soundbite of applause)  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow and this is TALK OF THE NATION: Science Friday from NPR News.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: And now, Professor Jean Berko Gleason will deliver the traditional Ig Nobel, Goodbye, goodbye speech.  Dr. GLEASON: Goodbye. Goodbye.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: And we ask now - all of the new Ig Nobel winners and the past Ig Nobel winners and the lectures join the Nobel laureates at center stage for a pointless photo-opportunity. If you could move up to the front.  (Soundbite of applause)  KAREN: Hooray.  (Soundbite of music)  KAREN: I think there are more.  (Soundbite of music)  KAREN: Okay. I guess that's it.  Mr. ABRAHAMS: Everybody please put your hands together, whack them together. Shower these people with self-esteem.  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: On behalf now of the Harvard-Radcliffe Science Fiction Association and the Harvard-Radcliffe Society of Physics Students and the Harvard Computer Society, especially on behalf of the Annals of Improbable Research, we want to thank you very much for coming tonight. Thank you to all of the people here, who took a lot of time out to do this. And\u2026  (Soundbite of applause)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: \u2026please just remember this final thought: If you didn't win an Ig Nobel Prize this year, and especially if you did: better luck next year.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. ABRAHAMS: Thank you. Good night.  (Soundbite of applause)  FLATOW: That's all from us. Our thanks to Mark Abrahams and the folks at the Annals of Improbable Research.

Scientists have been pondering this question for years. Some say it started as a Big Bang, others talk about quantum fluctuations, others say it exists because we're here to observe it. My next guest has pondered these questions and offers his own musings. Paul Davies says perhaps, things we do today and in the future can actually go back in time from the future - travel back and influence the very distant past and the structure of our universe. His new book is called \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right for life. \" He's also a professor at Arizona State University and director of the Beyond Center for Fundamental Concepts in Science. And he joins us from KJZZ in Arizona. Welcome back to Science Friday, Dr. Davies. Dr. PAUL DAVIES (Author, \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right for Life\"; Director, Beyond Center for Fundamental Sciences): Thank you. Good afternoon. FLATOW: What brought on this idea of talking about a new book? Dr. DAVIES: Well, I was struck by the fact that the multiverse theory of the universe was gaining a lot of momentum a few years ago. And this multiverse theory says that the reason the universe seems to be just right for life, almost like a fix, is because there isn't just one universe. There's a vast ensemble of them out there somewhere. And the laws of physics, what we thought were the laws, are really just more like local bylaws, differing in different patches. And so, getting it just right for life would be a very rare thing, but it would be only in those universes where there would be observers. And I thought this was a bit of a cop out. So that was the main motivation for writing this book. I wanted to have a really good critical look at this very popular multiverse theory. FLATOW: But you have come up with some, really, new ideas. I think new ideas to me and for mostly other readers and your ideas that you have been thinking about for years. Dr. DAVIES: Right. FLATOW: And you've argued that a good case - I'm going to read it right from the book - a good case can be made that life and mind are fundamental physical phenomena and so must be incorporated into the overall cosmic scheme. Life and mind\u2026 Dr. DAVIES: Yes. FLATOW: \u2026we don't think about that as running the universe. Dr. DAVIES: Well, you see, it's true that most scientists regard life as just some quirky, little embellishment that's added on to the universe as an afterthought, just something that happened in the funny, little corner of the universe, end of story. And when it comes to mind, a similar thing - just a weird aberration, an odd phenomenon of no fundamental significance. And I've always thought that this is deeply wrong, that life and, eventually, mind are fundamental features of the universe, fundamental in the same sense that the elementary particles of fundamental or the dimensions of space are fundamental. So they play a deep role. And one of the reasons that that idea was reinforced is because if the universe had any old rag bag of laws, if I gave you the task of designers of universe, you'd make a hash of it. And you've got a universe in which almost certainly, there could be no life. The one we're in is fine-tuned for life, there's no real disagreement about that. Where we start scrubbing is over where the explanation is. I take the reason for the fine-tuning to be that life itself and consciousness - the existence of conscious beings - is deeply fundamental to the great overall scheme of things. And any attempt to explain existence, the ultimate explanation of existence at a really basic level has to incorporate life and mind in a basic way and not just sort of throw them in as a lucky bonus or something. FLATOW: Talking with Paul Davies, author of \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right for Life\" on TALK OF THE NATION: Science Friday from NPR News. Are you saying then that the universe exists because there are lives and minds out there? D. DAVIES: Well, I wouldn't really call it like that. What I would say is the following. That the universe has engineered its own self-awareness, it hasn't been imprinted on it from without and it's not the result of just some, you know, winning the cosmic jackpot - to use the title of the book. It's isn't that there's a squillion number of universes out there and they're all random, and just here and there you're bound to get it just right for life. I think that life and mind and the universe and the laws that bring it into being or mutually explanatory, that is that they form part of a single explanatory scheme. Now, the traditional way of looking at the laws of physics are that they are sort of stomped on the universe by magic like the Maker's mouth at the time of the Big Bang and that they are basically perfect mathematical statements that exist in some other worldly realm, exact relationships that just happen to exist for reasons we know not what. And they're plunked on the universe and we're stuck with them. They're amusively eternal, transcendent laws. And I think that's a bogus idea. I think it's an idea that derives originally from theology, from monotheistic theology, the idea of a created world order and a rational plan. I don't think of the laws of physics like that, I think of them as more like software being run on the great cosmic machine, the great cosmic computer we call the universe, and so that that the laws are inherent in the universe and emergent with it. And so I think that life and the laws and the observers are all part of a common package. And I come - in the book, I suggest a mechanism whereby the existence of life and observers can, as it were, react back on the universe and engineer the very laws that are necessary for that to hold together itself consistency. FLATOW: But that would mean - and you explained this on your book - that people would have to travel back in time to create those laws. Dr. DAVIES: We're all expressing it in much more of a dramatic manner. People certainly don't travel back in time. FLATOW: Well\u2026 Dr. DAVIES: And it's important to realize that you can't change the past or send information back in the past. But we've known for over 50 years that this notion of a unique past is in any case a fiction. The idea that there was a particular state of the time of the Big Bang and it's connected by a unique part in history to the present moment went out the window with quantum physics. Quantum mechanics, which has uncertainty at it's half, tells us not only that the future is uncertain, the past is uncertain as well. FLATOW: Going to go to break and we'll come back and talk a little bit more with Paul Davies, author of \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right for Life. \" I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. Talking with Paul Davies, author of \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe Is Just Right for Life. \" There are so many ideas in this book, this tremendous book. Dr. Davies begins the book by giving a terrific recap of where we stand in our knowledge about the universe, and then he goes further and speculates about why the universe is the way it is. And he talks about the universe and mind become one in the far, far future. And he talks about how the knowledge will spread out through the universe and meld and - the mind will meld with the universe and actually be able to change what happened beforehand. Would that be right, Dr. Davies, what I'm talking\u2026 Dr. DAVIES: Everything except the word change. FLATOW: Okay. Dr. DAVIES: Because this is quantum physics. This is why we need your (unintelligible) to come back. You have to help us out, because, you know, quantum physics is this weird wonderland. FLATOW: Right. Dr. DAVIES: And Einstein spoke about spooky action at a distance. FLATOW: Right. Dr. DAVIES: It's one of his famous phrases. And what he meant is that in quantum physics, you can reach across the universe, two particles that might be millions of light years apart, are somehow still subtly linked in a way that what happens to one concerns what happens to the other. But you can never use manipulation to one particle to change the other one. That they're deeply correlated it in a way that makes no sense in daily life. Well, this ghostly action at a distance can be - with a simple change of reference frame - turned into ghostly action back in time. What it means is what we do today, what human beings choose to measure - or it doesn't have to be not human beings, it can be some experimental setup in the lab, but what gets measured today affects the nature of reality as it was in the distant past. This is not in dispute. It sounds like a really amazing dramatic claim. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. DAVIES: This is not new. There are experiments you can do in the lab and it's all correct. It's part and parcel of standard quantum physics. And Stephen Hawking has written about this very recently, in which he says, it's a mistake to think of them being a unique path, you must think of the present state of the universe or the quantum level as an amalgam of all the different histories. It's often called the many histories - a few of quantum mechanics or the different possible histories in the past. And what we choose to measure today, the existence of observers and so on, will, to some limited extent, affect which history is going to that amalgam and which don't. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. DAVIES: But, of course, we're only at the start of the great cosmic journey, as you've pointed out, that in the trillions of years for the rest ahead, we can imagine that life and conscious beings will spread out across the cosmos, certainly from Earth, but maybe from other planets, too. And eventually, these - what John Wheeler called acts of observer-participancy, will saturate the universe. So these ideas, although they seem very radical, actually are not that new. John Wheeler, he who coined the term black hole\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. DAVIES: \u2026was suggesting ideas like this about 30 years ago. What I've done is to try to flesh them out and find a real physical mechanism to make them work. FLATOW: But you've also brought them backwards a little bit more in time, at least the public idea about them. Dr. DAVIES: I think this notion that what happens in the universe now is relevant to the past, sounds dramatic and revolutionary. Well, I keep emphasizing that it's actually\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. DAVIES: \u2026implicit already in quantum physics, which is pretty weird. Weird things happen in quantum physics. And that's the hook, if you like, that can link life and mind with the universe, which back in the first split-second, if laws were only just sort of congealing, so to speak, how to determine the Big Bang. And that's the way in which those laws can zero in on the bio-friendly set that we're so mystified about. That's how they got bio-friendly. FLATOW: I see. Let's go to David(ph) in Muncie, Indiana. Hi, David. DAVID (Caller): Hi. I don't have a background in science, but I do have some interest in, like, philosophy of science and philosophy of origin. Obviously, I haven't read your book and I'll just be commenting on - based on what I've heard so far. But when you were talking about mind and life as fundamental parts of the universe, like fundamental particles in the taking - sort of a departure from, like a traditional view, like a materialist or physicalist view of the world where those things would be saved, emergent properties or something, it occurred to me that it - it's somewhat like creationists who are, sort of, presupposing a - you know, a creator and then saying, well, this is the way that the process has worked, but that there was a motivating force behind it or that maybe there's a conflation between theology and science, like maybe (unintelligible) or something like that. And I can't help wondering if there's a blurring of the lines between science and something else, maybe theology or something else. Dr. DAVIES: Well, in one sense, you couldn't be more wrong because this is an attempt to explain the universe - why it exists, why it has the laws it does or why life and mind exist from entirely within the universe, because one of the things I want to do is get away from the notion that somehow this magic has been imprinted on the universe from without. Instead of appealing to something outside like a god or some set of laws that just happens to exist conveniently, I want to try and explain everything scientifically from within, so it's the exact opposite of what you were suggesting. But if you're saying that in revisiting these topics, like how did the universe come to exist? What is the place of human beings in the great scheme? Are we trespassing on territory previously occupied by priests and philosophers? Well, then yes, of course. Any attempt to grapple with the deep discretions of existence is going to stray across that line that formerly was the province of philosophy. It's now becoming part of science and I'm taking a thoroughly scientific view of how to explain these things. So I would say that I disagree with your earlier sentiment. And one other thing to say\u2026 DAVID: I understand that the physical constants, they're not something which sort arbitrarily occurred, but they're a product of life or mind? Dr. DAVIES: The - what I'm saying is that these physical constants which have to be fine-tuned in order for there to be life\u2026 DAVID: Right. Dr. DAVIES: \u2026these are - when the universe came into existence, these were not nailed down with that is that we have now. They were - some are fuzzy and unfocused. And the way in which they focused in on the bio-friendly set is connected with the very existence of observing beings who appear billions of years later through this quantum feedback loop which John Wheeler explicated in its original form about 30 years ago, and I've tried to develop this now. So that's the link that takes us from\u2026 DAVID: Is it cause-and-effect relationship? Dr. DAVIES: Well, you have to be really careful in quantum physics with cause-and-effect\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. DAVIES: \u2026you know, what they are in daily life, but in some sense, it is. It's more of a consistency. FLATOW: David, you know, the attempt on the mistake I made before in using the word, you know, change something that happened earlier is the trap that you - we're both falling into. You're saying that, you know, by influencing -listening to Dr. Davies talking about the humans influencing the direction the universe takes, you're saying that we can go back and influence what happened or where there's a direct link but there's isn't. It's a spooky action that's really hard to understand. And I certainly don't understand all of it and\u2026 DAVID: Well, I guess what I had in my mind was that if the proposition is the minds or the lives have been the feature which - maybe causes isn't the right word - but which had an end product such that the universe have the particular set of features that it had, then it seems that in a way that's like positing a creator. Dr. DAVIES: Why is that? Because the universe is engineering then self-awareness. Otherwise, you're stuck with the notion that something outside the universe has engineered it, but what is that? You know, I'll just turn it around. What is that going to be? That's either going to be a pre-existing designer God or some magical set of laws or something outside the universe. I want it to all be done from within inside and so the universe engineers its own self-awareness. DAVID: But if with the - what you call the magical set of laws, those are laws which are observable. And if they're observable, then that seems like it's a proper thing to have as part of science. If\u2026 Dr. DAVIES: Yeah, but where did they come from? That's the point. You're saying that they got imprinted on the universe like the Maker's mark by some external agency at the time of the Big Bang? You see I don't buy that because that is appealing to some creator being outside the universe. FLATOW: So you're saying the universe is self-contained and self-changing within itself? Dr. DAVIES: And self-explanatory. Exactly. It's\u2026 FLATOW: And self-explanatory and\u2026 Dr. DAVIES: It's an attempt to get everything out of the common explanatory package instead of just shoving it off outside the universe, oh, well, God did it. Oh, well, some magical set of laws just happened to exist or there's an infinite number of unseen universe. I want to do it all from within the universe. FLATOW: And if there were not intelligent beings here, would the universe exist? Dr. DAVIES: That's a deep philosophical question that you have to make up your mind about. Does something that can never even, in principle, be observed, can it really be said to exist? Some people think yes. Some people think no. It depends on your philosophical stance. I keep changing my mind though. FLATOW: I was going to ask you that - does your head swim sometimes as much as mine does at this moment and as much as our listeners do, trying to understand this? Dr. DAVIES: Dealing with the deepest questions of existence is always challenging. And what I said at the end of the book, incidentally, because some of this stuff sounds just plain wacky, is that everybody's theory of the universe is plain wacky. You know what have we got? There's an unexplained God that just did it - how nice. There's a set of physical laws that just happened to be right for life and so on - well, how convenient. There's an infinite number of universes we can never see even in principle. Well, you know, what (unintelligible)? They all seem totally crazy if you're dealing with the deepest questions of existence. Everything is going to seem bizarre. And I reckon what I'm offering is the least crazy of the lot, but it still sounds pretty wacky. FLATOW: I think it was John Wheeler, I remember interviewing him many years ago, was saying, oh, maybe he was quoting Einstein in saying the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible. Dr. DAVIES: Right. And this is a big point because human beings are not just observers. It's not like, you know, we're selecting our place in the universe because we just happened to be here observing it, we can understand it, too. It's comprehensible to us. And that's why I think there is this deep link but I don't think that mind is just a trivial little embellishment because why do we have to understand the universe? That suggests that our minds are linked in to the workings of the universe in a very deep way and that's why I say fundamental. Not fundamental in some sort of there are some spirit or anything like that, you know, just sort of pasted on, that's not what I meant. The first caller seemed to misunderstand that. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. DAVIES: I mean, fundamental in the sense of cosmic significance, that the workings of the universe as a whole requires to understand it. FLATOW: But you know when you talk to scientists - and I've talked to many of them - they all sway, they stay away from the question of why the universe seems strangely suited that way. Dr. DAVIES: Yeah, they don't like it because it makes them feel very uncomfortable. I've just run through the alternatives on (unintelligible) that you appeal to some external God who's unexplained - well, scientists don't like that. That there's an infinite number of universes - well, they don't like that because it's just that theories of physics permit an infinite number of alternative realities and they'd rather just describe this reality. And they, generally speaking, feel very uncomfortable with the idea of bringing observers into the picture because physicists, traditionally, have tried to ignore mind - life and mind. They feel the very essence of physics is to be objective that everyone can agree, doesn't matter how the observer is moving, what their stance is, it will all agree to a common set of results. But at some stage, we must incorporate consciousness - or mind, if you like -into our description of the physical universe in a totally non-mystical way. The moment it's like sort of added on as an extra, most physicists try not to think about it, but they think about it as being sort of something else. I would like to see an understanding of the conscious mind thoroughly integrated into physics, which means finding mechanisms that explain conscious experiences and how those experiences react back on the universe. And quantum physics, by general consent, seems to be the best way of getting at that connection. FLATOW: Talking with Paul Davies, author of \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right for Life\" on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News, a truly fascinating book in concept. So you're wrestling with this, you put out this idea, and you're still working it out in your own mind. Dr. DAVIES: Yes, I mentioned that the gem of this idea of somehow the universe explaining itself and the existence of observers reacting back on the universe to make it bio-friendly, that idea was - put out by John Archibald Wheeler, he of the black hole fame about 30 years ago, but he called it an idea for an idea. He didn't develop it beyond thinking that quantum physics will be the way to bring about this connection. What I've been trying to do is to take this step further. How is it the case that the laws of physics are malleable in this way? You know, mostly you think that they're just sort of absolute fixed universal laws precisely now down from the get-go. But indeed, there is a way with our further understanding now of the nature of black holes, the nature of (unintelligible) in cosmology and understanding of how the laws of physics could be malleable, could be flexible, flexi-laws is what Stephen Hawking calls it. And so these flexi-laws of flexi history is just what we need to bring about this sort self-consistent explanatory loop. FLATOW: Well, if we have - if 75 percent of the universe, the dark energy, we have no idea what it is. Dr. DAVIES: Right. Well, we have an idea, there's plenty of theories. But the\u2026 FLATOW: Well\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. DAVIES: I've never been too troubled by this. FLATOW: You're not troubled that we don't know - or we have theories but, you know, it's just mysterious. Dr. DAVIES: I think it's exciting to contemplate and the lion's share comes from the circle of dark energy, the thing that's making the universe\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. DAVIES: \u2026accelerate, spin faster and faster. And this dark energy at the moment is indistinguishable from the quantum vacuums - we're back to the dready(ph) quantum again. Quantum physics tells us that empty space should have a weird type of energy that would have an anti-gravity effect. And I've worked on that quantum vacuum, the gravity of the quantum vacuum for most of my career so I had a soft spot for it. The only problem is that when you put the numbers in, it's famously 120 pounds (unintelligible) that we get out of the theories. So, you know, nice try, but we got to get that number down from that. FLATOW: I have 30 seconds, just to ask you, Dr. Davies, do we need new physics? Will the physics we have explain what you're trying to describe? Dr. DAVIES: No. We need something new and in particular, we need something that will bring the laws of physics themselves within the scope of science. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And there's the search. And I want to thank you very much, Paul Davies, for taking time to talk with us and continue the great work in tweaking our minds to think. Dr. DAVIES: It's been great fun. Thanks. FLATOW: You're welcome. Paul Davies is author of \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right for Life. \" A terrific read, I highly recommend it. It's really thought-provoking.

I'm Ira Flatow in New York.  IRA FLATOW, host:  Up next, how did the universe come into existence in the balance that allows for a life? Scientists have been pondering this question for years. Some say it started as a Big Bang, others talk about quantum fluctuations, others say it exists because we're here to observe it.  My next guest has pondered these questions and offers his own musings. Paul Davies says perhaps, things we do today and in the future can actually go back in time from the future - travel back and influence the very distant past and the structure of our universe.  His new book is called \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right for life. \" He's also a professor at Arizona State University and director of the Beyond Center for Fundamental Concepts in Science. And he joins us from KJZZ in Arizona.  Welcome back to Science Friday, Dr. Davies.  Dr. PAUL DAVIES (Author, \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right for Life\"; Director, Beyond Center for Fundamental Sciences): Thank you. Good afternoon.  FLATOW: What brought on this idea of talking about a new book?  Dr. DAVIES: Well, I was struck by the fact that the multiverse theory of the universe was gaining a lot of momentum a few years ago. And this multiverse theory says that the reason the universe seems to be just right for life, almost like a fix, is because there isn't just one universe. There's a vast ensemble of them out there somewhere. And the laws of physics, what we thought were the laws, are really just more like local bylaws, differing in different patches. And so, getting it just right for life would be a very rare thing, but it would be only in those universes where there would be observers. And I thought this was a bit of a cop out. So that was the main motivation for writing this book. I wanted to have a really good critical look at this very popular multiverse theory.  FLATOW: But you have come up with some, really, new ideas. I think new ideas to me and for mostly other readers and your ideas that you have been thinking about for years.  Dr. DAVIES: Right.  FLATOW: And you've argued that a good case - I'm going to read it right from the book - a good case can be made that life and mind are fundamental physical phenomena and so must be incorporated into the overall cosmic scheme. Life and mind\u2026  Dr. DAVIES: Yes.  FLATOW: \u2026we don't think about that as running the universe.  Dr. DAVIES: Well, you see, it's true that most scientists regard life as just some quirky, little embellishment that's added on to the universe as an afterthought, just something that happened in the funny, little corner of the universe, end of story. And when it comes to mind, a similar thing - just a weird aberration, an odd phenomenon of no fundamental significance. And I've always thought that this is deeply wrong, that life and, eventually, mind are fundamental features of the universe, fundamental in the same sense that the elementary particles of fundamental or the dimensions of space are fundamental.  So they play a deep role. And one of the reasons that that idea was reinforced is because if the universe had any old rag bag of laws, if I gave you the task of designers of universe, you'd make a hash of it. And you've got a universe in which almost certainly, there could be no life. The one we're in is fine-tuned for life, there's no real disagreement about that. Where we start scrubbing is over where the explanation is.  I take the reason for the fine-tuning to be that life itself and consciousness - the existence of conscious beings - is deeply fundamental to the great overall scheme of things. And any attempt to explain existence, the ultimate explanation of existence at a really basic level has to incorporate life and mind in a basic way and not just sort of throw them in as a lucky bonus or something.

And I can't help wondering if there's a blurring of the lines between science and something else, maybe theology or something else.  Dr. DAVIES: Well, in one sense, you couldn't be more wrong because this is an attempt to explain the universe - why it exists, why it has the laws it does or why life and mind exist from entirely within the universe, because one of the things I want to do is get away from the notion that somehow this magic has been imprinted on the universe from without. Instead of appealing to something outside like a god or some set of laws that just happens to exist conveniently, I want to try and explain everything scientifically from within, so it's the exact opposite of what you were suggesting.  But if you're saying that in revisiting these topics, like how did the universe come to exist? What is the place of human beings in the great scheme? Are we trespassing on territory previously occupied by priests and philosophers? Well, then yes, of course. Any attempt to grapple with the deep discretions of existence is going to stray across that line that formerly was the province of philosophy. It's now becoming part of science and I'm taking a thoroughly scientific view of how to explain these things. So I would say that I disagree with your earlier sentiment. And one other thing to say\u2026  DAVID: I understand that the physical constants, they're not something which sort arbitrarily occurred, but they're a product of life or mind?  Dr. DAVIES: The - what I'm saying is that these physical constants which have to be fine-tuned in order for there to be life\u2026  DAVID: Right.  Dr. DAVIES: \u2026these are - when the universe came into existence, these were not nailed down with that is that we have now. They were - some are fuzzy and unfocused. And the way in which they focused in on the bio-friendly set is connected with the very existence of observing beings who appear billions of years later through this quantum feedback loop which John Wheeler explicated in its original form about 30 years ago, and I've tried to develop this now. So that's the link that takes us from\u2026  DAVID: Is it cause-and-effect relationship?  Dr. DAVIES: Well, you have to be really careful in quantum physics with cause-and-effect\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. DAVIES: \u2026you know, what they are in daily life, but in some sense, it is. It's more of a consistency.  FLATOW: David, you know, the attempt on the mistake I made before in using the word, you know, change something that happened earlier is the trap that you - we're both falling into. You're saying that, you know, by influencing -listening to Dr. Davies talking about the humans influencing the direction the universe takes, you're saying that we can go back and influence what happened or where there's a direct link but there's isn't. It's a spooky action that's really hard to understand. And I certainly don't understand all of it and\u2026  DAVID: Well, I guess what I had in my mind was that if the proposition is the minds or the lives have been the feature which - maybe causes isn't the right word - but which had an end product such that the universe have the particular set of features that it had, then it seems that in a way that's like positing a creator.  Dr. DAVIES: Why is that? Because the universe is engineering then self-awareness. Otherwise, you're stuck with the notion that something outside the universe has engineered it, but what is that? You know, I'll just turn it around. What is that going to be? That's either going to be a pre-existing designer God or some magical set of laws or something outside the universe. I want it to all be done from within inside and so the universe engineers its own self-awareness.  DAVID: But if with the - what you call the magical set of laws, those are laws which are observable. And if they're observable, then that seems like it's a proper thing to have as part of science. If\u2026  Dr. DAVIES: Yeah, but where did they come from? That's the point. You're saying that they got imprinted on the universe like the Maker's mark by some external agency at the time of the Big Bang? You see I don't buy that because that is appealing to some creator being outside the universe.  FLATOW: So you're saying the universe is self-contained and self-changing within itself?  Dr. DAVIES: And self-explanatory. Exactly. It's\u2026  FLATOW: And self-explanatory and\u2026  Dr. DAVIES: It's an attempt to get everything out of the common explanatory package instead of just shoving it off outside the universe, oh, well, God did it. Oh, well, some magical set of laws just happened to exist or there's an infinite number of unseen universe. I want to do it all from within the universe.  FLATOW: And if there were not intelligent beings here, would the universe exist?  Dr. DAVIES: That's a deep philosophical question that you have to make up your mind about. Does something that can never even, in principle, be observed, can it really be said to exist? Some people think yes. Some people think no. It depends on your philosophical stance. I keep changing my mind though.  FLATOW: I was going to ask you that - does your head swim sometimes as much as mine does at this moment and as much as our listeners do, trying to understand this?  Dr. DAVIES: Dealing with the deepest questions of existence is always challenging. And what I said at the end of the book, incidentally, because some of this stuff sounds just plain wacky, is that everybody's theory of the universe is plain wacky. You know what have we got? There's an unexplained God that just did it - how nice. There's a set of physical laws that just happened to be right for life and so on - well, how convenient. There's an infinite number of universes we can never see even in principle. Well, you know, what (unintelligible)? They all seem totally crazy if you're dealing with the deepest questions of existence. Everything is going to seem bizarre. And I reckon what I'm offering is the least crazy of the lot, but it still sounds pretty wacky.  FLATOW: I think it was John Wheeler, I remember interviewing him many years ago, was saying, oh, maybe he was quoting Einstein in saying the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible.  Dr. DAVIES: Right. And this is a big point because human beings are not just observers. It's not like, you know, we're selecting our place in the universe because we just happened to be here observing it, we can understand it, too. It's comprehensible to us. And that's why I think there is this deep link but I don't think that mind is just a trivial little embellishment because why do we have to understand the universe? That suggests that our minds are linked in to the workings of the universe in a very deep way and that's why I say fundamental. Not fundamental in some sort of there are some spirit or anything like that, you know, just sort of pasted on, that's not what I meant. The first caller seemed to misunderstand that.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. DAVIES: I mean, fundamental in the sense of cosmic significance, that the workings of the universe as a whole requires to understand it.  FLATOW: But you know when you talk to scientists - and I've talked to many of them - they all sway, they stay away from the question of why the universe seems strangely suited that way.  Dr. DAVIES: Yeah, they don't like it because it makes them feel very uncomfortable. I've just run through the alternatives on (unintelligible) that you appeal to some external God who's unexplained - well, scientists don't like that. That there's an infinite number of universes - well, they don't like that because it's just that theories of physics permit an infinite number of alternative realities and they'd rather just describe this reality.  And they, generally speaking, feel very uncomfortable with the idea of bringing observers into the picture because physicists, traditionally, have tried to ignore mind - life and mind. They feel the very essence of physics is to be objective that everyone can agree, doesn't matter how the observer is moving, what their stance is, it will all agree to a common set of results.  But at some stage, we must incorporate consciousness - or mind, if you like -into our description of the physical universe in a totally non-mystical way. The moment it's like sort of added on as an extra, most physicists try not to think about it, but they think about it as being sort of something else. I would like to see an understanding of the conscious mind thoroughly integrated into physics, which means finding mechanisms that explain conscious experiences and how those experiences react back on the universe. And quantum physics, by general consent, seems to be the best way of getting at that connection.  FLATOW: Talking with Paul Davies, author of \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right for Life\" on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News, a truly fascinating book in concept.  So you're wrestling with this, you put out this idea, and you're still working it out in your own mind.  Dr. DAVIES: Yes, I mentioned that the gem of this idea of somehow the universe explaining itself and the existence of observers reacting back on the universe to make it bio-friendly, that idea was - put out by John Archibald Wheeler, he of the black hole fame about 30 years ago, but he called it an idea for an idea. He didn't develop it beyond thinking that quantum physics will be the way to bring about this connection.  What I've been trying to do is to take this step further. How is it the case that the laws of physics are malleable in this way? You know, mostly you think that they're just sort of absolute fixed universal laws precisely now down from the get-go. But indeed, there is a way with our further understanding now of the nature of black holes, the nature of (unintelligible) in cosmology and understanding of how the laws of physics could be malleable, could be flexible, flexi-laws is what Stephen Hawking calls it. And so these flexi-laws of flexi history is just what we need to bring about this sort self-consistent explanatory loop.  FLATOW: Well, if we have - if 75 percent of the universe, the dark energy, we have no idea what it is.  Dr. DAVIES: Right. Well, we have an idea, there's plenty of theories. But the\u2026  FLATOW: Well\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. DAVIES: I've never been too troubled by this.  FLATOW: You're not troubled that we don't know - or we have theories but, you know, it's just mysterious.  Dr. DAVIES: I think it's exciting to contemplate and the lion's share comes from the circle of dark energy, the thing that's making the universe\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. DAVIES: \u2026accelerate, spin faster and faster. And this dark energy at the moment is indistinguishable from the quantum vacuums - we're back to the dready(ph) quantum again. Quantum physics tells us that empty space should have a weird type of energy that would have an anti-gravity effect. And I've worked on that quantum vacuum, the gravity of the quantum vacuum for most of my career so I had a soft spot for it. The only problem is that when you put the numbers in, it's famously 120 pounds (unintelligible) that we get out of the theories. So, you know, nice try, but we got to get that number down from that.  FLATOW: I have 30 seconds, just to ask you, Dr. Davies, do we need new physics? Will the physics we have explain what you're trying to describe?  Dr. DAVIES: No. We need something new and in particular, we need something that will bring the laws of physics themselves within the scope of science.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And there's the search. And I want to thank you very much, Paul Davies, for taking time to talk with us and continue the great work in tweaking our minds to think.  Dr. DAVIES: It's been great fun. Thanks.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Paul Davies is author of \"Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right for Life. \" A terrific read, I highly recommend it. It's really thought-provoking.

Just ahead: the virtue of celibacy. She is a doctor and a minister, and she says she is a virgin and proud of it. We will let her tell you all about it. That's next. But first, in the 1960s, LSD was touted as a potential wonder drug for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. But in the tune-in, turn on, dropout days of a counterculture era, it was also abused, and the U. S. government outlawed it in 1971. For two decades, there was an almost total ban on medical experimentation with hallucinogenic drugs. But those restrictions are beginning to loosen, and researchers are starting to look at uses for the drug MDMA. It's better known on the streets and nightclubs as ecstasy. An FDA-approved study is currently investigating whether MDMA could be effective in treating people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. In this week's Washington Post Magazine, author Tom Shroder talks about that study in his story, \"The Peace Drug. \" Shroder is editor of the magazine. He's here with us in the studio. Also joining us is Dr. Michael Mithoefer, who conducted the experiments. He is at ARP studios in Charleston, South Carolina. Welcome to both of you, gentlemen. Dr. MICHAEL MITHOEFER (Associate Clinical Professor of Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons):  Well, thank you. Glad to be here. Mr. TOM SHRODER (Editor, Washington Post Magazine): Thank you. Nice to be here. MARTIN: Tom, how did you get interested in this subject? Mr. SHRODER: Oh, I actually knew Rick Doblin, who is the man behind the funding of many of these studies, with an organization called the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. I knew him when I was a college student, and I've followed his career since that time. MARTIN: And - so Dr. Mithoefer, how - what gave you the idea to use MDMA to treat post-traumatic stress disorder? What is it about that drug that gave you the idea that it could be helpful? And how does it work? Dr. MITHOEFER: Well, I treated a lot of people with post-traumatic stress disorder, and I was aware of the anecdotal reports from the period when MDMA was actually a legal substance. A number of therapists used it, and although no controlled trials were done, they reported on the effects. And, you know, our hypothesis is that since fear and defensiveness are part of PTSD - post-traumatic stress disorder - then they can also be obstacles to the treatment, because treatment involves revisiting the trauma in therapy. So the idea is that if this is a drug that could help reduce of levels of fear and defensiveness and allow people to then revisit the trauma in a therapeutic way, that it could be helpful. And these are people who are resistant to treatment. All of our subjects have had treatment with both medications and therapy in the past, and still have very significant PTSD symptoms. MARTIN: Are there any other effective treatments for PTSD? Or are these\u2026 Dr. MITHOEFER: There are. MARTIN: \u2026patients just so in such distress that just - the conventional treatments aren't working? Dr. MITHOEFER: Right. There are a number of effective treatments: exposure therapy, cognitive behavior therapy, EMDR, other talking therapies, and they can be very effective for some people. But there's a significant number of people who are still not helped by those treatments. MARTIN: Now, you, as a former emergency room doctor, I would have to assume you've seen the effects of MDMA, or ecstasy, being abused. So did you have any concern starting these trials, that this just might not be worth it? Dr. MITHOEFER: Well, yes\u2026 MARTIN: Might do more harm than good, I guess. Dr. MITHOEFER: Right. That's always an important consideration. It's a matter of weighing the risk versus the possible benefits, and we looked at that very carefully. And while there's still unanswered questions about recreational use and there's no question that MDMA can be dangerous in some situations, there's quite a bit of phase one safety data from studies in the United States and Europe using doses similar to the ones we're using under medical supervision -pure MDMA - that have shown that can be safely administered in that kind of situation. MARTIN: Tom Shroder, for many years, the federal government's refused to allow even the study of therapeutic uses of so-called psychedelic drugs. Why did that ban start, and why is it starting to change? Mr. SHRODER: Well, I think it started because of the, really, with Timothy Leary, who began the scientific study of psychedelic drugs and then turned into a cheerleader for the widespread abuse of it, I think that scared a lot of people. And it also became associated with a counterculture that was also frightening to the establishment, so I think there was a political element, as well. And clearly, there are many more drugs that are even more dangerous than these that are used for medical purposes all the time. So I do think that the extent of the prohibition is partly - has a political dimension to it, and I just think that a lot of patient work by a lot of people who believed in the potential of these drugs over many years has finally yielded some results with scientific studies that, as Dr. Mithoefer showed, said that in the small doses in clinical situations, that this certainly was not as dangerous as many drugs that have a very important medical use. MARTIN: But you've also point out in the article that some of the other people who've gotten interested in this subject from a research perspective become - well, how can I put it? Get a little too close to the subject, maybe, for comfort. They just become advocates in a way that seems to detract from people's willingness to accept some of the science. I just wonder why that is. I mean, Rick Doblin is a person you met who's very\u2026 Mr. SHRODER: Well, Rick Doblin - right, right. Rick Doblin\u2026 MARTIN: \u2026he's very excited about the government policy related to illegal drugs and\u2026 Mr. SHRODER: And he also has a libertarian element, in his viewpoint that the government shouldn't control what people choose to do with their bodies. But again, he has a scientific - he agrees with Dr. Mithoefer that if MDMA was ever going to prove its effectiveness, that even then it should only be used in specialized clinics. And Dr. Mithoefer can speak to this with trained clinicians who are trained in administering this therapy. MARTIN: Dr. Mithoefer, can - talk to me about what you've found so far. How has this drug worked with the patients that you've worked with so far? How do the benefits last, and is addiction a problem? Dr. MITHOEFER: Well, I want to emphasize, first of all, that this is just preliminary data. This is a small pilot study, and we haven't even finished this study yet. So we realize that there - we have a long way to go before we prove anything about effectiveness. But what I can say is that preliminary data is encouraging, and these people who have failed other treatments were seeing significant decreases in their scores of PTSD symptoms measured by objective measures in many of the people. MARTIN: And is addiction a problem? Is it an issue? Or I guess they're just not, they're not on - first of all, they're so closely monitored, and secondly, they're not on it long enough for that to manifest itself if that were a possibility. Is that it? Dr. MITHOEFER: Well, right. One important point is we don't give people MDMA every day or any MDMA to take home. They only receive it the maximum of three times under our direct supervision with a male and female therapist present, and so there's no potential for misusing the MDMA we're giving them. And what we've seen is people at the end of this study tend to have the feeling that, you know, this is a serious thing that's - they're - they've been introduced to, usually, and most people have not taken it before. They've experienced it in a medical setting, and they were not seeing people having the inclination to go out and take it on their own and use it. MARTIN: So what's next? What happens next? You've completed the first year phase of the clinical trial. What's next? Dr. MITHOEFER: Yeah, this is phase two. We need to finish the study, which will happen this fall - I mean, this coming summer. And then, we're looking at moving on to larger phase three trials, which would be in multi centers, and involving many more subjects. And those larger trials have been in position to statistically show whether or not this is an effective treatment. MARTIN: Tom Shroder, a final question to you, just about a minute left here. Do you feel that sort of overall, the context in which we discuss treatments for drug addiction where alcohol or whatever drug is changing, or is this just kind of a happy accident that the seriousness of PTSD as such that the public health demand - particularly given all the soldiers coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan - is such that there's a willingness to bend the rules in this particular way? Or is something larger changing in our society and the way we think about the uses of drugs? Mr. SHRODER: Well, I actually don't think it's bending any rules. I think the FDA deserves some credit here for saying, well, we're going to look at this. And if there's good science that shows this is an effective treatment, then we're going to proceed as we would with any other potentially helpful drug. MARTIN: But it has required a change in perception, a change in attitude in order to get to this point. And I'm wondering whether you think there's a broader shift in attitude taking place, or is this just that the system is correcting itself in going back to the science? Mr. SHRODER: Yeah, I think that that is actually the way to look at it, is these drugs always had potential, and they had - they just flat out banned anybody from looking at it for a generation, and now that is going away. And I think there's going to be a lot more serious examination of the potential of these drugs for helpful medical use. MARTIN: Tom Shroder is editor of the Washington Post Magazine.

Do you feel that sort of overall, the context in which we discuss treatments for drug addiction where alcohol or whatever drug is changing, or is this just kind of a happy accident that the seriousness of PTSD as such that the public health demand - particularly given all the soldiers coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan - is such that there's a willingness to bend the rules in this particular way? Or is something larger changing in our society and the way we think about the uses of drugs?  Mr. SHRODER: Well, I actually don't think it's bending any rules. I think the FDA deserves some credit here for saying, well, we're going to look at this. And if there's good science that shows this is an effective treatment, then we're going to proceed as we would with any other potentially helpful drug.  MARTIN: But it has required a change in perception, a change in attitude in order to get to this point. And I'm wondering whether you think there's a broader shift in attitude taking place, or is this just that the system is correcting itself in going back to the science?  Mr. SHRODER: Yeah, I think that that is actually the way to look at it, is these drugs always had potential, and they had - they just flat out banned anybody from looking at it for a generation, and now that is going away. And I think there's going to be a lot more serious examination of the potential of these drugs for helpful medical use.  MARTIN: Tom Shroder is editor of the Washington Post Magazine. He's author of this week's story, \"The Peace Drug. \"  We were also joined by Dr. Michael Mithoefer. He's a psychiatrist and researcher in Charleston, South Carolina.

The cosmetic surgery industry is booming. Botox injections are all the rage. Television programs like \"Nip/Tuck\" and the reality show \"Dr. 90210\" seem to mirror our enduring quest to stay young and beautiful no matter what it takes. But as routine as these operations may seem on TV, sometimes things go horribly wrong. Two weeks ago, Donda West, the mother of rap star Kanye West, died a day after visiting a plastic surgeon. The doctor says he performed breast reduction, tummy tuck and liposuction procedures. Early indications suggest that Donda West died from surgical complications. An official cause of death won't be determined for weeks. The surgeon denies any wrongdoing. But on the Internet, a lot of blog posters did not blame the surgeon. They blamed the patient. The negative backlash prompted Washington Post fashion editor Robin Givhan to write: Popular culture pushes and pushes and pushes people toward an ideal and then tut-tuts when they take the bait.

Ms. ROBIN GIVHAN (Fashion Editor, The Washington Post): Oh, it's nice to be here. CONAN: And you write that celebrities these days get caught no matter which way it works. The Internet, you say, is filled with speculation about which celebrities have had work done and how terrible it is. Celebrities are trapped, mocked if they look bad, mocked for trying desperately to look good. Ms. GIVHAN: Now, it's true. There's - there are lot of Web sites and one in particular, you know, awfulplasticsurgery. com, and you can spend hours whiling away the day, looking at these photographs in which people literally speculate on who's had a little bit shaved off the tip of their nose, who's had their ears done, their breasts done. And, I mean, it's a real kind of picking apart of celebrities, not what they're wearing but just, you know, the physical aspect of the celebrity. CONAN: And there's no way to win - either you're old and age and gravity have taken their toll, or you're desperate and narcissistic. Ms. GIVHAN: Well, I think that there is - there really isn't a way to win. I mean, I think that there are some celebrities who, or some famous people who are lucky enough that they got the genes that allow them to age well or at least in a way that we, as a culture, sort of deems as aging well. But, you know, the rest of us are kind of subject to this really impossible standard, and it's a standard that I think comes from both the world around us but also from within. We want to be beautiful, essentially. CONAN: And - well, obviously, the standard, though, is - may come from within, but it has external measurements, if you will. Ms. GIVHAN: It does. I mean, it has the standard that is set by fashion magazines, standards that's set by a film industry. And even though intellectually we know that the images that we see in a magazine or on the screen are not real in the sense that they haven't been altered or they haven't been improved significantly with the magic of makeup or the, you know, the artistry of filmmaking, we still kind of take that in and use that as the standard. And when - sometimes, you know, when I'm looking at the fashion industry and the latest trend in makeup is the so-called natural look, I find that even more disturbing than when they're talking about a hyper glamour look, because when they talk about the natural look, the reality is that there's absolutely nothing natural about it at all but there's just been a lot of makeup applied to look as seamless as possible. And I think it kind of exacerbates that idea of being able to roll out of bed and essentially looking like Halle Berry. CONAN: Yet, this ideal that we hold up to that not only do we - are we supposed to look great, we're supposed to look effortless as we do it. Ms. GIVHAN: Yeah. I mean, that's kind of the really nagging problem, I think, the idea that you're not supposed to show any effort, you're - you know, it's - you hear these interviews with models quite often. And they'll - people will ask them, what's your fitness regimen? And they'll ask that question to a Hollywood celebrity. And nine times out of ten, they are reluctant to say to you that, well, I use a nutritionist and I have a personal trainer, and I haven't had a cookie since 1975. Instead, what they want to say to you is, oh, I don't really do anything. I lost 50 pounds of baby weight because I was just running around, you know, cleaning up the house or something. CONAN: And do you want split a plate of fries? Ms. GIVHAN: Yeah, exactly. CONAN: Our number is 800-989-8255. If you'd like to join us: 800-989-TALK. E-mail is talk@npr. org. Our guest Robin Givhan, the fashion editor for the Washington Post. Let's get Barry(ph) on the line, Barry calling us from Santa Rosa in California. BARRY (Caller): Hi. I've been a plastic surgeon for 28 years. And there is sort of a misconception to why people to come a plastic surgeon. No one comes to me and says make me look beautiful. People come in because they have a problem, and they want the problem to go away. Maybe they look in the mirror and all they see is their nose. And they want to feel whole again. And there is something in the media about people wanting to look beautiful and such like that. But that's sort of not the experience that we have. There's a lot of advertising now by people who aren't really plastic surgeons. I mean, I do cleft lips and palates and reconstructive surgery as well as aesthetic surgery. But now, we have even in our area, general surgeons and gynecologists and people who are saying they're doing plastic surgery - what they mean is cosmetic surgery. But basically, people come in to solve a problem. And I think that the idea that people are coming in to make beautiful is really overemphasized. CONAN: Well, maybe a specific problem, the puffiness under the eyes or something like that. But isn't that a product of age in some respects? BARRY: Well, I mean, I think that people as they get older look better. But some people that they look in the mirror and - that's all they see. They get fixated on these things and they want to have it go away. It's sort of the opposite of tattoos. People get tattoos because they want identity with the tattoo. People get plastic surgery because they want things to disappear, whether it's - the bags under their eyes. And sometimes, the bags under their eyes are caused by loose ligaments that caused extra tearing. So there are various things. Generally, I try to talk people out of surgery and not, you know, suggest anything that they should have done. But - I mean, I operate all the time and I never have somebody come in and says, how can you make me look better. If somebody comes in to me and says what do you suggest I have done, I'll tell them, well, what bother you - I'll ask what bothers you. And as I said - if somebody said I want to be beautiful, I would tell them you are beautiful. CONAN: Isn't this just, in a way, sort of semantics, though? I mean, I want my, you know, face to be as seamless as it was when I was 25. BARRY: Well, that's not going to happen. I mean, people have unrealistic expectations. Like, for instance, breast surgery - by far, many women have breast surgery, like breast enhancement. Well, women in their 30s who breastfed multiple children and now have very saggy sort of empty fats and they want to go back. They want their breast not to be an issue. I do lots of breast reductions. And the breast reductions are because people don't want their breasts to be an issue for that opposite reason. CONAN: Yeah. And I wonder all those other surgeons who are crowding into the act, they - you figured that they're doing this - that has to be because there's tremendous demand for this. BARRY: There is. There's a huge demand for it, but you have to be very, very careful and assess people of what their expectations are, what their motivations are for having it. And certainly, there's going to be some outliers or people who were trying to be talked into things. I mean, I do a lot of noses. And I've had people come to me who've been talked in - so they went to a surgeon because they have sinus trouble. And then they - the doctor says I can make your nose look better. And the patient says, well, I didn't know anything wrong with my nose, but if you say so. And then they'll come to me. They had their nose put back\u2026 CONAN: Repaired, yes. BARRY: \u2026because now - there's a problem there wasn't one before. CONAN: Now, I understand. Barry, thanks very much for the call. We appreciate it. BARRY: Thank you. CONAN: And from his point of view, I can understand the distinction. But nevertheless, I don't think that undermines your point, Robin. Ms. GIVHAN: No. But I mean, I understand what he's saying. It's the rare person who comes in and says please make me look like Brad Pitt. I think those are the people who end up on bad reality shows and we're sort of looking at them, you know, like a train wreck or something. I think what happens is people are, in fact, bothered by some aspect of their appearance. And it calls to mind a story I did a long time ago actually about a woman who was, at that point, in her 60s, and she was going in for a face-lift and a brow lift and some dermabrasion. And it was, I believe, if I remember correctly, about her second or third face-lift. And one of the things that she said to me that I thought was really quite telling about why she was going in was that she felt very young inside. She felt like she did when she was in her 30s and 40s. But she didn't like the fact that people were treating her like an old person. And she wanted her outside to match how she still envisioned herself on the inside. Now, I think that's a really complicated reason for going in, and it's not solely about just I want to look younger or I want to look prettier. But I think it does tap into this really complicated relationship that we do have with the idea that beauty is better on in terms of youthful beauty as opposed to the beauty that comes with age, and certainly as it applies to women. CONAN: And you also write that to be fair, giving in to youth culture does have real rewards: job opportunities, financial gain, flattery. Ms. GIVHAN: Oh, absolutely. I mean, people are very quick to say that when they see someone who they know has had plastic surgery and it's been done incredibly well, there is an incredible amount of a flattery. You know, what they say, oh, you know, they don't look like they had any work done. They just look like they finally got a good night sleep. They look really rested. And that's seen as this little victory that, you know, they have managed to have the plastic surgery and do it in a way that is culturally acceptable. For instance, the person who goes in - and perhaps, it is more obvious. And the fact that we can see the telltale signs of it, we decide that that person has failed and that's been inappropriate. CONAN: Not the surgeon, the person has failed. Yeah. Ms. GIVHAN: The person has failed. They chose the wrong surgeon. Not that the surgeon has done a bad job. CONAN: Robin Givhan is our guest, fashion editor for the Washington Post. 800-989-8255. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And let's get Paul(ph) on the line, Paul with us from Mason City in Iowa. PAUL (Caller): Hello. CONAN: Hi, Paul. You're on the air. PAUL: Thanks for taking my call. CONAN: Sure. Thanks for calling. PAUL: I just like to make a small comment that based on the case that you were talking about earlier, I think that the person that has the surgery should take full responsibility for the choice. Not the - the surgeon is making a service to the people. I think it's an epidemic of the wealthy that they get diluted by pop culture. And I mean, I think that plastic surgeons that do miracle works for people in a car crash or (unintelligible)\u2026 CONAN: Yeah. Or born with a cleft palate or any of those things, yes, we understand. PAUL: That is, you know, that's something that should be accepted as it helps the person's well-being. But people that just want to change their face or try to improve their physical structure, that's unnatural. I believe that's their own problem, if they do have any problem after the case. CONAN: So it's their own fault if the surgeon messes up. PAUL: It's definitely their own fault. CONAN: Uh-huh. PAUL: They made the choice, whether which surgeon they decide to go to. They knew the risk. And they should take responsibility for it. And\u2026 CONAN: It's a little coldhearted, don't you think, Paul? PAUL: Not necessarily because why should people have to change the way that they look if - that they are born naturally. I mean, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And if you're a beautiful person inside, it really shouldn't matter what you look like. CONAN: Okay. PAUL: No matter who tries it, whether it's television or magazines that tries to influence people, it's poor choices that people make. That's what usually ends up being the regret. CONAN: All right. Thanks very much for the call. And I have to say, Robin Givhan, comments like that were not uncommon after the Donda West's case came. Ms. GIVHAN: Yeah. I mean, I think it's so disturbing that someone can be that coldhearted, frankly. I mean, one of the things that I think we're all aware of is that, you know, we're a very visual culture. And there have been studies that have shown that people who are more attractive have a lot of advantages, whether it's being paid more or whether it's being - given the benefit of the doubt. There are a lot of advantages for being perceived as attractive. And I don't think that you can really judge unless you've walked in someone else's shoes and you've lived, you know, in their body to really be able to understand what it's like when people respond to you in certain ways. What I think is sort of sad is that, you know, plastic surgery, aesthetic plastic surgery has, in fact, been able to transform a lot of lives. And it's done a lot of good, I think, I assume, for a lot of people. What happens, though, is I think we've often become a bit immune to really how drastic of a procedure some of these things really are. CONAN: How easy it looks on TV. Ms. GIVHAN: It looks so easy. And even with television shows like \"Extreme Makeover,\" where you actually do see some of what happens when someone has plastic surgery, its still television. And, you know, the recovery time takes approximately 45 minutes as opposed to the weeks of recovery time that it does in reality. And I think it would behoove a lot of people if they could actually sort of see what really goes on during a face-lift or during rhinoplasty. And to know that when someone goes in and makes a decision to do that, they're really making an enormous decision. I mean, it's not something that they've undertaken lightly no matter how frivolous, I think, it may seem to other people. And certainly to say that it's something that's relegated to, you know, the rich and famous, I think, is not really true anymore. I mean, it's become far, far, far more accessible. CONAN: Robin Givhan, thanks very much for your time. Ms. GIVHAN: Thank you. CONAN: Robin Givhan is the fashion editor for the Washington Post, and joined us today from our bureau in New York City.

And if you're a beautiful person inside, it really shouldn't matter what you look like.  CONAN: Okay.  PAUL: No matter who tries it, whether it's television or magazines that tries to influence people, it's poor choices that people make. That's what usually ends up being the regret.  CONAN: All right. Thanks very much for the call. And I have to say, Robin Givhan, comments like that were not uncommon after the Donda West's case came.  Ms. GIVHAN: Yeah. I mean, I think it's so disturbing that someone can be that coldhearted, frankly. I mean, one of the things that I think we're all aware of is that, you know, we're a very visual culture. And there have been studies that have shown that people who are more attractive have a lot of advantages, whether it's being paid more or whether it's being - given the benefit of the doubt. There are a lot of advantages for being perceived as attractive. And I don't think that you can really judge unless you've walked in someone else's shoes and you've lived, you know, in their body to really be able to understand what it's like when people respond to you in certain ways.  What I think is sort of sad is that, you know, plastic surgery, aesthetic plastic surgery has, in fact, been able to transform a lot of lives. And it's done a lot of good, I think, I assume, for a lot of people. What happens, though, is I think we've often become a bit immune to really how drastic of a procedure some of these things really are.  CONAN: How easy it looks on TV.  Ms. GIVHAN: It looks so easy. And even with television shows like \"Extreme Makeover,\" where you actually do see some of what happens when someone has plastic surgery, its still television. And, you know, the recovery time takes approximately 45 minutes as opposed to the weeks of recovery time that it does in reality.  And I think it would behoove a lot of people if they could actually sort of see what really goes on during a face-lift or during rhinoplasty. And to know that when someone goes in and makes a decision to do that, they're really making an enormous decision. I mean, it's not something that they've undertaken lightly no matter how frivolous, I think, it may seem to other people. And certainly to say that it's something that's relegated to, you know, the rich and famous, I think, is not really true anymore. I mean, it's become far, far, far more accessible.  CONAN: Robin Givhan, thanks very much for your time.  Ms. GIVHAN: Thank you.  CONAN: Robin Givhan is the fashion editor for the Washington Post, and joined us today from our bureau in New York City.

He thought wrong. Tom Kramer of Interlochen Public Radio reports. TOM KRAMER: It was a warm late summer day when Mark Holley stretched and pulled his way into a wet suit and splashed into the dark blue water of Grand Traverse Bay. He came back to this spot to look for a long line of rocks that he discovered weeks earlier. The most interesting rock measures about three and a half feet by five feet. When he first saw it, Holley wiped off several inches of zebra mussels and revealed what looks like scratches all over the surface of the rock. Mark Holley is one of just a handful of underwater archeologists in the U. S. He earned his Ph. D. in underwater archeology at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. And he was pretty sure he had found something of interest, so he took some pictures.  Back in his home office, when he had a chance to dry off and take a closer look at those pictures, an image started to jump out at him. An elephant? Dr. MARK HOLLY (Underwater Archeologist): No, this is crazy. There's no way it's an elephant, right? There's no way it's an elephant. And I don't know, I guess I'd forgot when I was in third grade there and we went down to the museum in Ann Arbor, the natural history museum - what's the most prominent display in there? Well, it's of a Michigan mastodon, right? Which is essentially an ancient elephant that lived in the area.  KRAMER: In fact, more than 250 fossilized mastodons have been found in Michigan. So Holly looked at the photo again and again and again, and then he started asking other people what they saw, including some members of the Grand Traverse band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, whose tribal lands are near the site.  Not only did they see a mastodon etched on that rock, but they saw something else. They told Holly that a diagonal line coming from what would be the chest of the mastodon has tell-tale markings of being a spear complete with feathers. And that could signal only one thing, that humans hunted mastodons.  For years, experts in Michigan and around the country have collected evidence that humans ate mastodons, even storing the meat for months in cold water. But there has never been widely accepted conclusive evidence that the animals were actually hunted by humans. Dr. HOLLY: Everybody has theorized that ancient humans hunted mastodons, but nobody has got the smoking gun that they actually have. And this could be the smoking gun. KRAMER: Although he is genuinely excited about what he may have found, Mark Holly is quick to point out that there is plenty of work to do to verify, or debunk, what exactly is on that rock sitting on the bottom of the bay.  Charles Cleland agrees with that skepticism. He's professor emeritus of archeology at Michigan State University, and he's seen the photos and looked at the data. Professor CHARLES CLELAND (Michigan State University): Things like this are always going to be controversial. But this would be a giant find if true, and you know, it would be of great interest to archeologists all over North America.  KRAMER: It's also of great interest to local Native Americans. While members of the local tribe are reluctant to speak publicly about the find, John Bailey isn't. Bailey is a member of a different tribe and a former director of the Governor's Commission on Indian Affairs in Michigan. Mr. JOHN BAILEY: I think it's highly significant because now it will lay to rest many of the myths and legends that have been created about the people in this region. And when you pinpoint when the wooly mammoth roamed and who hunted them, and with what equipment and what tools, really it verifies what as natives we have told these stories for hundreds of years. KRAMER: For now, photos of the stone have been sent to experts around the country. The rock itself is still on the bottom of Grand Traverse Bay. Its exact location is a closely guarded secret to protect the site's integrity. Mark Holly, in the meantime, is continuing to dive the site looking for more signs of ancient people, or at least clues to history hiding under the waves.

Later in the program, two women judges in Cameroon try to even the scales of justice for women and children. A new documentary airing tonight tells their story. We'll talk with the Mocha Moms on the never-ending battle to keep teens safe while driving, and a look back at Jimi Hendrix. He would have been 65 today. But first: World AIDS Day is Saturday, and a new report this week shows that this nation's capital is also the nation's HIV capital. Washington, D. C. has the nation's highest rate of HIV/AIDS infection in the country, a rate 10 times higher than the national average. The report by the city's HIV/AIDS Administration showed that 1 in 20 residents has HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and 1 in 50 has AIDS. And a disproportionate number of those cases were among African-Americans. The new report shows, in this city at least, how deeply the disease has penetrated both the general population and the African-American community. In the studio with us to talk about this is Dr. Shannon Hader. She's director of the Washington, D. C. HIV/AIDS Administration. We're also joined by Rae Lewis Thornton, an AIDS survivor and a longtime AIDS educator. She's at NPR's Chicago bureau. Ladies, welcome, and thank you so much for speaking with us about this important topic. Ms. RAE LEWIS-THORNTON (AIDS Educator): Thank you for having us. Dr. SHANNON HADER (Director, HIV/AIDS Administration): Thank you. Great to be here. MARTIN: Dr. Hader, the numbers are certainly sobering, but are they surprising in any way to you? Dr. HADER: Well, I think more than surprising, they're important. We can spend a lot of time guessing and postulating and, you know, proposing and planning on faith rather than on facts. And what we have now is we have facts, and we have information, we have a snapshot of where we're at in an epidemic. And that can only help us be better at where we need to go. MARTIN: Eighty percent of the new cases in Washington were among African-Americans. Does this say anything culturally, or is it just a simple fact of arithmetic and demographics that Washington, D. C. is a majority black city? Dr. HADER: Well, I think it shows us where we're at in the modern epidemic. And it can be a wake up call for anyone who's, I think, stuck in the past and has the stereotype in their mind that HIV only affects one face, one type of person, or if they have an image that this is the early '80s, white gay men's disease only. That's just not it. And so, this is something that should be meaningful to residents in the district. MARTIN: Rae, more people became HIV positive through heterosexual sex than through men having sex with men or I. V. drug use. Now, I know you have been talking about this for years, but I wondered if that - the predominance of that is a mode of transmission, did that surprise you? Ms. LEWIS-THORNTON: It didn't. In fact, we've known this about women for years. The fact of the matter is is that they're still - women, for the most part, are infected disproportionately by heterosexual sex. When I looked at the statistics, I'm still in the doubt about the study in regard to we still - there are 23 percent people in this study were still infected unknown. And so I wonder how many of those people are really the other - men who have sex with men and - or I. V. drug use. MARTIN: Not being honest. Ms. LEWIS-THORNTON: Probably men who have sex with men. So, you know, it's alarming, but we still have in the scheme of that study, there's still 23 percent of the people who don't know who they're infected. I'm curious about that. MARTIN: Mm-hmm. You mentioned, Rae, that black women have been particularly hard hit by the disease, but this report also showed that 70 percent of new cases in Washington were men. Why might that be? Ms. LEWIS-THORNTON: You know, I think that we all live in - I think, historically, everyone has wanted to believe that HIV is the other. It's someone else. And so, even among gay men we're seeing a rise of HIV cases because they believe that it's a gay - disease for old gay men and not young gay men. And so I think that we've let our guards down because there isn't enough press about it. There's not enough education about. We've let our guards down because there's a belief that, you know, HIV isn't serious. You know, we've had journalists and the medical doctors comparing it to diabetes, which it's not like diabetes. I live it. I tell you that for sure. And so I think that we haven't made it a serious issue, and so that people haven't let their guards down. And I think that's across the board with whatever community is infected by this disease. MARTIN: Dr. Hader, what do you think about that figure, that 70 percent of new cases being men? What do you think about that? Dr. HADER: Well, I think it - actually, it's consistent with what we're seeing, which is we have multiple high-risk groups in D. C. We don't have a single epidemic. It's not just a heterosexual epidemic. It's not just the men-who-have-sex-with-men epidemic. It's not just an injection-drug-user epidemic. We have multiple risk factors and multiple sort of risk groups going on. And I think the fact that a lot of men are still getting infected does, in fact, reflect the fact that we still have a substantive amount of transmission in the MSM community. And\u2026 MARTIN: Men having sex with men. Dr. HADER: Yeah. I'm sorry. Men having sex with men. I think, importantly, about two-thirds of the men who have sex with men who are reported in this report as having gotten HIV, about two-thirds are black. So I think it's really time to also talk about what it means to be a black, gay man, what it means to be a black man having sex with men and how we support our family, our community and decreasing the stigma and help people protect themselves. MARTIN: Speaking of people protecting themselves, I think people tend to think of AIDS as a disease of the young. A report showed that a majority of new cases in this city were among people older than 40. Now, I found this fascinating because, you know, this generation has spent its entire adulthood in the shadow of HIV. You know, I'm over 40. I remember in my 20s that - people starting to die. And I just wonder, you know, why is this population now so vulnerable? Is it because they don't think they are? Rae, I don't know. You may have some thoughts about this. What do you think? Ms. LEWIS-THORNTON: I think that, you know, at one level, we don't see us - no one sees himself at risk for HIV unless they are I. V. drug users or men who have sex with men. That's a reality. So you have this group of people who are, you know, the over-40 community, the over-65 community, we've seen an increase of the 65 and older with the rising sale of Viagra and Cialis, and so no one wants to believe that they travel in a circle that would be - put them at risk for HIV or that their behavior is risky behavior. And I think that's, you know, part of the problem is how we see risk and how people define risk. Nobody wants to believe that, you know, especially women, that I'm in a monogamous relationship and I'm at risk for HIV. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, this is TELL ME MORE. I'm speaking with Dr. Shannon Hader, director of the Washington, D. C. HIV/AIDS Administration, and Rae Lewis-Thornton, an AIDS survivor and a longtime AIDS educator. Rae, you mentioned you've lived with AIDS for a long time, over 20 years I think it is. Ms. LEWIS-THORNTON: Yes. I was diagnosed 20 years ago. MARTIN: And you were saying that you think people misunderstand. They think now that because we talk about it as a chronic condition, it's like diabetes. And you said it is not that way. Can you just briefly let us\u2026 Ms. LEWIS-THORNTON: It's not that way. MARTIN: \u2026what's different that you think people need to understand? Ms. LEWIS-THORNTON: Well, the fact of the matter is, is there's no cure of HIV. And HIV's a very intelligent virus. It adapts to everything you give it. So eventually, you know, someone who starts out - get early treatment and diagnosis for HIV who starts out at two pills a day will eventually end up where somewhere where I was at. I just switched regiments, but up until two weeks ago, I was injecting in my stomach twice a day and taking 14 pills a day. And so there are side effects to medications, and still, HIV behaves differently in every person, depending on the strain of the virus. And so some people, you know, do very well with drug and treatment and care, and some people do poorly with drug treatment and care. And so this illusion that you can take - pop to two pills in your mouth a day and keep going is just, you know, it's not right. And then there are emotional baggage to HIV that you don't get with other drugs because there's still so much stigma and shame attached to this disease. And many people, especially African-Americans, live in denial. They live in secret. They have no support systems because they're afraid to tell their pastors. They're afraid to tell their mothers. And so, diabetes doesn't carry that kind of weight. MARTIN: Mm-hmm. That's an important point. Dr. Haden, I wanted to ask, what do you want to do now? What is your response to this information now that you have it? I know that you want to ramp up the availability of free condoms in the city. That's one approach you want to take. Why is that important, and what else do you want to do? Dr. HADER: Well, I think we want to hit hard, hit everywhere, so we have multiple approaches to take. Certainly, increasing the availability of free condoms is part of that, but that goes hand and hand also with supporting community-based organizations, faith-based organizations, other members of the community to really also ramp-up prevention skills, negotiation skills, thinking and decision making on how at an individual level we make decisions to keep ourselves safe. In addition to that, I think an important thing we saw in this state as well is that there are a lot of people getting tested too late. They're first finding out they have HIV right around the time they're already immune compromised, they've already developed AIDS. And that's just not okay. We do want people to get tested earlier, to get into care earlier, and to help preserve their health before their immune system has really taken a hard hit. So the second area we're focusing on is really getting more people more routinely tested. And sort of building on that race thing, part of this is trying to shift HIV into a realm like we treat all of our other medical diseases. So when you go get a check up, you should be getting your biomass index for your obesity. And you should be getting your blood pressure checked for hypertension. And you should be getting your blood sugar checked for diabetes. Well, you should also be getting an HIV test. You shouldn't have to beg for that from your provider. MARTIN: Mm-hmm. I see. So, Rae, we have about a minute left. Is there anything over the years you've been working with this and living with this that you think would make a difference? If you could wave your wand, what will it be? Ms. LEWIS-THORNTON: Well, I think that African-Americans specifically have to understand that AIDS is live and real. It's set up camp in our community. We must get tested, because early diagnosis can and will prolong your life. Thirty percent of all new cases of people infected are infected by people who didn't know they were infected. So testing is critical and crucial for African-Americans. We have to then, once we know, go get treatment. So we're dying at a disproportionate rate than our white counterparts because we're not getting treatment and care. And most importantly, we have to have some personal responsibility and begin to use condoms 100 percent of the time. And that's the bottom line, because AIDS is not going anywhere. MARTIN: All right. Rae, thank you so much for what you've been doing all these years to keep people informed. Rae Lewis-Thornton is an AIDS survivor and educator. She joins us from our NPR Chicago Bureau. We were also joined by Dr. Shannon Hader. She's the director of the D. C. HIV/AIDS Administration. And she was kind enough to join me here in our Washington studio.

So you have this group of people who are, you know, the over-40 community, the over-65 community, we've seen an increase of the 65 and older with the rising sale of Viagra and Cialis, and so no one wants to believe that they travel in a circle that would be - put them at risk for HIV or that their behavior is risky behavior. And I think that's, you know, part of the problem is how we see risk and how people define risk. Nobody wants to believe that, you know, especially women, that I'm in a monogamous relationship and I'm at risk for HIV.  MARTIN: If you're just joining us, this is TELL ME MORE.  I'm speaking with Dr. Shannon Hader, director of the Washington, D. C. HIV/AIDS Administration, and Rae Lewis-Thornton, an AIDS survivor and a longtime AIDS educator.  Rae, you mentioned you've lived with AIDS for a long time, over 20 years I think it is.  Ms. LEWIS-THORNTON: Yes. I was diagnosed 20 years ago.  MARTIN: And you were saying that you think people misunderstand. They think now that because we talk about it as a chronic condition, it's like diabetes. And you said it is not that way. Can you just briefly let us\u2026  Ms. LEWIS-THORNTON: It's not that way.  MARTIN: \u2026what's different that you think people need to understand?  Ms. LEWIS-THORNTON: Well, the fact of the matter is, is there's no cure of HIV. And HIV's a very intelligent virus. It adapts to everything you give it. So eventually, you know, someone who starts out - get early treatment and diagnosis for HIV who starts out at two pills a day will eventually end up where somewhere where I was at. I just switched regiments, but up until two weeks ago, I was injecting in my stomach twice a day and taking 14 pills a day.  And so there are side effects to medications, and still, HIV behaves differently in every person, depending on the strain of the virus. And so some people, you know, do very well with drug and treatment and care, and some people do poorly with drug treatment and care. And so this illusion that you can take - pop to two pills in your mouth a day and keep going is just, you know, it's not right. And then there are emotional baggage to HIV that you don't get with other drugs because there's still so much stigma and shame attached to this disease. And many people, especially African-Americans, live in denial. They live in secret. They have no support systems because they're afraid to tell their pastors. They're afraid to tell their mothers. And so, diabetes doesn't carry that kind of weight.  MARTIN: Mm-hmm. That's an important point.  Dr. Haden, I wanted to ask, what do you want to do now? What is your response to this information now that you have it? I know that you want to ramp up the availability of free condoms in the city. That's one approach you want to take. Why is that important, and what else do you want to do?  Dr. HADER: Well, I think we want to hit hard, hit everywhere, so we have multiple approaches to take. Certainly, increasing the availability of free condoms is part of that, but that goes hand and hand also with supporting community-based organizations, faith-based organizations, other members of the community to really also ramp-up prevention skills, negotiation skills, thinking and decision making on how at an individual level we make decisions to keep ourselves safe.  In addition to that, I think an important thing we saw in this state as well is that there are a lot of people getting tested too late. They're first finding out they have HIV right around the time they're already immune compromised, they've already developed AIDS. And that's just not okay. We do want people to get tested earlier, to get into care earlier, and to help preserve their health before their immune system has really taken a hard hit.  So the second area we're focusing on is really getting more people more routinely tested. And sort of building on that race thing, part of this is trying to shift HIV into a realm like we treat all of our other medical diseases. So when you go get a check up, you should be getting your biomass index for your obesity. And you should be getting your blood pressure checked for hypertension. And you should be getting your blood sugar checked for diabetes. Well, you should also be getting an HIV test. You shouldn't have to beg for that from your provider.  MARTIN: Mm-hmm. I see.  So, Rae, we have about a minute left. Is there anything over the years you've been working with this and living with this that you think would make a difference? If you could wave your wand, what will it be?  Ms. LEWIS-THORNTON: Well, I think that African-Americans specifically have to understand that AIDS is live and real. It's set up camp in our community. We must get tested, because early diagnosis can and will prolong your life. Thirty percent of all new cases of people infected are infected by people who didn't know they were infected.  So testing is critical and crucial for African-Americans. We have to then, once we know, go get treatment. So we're dying at a disproportionate rate than our white counterparts because we're not getting treatment and care. And most importantly, we have to have some personal responsibility and begin to use condoms 100 percent of the time. And that's the bottom line, because AIDS is not going anywhere.  MARTIN: All right. Rae, thank you so much for what you've been doing all these years to keep people informed.  Rae Lewis-Thornton is an AIDS survivor and educator. She joins us from our NPR Chicago Bureau. We were also joined by Dr. Shannon Hader. She's the director of the D. C. HIV/AIDS Administration. And she was kind enough to join me here in our Washington studio.  Ladies, thank you so much for joining us and for talking with us.  Ms. LEWIS-THORNTON: You're welcome.  Dr. HADER: Thank you.

Dr. MARK DYBUL (U. S. Global AIDS Coordinator): There's a sense of optimism that wasn't there four World AIDS Days ago. All we did was commemorate people dying. Now we're celebrating all the millions of people who are alive, whose children are not orphaned because of this infection, who are going to be prevented from having this infection. But we're just beginning this. MONTAGNE: Mark Dybul runs the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. It's a five year, $15 billion U. S. effort to prevent HIV and bring AIDS medications to developing countries, mostly in Africa. Earlier this week, the big news from the United Nations was that its numbers of those infected with HIV worldwide are much lower than had been thought. The U. N. says 33 million people have HIV, not the 39 million that those fighting the epidemic have been using as their measure. Dr. Dybul joined us to discuss the president's plan. Dr. DYBUL: Most of the revised estimate is actually because we're doing a better job of measuring the epidemic. But buried beneath there is actually some very important data from a number of countries showing significant declines in the amount of people who are infected. And that's correlated with changes in behavior, particularly sexual behavior - reducing partners, delaying when you become sexually active, using condoms more consistently. So we actually are seeing some trends that are very, very promising. MONTAGNE: Well, how much can the last four years of very intense U. S. aid be credited with the improvement in behavior? Dr. DYBUL: Well, I think really what we're trying to do is support the countries in their efforts, and the resources and the programmatic support has had a significant impact on what's going on in the countries. But the United States actually had AIDS efforts before the emergency plan. This is just a quantum leap in the resources, and therefore a quantum leap in the change. MONTAGNE: One criticism that has been leveled at this program - the President's program - came from the Institute of Medicine for how you all have budgeted for prevention; one-third of that money has to go to abstinence or these programs that are called Be Faithful programs. Dr. DYBUL: Mm-hmm. MONTAGNE: Is prevention, abstinence - rather Be Faithful programs - are they so key that this program is going to stick with it? Dr. DYBUL: Well, there's no question they're key. And the Institute of Medicine actually - they actually didn't question whether or not you ought to spend that amount. They just didn't think there ought to be congressional directive for that amount, but rather let the field determine what's appropriate. But you know, if you look at the data from UNAIDS and you look at the data from a couple of countries with significant reductions and prevalence, like Kenya or Zimbabwe, what we're seeing is what's called the ABCs - Abstain, Be Faithful and Correct and Consistent Condom Use - is occurring and is correlated with these declines in prevalence. And the United States, since the emergency plan began, has supplied 1. 8 billion condoms, so it's not as if condoms aren't an important part this. And I think one of the things people miss, though, is beneath these programs, ABC is a nice catch-phrase, but what we're fundamentally doing is changing how people look at themselves, beginning with very young children, five to 10 years old, and teaching them to respect themselves and respect others. And one of the consequences of that is, for example, young boys don't abuse young girls, and that you delay when you become sexually active and you're more personally responsible in your behavior. So we're definitely seeing these behavior changes that are correlated with prevalence. And I think anyone reasonably would say that makes sense. MONTAGNE: One concern about the program would be its link to, let's say, other goals of the United States. Dr. DYBUL: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. MONTAGNE: An example would be Vietnam, with a rather low incidence of HIV infection, added to this program, and the question is, would that have been for diplomatic or political reasons? The U. S. wants to have a stronger connection to Vietnam. Dr. DYBUL: No. It actually wasn't, but it would be an interesting link for someone to make. The reason Vietnam was selected is because it was on the verge of an explosive epidemic. There were predictions of a million new infections. And so we thought if we could get in early and prevent that, we would actually show a different type of model. Also, we didn't have any programs that had significant intravenous drug use. And we thought looking to the future, we need to be engaged in a country that did, and so we're working with Vietnam to support methadone programs. And so we had a hole, and Vietnam was a good country to fill it. MONTAGNE: You know, from our discussion right now, it sounds like you're so positive. Dr. DYBUL: Optimistic? Ms. MONTAGNE: That's not a bad thing. Or optimistic. What has been the greatest failure? Dr. DYBUL: You know, if I had hours I couldn't go through all the things we could do better. I think we can do better at everything we're doing, but we're only four years into this, and so it's going to take a long-term effort. To talk about failures, we need to do a better job at expanding prevention. We need to do a better job by getting services throughout the country to rural areas. We're seeing it in some countries, but not all. We need to change policies that allow for better healthcare workers. We need to focus on where the new infections are and tackle those rather than using old techniques. We're still using prevention techniques that were developed 20 years ago. So we have a lot to do. MONTAGNE: Mark Dybul runs the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Thanks very much for joining us. Dr. DYBUL: Thank you very much.

Here's one more question for you. What is intelligence? Is it the ability to solve a puzzle or write a novel or what? Well, this next story is about how scientists are grappling with what makes a machine intelligent - artificial intelligence it's called, AI for short. Rick Kleffel of member station KUSP filed this report after attending the Second Annual Singularity Summit, a gathering in San Francisco of scientists, entrepreneurs, students, authors, visionaries, futurists and, of course, computer geeks. RICK KLEFFEL: In 1956, humanity began to design its own successor. When the forefathers of artificial intelligence gathered at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, coming up with a brain in a box seemed to be a straightforward problem with an achievable solution. But at the 2007 Singularity Summit, Dr. Rodney Brooks, chief technology officer of the company iRobot, suggested that these bright, young men were only looking at part of the problem. Dr. RODNEY BROOKS (Co-founder; Chief Technology Officer, iRobot): And as I talk about intelligence, I think they got inspired about what made them more intelligent than the other people they knew and what they were good at with solving puzzles and doing mathematics and that seemed the essence of intelligence to them. KLEFFEL: Brooks says that this definition is incomplete. It dismisses skills the forefathers saw as unimportant. Dr. BROOKS: You know what a 2-year-old child could do, just - it will walk around and climb on things, recognize objects, name them, talk about them. Anyone could do that. That's not the essence of intelligence. So out of that 1956 then came, you know, playing chess, proving theorems. That was intelligence, but what seemed that only gets you so far. KLEFFEL: At the 2007 Singularity Summit, the speakers are working from a newly informed division of human intelligence. Sam Adams is a distinguished engineer within IBM's research division, who work on a project following up Deep Blue. It's called Joshua Blue, and it's an attempt to create a toddler in a box. Mr. SAM ADAMS (Engineer, Research Division, IBM): The only proven pathway to human levels of intelligence we have is the one we walk ourselves. So let's go look at that and learn from it and see if we can build something like it. We found, following the child, looking the childhood development, taking it seriously, go across campus and talk to the psychology department. You know, talk to neurophysiology department. Find out what they've been learning. And then use your engineering skill to try to build analogs of that in the system. KLEFFEL: While Sam Adams and other speakers focused on how we might go about creating an artificial intelligence, Dr. Barney Pell suggested one way of determining if we had succeeded. Dr. BARNEY PELL (CEO, Powerset): One of the definitions that I used was by a high school replacement robot that can actually compete with high school graduates. We'll know that's been achieved when you start finding that robots are winning at least half the jobs, you know, in the job market competition with high school graduates. That's a very clear milestone. KLEFFEL: When Deep Blue beat Garry Kasporov at chess, Kasporov famously commented at least he couldn't enjoy its victory. But Deep Blue is an expert system that could only play chess, not a self-aware learning intelligence. Jamais Cascio serves as the global future strategist for the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology. He suggests that there are now two types of artificial intelligence. Mr. JAMAIS CASCIO (Global Future Strategist, Center for Responsible Nanotechnology): What AI, as it's understood today means, are these really narrow specific forums of machine cognition. You're not going to get Deep Blue to start playing backgammon. It's a very dedicated system. Conversely, artificial general intelligence is the idea that you can, in fact, create these machine cognition systems that rather than being focused on particular narrow subjects, actually have the ability to learn something new. KLEFFEL: Though artificial general intelligent, AGI, maybe something we can create, it may not be something we can sell. Dr. James Hughes is the executive director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies. Dr. JAMES HUGHES (Director, Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies): There are very few companies that actually want to do that. I mean, you don't really want to have an argument with your toaster about whether it's going to give you a toast in the morning. KLEFFEL: Still, there is a need for AGI and a need to understand potential problems before they get out of hand. James Hughes. Dr. HUGHES: We're deploying robots in the field and in Iraq. And one of the questions that's come up is do you want to empower a robot to go around killing humans but then what if you give it the command that he can destroy a materiel in the field but you can't destroy humans. Well, the materiel is sometimes held in the hands of the humans. KLEFFEL: According to Hughes, the questions go beyond the ability of machines to distinguish a target. Dr. HUGHES: There are many ethical questions of the liability and how much autonomy we want to give to machines, who's responsible when a machine makes a mistake and those kinds of questions, in addition to what kinds of ethics are going to drive these machines. I mean, we could imagine that there could be Sharia robots or there could be utilitarian robots. There could be, you know, the anthological Catholic ethics robots. So that's part of the debate as well. KLEFFEL: At this year's Singularity Summit, speakers explore the consequences of creating a self-aware artificial general intelligence. Paul Saffo is a futurist who teaches at Stanford University. Professor PAUL SAFFO (Technology Forecaster; Consulting Associate, Stanford University): The optimistic scenario is they'll treat us like pets, and the pessimistic scenario is they'll treat us like food. KLEFFEL: When Saffo looked for a positive, compelling vision of artificial intelligence, he quoted a forty-year-old poem by Richard Brautigan. Prof. SAFFO: I like to think, and it has to be, of a cybernetic ecology where we are free of our labors and joined back to nature, returned to our mammal brothers and sisters and all watched over by machines of loving grace. I think that's a wonderfulsome(ph). (Soundbite of applause) KLEFFEL: The Singularity Summit takes place annually, but the work goes on year round as the conversations continue between those who imagine and those who invent the future.

BOB MOON: Well, yeah, this might give new meaning to the idea that love conquers all, Alex, because it might even help fight global warming if you stay together. That's because these Michigan State researchers have found that divorce leads to what they're calling resource-inefficient lifestyles.  They tracked divorce and resource use in the U. S. and 11 other countries, both developed and developing nations. And here in the U. S. they found that households that split up over the course of a year could have saved 38 million rooms, 73 billion kilowatt hours of electricity, and 627 billion gallons of water. When you compare the consumption of divorced people with married households, it's about 50 percent more overall.  The flipside is divorce might be good if you're trying to sell people things. It increases the demand for more household products like washing machines and refrigerators. But when you add it all up, you can start figuring out how much of an impact this has. Here in this country, households headed by a person who was divorced rose to more than 15 million in 2000 from around three million in 1970. CHADWICK: So do researchers have any ideas on how to fix the problem here?   MOON: Well, they're not weighing in on how to deal with the rising number of divorces, but they are suggesting a fix that kind of sounded familiar to me, Alex. You know, back in the '60s and '70s there were these two divorced guys named Oscar and Felix who moved in together. CHADWICK: Oh, yeah.  (Soundbite of \"The Odd Couple\" theme)  MOON: Well, remember that was the whole theme of \"The Odd Couple,\" and it turns out that Oscar and Felix may have been ahead of their time. Cohabitation might be a good thing here. These researchers suggests that governments might want to offer tax incentives for divorced people to either re-marry or cohabitate, and maybe even extend waiting periods before allowing for divorces.  CHADWICK: Bob, have the green groups said anything about this research? MOON: Yeah. There is a group called the Center for the New American Dream. And the head of that organization says that this study shows that divorce might be a good time to scale back on your material possessions that you surround yourself with, maybe think about moving in with family or getting a roommate or something like that. But she also says that the group wouldn't advocate staying in an unhappy relationship just because it's better for the environment. I guess if you're not going to do it for the kids, there's probably not much chance that you'll think twice about doing it for the sake of the planet, Alex. CHADWICK: Bob Moon. Thank you, Bob.

We're talking about HIV/AIDS in the nation's capital. A study out last week by Washington, D. C. 's HIV/AIDS Administration showed that the city has the highest rate of HIV/AIDS infection in the country. The report described the situation as a modern epidemic. What's even more surprising that Washington was once considered ahead of the curve in its approach to the disease. One person who was not shocked by those findings was Jose Antonio Vargas. He's a reporter with The Washington Post. He's been writing about the effects of the disease in Washington, D. C. , and around the country for several years. Welcome. Thanks for speaking with us. Mr. JOSE ANTONIO VARGAS (Staff Writer, The Washington Post): Thanks for having me. I really appreciate it. MARTIN: You wrote an article for this past Sunday's paper where you described AIDS in Washington as a tale of two cities. What did you mean by that? Mr. VARGAS: You know, to put that into context, I mean, I think you can talk about many issues in this city - look at education, look at crime, and you look at AIDS - and I think you see two very different realities. Actually, what was interesting to me about the essay that I wrote for Sunday's paper is the day before that, Laura Bush in our editorial pages had an op-ed about international AIDS. Basically talking about global AIDS epidemic and how things are improving. And, you know, the White House is only a few blocks, a couple of miles, maybe, from some of the places that I've visited, and you kind of wonder, you know, if people's eyes are really open enough to be looking at things in the way that they should be looking at them. MARTIN: You know, the numbers in the report are disturbing enough. And one of the reasons this report got a lot of attention is this was considered to be the first time that this district actually had some accurate numbers\u2026 Mr. VARGAS: Yes, yes. MARTIN: \u2026from the extent of the disease within this city. And those numbers are disturbing enough. Some 12,000 D. C. residents have HIV or AIDS or some 3,300 new cases reported between 2001 and 2006. But you still doubt the accuracy of the numbers. You know, what would be the reason that we wouldn't have accurate numbers at this point? Mr. VARGAS: Because I think we're talking about a disease that still has a lot of stigma. Frankly, a lot of people still aren't getting tested - that's a really, really, really big one. And we're not just talking about young people who have grown up with AIDS in terms of hearing about, you know, the HIV get-tested campaigns - but also among adults who don't want to be attached to this disease. I remember when I was writing this piece, I was re-reading a James Baldwin essay when he was talking about, you know, numbers always hide as much as they reveal. And that was in my head the whole time as I was thinking about this piece because really for many years, some of these AIDS organizations have operated kind of in their own silos as if they existed in their own cities -all working from different sets of numbers. And, you know, D. C. , eight wards, the way that it is - east of the River, Anacostia - kind of the segregation and the classicism that happens in this city, the city has done a very poor job tracking this epidemic in terms of numbers. And here they are again - a new AIDS director, a new report - they're saying again, quote, unquote, \"a modern epidemic. \" You know, I was kind of skeptical looking at the numbers. MARTIN: And one of the things that also interested me about the piece is you pointed out that you were born in 1981, which is the year that\u2026 Mr. VARGAS: Yeah. MARTIN: \u2026HIV was identified as a distinct virus or syndrome. And so you grew up with AIDS as a part of your consciousness\u2026 Mr. VARGAS: Yes, yes. MARTIN: \u2026as a part of a political and cultural reality that you grew up with. And you've also reported on AIDS in other parts of the country, in San Francisco, which is, of course, a place that has a lot of consciousness around\u2026 Mr. VARGAS: Yes, yes. MARTIN: \u2026the disease. What I was curious about is if \u2014 what you've learned about the way HIV/AIDS works in the district and the way it - our efforts to address it are not working? Does that have broader - is there something that the rest of the country needs to be concerned about or is it just part of the, you know, problem of living in a city with kind of a mixed-up governance and, you know, new home rule and, you know, city systems don't always work as well as they should? Mr. VARGAS: Well, one of the things that I found staggering was this idea - you know, I had profiled a guy named Ron Daniels who runs the - who runs Prevention Works! . This is the needle exchange program in the district that basically he drives around on RV that goes through the eight wards of the city, especially in the poorer areas of the city, and hands out clean needles in exchange for dirty ones, right. I ended up reporting this story and I didn't know that, guess what, D. C. is the only city in the country that can't use its own tax dollars to fund a needle exchange program, which by the way exists in some 206 municipalities in 30 states in the country. And we can't do that because, guess what? The city's budget has to be approved by Congress. And some Congress members - some of them Republicans - didn't like the fact that the city of - you know, that the District of Columbia would be handing out needles to anybody, much less drug addicts. I thought that was really interesting because, again, again - I mean, you have here the mixing of Capitol Hill and you mix it up with basically the demographics of this city, which in many areas of the city is still poor. There's that to think about. And frankly, especially as it relates to the African-American community, I think this is something in the next 20 years or so, if this is not targeted now \u2014 because guess what, what's happening in D. C. it's what's happening in Detroit, it's what's happening in Chicago, it's what's happening in Philadelphia. You didn't see it - we don't see it a lot in San Francisco because the demographics of San Francisco is people who are getting HIV or AIDS are predominantly gay men - white gay men. There's not a lot of black people in San Francisco. And so I think if this is not something that specifically the African-American community addresses, this is something that can take - that can just keep on evolving and keep on growing. And we have to get people tested. MARTIN: Finally, I wanted to ask you about the Latino population, which is growing in the district as it is in many cities both large and small. Mr. VARGAS: Yeah. MARTIN: I noticed that about 5 percent of the folks living with HIV/AIDS in the district are Latino. Is that an \u2014 also a community that needs to pay more attention\u2026 Mr. VARGAS: Yes. MARTIN: \u2026into what's going on? Mr. VARGAS: Yes, definitely. And I think a part of that, too, is, you know, machismo, and again, homophobia. You know, this is not something that people like to talk about, and this is something that they're struggling with through to get people to come in and get tested, and to have people openly talk about educating each other, you know, on this epidemic. And also, by the way, both in the Latino community and the black community is transgender; not a lot, but there's a sizeable amount of transgender prostitutes, right, out there that are also getting infected. And this is not something, you know, that a lot of people really talk about. MARTIN: Jose Antonio Vargas is reporter with The Washington Post.

According to the World Health Organization, working overnight could raise your risk of getting cancer. Maria Cheng is a medical writer for the Associated Press and she reported on the story. She's with us now. Hi, Maria. Ms. MARIA CHENG (Medical Writer, Associated Press): Hi, how are you doing? CHIDEYA: I am doing great. No, the World Health Organization believes that something called a circadian rhythm has to do with the person's openness to cancer. Can you first explain what a circadian rhythm is and how it's changed if you work overnight? Ms. CHENG: Sure. The circadian rhythm is basically your body's natural 24-hour clock. So it tells you when you should be sleeping and eating, producing certain hormones for biological functions. And it's based on the light/dark cycle. So basically you should be up when it's light and asleep when it's dark. CHIDEYA: How much science is there out now to really look at this issue of workplace health, people working overnight? Is this the only evidence? Ms. CHENG: Well, it was basically an analysis of all the existing evidence. So it studies that were done in the last 20 years. And what they did was they looked at studies of nurses who worked the night shifts and airline pilots. And what they found was that in those groups, they were - the women were more likely to get breast cancer and the men were more likely prostate cancer. There have also been some animal studies showing that if you switch the light/dark cycles of animals, they are more prone to get cancer. CHIDEYA: Now, when we talk about what a night shift is, are we talking about people who literally work from, say, you know, 12 a. m. until 8 a. m. Are we also talking about people who wake up in the dark, people who might do, say, a 4 a. m. shift? Ms. CHENG: We don't exactly have the answer to that. All the studies looked at people with varying shifts to some extent. So we can't say exactly if people who work at - start at midnight, who's finished at 6 a. m. or something like that. But the idea is basically, if you're working when you're supposed to be sleeping that interrupts your body cycle and may make you susceptible to cancer. CHIDEYA: Melatonin, what's that? It has been mentioned in the study. What exactly is it, and how does this impact it? Ms. CHENG: It's basically a hormone that your body produces and scientists think that it can help you fight cancer if they can help fight tumors. But the problem is, it's only produced when it's dark. So if you're working under light conditions at night, you're probably not producing as much of it as you may need to protect your body from cancer. So if you tend to work at night a lot, and your body's not producing a lot of it, your levels may be lower, which may make you more vulnerable to cancer. CHIDEYA: Now, melatonin is something that you can pick up in some health food stores. Is anyone discussing or analyzing whether or not these available melatonin tablets have any impact on these issues? Ms. CHENG: Well, the people have taught about whether or not you could take that as a supplement, but they don't think it's a good idea to take it in the long-term because then your body loses the ability to produce it itself, which is not a great idea. So basically, if you're working the night shift, what you should try to do is make sure you have this light and dark balance, so that even if you're working at night, you're still getting some amount of darkness when you're sleeping. CHIDEYA: Tell me more about what you mean by that? How do you - how much darkness do you need? Are you saying that people should have curtains up and, you know, sort of black-out curtains in they work the night shift? Ms. CHENG: Well, that's what some of the scientist suggested that it's really important to maintain this balance between light and darkness for your body. So the problem is that a lot of people who work night shifts aren't entirely to switch their systems. You know, when they're days off, they still want to go and see their friends and have a normal life. So they're basically overextending themselves so they don't get enough darkness. If you were able to completely switch yourself so that you were up during the night when you had to be, and then sleeping in darkness during the daytime, that might be okay, but it's this constant switch that they think is dangerous. CHIDEYA: Some people who work the night shift probably could do their work at other times. Other people, you always need nurses, you always need people in emergency rooms. You need a lot of people who work at night in a mandatory way. Is there any sense of how this could impact the business world or do you think people will largely ignore a study like this? Ms. CHENG: I think obviously it's going to have an impact on the business community. It is, right now, just probable tag. So they haven't determined conclusively that it causes of cancer. There could be some other things that people are doing, which increases their cancer risk, but the advice from the scientists seem to be that, if you can avoid working on a night shift for a long period of time, or at least avoid this conflict, which is that screw up your body's biological clock, that would probably help. CHIDEYA: Now, the World Health Organization has been careful to say this research is not conclusive. When it comes to being better safe than sorry, what's the bottom line here? Ms. CHENG: Again, it's just really important to maintain that balance between light and dark, so that if you are working at night, it's very important to get some sleep in a dark area, to make sure that your body has that time to produce melatonin to ensure that your levels aren't low enough that you might be susceptible to cancer. CHIDEYA: Very briefly, what's the next step for someone like you, who's covering the story? Ms. CHENG: Well, obviously, it's something that we'll continue to follow. More studies need to be done to see if they will get the same results in different populations and people who aren't nurses and not airline pilots to see if it applies to other populations. And basically, just watch as to see what things that's can be done to prevent this. If there are certain kinds of light that could be used that wouldn't inhibit melatonin production and other measures that people can do to protect themselves. CHIDEYA: Maria Cheng, thanks so much. Ms. CHENG: My pleasure. CHIDEYA: Maria Cheng is a medical writer for the Associated Press, based in London. She talked with us about the possible link and cancer and people who work the night shift.  FARAI CHIDEYA, host:  Could the graveyard shift send you to an early grave? According to the World Health Organization, working overnight could raise your risk of getting cancer.

Are we also talking about people who wake up in the dark, people who might do, say, a 4 a. m. shift?  Ms. CHENG: We don't exactly have the answer to that. All the studies looked at people with varying shifts to some extent. So we can't say exactly if people who work at - start at midnight, who's finished at 6 a. m. or something like that. But the idea is basically, if you're working when you're supposed to be sleeping that interrupts your body cycle and may make you susceptible to cancer.  CHIDEYA: Melatonin, what's that? It has been mentioned in the study. What exactly is it, and how does this impact it?  Ms. CHENG: It's basically a hormone that your body produces and scientists think that it can help you fight cancer if they can help fight tumors. But the problem is, it's only produced when it's dark. So if you're working under light conditions at night, you're probably not producing as much of it as you may need to protect your body from cancer. So if you tend to work at night a lot, and your body's not producing a lot of it, your levels may be lower, which may make you more vulnerable to cancer.  CHIDEYA: Now, melatonin is something that you can pick up in some health food stores. Is anyone discussing or analyzing whether or not these available melatonin tablets have any impact on these issues?  Ms. CHENG: Well, the people have taught about whether or not you could take that as a supplement, but they don't think it's a good idea to take it in the long-term because then your body loses the ability to produce it itself, which is not a great idea.  So basically, if you're working the night shift, what you should try to do is make sure you have this light and dark balance, so that even if you're working at night, you're still getting some amount of darkness when you're sleeping.  CHIDEYA: Tell me more about what you mean by that? How do you - how much darkness do you need? Are you saying that people should have curtains up and, you know, sort of black-out curtains in they work the night shift?  Ms. CHENG: Well, that's what some of the scientist suggested that it's really important to maintain this balance between light and darkness for your body.  So the problem is that a lot of people who work night shifts aren't entirely to switch their systems. You know, when they're days off, they still want to go and see their friends and have a normal life. So they're basically overextending themselves so they don't get enough darkness.  If you were able to completely switch yourself so that you were up during the night when you had to be, and then sleeping in darkness during the daytime, that might be okay, but it's this constant switch that they think is dangerous.  CHIDEYA: Some people who work the night shift probably could do their work at other times. Other people, you always need nurses, you always need people in emergency rooms. You need a lot of people who work at night in a mandatory way. Is there any sense of how this could impact the business world or do you think people will largely ignore a study like this?  Ms. CHENG: I think obviously it's going to have an impact on the business community. It is, right now, just probable tag. So they haven't determined conclusively that it causes of cancer. There could be some other things that people are doing, which increases their cancer risk, but the advice from the scientists seem to be that, if you can avoid working on a night shift for a long period of time, or at least avoid this conflict, which is that screw up your body's biological clock, that would probably help.  CHIDEYA: Now, the World Health Organization has been careful to say this research is not conclusive. When it comes to being better safe than sorry, what's the bottom line here?  Ms. CHENG: Again, it's just really important to maintain that balance between light and dark, so that if you are working at night, it's very important to get some sleep in a dark area, to make sure that your body has that time to produce melatonin to ensure that your levels aren't low enough that you might be susceptible to cancer.  CHIDEYA: Very briefly, what's the next step for someone like you, who's covering the story?  Ms. CHENG: Well, obviously, it's something that we'll continue to follow. More studies need to be done to see if they will get the same results in different populations and people who aren't nurses and not airline pilots to see if it applies to other populations. And basically, just watch as to see what things that's can be done to prevent this. If there are certain kinds of light that could be used that wouldn't inhibit melatonin production and other measures that people can do to protect themselves.  CHIDEYA: Maria Cheng, thanks so much.  Ms. CHENG: My pleasure.  CHIDEYA: Maria Cheng is a medical writer for the Associated Press, based in London. She talked with us about the possible link and cancer and people who work the night shift.

Several runs of wild salmon in western Canada could be driven to extinction in four years, at least that's the conclusion of a new study. It finds that the salmon are being ravaged by parasites linked to nearby fish farms. NPR's John Nielsen has more on this controversial paper. JOHN NIELSEN: Every spring, millions of baby salmon known as smolt roll down mountain streams in Western Canada. Many of these tiny fish end up in the Pacific Ocean. But in recent years, one kind of salmon - pink salmon - has had trouble reaching those waters. Salmon expert Alexandra Morton tracks smolt runs in a place called Broughton Archipelago. She says this tiny fish often look half dead. Ms. ALEXANDRA MORTON (Salmon Expert): They don't even run from my boat. They just sit there floundering. I know there's something very, very wrong, because these guys, when they're healthy, they're like quicksilver. They're like grease lightning. You barely see them. NIELSEN: Morton runs the salmon coast field station in British Columbia. She says the listless smolts have been attacked by tiny crustaceans called sea lice. These are parasites that don't harm adult salmon, but when a smolt no bigger than a peanut is involved, it's different. Ms. MORTON: A sea lice on a little salmon is like a raccoon hanging off of your side. It's huge. NIELSEN: And often lethal. In a new paper published by the journal \"Science,\" a team lead by Martin Krkosek of the University of Alberta says sea lice appear to be killing eight out of every 10 pink salmon smolts that swims through the Broughton Archipelago. Mr. MARTIN KRKOSEK (University of Alberta): Based on that rate of decline, in another four years, the pink salmon populations in the Broughton Archipelago are going to reach extinction. NIELSEN: The researchers came to that conclusion after sifting through decades-worth of wild salmon counts collected by Canadian officials. They think the sea lice infestations are coming from giant, floating salmon farms that raise fish in giant nets. Alexandra Morton, one of the authors of the new study, says these farms started showing up near salmon migration routes in the 1980s. Ms. MORTON: Now, there's farms in here with over a million fish per farm. And what they've done is they have just, they've put too many fish in this water. NIELSEN: Morton thinks these fish farms have been pumping clouds of sea lice into local waters for years. She says other studies seem to show that when wild salmon swim by these farms, they pick up lots of lice. She and the other authors of the study say the only way to protect wild salmon is to move the farms away from spawning runs or into big tanks built on dry land. But officials in the farming industry and some government officials say they're not impressed by this new study. Kevin Amos is an aquaculture expert with the National Marine Fishery service in the United States. Dr. KEVIN AMOS (Aquaculture Expert, National Marine Fishery Service): It's a mathematical model that does not demonstrate cause and effect. And it basically leaves out many important elements. NIELSEN: Like the possibility that wild fish such as stickleback are the main source of the sea lice infestations or that overfishing is a big part of a problem. Amos says the claim that sea lice could drive local rounds of pink salmon to extinction in just four years is statistically ludicrous in his opinion. But other experts say this study seems convincing. Ray Hilborn is of fisheries biologist at the University of Washington. He says the wakes him wonder about plans to raise other kinds of wild fish like halibut and sablefish in giant pens. Professor RAY HILBORN (Fisheries biologist, University of Washington): The cautionary note is, look, expect the same thing to happen with those species that's happening with salmon. NIELSEN: The irony, says Hilborn, is that fish farms have long been touted as a way of taking fishing pressure off of wild fish like salmons. If the studies like this one are confirmed, it could get much harder to build new fish farms. John Nielsen, NPR News, Washington.

Now, if you had to pick the biggest science story of 2007, which one would get your vote? Science Magazine, they pick one every year, and this year, they picked the human genetic variation as its breakthrough of the year. Nature named the head of the International Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, as its newsmaker of the year. They sort of won a double award, with also with the Nobel Peace Prize and Al Gore whose latest report says it's 90 percent - the IPCC said it's 90 percent certain that activity - human activity is causing global warming. You might say, hey, you know that Arctic ice, we've seen those great pictures of the Arctic ice melting even faster than scientists predicted, maybe that's, you know, that changed a lot of people's minds. Maybe that's a great best science story of the year or a health story. There's a health story that's related to that as scientists are documenting the health effects of global warming. Then right there smack toward the end of the year, we have the - those retro stem cells. What - people might say, hey, you know, that's a big story of the year, but it's not that big because it hasn't gone a whole big direction yet, you know? How about Craig Venter's genome or the discovery of more planets outside our solar system? Well, we've gathered some of our favorite and most knowledgeable NPR reporters for a look back at the year in science. And if you'd like to join our discussion, our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. As always, you can go over to \"Second Life\" and join the other avatars there that are sending in questions and talking about our SCIENCE FRIDAY hour this hour. Let me introduce my guests. Joe Palca is science correspondent for NPR in Washington, Elizabeth Shogren, is environmental correspondent at NPR, and Joanne Silberner is the NPR's health policy correspondent. Welcome, you all, to SCIENCE FRIDAY. ELIZABETH SHOGREN: Thanks, Ira. JOE PALCA: Thanks, Ira. SHOGREN: Good to be here. FLATOW: When was the last time all three of you were in front of a microphone? PALCA: At the same time. (Soundbite of laughter) PALCA: I think it was '07 or\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: (Unintelligible)\u2026 PALCA: I can't remember back that far. Right. JOANNE SILBERNER: (Unintelligible). PALCA: I was thinking you thinking you gathered the most impressive science writers, but they were busy, so you got us. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Oh, no, you guys are the tops. PALCA: All right, thank you. FLATOW: Come on, you know, that puts our show down. You're guys are at the top. PALCA: Yes, we - you're lucky to have us. FLATOW: There you go, that's what we need. So, Joe, since you're talking up the first this hour, why don't you give us your pick for the top stories? PALCA: Well, I mean, Ira, you know, you mentioned the big story on my beat. How am I not going to say that that's the top story? FLATOW: Right. PALCA: Although, we should have a discussion about what we all mean by top story, but I think this whole business about, you know, getting normal adult stem cells to sing and dance like embryonic stem cells without destroying an embryo in the process is a fantastically important step. I mean, if this world of stem cell research is going to go anywhere, and it seems a lot of scientists believe it is, as you say not that much to show yet, but the promise still is there. If it's going to go anywhere, they're going to have to get around this ethical conundrum of destroying embryos. And if this really does that, briefly, to describe it you know, they take these adult cells. And they insert these genes that make them behave as if they were embryonic stem cells and it sort of gets rid of the question, I mean, you know, the question is: What are they? Well, if they look like embryonic stem cells and they act like embryonic stem cells, and they do things like embryonic stem cells, are they embryonic stem cells? FLATOW: Quite(ph) that. PALCA: Well, you know, they are in one sense and they're not another - exactly. FLATOW: Yeah. PALCA: But if this gets around that, so I think that's a fantastically important step, and we'll just wait and see. I mean, you know, we - that's what we do in science, we wait and see. FLATOW: We're talking about the best stories this hour in TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Joanne, well, your beat covers lots of health stuff, what would you like to pull out? SILBERNER: I think I want to pull out a whole category because, you know, medicine moves slowly at the most time, occasionally it makes great leaps. And maybe in stem cells that may be happening, who knows, but the category I'd pick out for this year is infectious diseases. In one of the under reported or under realized stories, I think, is that there's a vaccine that's been developed for bird flu if it does indeed come over. No one really knows if it works. You can't expose, people to bird flu and see whether or not they catch up. The government has developed a vaccine that's being put in a stockpile. The fact that bird flu hasn't arrived in humans in a big way is good news. But there's bad news on infectious diseases front as well. We've got a similarly new form of MRSA, Methicillin-resistant Staph Aureus, which seems to be going around and no one quite knows what to do about it. FLATOW: Right. SILBERNER: There's a new cold virus that suddenly appeared and it's - no one knows how - they know that it can occasionally cause some big and serious problems, but no one knows the denominator. How often is that we're not doing anything? And new ear infection, so good news and bad news from infectious disease would take my vote. FLATOW: Good news. I'm glad they don't have that med student syndrome at the\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Elizabeth, what have you got for us? SHOGREN: Well, I think it would have to be climate change reaching a tipping point as far as the public perception of how important and how real it is. It's been an amazing year, and we're only in the process here, but it's been an amazing year - you had the Supreme Court announce that it is a pollutant and that the Environmental Protection Agency should regulate it. You had a Nobel Peace Prize for Al Gore in the IPCC. We had a new IPCC report telling us that the dangers are more than we feared they might have been. There's been so much going on across the country and across the world and most recently in Bali where the world - representatives of the world's countries got together and decided on a plan forward or at least a plan to go forward and deal with the problem in a more serious way. FLATOW: Well, now you have Arnold Schwarzenegger's going to take on Washington. SHOGREN: Oh, was sure he is. FLATOW: You know? SHOGREN: And that's a fascinating story in itself. FLATOW: It's a great story. SHOGREN: But it - and it shows that this is not a Democratic issue. This is a bipartisan issue. Some of the Republican governors are at the forefront of this issue trying to push the United States to do more. And it's not just on the -in the states now the - in the Senate. A subcommittee and a committee voted to approve a measure that would set up a whole new system for controlling greenhouse gas emissions from cars and factories and power plants, and so that's on its way too. FLATOW: We'll have to watch all of these. We're going to have to take a break, come back and take more of your questions from - what you think. Maybe - what do you think, are they stories we missed, some of the stories that are bigger, some of the stories that might deserve more attention with Joe Palca, Elizabeth Shogren and Joanne Silberner. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) CONAN: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. A brief program note: Since news broke that the CIA destroyed hundreds of hours of videotaped interrogations, a federal court and Congress have been asking questions and they're starting to get answers. Neal Conan revisits the destruction of the CIA tapes on Monday's TALK OF THE NATION. This hour, we're talking about our year in science with my guests Elizabeth Shogren, environment correspondent at the national desk at NPR. Joanne Silberner is the health policy correspondent. Joe Palca is a science correspondent. And our number - 1-800-989-8255. Let's see if we got a - oh, we have a lot of phone calls here. Let's go to Nelson(ph) in Tucson. Hi, Nelson. NELSON (Caller): Hi, how are you doing? FLATOW: Hi, there. NELSON: Yeah, so my story of the year is kind of personal, I guess, being that I just finished the post docs and took and took a job in the industry. And the reason behind that is kind of my story in that post docs are leaving - or leaving academics at a very high rate, and I think it has to do a lot with the funding situation as it stands being so difficult to get money, and I think that that might be a science story that's rather big, but might not be talked about as much. FLATOW: You know, that is my sleeper science story of the year. We did a story - we did a show on this a few weeks ago about an urban institute study that showed exactly what you just said; that there are three times the number of qualified scientists and engineering graduates for the number of jobs available to them, three times as many. Where are they going was the question. FLATOW: Why do we have to import talent from overseas when we have all this talents three times the number for the slots available? NELSON: Right. FLATOW: And you have answered that part of that question. NELSON: Yeah, it's difficult too because, you know, being in academics for so long, I still believe that academics is probably the best place to do real science, you know? I answer the questions that need to be answered, but if all the brains are heading out of the industry, I think it might hurt a little bit. And\u2026 FLATOW: Is that - is it because of the money? It's not just there for you? NELSON: Not necessarily the money personally. FLATOW: Yeah. NELSON: But the need that if I wanted to become an assistant professor, I need to write grants pretty much year-round and not do science, and I can't write grants unless I do the science, so this awful Catch-22. FLATOW: Yeah. NELSON: So\u2026 PALCA: Ira, can I jump in for a sec? FLATOW: Sure, please. PALCA: Well, this is actually, I mean, this is an interesting story because it's been going on for a long time and it's just\u2026 NELSON: Sure. PALCA: It's come up again in the last year or two because of some funny funding courts, I guess, somewhat at NIH. But it's been a very bad year for new grant approvals and a lot of scientists are discouraged about that. But there's a sort of a generic problem because the money for NIH, National Institutes of Health, has been going up and up and up and up, and if it hasn't gone up in the last year, it's certainly gone up quite a bit in the last 10 years. And the point is, you know, even a little - there's a little problem in American scientists, which people don't like to talk about, and its' a sort of a pyramid scheme because, you know, once you get in at the bottom, you want money for the rest of your life and you want to train the next generation. And so, are you training the right number of people? Are you training too many people? And, I think, we have to ask some serious questions because basically, we can never fund research at the rate at which we're drawing in competent people into the program, and so there's always going to be this problem of more qualified researchers than there is enough money. And it's a tough one, you know? FLATOW: But why then there are the - are people coming from overseas to take these jobs that these people won't take? NELSON: I can maybe offer\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. NELSON: insight into that. FLATOW: Go ahead. NELSON: Overseas post docs don't necessarily have to be paid as much as American citizens. And I've heard that - in the institution that I was in -overseas post docs from China, for instance, didn't necessarily get paid as much as the\u2026 PALCA: But that\u2026 SHOGREN: Yeah, but they're having a problem now in getting visas since September 11th. There's been issues going back\u2026 NELSON: Sure. SHOGREN: \u2026and forth some years are better than others. But certainly not as many people are getting to come in as they used to be able to. FLATOW: You'll hear, though, the other side of the story, which will say the law says they have to get paid the same amount and then the third hand of the story is, but there are lots of loopholes in that law. NELSOBN: There certainly are. FLATOW: Yes. So, I think this is a huge issue about why we have - we're losing in the pipelines so many qualified people and that, to me, it's almost like the answer's almost the same. I heard - I asked somebody who - in the lab the other day. She's a lawyer, her husband is a post doc and he - I asked - I brought this up and I asked her why her husband is still there if he's surrounded by foreigners, and she said he's willing to put the hours in at the bottom line. He says the foreigners are willing to come in and, you know, in the early stage of their lives and put the hours in for a chance to make it big. He said the other people - the other post docs that they know of, they've just gone in to the industry where they can make it big immediately. NELSON: You got it. FLATOW: They're not willing to start at the bottom. SILBERNER: Well, in medicine, you know, there's been a problem with getting American medical students, you know, they're getting fewer and fewer attracted into family practice than some of the other\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. SILBERNER: \u2026primary care specialties that pay less. So when you have your residencies and internships, they need foreign medical grads. FLATOW: So we're like farming out the early jobs in science like we farm out lawn mowing, you know? It's sort of the same thing that's going on in yard work and house work. NELSON: Yeah. FLATOW: Okay. Thanks for calling. It was my soap box(ph). Caller: Yeah. Thanks for the conversation. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Elizabeth, another story you'd like to bring up. SHOGREN: What we mentioned just briefly, the story that happened just this week. And it was kind of a combined story. We had the Congress and - approving a new energy bill which sets new fuel efficiency standards for cars - raising it to 35 miles per gallon. And the president signed that bill. And that was huge. It's been decades since there's been this kind of a big change of commitment by the U. S. government to improve fuel efficiency standards for cars, so cars will go farther on a gallon of gas. So that was a big deal. FLATOW: Thirty years in the making. SHOGREN: Yeah. It's quite a long time. And one of the things that will happen as a result of this is that cars - at least the new ones - will not emit as much greenhouse gases from their tailpipes as they do now because when cars go farther on a gallon of gas, they emit less greenhouses gases. And so that's a good thing for global warming as well. FLATOW: Yeah. SHOGREN: And that was part of what I think came together to push the Congress and the president to do something they hadn't wanted to do for a long time. I spoke to industry - just one. And the surprising thing about this is that the auto industry, in the end, supported this decision. It's something that they would never have done even six month ago. And I think that that's part of what indicates it; that even - that industry in the United States is seeing the writing the wall and that it's time to start doing things. And also that maybe it's time to start making deals that aren't as strict or as difficult as whatever deals they might be able to make once some other president is in office. But that's- it's an interesting\u2026 FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mm. And there are critics who say that in return for allowing that to happen, they got the EPA deal that went down this week. SHOGREN: Right. And I think that that's really important to see is that the Bush administration is still the Bush administration. And while the president signed this the very same day, the Environmental Protection Agency told California and at least 16 other states that they may not go ahead with their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes even more than this energy - energy bill would have done, so the one that states want to go ahead and do something more extreme, the federal government is still obstructing that. FLATOW: Yeah. You know, I was reading a story today - it might have been The Times or the Wall Street Journal, I can't remember because my mind is going -about the European Union making even stricter standards now for the automakers overseas. And to me, that said, well, you know, we've ratcheted it up again. Let's say the Europeans start making, you know, cars that do meet higher standards. Is Detroit going to be left behind again because they're not, you know, going to rush into this, like the Europeans might. SHORGREN: Well, and the 35 miles per gallon target for this new rule is by 2020\u2026 FLATOW: Right. SHOGREN: \u2026which is still some years down the road. And the European auto - the Europeans have a head start because they use a lot of diesel, which already is more efficient than gasoline, and so that gives them a head start towards using gas - using less fuel when they use their cars. So - and I do think that this is a - that there will be a big question of whether this is enough. And what California and Governor Schwarzenegger say and what many other people say around the country is that what the president signed isn't enough but will -but it is a big step forward nonetheless. FLATOW: Let's go to Andre(ph) in Michigan. Hi, Andre. ANDRE (Caller): Hi. FLATOW: Hi, there. Go ahead, ANDRE: The enigma that is the origin of the Moon and the Earth during the age of the late heavy bombardment of our early solar system 4. 5 billion years ago. FLATOW: You say an enigma. ANDRE: The enigma of origin. FLATOW: What do you mean by that? ANDRE: How the early solar system formed our planet and the moon together. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So it didn't happen the way we think it did. ANDRE: No. FLATOW: Let's see. Any comment on that? Anybody been following that one? We don't have. PALCA: Not one of mine, Ira. FLATOW: We don't have a planet correspondent. PALCA: We don't have - we can run out into the newsroom and see if there's someone. (Soundbite of laughter) SILBERNER: And for me not unless the moon has a heartbeat. PALCA: Right. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: It's a good point. I remember the story was kind of interesting about (unintelligible). PALCA: Yeah. I could tell you something about Mars, but I think I'd have to pass on the Moon. Sorry. FLATOW: Sorry, Andre, but you stumped the panel and we need that. (Soundbite of laughter) PALCA: That's terrible. FLATOW: I'm looking for my bell. It's on the other side of the desk, and I can't quite reach it here. So, thanks, Andre. 1-800-989-8255. There were - Joe, just because you brought it up -there were a lot of Mars things and planetary things that were going on. PALCA: Oh, yeah. I mean, this has been a fantastic year, I mean, the flybys and Saturn, there were some more data coming from, I think, the Pluto mission and -I think I've got that right - and - but I, you know, I've been watching for these amazing little rovers on Mars. Can you believe it? I mean, you know, three and a half years ago, they're crossing their fingers and said, maybe 90 days. God, wouldn't that be great? We could drive a hundred yards. And now they've driven 16 miles or whatever it is. It's just - not that far, but it's just amazing. And it's such a tribute to what's possible. And I think, in a way, you know, it's got to be a pain for NASA to hear this over and over again, you know? They've got this gazillion dollar space station circling the planet. They can't get it finished. They can't get the space shuttle to fly up to it, you know? The - all the people on there and most of what they're doing is keeping it - and doing housekeeping because there's so much stuff to keep take care of, and here are these little bitty, you know, by comparison, costing nothing rovers, you know, clunking along, taking data. They got probes orbiting the planet. They're coming back with a better understanding of where Mars came from, how there might have been life there, how - or how there might have been water at least. And, you know, it's just such a tribute to what's possible if you get a - well, you get a little lucky, okay. They know they're lucky. But they had a good design and they implemented it and the pay off has been incredible. (Soundbite of bell ringing) FLATOW: There's the stump the panel bell. (Soundbite of laughter) SHORGEN: Congratulations, Ira. PALCA: I got that one right. FLATOW: You got it. You got that right. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow with Joanne Silberner, Elizabeth Shogren and Joe Palca, talking about the big science stories of the year. And, you know, the X PRIZE stuff. You, you know, sort of segueing into that, you know, a lot of X PRIZES are taking the place of government research. Private industries are funding some of these big new projects. And\u2026 PALCA: Well, I think the idea is to say, you know, let's at least consider other ways of doing business in science and in exploration. And I think a lot of people are considering that. FLATOW: Yeah. PALCA: I mean, in a way, it reflects the little bit on what Elizabeth was saying about the states kind of getting involved in the climate change game. You know, the states obviously got involved in a big way in the embryonic stem cell research game because they said we're not really happy with the way the federal government is going. And, you know, by the way, if you think these things really are going to have an economic payoff someday, well, why not encourage people to join in? FLATOW: Yeah. PALCA: And the people who say, look, even if there is no economic payoff right away, the ancillary benefits of having these prizes that people build infrastructures to go after is going to be helpful to the country. So it's - I think it's, you know, it's an interesting approach. FLATOW: Yeah. PALCA: But we'll see. FLATOW: Yeah. Here's a question from Second Life from Leandro(ph) who says how about that Vitamin D story? It's a biggie. SILBERNER: That's an interesting one. And that's - I think that bears\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Yeah. SILBERNER: \u2026watching if you're looking forward to the future. Vitamin D is, you know, a lot of food is fortified with it. And, of course, if you're a fan of cod liver oil, you will enjoy plenty of it. It's\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) SILBERNER: But, you know, food is fortified and there's plenty of fish. I think there are people talking about should we increase the levels? It's been talked about as possibly being related to a lower risk of multiple sclerosis, although a lot of things have gone that way and not panned out. But colorectal cancer, that one's been around for a while. There's been suggestions that it may protect against colorectal cancer. And some of that evidence is pretty interesting. So I think we're going to see a lot of things happening on that front for sure. FLATOW: So Vitamin D is the new Vitamin E sort of. (Soundbite of laughter) SILBERNER: Yeah, that's a good way of putting it. And, of course, we have to remember there have been a lot of disappointments with some of these vitamins. Beta-carotene was supposed\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. SILBERNER: \u2026to protect against all sorts of things. It turns out it may not only not be protective; it may be harmful in some cases. So I think no one is saying the Vitamin D story is done, but I certainly think it bears watching. FLATOW: Rich(ph) in Rochester, hi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. RICH (Caller): I think another big story in - I think it's probably one with the global - I mean, the climate changes - the quiet comeback of nuclear energy with\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. RICH: \u2026the (unintelligible) designs and things like that. FLATOW: That's been kind of coming. SHOGREN: Well, that's a interesting point. I think comeback might be a little bit of a strong word because, so far, we have the industry hoping for, praying for, on the verge of poised for a comeback. But we don't have any new nuclear power plants. And we'll see if we get there or if we don't, but it is interesting that, at least from the standpoint of how people are talking about nuclear energy, it has become more popular. Now, of course, there are lots of people who are in positions of power who aren't so crazy about it, so we'll see what happens. But it's been interesting to see the nuclear energy industry kind of re-pitch itself. And the way it's pitching itself now is as the big answer to the climate change program. FLATOW: Yeah, yeah. SHOGREN: And that's been fascinating. And they're in the huge budget bill that the president and Congress have been working on. There is more money for loan guarantees for new nuclear power plants and for other sources of energy that don't emit greenhouse gases. So it will be interesting to see whether those loan guarantees and all of this positive press might change the future of nuclear power and actually create a comeback. FLATOW: Now, it is - we only have about less than a minute left and we didn't get to talk about 2008. But I'll tell you something I would like to see in 2008. I would to see science to become a topic of the political debates. I'd like to have someone talk about science\u2026 PALCA: Well, there is\u2026 FLATOW: \u2026and questions about science in these debates, you know? PALCA: Right. While that hasn't come up, I have seen there somebody who's organizing - I guess John Rennie from Scientific American just joined a group that's calling on the presidents to have - the presidential candidates to have a scientific debate. I've heard Hillary Clinton makes some comments about her positions. But, yeah, it's not really been an issue. I think, in a way, stem cells might have been an issue in this debate, in this campaign. But maybe that's been taken off the table by some\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. PALCA: \u2026of the news findings we've discussed. I don't know. FLATOW: Well, we just\u2026 SHOGREN: I think\u2026 FLATOW: Go ahead. SHOGREN: I think climate change will enter more. It's not as much of a debate right now among Republicans or among Democrats, but once it's - once the primaries are over, I think the topic will come out more. FLATOW: Now, let's start out with the question to all the candidates: Why is it hotter in the summer than it is in the winter? (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: And we will end it there and see how they compare with the Harvard graduates. I want to thank all of my guests - Joanne Silberner, Joe Palca, Elizabeth Shogren - all the correspondents - science and health correspondents at NPR's desk. Thank you all. Have a great holiday season. PALCA: You too, Ira. SILBERNER: You too, Ira. FLATOW: And we'll talk to you maybe next year. SILBERNER: Terrific.  IRA FLATOW, host:  Up next, a look back at the year in science. Now, if you had to pick the biggest science story of 2007, which one would get your vote? Science Magazine, they pick one every year, and this year, they picked the human genetic variation as its breakthrough of the year. Nature named the head of the International Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, as its newsmaker of the year. They sort of won a double award, with also with the Nobel Peace Prize and Al Gore whose latest report says it's 90 percent - the IPCC said it's 90 percent certain that activity - human activity is causing global warming.  You might say, hey, you know that Arctic ice, we've seen those great pictures of the Arctic ice melting even faster than scientists predicted, maybe that's, you know, that changed a lot of people's minds. Maybe that's a great best science story of the year or a health story. There's a health story that's related to that as scientists are documenting the health effects of global warming. Then right there smack toward the end of the year, we have the - those retro stem cells. What - people might say, hey, you know, that's a big story of the year, but it's not that big because it hasn't gone a whole big direction yet, you know? How about Craig Venter's genome or the discovery of more planets outside our solar system?  Well, we've gathered some of our favorite and most knowledgeable NPR reporters for a look back at the year in science. And if you'd like to join our discussion, our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. As always, you can go over to \"Second Life\" and join the other avatars there that are sending in questions and talking about our SCIENCE FRIDAY hour this hour.  Let me introduce my guests. Joe Palca is science correspondent for NPR in Washington, Elizabeth Shogren, is environmental correspondent at NPR, and Joanne Silberner is the NPR's health policy correspondent. Welcome, you all, to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  ELIZABETH SHOGREN: Thanks, Ira.  JOE PALCA: Thanks, Ira.  SHOGREN: Good to be here.  FLATOW: When was the last time all three of you were in front of a microphone?  PALCA: At the same time.  (Soundbite of laughter)  PALCA: I think it was '07 or\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: (Unintelligible)\u2026  PALCA: I can't remember back that far. Right.  JOANNE SILBERNER: (Unintelligible).  PALCA: I was thinking you thinking you gathered the most impressive science writers, but they were busy, so you got us.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Oh, no, you guys are the tops.  PALCA: All right, thank you.  FLATOW: Come on, you know, that puts our show down. You're guys are at the top.  PALCA: Yes, we - you're lucky to have us.  FLATOW: There you go, that's what we need.  So, Joe, since you're talking up the first this hour, why don't you give us your pick for the top stories?  PALCA: Well, I mean, Ira, you know, you mentioned the big story on my beat. How am I not going to say that that's the top story?  FLATOW: Right.  PALCA: Although, we should have a discussion about what we all mean by top story, but I think this whole business about, you know, getting normal adult stem cells to sing and dance like embryonic stem cells without destroying an embryo in the process is a fantastically important step. I mean, if this world of stem cell research is going to go anywhere, and it seems a lot of scientists believe it is, as you say not that much to show yet, but the promise still is there. If it's going to go anywhere, they're going to have to get around this ethical conundrum of destroying embryos. And if this really does that, briefly, to describe it you know, they take these adult cells. And they insert these genes that make them behave as if they were embryonic stem cells and it sort of gets rid of the question, I mean, you know, the question is: What are they?  Well, if they look like embryonic stem cells and they act like embryonic stem cells, and they do things like embryonic stem cells, are they embryonic stem cells?  FLATOW: Quite(ph) that.  PALCA: Well, you know, they are in one sense and they're not another - exactly.  FLATOW: Yeah.  PALCA: But if this gets around that, so I think that's a fantastically important step, and we'll just wait and see. I mean, you know, we - that's what we do in science, we wait and see.  FLATOW: We're talking about the best stories this hour in TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  Joanne, well, your beat covers lots of health stuff, what would you like to pull out?  SILBERNER: I think I want to pull out a whole category because, you know, medicine moves slowly at the most time, occasionally it makes great leaps. And maybe in stem cells that may be happening, who knows, but the category I'd pick out for this year is infectious diseases.  In one of the under reported or under realized stories, I think, is that there's a vaccine that's been developed for bird flu if it does indeed come over. No one really knows if it works. You can't expose, people to bird flu and see whether or not they catch up. The government has developed a vaccine that's being put in a stockpile. The fact that bird flu hasn't arrived in humans in a big way is good news.  But there's bad news on infectious diseases front as well. We've got a similarly new form of MRSA, Methicillin-resistant Staph Aureus, which seems to be going around and no one quite knows what to do about it.  FLATOW: Right.  SILBERNER: There's a new cold virus that suddenly appeared and it's - no one knows how - they know that it can occasionally cause some big and serious problems, but no one knows the denominator. How often is that we're not doing anything? And new ear infection, so good news and bad news from infectious disease would take my vote.  FLATOW: Good news. I'm glad they don't have that med student syndrome at the\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Elizabeth, what have you got for us?  SHOGREN: Well, I think it would have to be climate change reaching a tipping point as far as the public perception of how important and how real it is. It's been an amazing year, and we're only in the process here, but it's been an amazing year - you had the Supreme Court announce that it is a pollutant and that the Environmental Protection Agency should regulate it.  You had a Nobel Peace Prize for Al Gore in the IPCC. We had a new IPCC report telling us that the dangers are more than we feared they might have been. There's been so much going on across the country and across the world and most recently in Bali where the world - representatives of the world's countries got together and decided on a plan forward or at least a plan to go forward and deal with the problem in a more serious way.  FLATOW: Well, now you have Arnold Schwarzenegger's going to take on Washington.  SHOGREN: Oh, was sure he is.  FLATOW: You know?  SHOGREN: And that's a fascinating story in itself.  FLATOW: It's a great story.  SHOGREN: But it - and it shows that this is not a Democratic issue. This is a bipartisan issue. Some of the Republican governors are at the forefront of this issue trying to push the United States to do more. And it's not just on the -in the states now the - in the Senate. A subcommittee and a committee voted to approve a measure that would set up a whole new system for controlling greenhouse gas emissions from cars and factories and power plants, and so that's on its way too.  FLATOW: We'll have to watch all of these. We're going to have to take a break, come back and take more of your questions from - what you think. Maybe - what do you think, are they stories we missed, some of the stories that are bigger, some of the stories that might deserve more attention with Joe Palca, Elizabeth Shogren and Joanne Silberner. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  CONAN: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  A brief program note: Since news broke that the CIA destroyed hundreds of hours of videotaped interrogations, a federal court and Congress have been asking questions and they're starting to get answers. Neal Conan revisits the destruction of the CIA tapes on Monday's TALK OF THE NATION.  This hour, we're talking about our year in science with my guests Elizabeth Shogren, environment correspondent at the national desk at NPR. Joanne Silberner is the health policy correspondent. Joe Palca is a science correspondent.  And our number - 1-800-989-8255. Let's see if we got a - oh, we have a lot of phone calls here.  Let's go to Nelson(ph) in Tucson. Hi, Nelson.  NELSON (Caller): Hi, how are you doing?  FLATOW: Hi, there.  NELSON: Yeah, so my story of the year is kind of personal, I guess, being that I just finished the post docs and took and took a job in the industry. And the reason behind that is kind of my story in that post docs are leaving - or leaving academics at a very high rate, and I think it has to do a lot with the funding situation as it stands being so difficult to get money, and I think that that might be a science story that's rather big, but might not be talked about as much.  FLATOW: You know, that is my sleeper science story of the year. We did a story - we did a show on this a few weeks ago about an urban institute study that showed exactly what you just said; that there are three times the number of qualified scientists and engineering graduates for the number of jobs available to them, three times as many. Where are they going was the question.  FLATOW: Why do we have to import talent from overseas when we have all this talents three times the number for the slots available?  NELSON: Right.  FLATOW: And you have answered that part of that question.  NELSON: Yeah, it's difficult too because, you know, being in academics for so long, I still believe that academics is probably the best place to do real science, you know? I answer the questions that need to be answered, but if all the brains are heading out of the industry, I think it might hurt a little bit. And\u2026  FLATOW: Is that - is it because of the money? It's not just there for you?  NELSON: Not necessarily the money personally.  FLATOW: Yeah.  NELSON: But the need that if I wanted to become an assistant professor, I need to write grants pretty much year-round and not do science, and I can't write grants unless I do the science, so this awful Catch-22.  FLATOW: Yeah.  NELSON: So\u2026  PALCA: Ira, can I jump in for a sec?  FLATOW: Sure, please.  PALCA: Well, this is actually, I mean, this is an interesting story because it's been going on for a long time and it's just\u2026  NELSON: Sure.  PALCA: It's come up again in the last year or two because of some funny funding courts, I guess, somewhat at NIH. But it's been a very bad year for new grant approvals and a lot of scientists are discouraged about that. But there's a sort of a generic problem because the money for NIH, National Institutes of Health, has been going up and up and up and up, and if it hasn't gone up in the last year, it's certainly gone up quite a bit in the last 10 years.  And the point is, you know, even a little - there's a little problem in American scientists, which people don't like to talk about, and its' a sort of a pyramid scheme because, you know, once you get in at the bottom, you want money for the rest of your life and you want to train the next generation. And so, are you training the right number of people? Are you training too many people?  And, I think, we have to ask some serious questions because basically, we can never fund research at the rate at which we're drawing in competent people into the program, and so there's always going to be this problem of more qualified researchers than there is enough money. And it's a tough one, you know?  FLATOW: But why then there are the - are people coming from overseas to take these jobs that these people won't take?  NELSON: I can maybe offer\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  NELSON: insight into that.  FLATOW: Go ahead.  NELSON: Overseas post docs don't necessarily have to be paid as much as American citizens. And I've heard that - in the institution that I was in -overseas post docs from China, for instance, didn't necessarily get paid as much as the\u2026  PALCA: But that\u2026  SHOGREN: Yeah, but they're having a problem now in getting visas since September 11th. There's been issues going back\u2026  NELSON: Sure.  SHOGREN: \u2026and forth some years are better than others. But certainly not as many people are getting to come in as they used to be able to.  FLATOW: You'll hear, though, the other side of the story, which will say the law says they have to get paid the same amount and then the third hand of the story is, but there are lots of loopholes in that law.  NELSOBN: There certainly are.  FLATOW: Yes. So, I think this is a huge issue about why we have - we're losing in the pipelines so many qualified people and that, to me, it's almost like the answer's almost the same. I heard - I asked somebody who - in the lab the other day. She's a lawyer, her husband is a post doc and he - I asked - I brought this up and I asked her why her husband is still there if he's surrounded by foreigners, and she said he's willing to put the hours in at the bottom line.  He says the foreigners are willing to come in and, you know, in the early stage of their lives and put the hours in for a chance to make it big. He said the other people - the other post docs that they know of, they've just gone in to the industry where they can make it big immediately.  NELSON: You got it.  FLATOW: They're not willing to start at the bottom.  SILBERNER: Well, in medicine, you know, there's been a problem with getting American medical students, you know, they're getting fewer and fewer attracted into family practice than some of the other\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  SILBERNER: \u2026primary care specialties that pay less. So when you have your residencies and internships, they need foreign medical grads.  FLATOW: So we're like farming out the early jobs in science like we farm out lawn mowing, you know? It's sort of the same thing that's going on in yard work and house work.  NELSON: Yeah.  FLATOW: Okay. Thanks for calling. It was my soap box(ph).  Caller: Yeah. Thanks for the conversation.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number.  Elizabeth, another story you'd like to bring up.  SHOGREN: What we mentioned just briefly, the story that happened just this week. And it was kind of a combined story. We had the Congress and - approving a new energy bill which sets new fuel efficiency standards for cars - raising it to 35 miles per gallon. And the president signed that bill. And that was huge. It's been decades since there's been this kind of a big change of commitment by the U. S. government to improve fuel efficiency standards for cars, so cars will go farther on a gallon of gas. So that was a big deal.  FLATOW: Thirty years in the making.  SHOGREN: Yeah. It's quite a long time. And one of the things that will happen as a result of this is that cars - at least the new ones - will not emit as much greenhouse gases from their tailpipes as they do now because when cars go farther on a gallon of gas, they emit less greenhouses gases. And so that's a good thing for global warming as well.  FLATOW: Yeah.  SHOGREN: And that was part of what I think came together to push the Congress and the president to do something they hadn't wanted to do for a long time. I spoke to industry - just one. And the surprising thing about this is that the auto industry, in the end, supported this decision. It's something that they would never have done even six month ago. And I think that that's part of what indicates it; that even - that industry in the United States is seeing the writing the wall and that it's time to start doing things. And also that maybe it's time to start making deals that aren't as strict or as difficult as whatever deals they might be able to make once some other president is in office. But that's- it's an interesting\u2026  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mm. And there are critics who say that in return for allowing that to happen, they got the EPA deal that went down this week.  SHOGREN: Right. And I think that that's really important to see is that the Bush administration is still the Bush administration. And while the president signed this the very same day, the Environmental Protection Agency told California and at least 16 other states that they may not go ahead with their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes even more than this energy - energy bill would have done, so the one that states want to go ahead and do something more extreme, the federal government is still obstructing that.  FLATOW: Yeah. You know, I was reading a story today - it might have been The Times or the Wall Street Journal, I can't remember because my mind is going -about the European Union making even stricter standards now for the automakers overseas. And to me, that said, well, you know, we've ratcheted it up again. Let's say the Europeans start making, you know, cars that do meet higher standards. Is Detroit going to be left behind again because they're not, you know, going to rush into this, like the Europeans might.  SHORGREN: Well, and the 35 miles per gallon target for this new rule is by 2020\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  SHOGREN: \u2026which is still some years down the road. And the European auto - the Europeans have a head start because they use a lot of diesel, which already is more efficient than gasoline, and so that gives them a head start towards using gas - using less fuel when they use their cars. So - and I do think that this is a - that there will be a big question of whether this is enough. And what California and Governor Schwarzenegger say and what many other people say around the country is that what the president signed isn't enough but will -but it is a big step forward nonetheless.  FLATOW: Let's go to Andre(ph) in Michigan. Hi, Andre.  ANDRE (Caller): Hi.  FLATOW: Hi, there. Go ahead,  ANDRE: The enigma that is the origin of the Moon and the Earth during the age of the late heavy bombardment of our early solar system 4. 5 billion years ago.  FLATOW: You say an enigma.  ANDRE: The enigma of origin.  FLATOW: What do you mean by that?  ANDRE: How the early solar system formed our planet and the moon together.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So it didn't happen the way we think it did.  ANDRE: No.  FLATOW: Let's see. Any comment on that? Anybody been following that one? We don't have.  PALCA: Not one of mine, Ira.  FLATOW: We don't have a planet correspondent.  PALCA: We don't have - we can run out into the newsroom and see if there's someone.  (Soundbite of laughter)  SILBERNER: And for me not unless the moon has a heartbeat.  PALCA: Right.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: It's a good point. I remember the story was kind of interesting about (unintelligible).  PALCA: Yeah. I could tell you something about Mars, but I think I'd have to pass on the Moon. Sorry.  FLATOW: Sorry, Andre, but you stumped the panel and we need that.  (Soundbite of laughter)  PALCA: That's terrible.  FLATOW: I'm looking for my bell. It's on the other side of the desk, and I can't quite reach it here. So, thanks, Andre.  1-800-989-8255.  There were - Joe, just because you brought it up -there were a lot of Mars things and planetary things that were going on.  PALCA: Oh, yeah. I mean, this has been a fantastic year, I mean, the flybys and Saturn, there were some more data coming from, I think, the Pluto mission and -I think I've got that right - and - but I, you know, I've been watching for these amazing little rovers on Mars. Can you believe it? I mean, you know, three and a half years ago, they're crossing their fingers and said, maybe 90 days. God, wouldn't that be great? We could drive a hundred yards. And now they've driven 16 miles or whatever it is. It's just - not that far, but it's just amazing. And it's such a tribute to what's possible.  And I think, in a way, you know, it's got to be a pain for NASA to hear this over and over again, you know? They've got this gazillion dollar space station circling the planet. They can't get it finished. They can't get the space shuttle to fly up to it, you know? The - all the people on there and most of what they're doing is keeping it - and doing housekeeping because there's so much stuff to keep take care of, and here are these little bitty, you know, by comparison, costing nothing rovers, you know, clunking along, taking data. They got probes orbiting the planet. They're coming back with a better understanding of where Mars came from, how there might have been life there, how - or how there might have been water at least. And, you know, it's just such a tribute to what's possible if you get a - well, you get a little lucky, okay. They know they're lucky. But they had a good design and they implemented it and the pay off has been incredible.  (Soundbite of bell ringing)  FLATOW: There's the stump the panel bell.  (Soundbite of laughter)  SHORGEN: Congratulations, Ira.  PALCA: I got that one right.  FLATOW: You got it. You got that right.  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow with Joanne Silberner, Elizabeth Shogren and Joe Palca, talking about the big science stories of the year.  And, you know, the X PRIZE stuff. You, you know, sort of segueing into that, you know, a lot of X PRIZES are taking the place of government research. Private industries are funding some of these big new projects. And\u2026  PALCA: Well, I think the idea is to say, you know, let's at least consider other ways of doing business in science and in exploration. And I think a lot of people are considering that.  FLATOW: Yeah.  PALCA: I mean, in a way, it reflects the little bit on what Elizabeth was saying about the states kind of getting involved in the climate change game. You know, the states obviously got involved in a big way in the embryonic stem cell research game because they said we're not really happy with the way the federal government is going.  And, you know, by the way, if you think these things really are going to have an economic payoff someday, well, why not encourage people to join in?  FLATOW: Yeah.  PALCA: And the people who say, look, even if there is no economic payoff right away, the ancillary benefits of having these prizes that people build infrastructures to go after is going to be helpful to the country. So it's - I think it's, you know, it's an interesting approach.  FLATOW: Yeah.  PALCA: But we'll see.  FLATOW: Yeah. Here's a question from Second Life from Leandro(ph) who says how about that Vitamin D story? It's a biggie.  SILBERNER: That's an interesting one. And that's - I think that bears\u2026  FLATOW: Right. Yeah.  SILBERNER: \u2026watching if you're looking forward to the future. Vitamin D is, you know, a lot of food is fortified with it. And, of course, if you're a fan of cod liver oil, you will enjoy plenty of it. It's\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  SILBERNER: But, you know, food is fortified and there's plenty of fish. I think there are people talking about should we increase the levels? It's been talked about as possibly being related to a lower risk of multiple sclerosis, although a lot of things have gone that way and not panned out. But colorectal cancer, that one's been around for a while. There's been suggestions that it may protect against colorectal cancer. And some of that evidence is pretty interesting. So I think we're going to see a lot of things happening on that front for sure.  FLATOW: So Vitamin D is the new Vitamin E sort of.  (Soundbite of laughter)  SILBERNER: Yeah, that's a good way of putting it. And, of course, we have to remember there have been a lot of disappointments with some of these vitamins. Beta-carotene was supposed\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  SILBERNER: \u2026to protect against all sorts of things. It turns out it may not only not be protective; it may be harmful in some cases. So I think no one is saying the Vitamin D story is done, but I certainly think it bears watching.  FLATOW: Rich(ph) in Rochester, hi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  RICH (Caller): I think another big story in - I think it's probably one with the global - I mean, the climate changes - the quiet comeback of nuclear energy with\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  RICH: \u2026the (unintelligible) designs and things like that.  FLATOW: That's been kind of coming.  SHOGREN: Well, that's a interesting point. I think comeback might be a little bit of a strong word because, so far, we have the industry hoping for, praying for, on the verge of poised for a comeback. But we don't have any new nuclear power plants. And we'll see if we get there or if we don't, but it is interesting that, at least from the standpoint of how people are talking about nuclear energy, it has become more popular. Now, of course, there are lots of people who are in positions of power who aren't so crazy about it, so we'll see what happens. But it's been interesting to see the nuclear energy industry kind of re-pitch itself. And the way it's pitching itself now is as the big answer to the climate change program.  FLATOW: Yeah, yeah.  SHOGREN: And that's been fascinating. And they're in the huge budget bill that the president and Congress have been working on. There is more money for loan guarantees for new nuclear power plants and for other sources of energy that don't emit greenhouse gases. So it will be interesting to see whether those loan guarantees and all of this positive press might change the future of nuclear power and actually create a comeback.  FLATOW: Now, it is - we only have about less than a minute left and we didn't get to talk about 2008. But I'll tell you something I would like to see in 2008. I would to see science to become a topic of the political debates. I'd like to have someone talk about science\u2026  PALCA: Well, there is\u2026  FLATOW: \u2026and questions about science in these debates, you know?  PALCA: Right. While that hasn't come up, I have seen there somebody who's organizing - I guess John Rennie from Scientific American just joined a group that's calling on the presidents to have - the presidential candidates to have a scientific debate. I've heard Hillary Clinton makes some comments about her positions. But, yeah, it's not really been an issue. I think, in a way, stem cells might have been an issue in this debate, in this campaign. But maybe that's been taken off the table by some\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  PALCA: \u2026of the news findings we've discussed. I don't know.  FLATOW: Well, we just\u2026  SHOGREN: I think\u2026  FLATOW: Go ahead.  SHOGREN: I think climate change will enter more. It's not as much of a debate right now among Republicans or among Democrats, but once it's - once the primaries are over, I think the topic will come out more.  FLATOW: Now, let's start out with the question to all the candidates: Why is it hotter in the summer than it is in the winter?  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: And we will end it there and see how they compare with the Harvard graduates.  I want to thank all of my guests - Joanne Silberner, Joe Palca, Elizabeth Shogren - all the correspondents - science and health correspondents at NPR's desk. Thank you all. Have a great holiday season.  PALCA: You too, Ira.  SILBERNER: You too, Ira.  FLATOW: And we'll talk to you maybe next year.  SILBERNER: Terrific.

I'm Ira Flatow. Okay, the holiday season, you're at a party talking to someone you just met and a few minutes into the conversation, you discover he's one of those dreaded close talkers, something like you seen on \"Seinfeld. \" He leans in just a little too close, you would take a step back, he moves closer to you. Take another step back and soon, you're up against the wall there's nowhere to go. Your personal space is under siege and if it's, really, very close, it's a very uncomfortable feeling because, that's because even though you can't see a boundary around yourself, your brain knows where the space starts and stops and it, in turn, makes you react to feel like your space has been invaded. That cocktail party scenario is just one example of the complex mapping your brain does. Whether you are a professional athlete or you're just trying to cross the street, how your brain keeps track of your body is a really complicated and amazing process. And your brain can play tricks on that space around you, too, making you believe that supernatural things are occurring, like out-of-body experiences. Do you see auras and colors? Some people do. And now, neuroscientists are just learning how these may be natural events orchestrated by your brain. My next two guests have written a book on the topic, talking about the mysteries of your brain and the space around you. Sandra and Matthew Blakeslee are a mother-son science writing team. Their new book is called \"The Body Has a Mind of Its Own: How Your Body Maps in Your Brain Help You Do (Almost) Anything Better. \" Sandra Blakeslee is a frequent contributor to New York Times and she and her son join me from KANW in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Ms. SANDRA BLAKESLEE (Co-author, \"The Body Has a Mind of Its Own: How Your Body Maps in Your Brain Help You Do (Almost) Anything Better\"): Thank you. Mr. MATTHEW BLAKESLEE (Co-author, \"The Body Has a Mind of Its Own: How Your Body Maps in Your Brain Help You Do (Almost) Anything Better\"): Nice to be here. FLATOW: Thank you. Sandra, well tell me about your body has - your brain has body maps? What is - what are we talking about here? Ms. BLAKESLEE: Right. So your brain actually has - your brain maps as a sprawling network of body maps, and so it's - these things happen sort of out of consciousness under the hood as it were. You have maps of your body parts, which is called your touch map. So if you touch your arm or your leg or your hip or young side of your face, there's an area in your brain that maps each limb, each finger, each toe, each part of your body. There's a motor map every time you move a hand or an arm or any part of your body that motor region controls the motor map. You also have a spatial map. So if you put your hand out in front of you and lay it over your head, you're mapping all of every inch of space around your body. It's sort of affixed to you body and you can - your brain is keeping track of everything in that space. You're mapping your internal organs, your felt sense, you're mapping your emotional world that way. So these maps has worked in concert to give you the sense of being a unitary being, but it's kind of strange because these maps can fall apart and these maps can lead to all sorts of strange phenomena. FLATOW: Hmm. These maps, your brain, I'm reading in your book your brain is also mapping the space that you're walking through at the same time, right? Ms. BLAKESLEE: Correct. FLATOW: It's creating a place you call there a place cell. There are cells called place cells in the brain that are actually keeping a storage area of what you're walking through. Ms. BLAKESLEE: Right, and this is an area - this is an area called the hypocampus, which is where memory is kind of mediated. But is also a place map. So where - when you walk through a room, it's taking - this region of your brain is mapping where you are in space. And a little further up there is an area called grid cells, which are mapping also where you are in space. So the finding is this that great athletes probably have very good grid cells and very good place cells because of the way they move around the court and the way they can ease in basketball and in football and in soccer - games like that. The brain is mapping that space constantly and people would have, could be more gifted at it if they had better parietal maps. FLATOW: You talked about Bill Bradley, the great basketball player, later a senator from New Jersey, who could virtually see behind him almost, as if he had eyes in the back of his head because he had such great talent. Ms. BLAKESLEE: Right. FLATOW: And that's because he was able to use these cells - these maps better than most people? Ms. BLAKESLEE: Presumably so. And he would train and practice and practice and practice. But he had a great gift for mapping that space and the argument is if that great athletes have a better mapping system for their spatial placement of the body. FLATOW: Matt, can you use this information to make you area better athlete now that you know that these maps and spaces in cells exists? Mr. BLAKESLEE: Well, yes, as it turns out. So your body map network is in control of your movements and all of your skills. What we tend to call muscle memories and skill memories aren't actually in your body or in your muscles, they are distributed throughout these networks. When you practice a sport, you are finding the connections between and among these maps and improving the skill that way. But you can also do what's called imaginal practice. It's not practicing your mind's eyes so much as practicing your mind's body. And as we detail in the book, by practicing in your mind's body, feeling the actual stress on your joints and the velocities - you don't even need to use your vision for this, in fact, sometimes it helps not to do that - you can actually improve your skills more than under sort - some circumstances, improve your skills more than you can through actual practice. By combining imaginal practice in your mind's body and real practice, you actually get much better results typically than you do just going out to the court, just practicing with your physical body. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number, we're taking calls about mapping - the maps that of your body that your brains have. I want to know - this book is fascinating. I'm talking with Sandra and Matthew Blakeslee. \"The Body Has a Mind of Its Own: How Your Body Maps in Your Brain Help You Do (Almost) Anything Better. \" One of the truly fascinating parts of your book is the understanding that we gain from reading it about how knowing about these maps, knowing how the brain works may explain somebody's supernatural things that we think are supernatural but can actually be explained naturally - and especially people seeing colors and auras and things like that, Sandra? Ms. BLAKESLEE: Yeah, it's very, very cool. So a lot of this work is happening in Europe but some here too. With auras, there's a condition called synesthesia, which is a mixing of the senses. And it's actually more common than most people think. But you could be born a synesthic(ph) and you can see letters that will have colors and so on. But some people have sort of an aura synesthesia they will see colors around other people, and these colors are consistent. So every - you have friend named Joan(ph), who will have blue, another friend named Joan who will have pink, and when they test these people, they're sure are not confabulating because if you test them a year later and asked them the same type of questions and they have the answers exactly the same, it's like that they're really seeing that. So that's synesthesia - out of body experience as you can induce in you. I could induce one of you pretty easily\u2026 FLATOW: Really? Ms. BLAKESLEE: \u2026to it. Yes. FLATOW: I dare you. Ms. BLAKESLEE: Yeah. Okay, I'll take a flight to Washington or New York? There's - well, the way with first shown was in a sort of scientist in Switzerland and he was doing some brain exploration surgery. Before you do epilepsy surgery, you put a probe in the brain and you try to find where the focus of the abnormal tissue is. This guy has caught sort of going around looking in the brain just looking for this abnormal tissue. And he turned on the electrode in a place called the right angular gyrus, it's sort of right over your ear towards the back of your head. And the woman on the table, she just flew out of her body and she went, ah, and she was floating on the ceiling looking down, their legs floating. He turned off the electrode, she was back in her body. Turned it on, she was out. Off and back in. And he has done a bunch of patients like that. More recently, they did the same experiment but with virtual reality and they put you - let's say that you would be standing there and you would see projection of yourself about 6 feet ahead. If they run a stick or a ruler down your back and a ruler down the back of the avatar, which is this, you know, imaginal\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Ms. BLAKESLEE: \u2026picture of yourself. You will then move into that body. You will move out of your body into the avatar. And this is getting - they're getting very, very sophisticated with virtual reality and you can have - you can take and you can induce out of body experiences now with virtual reality without, you know, having to put a electrode in your head. FLATOW: Speaking of virtual reality, we have people on \"Second Life\" who are actually congregating around SCIENCE FRIDAY's spot here. Ms. BLAKESLEE: Wait. Ah. FLATOW: And Ovular(ph) in \"Second Life\" writes a text: Could you discuss gender differences in spatial mapping. Is there a gender difference? Matthew? Mr. BLAKESLEE: Well, I - we don't really have very much to say about that. Ms. BLAKESLEE: Well, there is one difference. Men tend to have larger parietal lobes and women tend to have better more connections between the two hemispheres. These are basic biological findings. And so the spatial mapping for males is probably a little better than for women. But then, again, all of that stuff about male, female? FLATOW: Yeah. Ms. BLAKESLEE: It's all on a bell-shaped curve and you've got, you know, women who tend\u2026 Mr. BLAKESLEE: So much overlap. Ms. BLAKESLEE: Yeah. Huge amount of overlap. But there isn't - there aren't very strong differences in the way these maps are laid down. They're laid down at birth, you have sort of a scaffolding for these maps when you're born. And then as experience flows into the brain, you build up these maps, you build up motor maps and cognitive maps. Mr. BLAKESLEE: There's some studies like I'm aware in rodents, for example. They find some gender differences like I think female rats tend to prefer using landmarks to navigate whereas males use a little bit more dead reckoning. That would be - correspond roughly to using place cells versus grid cells like we were talking about earlier. But I don't know how much they've - how far they've (unintelligible) this to people. FLATOW: Let me see if we're going to take\u2026 Mr. BLAKESLEE: Yeah. FLATOW: \u2026a quick call in before we have to go to the break. Let's go to Stephanie(ph) in Wenatchee, Washington. Hi, Stephanie. STEPHANIE (Caller): Hello. FLATOW: Hi there. STEPHANIE: My question is, you know that's - when you have your eyes closed and someone runs their finger not touching you but it feels like someone's touching you but between your nose and eyes? What makes it happen? Do they know? FLATOW: Good question. Ms. BLAKESLEE: Yeah. Yeah, what they do. This is your peripheral personal space map. So again, if you put your arms out in front of your body and wave them over your head and ran to the side, all of that space is mapped and you actually own that space and when people enter that space and if they try to tickle you or something like that, cells in your parietal lobe, which are mapping that space - well, it's more than one of the maps - are active. The cells are active when anything comes into that space. So you actually feel the presence of someone even with your eyes closed and this is why a healing touch is so powerful and (unintelligible) these things. It's probably not because of energy fields, but it's because of this activation of these body maps. STEPHANIE: Oh. Mr. BLAKESLEE: Yeah, the anticipation can actually cause a sensation in your lower, like, in your primary touch map, for example. FLATOW: So you can watch the cells in your brain actually firing when this happens? Mr. BLAKESLEE: Yes. That's right. FLATOW: And then I've (unintelligible)\u2026 Ms. BLAKESLEE: They're firing away. Mr. BLAKESLEE: Because all of these maps are interlinks, they're all influencing each other with sensations, predictions, anticipations, interpretations and\u2026 FLATOW: Wow. It's fascinating stuff. This is just some of the really fascinating stuff of the book \"The Body Has a Mind of Its Own: How Your Body Maps in Your Brain Help You Do (Almost) Anything Better. \" My guests are Sandra Blakeslee and Matthew Blakeslee. We're going to come back, take a short break, get more into some of these really unusual consequences of the body maps. Take more of your questions, 1-800-989-8255. Find an avatar in \"Second Life\" at Science School wearing a SCIENCE FRIDAY T-shirt. We'll be right back after this short break. Don't go away. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about how your brain keeps track of your body and your space around you, described as a bubble around your body in the book called \"The Body Has a Mind of Its Own: How Your Body Maps in Your Brain Help You Do (Almost) Anything Better. \" Sandra Blakeslee is here with her son Matthew Blakeslee. Four generations of science writers, San? Ms. BLAKESLEE: Yup. Good job. FLATOW: I remember your father, Al\u2026 Ms. BLAKESLEE: Uh-huh. FLATOW: \u2026but I don't think I ever met your grandfather. Ms. BLAKESLEE: So Howard - yeah, Howard Blakeslee was, I think, the first or among the first science writers in the United States starting around 1920 and he founded the field and Associated Press. And Alton, my dad, followed him. And then I fell into it sideways many, many years ago and mostly, in the New York Times, I've worked for them for 40 years. And now, Matt. Mr. BLAKESLEE: I pretty much fell into it by accident as well. I was\u2026 FLATOW: Did you want to be a science writer? Mr. BLAKESLEE: I had never really considered it, not seriously. I was training to be a scientist and then for various reasons, I decided not to go into an academic track. I was trying to find something else to do\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Mr. BLAKESLEE: \u2026looking at various options. And then Sandy said, why don't you try science writing and it was something kind of easy to fall into because I'd seen it all my life being done and discussed around the dinner table and everything, so I gave it a try and it's working out really well. FLATOW: That's good because usually, that has the opposite effect. I know what my kids, they don't want to talk to all about science because I'm talking about it all the time. So it's good to see that. Ms. BLAKESLEE: Yeah, that's right. Mr. BLAKESLEE: I didn't happen to us. FLATOW: That's good. Let's go to Bianca(ph) in Wichita. Hi, Bianca. BIANCA (Caller): Hi. Thanks for taking my call. So I am (unintelligible) and I'm apprentice midwife and I work in the (unintelligible) field and this has gotten my brain going, Because so often I see women who really choose to focus on visualization of their birth, have really successful, wonderful, easy laid back labors compared to women who, you know, don't really want to talk about it at all or don't want to be idealistic about the births that they want to have, have really difficult labor. Then, I just thought it seems very similar to what you're talking about sports. FLATOW: Yeah. BIANCA: And I want to hear your comments about that. FLATOW: Sandy, anything? Ms. BLAKESLEE: Well, you know, this - if you go to a sports psychologist and know how this laundry list of methods to improve your capacity to play the sport. One of them is visualization, visual imagery. What we're talking about, in this case, is motor imagery, which is different than visual imagery. Motor imagery is where you actually concentrate on the feel of the movements or of the sport. And what happens is that you increase this, literally, increase the size of the motor maps with imagery. That's only worked with motor imagery not with visual imagery. How would it apply to childbirth is a really interesting observation. And I don't know, Matt's wife is about to have her second baby in a few months so maybe, you can\u2026 Mr. BLAKESLEE: Touch true. Well, I mean, one thing about visualization, about getting in touch with your physical sensations is this taps into another bottle body mapping system that Sandy mentioned at the opening. In addition to all these maps you have of your body's musculature and skin sensations, what you'd use for voluntary volitional movement, there's this whole other track coming from your visual organs and from a separate population of receptors in your skin that gave rather to a separate region in the brain called your insula and this is a map of your heart, your lungs, your guts. This is where you have gut feelings, and in all giblets and the interior of your skin. This is where you experience pain, itch, tickle sensation, sensual touch - the kind that is shared between lovers and parents and young children. And this is also where you experience breath and heartbeat. And in humans, it's actually interesting. This are has been evolved to a much higher level than in any other animal, even our closest friendly cousins, for experiencing social emotions, social pain as well as physical pain. Meditation thickens the insular cortex and so - I guess this (unintelligible). I think by having in touch with your experience that way - paying attention to pain and trying to own it and control it through experiencing it, that could be the way that this visualizations are helping these mothers during child birth. AMANDA: Uh-huh. Ms. BLAKESLEE: I'm sure you can attenuate that map that way, yeah. FLATOW: I think you may practice your\u2026 Mr. BLAKESLEE: Yeah. AMANDA: I'm sorry? Mr. BLAKESLEE: Please, go ahead. It also made me think about women who have birthing who are survivors of abuse. And I'm curious\u2026 FLATOW: I guess we lost Bianca in a figurative spin. Mr. BLAKESLEE: Well, you\u2026 FLATOW: Go ahead, you can answer that. Mr. BLAKESLEE: Go ahead. FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. BLAKESLEE: Somatic psychotherapy? Ms. BLAKESLEE:: Yeah, go ahead. Mr. BLAKESLEE: Yeah, there's a subfield of a psychotherapy called somatic experience or somatic psychotherapy. There might be other terms, too. And this involves not just strolling through memory lane and finding intellectual reasons why something might have hurt you and stayed with you, but actually experiencing the associated sensations in your body. So when we're talking about how your (unintelligible) strange from your father, you also experience -consciously experience and attempt to the feelings in your body that attend those thoughts and\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. BLAKESLEE: \u2026the talking. And this is a more direct way in many cases, it's a good handle on those emotions and come to grips with the emotional blockage that you're experiencing your life. Ms. BLAKESLEE: There's one element in all of this we didn't talk about yet, but it's called plasticity. I'm sure that, Ira, you probably had people on your show talking about plasticity. The brain is constantly rewiring and it's just - it's a very (unintelligible) organ. And so with experiences and things like meditation or things like somatic experiencing or somatic psychology can actually change the maps, change the way the maps are organized. FLATOW: Yeah. Ms. BLAKESLEE: And so that's when - and a successful therapy is remapping. FLATOW: Yeah. You talk about a bit about that in another area. In playing video games like Nintendo and the Wii, which I have and I real like it's a wild game I find myself thinking I'm actually bowling or playing tennis or whatever. With the game you take it very seriously this cyber world? And if we really - are we remapping? Are we recreating a new and different map by uniting with the game? Mr. BLAKESLEE: Well, you're using your existing maps, but it's just amazing how much they can suck you in, isn't it? FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. BLAKESLEE: Well, one area of mapping that Sandy didn't mention in her opening was something called the (unintelligible) system. A lot of people have probably heard about this but (unintelligible) are a special set of neurons in some of your body maps that actually simulate the intentions and actions of other people as you witness them performing those actions and they also are active when you perform those same actions. So these sort of a psychic bridge between people. There's no neuroscientific evidence for telepathy, but this is pretty much as close as you can get and they're really amazing. And they're not only activated when you witness people, you know, fighting or kissing or what have you, when you simulate - when you witness those things, you simulate those things in your mind's body. But same things also happening when you are controlling an avatar in \"Second Life\" or a first person shooter in a video game or when you're (unintelligible) with the Wii. And this is one reason why you've sort of lose track of the interface and directly experience those virtual experiences. FLATOW: We have a virtual experience that everybody has had. I want to play, sort of, illustrate that, but how can it evoke - kind of evoke feelings, sounds here, and I'm playing some sounds of traffic. You're (unintelligible) in traffic. Oh, it's raining get that cab. Oh. And now, you hear cars rushing around. If you're a New Yorker or somebody's in Chicago, well, you know exactly how you feel when you hear that sound. Thank you, Charles(ph). That really sets things off, straining in your mind. Ms. BLAKESLEE: Right. Those are - that's are your auditory (unintelligible) so you have, again, a network of (unintelligible). The auditory (unintelligible) are being tickled by those sounds and it's tapping into the seeing it, feeling it, watching it, doing it, are all activated by the sound. So that if you hear crunching feet on gravel or a honking horns or the rain or anything like that, you actually can feel it, smell it, taste it, experience it, just through that one modality, just through that the hearing. It activates all the other maps. FLATOW: Another fascinating area you mentioned in your book, \"The Body Has a Mind of Its Own\" is how your weight loss, your feelings about weight loss and the actual weight loss itself can affect your body mass. Ms. BLAKESLEE: Yeah. Why your feel fat after you lose weight? FLATOW: Yeah. Ms. BLAKESLEE: It's a very, very common experience. And so this taps into another two types of body maps. One is your body schema, which is also done as proprioception. What this is, you have receptors in your joints, in your bones and your tendons, and in your muscles. And that's sending messages up to your brain of where you're located in space. So let's say you lose 30 pounds, right? And your clothes are thinner and your lighter and so on. And your proprioceptive sense actually will change because you're 30 pounds thinner and your clothes will fit differently, and that the touch on your skin from your clothes will be different. But you still feel sad. So why is that? And the reason, we argue, is that there's another body map called your body image, which is the set of beliefs you have about your body. And these are sort of developed in very often in early adolescence. By the same time that you decide what religion to be, and what political party to be, your body image coalesce. It will trump your thinner body schema, you're thinner felt body sense, because the body image is so potent. So one way to get around - and if you're trying to skip the weight off is to do things, to get more in touch with your, sort of, proprioceptive sense. One way you can do that is to work on your balance and thinks like that to tune up your felt body sense to overcome this body image that you're very much psychologically stuck with. FLATOW: Let's go to the phones. 1-800-989-8255. Nancy(ph) in Tamarack, Idaho. Hi, Nancy. NANCY (Caller): Hi there. FLATOW: Hi. NANCY: I had my 16-year-old son who, as a baby, was impossible to be around. He constantly ram into things. He (unintelligible) jaw with his head until I practically had no tongue. And about two years ago, he started ski jumping. And - well, he's a freestyle skier now. So he jumps, he does rails, he's unbelievable good at this. He has no problem whatsoever just throwing himself off a 60-foor jump. And yet he still\u2026 FLATOW: But is he - he's still (unintelligible) on the ground. NANCY: He's still a (unintelligible). (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. BLAKESLEE: That's fascinating. As a matter of fact\u2026 NANCY: He could die, of course. He's intelligent and (unintelligible)\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah. NANCY: But that, you know, he still wants him to (unintelligible) onto his mother. FLATOW: So he's created a successful body map when he can navigate very well when he's on a - up in the air as a skier. NANCY: Right. It answers the question of tweaking a different set of reacceptance. Mr. BLAKESLEE: That's hard to answer in too much detail. The question of individual variation is one the neuroscience is still lagging behind decades of looking at average human capabilities. But we all know that there are people with, you know, who are very smart or capable and talented in one area and then another area that even things pretty closely related they're hopeless or, you know, at least a lot lower than you would expect. I don't know how to answer that in detail. Ms. BLAKESLEE: Well, I have an idea. So there's two mappings. There's peripersonal space map, which is out at the end of your fingertips, and there's extrapersonal space mapping. And you can actually - when you use it - we even haven't gotten into this. This is - well, if you use a tool, if you use a rake or anything like that, it extends your body map out to the end of the tool. And skies - when he's wearing those skies, his body map is including the skies. But it's likely he could have - kind of a being clumsy, his parietal network for peripersonal space map might have low fidelity. But when he's dealing in wider spaces, out beyond his body, he might have perfectly normal extrapersonal space mapping. FLATOW: Yeah. And -Ms. BLAKESLEE: So he would have a lot of facility to move in that space outside that envelop around his body. FLATOW: Hope that works for you, Nancy. NANCY: Thanks. Bye. FLATOW: Thank you. 1-800-989-8255. We're talking about the body has a mind of its own this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. With the authors of the boos, Sandra Blakeslee and Matthew Blakeslee. And we have lots of folks on the phone, who want to talk. As you would imagine, there's a lot of information going out here. Let's go to John(ph) in - is this Skwentna, Alaska? JOHN (Caller): Oh, yes it is. FLATOW: All right. Go ahead. JOHN: First, thanks for being on the show and listen to you a lot and I really enjoy it. I have a comment and then sort of a general question. FLATOW: Well, a quick comment because we're running out of time. JOHN: Okay. I had neck surgery and then I had shoulder surgery. And the physical therapist that was working on my shoulder said, oh, you had a she was reading my aura and said, oh, you had a neck injury, and there was no way for her to know that. And, you know, I don't believe in the supernatural and I'm just wondering if that aura thing is - if you had much experience with it or other people that have had similar experiences. FLATOW: Sandy, you talk about auras a lot in the book. Ms. BLAKESLEE: Yeah. So I - in researching this, there's a whole field, the people that believe that aura reading can be taught and that auras can be read. I don't want to go there because I'm not so sure about it. But the auras I'm talking about are synesthesia - it's actually wiring in the brain that's causing the auras. And you can't imagine that; you're born that way. And there are some people that are born that way. The argument that you can teach auras I just don't know. I can't say if it's true or not. Mr. BLAKESLEE: What John's therapist might have been picking up on, though, is you know, all of your body parts and the maps that control those body and represent them in your brain are interlinked. And so as we all know, pain and sensation can be referred up and down. His physical carriage might have been altered by the first surgery and the second surgery combined in a way that you wouldn't see just one of the surgeries or injuries. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. I got a minute or two before the break. Are there cultural differences in these body maps? I mentioned at the beginning that \"Seinfeld\" moment where, you know, people get very close. In some cultures they welcome being that close. In other cultures that body map just goes nutty. Ms. BLAKESLEE: Right. So - actually, that body map at the party is more of a visual map that's been studied. Some cultures have 15-inch differences that, you know, face to face is 11 inches, 13 inches, 15 inches. I think U. S. is 17 inches. And that's been studied. But when people - so, yes, if you're born in, let's say, in an Arab country, you're going to have a closer peripersonal space mapping for face-to-face conversation. You're going to have a comfort zone that's much smaller than we have in the United States or at least for Americans. So that you - a lot of that is taught, a lot of that is learned. The Asians have very different spatial representations and spatial reasoning than Westerners. And there's a whole area of cultural anthropology right now looking at spatial mapping and that's, you know, learned. It's culturally learned. FLATOW: Is there an age, a spot in your life when that can be changed at all, or when it's being cemented? Ms. BLAKESLEE: Probably that there might be critical periods for learning this - but in - when you're learning a language, when you're learning to walk, when you're learning to run and throw balls or whether to learn a martial art or when you are child, you have a very plastic open, you know, brain for absorbing these differences. So probably you're - the plasticity stays throughout your life and you can certainly - you can move to Japan as an adult and learn Japanese aesthetics, but probably not as innately or as deeply as if you were born in Japan. FLATOW: Would they know from your walk, your gait that you're different. Ms. BLAKESLEE: Oh, yes. I had this great story. I lived in Africa, and one day, I was sitting with my husband in a - this was in Cameroon, and we were sitting in the bar and we were - this guy walked in and he was in the full regalia of Cameroonian with the, sort of, this robe and with the hat and everything. And he walked up to the bar, and his back was facing us. And we said, that's and American. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. BLAKESLEE: So we walked over to him and tapped him, and we said, where are you from? He said, damn, how did you know? His name was Marty(ph) and he was from Washington, D. C. And he looked - his face looked Cameroonian, but his walk was American, it was a complete giveaway. FLATOW: All right. Look at that. That's a good way - good place to take a short break here. We're talking with Sandra Blakeslee and Matthew Blakeslee, authors of \"The Body Has a Mind of Its Own: How Body Maps in Your Brain Help You Do (Almost) Everything Better. \" Short break. We'll come back. Talk a few more minutes. Take your questions. 1-800-989-8255. Stay with us. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. Up next this hour, we'll be continuing to talk about \"The Body Has a Mind of Its Own: How Body Maps in Your Brain Help You Do (Almost) Everything Better\" with Sandra Blakeslee and Matthew Blakeslee. A question from \"Second Life\" from Kimo(ph). He says, do animals have body maps? Mr. BLAKESLEE: Oh, absolutely, they do. The primates' body map network is a lot more sophisticated than any other order of mammals, but all mammals have these primary body maps in the neocortex. They, at least, have a primary and secondary and some of them have more sophisticated body maps for representing, you know, higher levels of action and perception. In our book, I think we actually have a section - I think at the end of chapter two where we show the proportions in some, sort of, cartoon caricatures of the body maps - the primary body maps of some other animals. FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. BLAKESLEE: So a hog has a really huge snout region with gigantic nostrils. And what's another one, the naked mole rat has these tentacles sticking out of its nose that are just gigantic, I think, about the same size as the rest of its body because they're so sensitive. FLATOW: We just have a few minutes left. So I want to talk philosophically about this whole new area of neuroscience. Where - Sandra, what do you think? You've been an observer for a while. Where do you think this is all headed? Where is it leading us to? How we view our brains differently? Ms. BLAKESLEE: Yeah, we do. We have this illusion of being a unitary self-conscious - the subjective sense and the more you, sort of, probe the brain, you realize that it's a bunch of parts and they're working together, and they're giving us this illusion of consciousness. And it's an illusion of being whole. And it really raises an - illusions of free will. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Ms. BLAKESLEE: Free will is actually - you can test the timing of the brain and your motor cortex, your motor system is planting all of the movements before you're even conscious of it. So consciousness is the last guy the block that knows what's going to happen because - and this is why brain machine interfaces work. You've probably heard about these where you have - you're able to think to move a cursor\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Right. Ms. BLAKESLEE: \u2026or to think to move a robot. And this is because they can read the motor intentions out of your brain before you're even conscious of doing it. So it raises a lot of - I think neuroscience is so much more interesting than philosophy because you can actually do experiments and its shedding light on that. Mr. BLAKESLEE: Yeah. The brain is where the rubber meets the road in terms of figuring out the mind-body connection. FLATOW: Because it make understanding\u2026 Mr. BLAKESLEE: There are thousands of years\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. BLAKESLEE: I'm sorry. FLATOW: I was going to say, there's a make-understanding consciousness that question easier or more difficult now. Mr. BLAKESLEE: Oh. You are more difficult. FLATOW: I mean, that's the - you know, you ask neuroscientists: What is consciousness, and then they throw up their hands a little bit because some of them just needs something to measure, you know. Ms. BLAKESLEE: Right. Well, there's this thing called qualia, which is the - what's called the redness of reddest. There's a deep subjective nature to experience that scientists cannot - or that neuroscience cannot answer. And that's where they throw up their arms. But you can answer the question about sub-subjective awareness more scientifically. And that's what they're moving in on. So they break the problem down away from the big C word and into its parts, and they're making a lot of progress that way. And this inner-receptive map - that Matt was talking about - this sense - this felt body sense that you have, this awareness, and it's awareness of time and it's awareness of yourself in space. That's pretty much a definition of consciousness. And the pieces of that puzzle are coming together. FLATOW: Hmm. Sandra and Matt, I want to thank you both taking time to be with us. This fascinating book, \"The Body Has a Mind of Its Own: How Body Maps in Your Brain Help You Do (Almost) Everything Better. \" A really interesting read. It will open up your mind a little to things that I think you haven't thought about. Sandra Blakeslee, Matthew Blakeslee, thanks a lot and have a great holiday weekend. Ms. BLAKESLEE: Thank you. You too. Mr. BLAKESLEE: Thanks. It's a pleasure to be on your show.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  Okay, the holiday season, you're at a party talking to someone you just met and a few minutes into the conversation, you discover he's one of those dreaded close talkers, something like you seen on \"Seinfeld. \" He leans in just a little too close, you would take a step back, he moves closer to you. Take another step back and soon, you're up against the wall there's nowhere to go. Your personal space is under siege and if it's, really, very close, it's a very uncomfortable feeling because, that's because even though you can't see a boundary around yourself, your brain knows where the space starts and stops and it, in turn, makes you react to feel like your space has been invaded.  That cocktail party scenario is just one example of the complex mapping your brain does. Whether you are a professional athlete or you're just trying to cross the street, how your brain keeps track of your body is a really complicated and amazing process. And your brain can play tricks on that space around you, too, making you believe that supernatural things are occurring, like out-of-body experiences. Do you see auras and colors? Some people do. And now, neuroscientists are just learning how these may be natural events orchestrated by your brain.  My next two guests have written a book on the topic, talking about the mysteries of your brain and the space around you.  Sandra and Matthew Blakeslee are a mother-son science writing team. Their new book is called \"The Body Has a Mind of Its Own: How Your Body Maps in Your Brain Help You Do (Almost) Anything Better. \"  Sandra Blakeslee is a frequent contributor to New York Times and she and her son join me from KANW in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Ms. SANDRA BLAKESLEE (Co-author, \"The Body Has a Mind of Its Own: How Your Body Maps in Your Brain Help You Do (Almost) Anything Better\"): Thank you.  Mr. MATTHEW BLAKESLEE (Co-author, \"The Body Has a Mind of Its Own: How Your Body Maps in Your Brain Help You Do (Almost) Anything Better\"): Nice to be here.  FLATOW: Thank you. Sandra, well tell me about your body has - your brain has body maps? What is - what are we talking about here?  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Right. So your brain actually has - your brain maps as a sprawling network of body maps, and so it's - these things happen sort of out of consciousness under the hood as it were. You have maps of your body parts, which is called your touch map. So if you touch your arm or your leg or your hip or young side of your face, there's an area in your brain that maps each limb, each finger, each toe, each part of your body. There's a motor map every time you move a hand or an arm or any part of your body that motor region controls the motor map.  You also have a spatial map. So if you put your hand out in front of you and lay it over your head, you're mapping all of every inch of space around your body. It's sort of affixed to you body and you can - your brain is keeping track of everything in that space. You're mapping your internal organs, your felt sense, you're mapping your emotional world that way. So these maps has worked in concert to give you the sense of being a unitary being, but it's kind of strange because these maps can fall apart and these maps can lead to all sorts of strange phenomena.  FLATOW: Hmm. These maps, your brain, I'm reading in your book your brain is also mapping the space that you're walking through at the same time, right?  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Correct.  FLATOW: It's creating a place you call there a place cell. There are cells called place cells in the brain that are actually keeping a storage area of what you're walking through.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Right, and this is an area - this is an area called the hypocampus, which is where memory is kind of mediated. But is also a place map. So where - when you walk through a room, it's taking - this region of your brain is mapping where you are in space. And a little further up there is an area called grid cells, which are mapping also where you are in space. So the finding is this that great athletes probably have very good grid cells and very good place cells because of the way they move around the court and the way they can ease in basketball and in football and in soccer - games like that. The brain is mapping that space constantly and people would have, could be more gifted at it if they had better parietal maps.  FLATOW: You talked about Bill Bradley, the great basketball player, later a senator from New Jersey, who could virtually see behind him almost, as if he had eyes in the back of his head because he had such great talent.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Right.  FLATOW: And that's because he was able to use these cells - these maps better than most people?  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Presumably so. And he would train and practice and practice and practice. But he had a great gift for mapping that space and the argument is if that great athletes have a better mapping system for their spatial placement of the body.  FLATOW: Matt, can you use this information to make you area better athlete now that you know that these maps and spaces in cells exists?  Mr. BLAKESLEE: Well, yes, as it turns out. So your body map network is in control of your movements and all of your skills. What we tend to call muscle memories and skill memories aren't actually in your body or in your muscles, they are distributed throughout these networks. When you practice a sport, you are finding the connections between and among these maps and improving the skill that way. But you can also do what's called imaginal practice. It's not practicing your mind's eyes so much as practicing your mind's body.  And as we detail in the book, by practicing in your mind's body, feeling the actual stress on your joints and the velocities - you don't even need to use your vision for this, in fact, sometimes it helps not to do that - you can actually improve your skills more than under sort - some circumstances, improve your skills more than you can through actual practice. By combining imaginal practice in your mind's body and real practice, you actually get much better results typically than you do just going out to the court, just practicing with your physical body.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number, we're taking calls about mapping - the maps that of your body that your brains have. I want to know - this book is fascinating. I'm talking with Sandra and Matthew Blakeslee. \"The Body Has a Mind of Its Own: How Your Body Maps in Your Brain Help You Do (Almost) Anything Better. \"  One of the truly fascinating parts of your book is the understanding that we gain from reading it about how knowing about these maps, knowing how the brain works may explain somebody's supernatural things that we think are supernatural but can actually be explained naturally - and especially people seeing colors and auras and things like that, Sandra?  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Yeah, it's very, very cool. So a lot of this work is happening in Europe but some here too. With auras, there's a condition called synesthesia, which is a mixing of the senses. And it's actually more common than most people think. But you could be born a synesthic(ph) and you can see letters that will have colors and so on. But some people have sort of an aura synesthesia they will see colors around other people, and these colors are consistent. So every - you have friend named Joan(ph), who will have blue, another friend named Joan who will have pink, and when they test these people, they're sure are not confabulating because if you test them a year later and asked them the same type of questions and they have the answers exactly the same, it's like that they're really seeing that. So that's synesthesia - out of body experience as you can induce in you. I could induce one of you pretty easily\u2026  FLATOW: Really?  Ms. BLAKESLEE: \u2026to it. Yes.  FLATOW: I dare you.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Yeah. Okay, I'll take a flight to Washington or New York? There's - well, the way with first shown was in a sort of scientist in Switzerland and he was doing some brain exploration surgery. Before you do epilepsy surgery, you put a probe in the brain and you try to find where the focus of the abnormal tissue is. This guy has caught sort of going around looking in the brain just looking for this abnormal tissue. And he turned on the electrode in a place called the right angular gyrus, it's sort of right over your ear towards the back of your head.  And the woman on the table, she just flew out of her body and she went, ah, and she was floating on the ceiling looking down, their legs floating. He turned off the electrode, she was back in her body. Turned it on, she was out. Off and back in. And he has done a bunch of patients like that. More recently, they did the same experiment but with virtual reality and they put you - let's say that you would be standing there and you would see projection of yourself about 6 feet ahead. If they run a stick or a ruler down your back and a ruler down the back of the avatar, which is this, you know, imaginal\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: \u2026picture of yourself. You will then move into that body. You will move out of your body into the avatar. And this is getting - they're getting very, very sophisticated with virtual reality and you can have - you can take and you can induce out of body experiences now with virtual reality without, you know, having to put a electrode in your head.  FLATOW: Speaking of virtual reality, we have people on \"Second Life\" who are actually congregating around SCIENCE FRIDAY's spot here.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Wait. Ah.  FLATOW: And Ovular(ph) in \"Second Life\" writes a text: Could you discuss gender differences in spatial mapping. Is there a gender difference? Matthew?  Mr. BLAKESLEE: Well, I - we don't really have very much to say about that.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Well, there is one difference. Men tend to have larger parietal lobes and women tend to have better more connections between the two hemispheres. These are basic biological findings. And so the spatial mapping for males is probably a little better than for women. But then, again, all of that stuff about male, female?  FLATOW: Yeah.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: It's all on a bell-shaped curve and you've got, you know, women who tend\u2026  Mr. BLAKESLEE: So much overlap.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Yeah. Huge amount of overlap. But there isn't - there aren't very strong differences in the way these maps are laid down. They're laid down at birth, you have sort of a scaffolding for these maps when you're born. And then as experience flows into the brain, you build up these maps, you build up motor maps and cognitive maps.  Mr. BLAKESLEE: There's some studies like I'm aware in rodents, for example. They find some gender differences like I think female rats tend to prefer using landmarks to navigate whereas males use a little bit more dead reckoning. That would be - correspond roughly to using place cells versus grid cells like we were talking about earlier. But I don't know how much they've - how far they've (unintelligible) this to people.  FLATOW: Let me see if we're going to take\u2026  Mr. BLAKESLEE: Yeah.  FLATOW: \u2026a quick call in before we have to go to the break. Let's go to Stephanie(ph) in Wenatchee, Washington. Hi, Stephanie.  STEPHANIE (Caller): Hello.  FLATOW: Hi there.  STEPHANIE: My question is, you know that's - when you have your eyes closed and someone runs their finger not touching you but it feels like someone's touching you but between your nose and eyes? What makes it happen? Do they know?  FLATOW: Good question.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Yeah. Yeah, what they do. This is your peripheral personal space map. So again, if you put your arms out in front of your body and wave them over your head and ran to the side, all of that space is mapped and you actually own that space and when people enter that space and if they try to tickle you or something like that, cells in your parietal lobe, which are mapping that space - well, it's more than one of the maps - are active. The cells are active when anything comes into that space. So you actually feel the presence of someone even with your eyes closed and this is why a healing touch is so powerful and (unintelligible) these things. It's probably not because of energy fields, but it's because of this activation of these body maps.  STEPHANIE: Oh.  Mr. BLAKESLEE: Yeah, the anticipation can actually cause a sensation in your lower, like, in your primary touch map, for example.  FLATOW: So you can watch the cells in your brain actually firing when this happens?  Mr. BLAKESLEE: Yes. That's right.  FLATOW: And then I've (unintelligible)\u2026  Ms. BLAKESLEE: They're firing away.  Mr. BLAKESLEE: Because all of these maps are interlinks, they're all influencing each other with sensations, predictions, anticipations, interpretations and\u2026  FLATOW: Wow. It's fascinating stuff. This is just some of the really fascinating stuff of the book \"The Body Has a Mind of Its Own: How Your Body Maps in Your Brain Help You Do (Almost) Anything Better. \"  My guests are Sandra Blakeslee and Matthew Blakeslee. We're going to come back, take a short break, get more into some of these really unusual consequences of the body maps. Take more of your questions, 1-800-989-8255. Find an avatar in \"Second Life\" at Science School wearing a SCIENCE FRIDAY T-shirt. We'll be right back after this short break. Don't go away.  I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking this hour about how your brain keeps track of your body and your space around you, described as a bubble around your body in the book called \"The Body Has a Mind of Its Own: How Your Body Maps in Your Brain Help You Do (Almost) Anything Better. \" Sandra Blakeslee is here with her son Matthew Blakeslee. Four generations of science writers, San?  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Yup. Good job.  FLATOW: I remember your father, Al\u2026  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Uh-huh.  FLATOW: \u2026but I don't think I ever met your grandfather.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: So Howard - yeah, Howard Blakeslee was, I think, the first or among the first science writers in the United States starting around 1920 and he founded the field and Associated Press. And Alton, my dad, followed him. And then I fell into it sideways many, many years ago and mostly, in the New York Times, I've worked for them for 40 years. And now, Matt.  Mr. BLAKESLEE: I pretty much fell into it by accident as well. I was\u2026  FLATOW: Did you want to be a science writer?  Mr. BLAKESLEE: I had never really considered it, not seriously. I was training to be a scientist and then for various reasons, I decided not to go into an academic track. I was trying to find something else to do\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. BLAKESLEE: \u2026looking at various options. And then Sandy said, why don't you try science writing and it was something kind of easy to fall into because I'd seen it all my life being done and discussed around the dinner table and everything, so I gave it a try and it's working out really well.  FLATOW: That's good because usually, that has the opposite effect. I know what my kids, they don't want to talk to all about science because I'm talking about it all the time. So it's good to see that.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Yeah, that's right.  Mr. BLAKESLEE: I didn't happen to us.  FLATOW: That's good. Let's go to Bianca(ph) in Wichita. Hi, Bianca.  BIANCA (Caller): Hi. Thanks for taking my call. So I am (unintelligible) and I'm apprentice midwife and I work in the (unintelligible) field and this has gotten my brain going, Because so often I see women who really choose to focus on visualization of their birth, have really successful, wonderful, easy laid back labors compared to women who, you know, don't really want to talk about it at all or don't want to be idealistic about the births that they want to have, have really difficult labor. Then, I just thought it seems very similar to what you're talking about sports.  FLATOW: Yeah.  BIANCA: And I want to hear your comments about that.  FLATOW: Sandy, anything?  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Well, you know, this - if you go to a sports psychologist and know how this laundry list of methods to improve your capacity to play the sport. One of them is visualization, visual imagery. What we're talking about, in this case, is motor imagery, which is different than visual imagery. Motor imagery is where you actually concentrate on the feel of the movements or of the sport. And what happens is that you increase this, literally, increase the size of the motor maps with imagery. That's only worked with motor imagery not with visual imagery. How would it apply to childbirth is a really interesting observation. And I don't know, Matt's wife is about to have her second baby in a few months so maybe, you can\u2026  Mr. BLAKESLEE: Touch true. Well, I mean, one thing about visualization, about getting in touch with your physical sensations is this taps into another bottle body mapping system that Sandy mentioned at the opening. In addition to all these maps you have of your body's musculature and skin sensations, what you'd use for voluntary volitional movement, there's this whole other track coming from your visual organs and from a separate population of receptors in your skin that gave rather to a separate region in the brain called your insula and this is a map of your heart, your lungs, your guts. This is where you have gut feelings, and in all giblets and the interior of your skin. This is where you experience pain, itch, tickle sensation, sensual touch - the kind that is shared between lovers and parents and young children.  And this is also where you experience breath and heartbeat. And in humans, it's actually interesting. This are has been evolved to a much higher level than in any other animal, even our closest friendly cousins, for experiencing social emotions, social pain as well as physical pain. Meditation thickens the insular cortex and so - I guess this (unintelligible). I think by having in touch with your experience that way - paying attention to pain and trying to own it and control it through experiencing it, that could be the way that this visualizations are helping these mothers during child birth.  AMANDA: Uh-huh.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: I'm sure you can attenuate that map that way, yeah.  FLATOW: I think you may practice your\u2026  Mr. BLAKESLEE: Yeah.  AMANDA: I'm sorry?  Mr. BLAKESLEE: Please, go ahead. It also made me think about women who have birthing who are survivors of abuse. And I'm curious\u2026  FLATOW: I guess we lost Bianca in a figurative spin.  Mr. BLAKESLEE: Well, you\u2026  FLATOW: Go ahead, you can answer that.  Mr. BLAKESLEE: Go ahead.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Mr. BLAKESLEE: Somatic psychotherapy?  Ms. BLAKESLEE:: Yeah, go ahead.  Mr. BLAKESLEE: Yeah, there's a subfield of a psychotherapy called somatic experience or somatic psychotherapy. There might be other terms, too. And this involves not just strolling through memory lane and finding intellectual reasons why something might have hurt you and stayed with you, but actually experiencing the associated sensations in your body. So when we're talking about how your (unintelligible) strange from your father, you also experience -consciously experience and attempt to the feelings in your body that attend those thoughts and\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  Mr. BLAKESLEE: \u2026the talking. And this is a more direct way in many cases, it's a good handle on those emotions and come to grips with the emotional blockage that you're experiencing your life.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: There's one element in all of this we didn't talk about yet, but it's called plasticity. I'm sure that, Ira, you probably had people on your show talking about plasticity. The brain is constantly rewiring and it's just - it's a very (unintelligible) organ. And so with experiences and things like meditation or things like somatic experiencing or somatic psychology can actually change the maps, change the way the maps are organized.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: And so that's when - and a successful therapy is remapping.  FLATOW: Yeah. You talk about a bit about that in another area. In playing video games like Nintendo and the Wii, which I have and I real like it's a wild game I find myself thinking I'm actually bowling or playing tennis or whatever. With the game you take it very seriously this cyber world? And if we really - are we remapping? Are we recreating a new and different map by uniting with the game?  Mr. BLAKESLEE: Well, you're using your existing maps, but it's just amazing how much they can suck you in, isn't it?  FLATOW: Yeah.  Mr. BLAKESLEE: Well, one area of mapping that Sandy didn't mention in her opening was something called the (unintelligible) system. A lot of people have probably heard about this but (unintelligible) are a special set of neurons in some of your body maps that actually simulate the intentions and actions of other people as you witness them performing those actions and they also are active when you perform those same actions. So these sort of a psychic bridge between people.  There's no neuroscientific evidence for telepathy, but this is pretty much as close as you can get and they're really amazing. And they're not only activated when you witness people, you know, fighting or kissing or what have you, when you simulate - when you witness those things, you simulate those things in your mind's body. But same things also happening when you are controlling an avatar in \"Second Life\" or a first person shooter in a video game or when you're (unintelligible) with the Wii. And this is one reason why you've sort of lose track of the interface and directly experience those virtual experiences.  FLATOW: We have a virtual experience that everybody has had. I want to play, sort of, illustrate that, but how can it evoke - kind of evoke feelings, sounds here, and I'm playing some sounds of traffic. You're (unintelligible) in traffic. Oh, it's raining get that cab. Oh. And now, you hear cars rushing around. If you're a New Yorker or somebody's in Chicago, well, you know exactly how you feel when you hear that sound. Thank you, Charles(ph).  That really sets things off, straining in your mind.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Right. Those are - that's are your auditory (unintelligible) so you have, again, a network of (unintelligible). The auditory (unintelligible) are being tickled by those sounds and it's tapping into the seeing it, feeling it, watching it, doing it, are all activated by the sound. So that if you hear crunching feet on gravel or a honking horns or the rain or anything like that, you actually can feel it, smell it, taste it, experience it, just through that one modality, just through that the hearing. It activates all the other maps.  FLATOW: Another fascinating area you mentioned in your book, \"The Body Has a Mind of Its Own\" is how your weight loss, your feelings about weight loss and the actual weight loss itself can affect your body mass.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Yeah. Why your feel fat after you lose weight?  FLATOW: Yeah.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: It's a very, very common experience. And so this taps into another two types of body maps. One is your body schema, which is also done as proprioception. What this is, you have receptors in your joints, in your bones and your tendons, and in your muscles. And that's sending messages up to your brain of where you're located in space. So let's say you lose 30 pounds, right? And your clothes are thinner and your lighter and so on. And your proprioceptive sense actually will change because you're 30 pounds thinner and your clothes will fit differently, and that the touch on your skin from your clothes will be different.  But you still feel sad. So why is that? And the reason, we argue, is that there's another body map called your body image, which is the set of beliefs you have about your body. And these are sort of developed in very often in early adolescence. By the same time that you decide what religion to be, and what political party to be, your body image coalesce. It will trump your thinner body schema, you're thinner felt body sense, because the body image is so potent.  So one way to get around - and if you're trying to skip the weight off is to do things, to get more in touch with your, sort of, proprioceptive sense. One way you can do that is to work on your balance and thinks like that to tune up your felt body sense to overcome this body image that you're very much psychologically stuck with.  FLATOW: Let's go to the phones. 1-800-989-8255. Nancy(ph) in Tamarack, Idaho. Hi, Nancy.  NANCY (Caller): Hi there.  FLATOW: Hi.  NANCY: I had my 16-year-old son who, as a baby, was impossible to be around. He constantly ram into things. He (unintelligible) jaw with his head until I practically had no tongue. And about two years ago, he started ski jumping. And - well, he's a freestyle skier now. So he jumps, he does rails, he's unbelievable good at this. He has no problem whatsoever just throwing himself off a 60-foor jump. And yet he still\u2026  FLATOW: But is he - he's still (unintelligible) on the ground.  NANCY: He's still a (unintelligible).  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. BLAKESLEE: That's fascinating. As a matter of fact\u2026  NANCY: He could die, of course. He's intelligent and (unintelligible)\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah.  NANCY: But that, you know, he still wants him to (unintelligible) onto his mother.  FLATOW: So he's created a successful body map when he can navigate very well when he's on a - up in the air as a skier.  NANCY: Right. It answers the question of tweaking a different set of reacceptance.  Mr. BLAKESLEE: That's hard to answer in too much detail. The question of individual variation is one the neuroscience is still lagging behind decades of looking at average human capabilities. But we all know that there are people with, you know, who are very smart or capable and talented in one area and then another area that even things pretty closely related they're hopeless or, you know, at least a lot lower than you would expect. I don't know how to answer that in detail.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Well, I have an idea. So there's two mappings. There's peripersonal space map, which is out at the end of your fingertips, and there's extrapersonal space mapping. And you can actually - when you use it - we even haven't gotten into this. This is - well, if you use a tool, if you use a rake or anything like that, it extends your body map out to the end of the tool. And skies - when he's wearing those skies, his body map is including the skies.  But it's likely he could have - kind of a being clumsy, his parietal network for peripersonal space map might have low fidelity. But when he's dealing in wider spaces, out beyond his body, he might have perfectly normal extrapersonal space mapping.  FLATOW: Yeah. And - Ms. BLAKESLEE: So he would have a lot of facility to move in that space outside that envelop around his body.  FLATOW: Hope that works for you, Nancy.  NANCY: Thanks. Bye.  FLATOW: Thank you. 1-800-989-8255. We're talking about the body has a mind of its own this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. With the authors of the boos, Sandra Blakeslee and Matthew Blakeslee. And we have lots of folks on the phone, who want to talk. As you would imagine, there's a lot of information going out here.  Let's go to John(ph) in - is this Skwentna, Alaska?  JOHN (Caller): Oh, yes it is.  FLATOW: All right. Go ahead.  JOHN: First, thanks for being on the show and listen to you a lot and I really enjoy it. I have a comment and then sort of a general question.  FLATOW: Well, a quick comment because we're running out of time.  JOHN: Okay. I had neck surgery and then I had shoulder surgery. And the physical therapist that was working on my shoulder said, oh, you had a she was reading my aura and said, oh, you had a neck injury, and there was no way for her to know that. And, you know, I don't believe in the supernatural and I'm just wondering if that aura thing is - if you had much experience with it or other people that have had similar experiences.  FLATOW: Sandy, you talk about auras a lot in the book.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Yeah. So I - in researching this, there's a whole field, the people that believe that aura reading can be taught and that auras can be read. I don't want to go there because I'm not so sure about it. But the auras I'm talking about are synesthesia - it's actually wiring in the brain that's causing the auras. And you can't imagine that; you're born that way. And there are some people that are born that way. The argument that you can teach auras I just don't know. I can't say if it's true or not.  Mr. BLAKESLEE: What John's therapist might have been picking up on, though, is you know, all of your body parts and the maps that control those body and represent them in your brain are interlinked. And so as we all know, pain and sensation can be referred up and down. His physical carriage might have been altered by the first surgery and the second surgery combined in a way that you wouldn't see just one of the surgeries or injuries.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. I got a minute or two before the break. Are there cultural differences in these body maps? I mentioned at the beginning that \"Seinfeld\" moment where, you know, people get very close. In some cultures they welcome being that close. In other cultures that body map just goes nutty.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Right. So - actually, that body map at the party is more of a visual map that's been studied. Some cultures have 15-inch differences that, you know, face to face is 11 inches, 13 inches, 15 inches. I think U. S. is 17 inches. And that's been studied. But when people - so, yes, if you're born in, let's say, in an Arab country, you're going to have a closer peripersonal space mapping for face-to-face conversation. You're going to have a comfort zone that's much smaller than we have in the United States or at least for Americans.  So that you - a lot of that is taught, a lot of that is learned. The Asians have very different spatial representations and spatial reasoning than Westerners. And there's a whole area of cultural anthropology right now looking at spatial mapping and that's, you know, learned. It's culturally learned.  FLATOW: Is there an age, a spot in your life when that can be changed at all, or when it's being cemented?  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Probably that there might be critical periods for learning this - but in - when you're learning a language, when you're learning to walk, when you're learning to run and throw balls or whether to learn a martial art or when you are child, you have a very plastic open, you know, brain for absorbing these differences. So probably you're - the plasticity stays throughout your life and you can certainly - you can move to Japan as an adult and learn Japanese aesthetics, but probably not as innately or as deeply as if you were born in Japan.  FLATOW: Would they know from your walk, your gait that you're different.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Oh, yes. I had this great story. I lived in Africa, and one day, I was sitting with my husband in a - this was in Cameroon, and we were sitting in the bar and we were - this guy walked in and he was in the full regalia of Cameroonian with the, sort of, this robe and with the hat and everything. And he walked up to the bar, and his back was facing us. And we said, that's and American.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. BLAKESLEE: So we walked over to him and tapped him, and we said, where are you from? He said, damn, how did you know? His name was Marty(ph) and he was from Washington, D. C. And he looked - his face looked Cameroonian, but his walk was American, it was a complete giveaway.  FLATOW: All right. Look at that. That's a good way - good place to take a short break here. We're talking with Sandra Blakeslee and Matthew Blakeslee, authors of \"The Body Has a Mind of Its Own: How Body Maps in Your Brain Help You Do (Almost) Everything Better. \" Short break. We'll come back. Talk a few more minutes. Take your questions. 1-800-989-8255. Stay with us.  I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  Up next this hour, we'll be continuing to talk about \"The Body Has a Mind of Its Own: How Body Maps in Your Brain Help You Do (Almost) Everything Better\" with Sandra Blakeslee and Matthew Blakeslee.  A question from \"Second Life\" from Kimo(ph). He says, do animals have body maps?  Mr. BLAKESLEE: Oh, absolutely, they do. The primates' body map network is a lot more sophisticated than any other order of mammals, but all mammals have these primary body maps in the neocortex. They, at least, have a primary and secondary and some of them have more sophisticated body maps for representing, you know, higher levels of action and perception.  In our book, I think we actually have a section - I think at the end of chapter two where we show the proportions in some, sort of, cartoon caricatures of the body maps - the primary body maps of some other animals.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Mr. BLAKESLEE: So a hog has a really huge snout region with gigantic nostrils. And what's another one, the naked mole rat has these tentacles sticking out of its nose that are just gigantic, I think, about the same size as the rest of its body because they're so sensitive.  FLATOW: We just have a few minutes left. So I want to talk philosophically about this whole new area of neuroscience. Where - Sandra, what do you think? You've been an observer for a while. Where do you think this is all headed? Where is it leading us to? How we view our brains differently?  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Yeah, we do. We have this illusion of being a unitary self-conscious - the subjective sense and the more you, sort of, probe the brain, you realize that it's a bunch of parts and they're working together, and they're giving us this illusion of consciousness. And it's an illusion of being whole. And it really raises an - illusions of free will.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Free will is actually - you can test the timing of the brain and your motor cortex, your motor system is planting all of the movements before you're even conscious of it. So consciousness is the last guy the block that knows what's going to happen because - and this is why brain machine interfaces work. You've probably heard about these where you have - you're able to think to move a cursor\u2026  FLATOW: Right. Right.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: \u2026or to think to move a robot. And this is because they can read the motor intentions out of your brain before you're even conscious of doing it. So it raises a lot of - I think neuroscience is so much more interesting than philosophy because you can actually do experiments and its shedding light on that.  Mr. BLAKESLEE: Yeah. The brain is where the rubber meets the road in terms of figuring out the mind-body connection.  FLATOW: Because it make understanding\u2026  Mr. BLAKESLEE: There are thousands of years\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah.  Mr. BLAKESLEE: I'm sorry.  FLATOW: I was going to say, there's a make-understanding consciousness that question easier or more difficult now.  Mr. BLAKESLEE: Oh. You are more difficult.  FLATOW: I mean, that's the - you know, you ask neuroscientists: What is consciousness, and then they throw up their hands a little bit because some of them just needs something to measure, you know.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Right. Well, there's this thing called qualia, which is the - what's called the redness of reddest. There's a deep subjective nature to experience that scientists cannot - or that neuroscience cannot answer. And that's where they throw up their arms. But you can answer the question about sub-subjective awareness more scientifically. And that's what they're moving in on. So they break the problem down away from the big C word and into its parts, and they're making a lot of progress that way. And this inner-receptive map - that Matt was talking about - this sense - this felt body sense that you have, this awareness, and it's awareness of time and it's awareness of yourself in space. That's pretty much a definition of consciousness. And the pieces of that puzzle are coming together.  FLATOW: Hmm. Sandra and Matt, I want to thank you both taking time to be with us. This fascinating book, \"The Body Has a Mind of Its Own: How Body Maps in Your Brain Help You Do (Almost) Everything Better. \" A really interesting read. It will open up your mind a little to things that I think you haven't thought about.  Sandra Blakeslee, Matthew Blakeslee, thanks a lot and have a great holiday weekend.  Ms. BLAKESLEE: Thank you. You too.  Mr. BLAKESLEE: Thanks. It's a pleasure to be on your show. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2007 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He may just end up saving your life. Paul Sucher experienced that firsthand shortly after Jamie Howard showed up at his home in Twin Falls, Idaho. Both men came by at our studio to share their story. ALISON STEWART, host: Jamie, when you first rang the bell, what was your plan that day? Mr. JAMIE HOWARD (Salesman, Kirby Company): Obviously, I work for Kirby, Scott Fetzer Corporation. My job is to sell vacuums. That's how I get paid. So initially, you offer to clean the carpet for free\u2026 STEWART: Uh-huh. Mr. HOWARD: \u2026in hopes that after seeing the product, they choose to buy one. So initially, of course, you go in or attempting to make money. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. HOWARD: I hadn't actually met Paul yet. Paul was not home. I met his girlfriend, Andi, who actually works at City Financial there in Twin Falls, Idaho. After speaking with her and finding out that they couldn't afford a Kirby because of medical reasons, I got inquisitive and just asked why. And she told me that Paul had been on dialysis for almost three years. His kidneys have completely failed and he was dying. I mean, that's what happens. I got a little more, you know, in depth and asked why haven't they found him a donor. I didn't know anything about it. I didn't know how the process worked. I didn't know what anything was. And she explained to me there's a list of over 500 people waiting for what's called a cadaver donor, which means, unfortunately, somebody has to die. STEWART: But they were an organ donor and then\u2026 Mr. HOWARD: Right. And they keep their body alive\u2026 STEWART: Sure. Mr. HOWARD: \u2026because they're brain-dead. And then they harvest the organs so that other people could, you know, prolong their life. Well, he was - unfortunately, so far down on the list that the reality was after hearing the whole thing was that he probably didn't have the time to be on the list long enough to get one. STEWART: Which is really interesting because you guys are both in your mid-30s, right? Mr. HOWARD: Thirty-five a piece(ph), yes, correct. STEWART: So Paul, when did you first fall ill? When did you discover you had this issue with your kidneys? Mr. PAUL SUCHER: Approximately three years ago. STEWART: What happened? You were just not feeling well? Mr. SUCHER: You really don't know what's going on. You just become extremely fatigued. You get ill. You think it's going to go away like when you get anything like common cold or the flu, and you delay going to see the doctor. And finally, when you get sick enough, you go in and they just tested my blood and said you had full renal failure. Your kidneys aren't working. And that's why you're sick. And at that point, they put you on emergency dialysis and you spend some time in intensive care. You know, they get you going and treated again and you're able to live on dialysis. And then you try to get medically and financially qualified to get on a transplant list at some center. And we went through that for about a year, and I eventually became qualified and I sat on that list for a couple of years until Jamie came along. STEWART: So what were you thinking when you realized, gosh, time is just passing and passing and passing, and I'm not getting this phone call about getting a kidney? Mr. SUCHER: You know, it's just kind of a mental thing. You just got to fight your way through it and go to work everyday and try to get through life even though you're sick. And hopefully, someday, something happens and they move you up the list. Fortunately, Jamie came along and I got a live donor, which I would encourage for anybody because that's really the way to go. It's the only way to get one quickly. STEWART: I would say Jamie, you're a live one. Definitely. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. HOWARD: Thank you. Mr. SUCHER: Yes. SMITH: So how did the conversation actually start when you were thinking that you might be able to give your kidney? Mr. HOWARD: Actually, after talking to Andi, like I said, when I got into it a little deeper, she told me that he was O-positive. Believe it or not, O-positive is actually a very common blood type. The problem with O-positive, though, is they're universal donor but they can only receive O-positive, which means any other blood type can get an organ from anybody else. O-positive people can only get an O-positive organ. When she told me that, I was, like, okay, I'm O-positive. And, I mean, she just asked. I mean, this is her, you know, life partner. STEWART: Sure. Mr. HOWARD: This is her husband. I mean, five years, six years, kids. I mean, they share kids together between two families or mixed families. So - I mean, Paul has five kids, two of his own, and, you know, three of hers. And so it came down to - she just asked. Would you consider being tested? And I was, like, well, you know, I'm making small talk at this point, you know. Someone have to think about, you know, but, all right. So you're not buying the vacuum. Okay, I'm going to go outside now, you know? Not my normal job. When I got outside, I got to thinking about it. I'm 35. Paul's 35. If I was in his position, and I have three kids of my own, a wife, and I was - I didn't have a future. I was - every day was the next day. Okay. Am I going to wake up tomorrow? I thought about it and I'm, like, if I have the opportunity to help somebody, I have to take it. So I called my wife, first and foremost. She's the biggest part of my life, other than my kids. And then I called my father who is a doctor in Idaho Falls and has personally started four nonprofit organizations over the years. So I've been around giving my whole life. Asked their opinion and then, of course, I prayed. And after praying, I - my older sister is like my guardian angel. She passed away. I had a complete calm feeling. And I just knew that I was what I was supposed to do. So within 15 minutes of meeting Andi, I hadn't met Paul yet, I went in and told her, if there's any way that I can help, I would be glad to. Because you have to understand, even though I went through the massive amount of tests, you still may not match. There could be\u2026 STEWART: Sure. Mr. HOWARD: \u2026things wrong with you. There could be things wrong with your proteins in your kidney. And it may not have worked. At that point, she called Paul and said, Paul, you might want to come home. There's a gentleman here that is willing to help if he can. So Paul came home. I met Paul. And you just met Paul. So after meeting Paul, you have to understand, Paul has a very large presence. Even though he was, you know, technically, in your death, most people at his stage of kidney failure are already on disability, full disability. Yet Paul would go to dialysis three times a week at four in the morning, then go home, change, shower, and go to work in order to support his family. And after, you know, meeting Paul, I was, like, there's no way that I could walk away from this and not try. So I met him on a Saturday. That Monday, I was in the hospital, started - we haven't started the test and miraculously, 90 days later, I was almost the perfect match. And we went to Denver, Colorado, the University of Denver, Colorado - which was awesome; they were great to us -transplant center, and we both laid on the table next to each other, and the outcome is perfect because he's healthy. STEWART: When you walked in, Paul, and you told medical authorities, hey, I have a living donor here, do they meet you with any skepticism, like, are you paying this guy? Mr. SUCHER: Very much so. STEWART: Do you have to buy 500 vacuums from him? Mr. SUCHER: Very much so. We actually had to fight them over that. They were very skeptical. They're not used to goodwill donor stepping forward, or unrelated like that. Most of them are brothers or sisters or parents and they proceed forward. The other problem with it is there, you know, there's 500 people just on that list at Denver. That's just the University of Colorado. So their backlog, their workload is really heavy. So you basically just become part of the system and they kind of push you through. STEWART: Paul, did you ever buy that vacuum cleaner? Mr. SUCHER: No, I did not. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. SUCHER: I think I can get a new vacuum cleaner. Mr. HOWARD: Actually, they have a Kirby. It's an older model. They have a Kirby. So, you know, it was an attempt to upgrade them. But it's not about the vacuum anymore. And that's the ongoing joke now with all, you know, everything that we've talked about. SMITH: You're a better donor than a salesman. Mr. HOWARD: Yeah, I got sold. (Soundbite of laughter) STEWART: Jamie Howard and Paul Sucher, thanks for joining us and good luck to both of you. Mr. HOWARD: Thank you. STEWART: I was so glad when you asked that question about whether he bought the vacuum. SMITH: That's the news reporter in me. (Soundbite of laughter) SMITH: I want to hear the facts. I don't want to just hear the heartwarming story. Coming up next, new music for the new year, our music guide Andy Langer is here to give us a heads up on good tunes coming our way in 2008. STEWART: This is THE BRYANT PARK PROJECT from NPR News. Do you like the heartwarming stuff, too? SMITH: I do. I do admit it. STEWART: Don't get all hard on me.  ROBERT SMITH, host:  And now, the best reason I've ever come across not to slam the door shut when a traveling salesman rings your bell. He may just end up saving your life.

STEWART: Which is really interesting because you guys are both in your mid-30s, right?  Mr. HOWARD: Thirty-five a piece(ph), yes, correct.  STEWART: So Paul, when did you first fall ill? When did you discover you had this issue with your kidneys?  Mr. PAUL SUCHER: Approximately three years ago.  STEWART: What happened? You were just not feeling well?  Mr. SUCHER: You really don't know what's going on. You just become extremely fatigued. You get ill. You think it's going to go away like when you get anything like common cold or the flu, and you delay going to see the doctor. And finally, when you get sick enough, you go in and they just tested my blood and said you had full renal failure. Your kidneys aren't working. And that's why you're sick. And at that point, they put you on emergency dialysis and you spend some time in intensive care. You know, they get you going and treated again and you're able to live on dialysis. And then you try to get medically and financially qualified to get on a transplant list at some center. And we went through that for about a year, and I eventually became qualified and I sat on that list for a couple of years until Jamie came along.  STEWART: So what were you thinking when you realized, gosh, time is just passing and passing and passing, and I'm not getting this phone call about getting a kidney?  Mr. SUCHER: You know, it's just kind of a mental thing. You just got to fight your way through it and go to work everyday and try to get through life even though you're sick. And hopefully, someday, something happens and they move you up the list. Fortunately, Jamie came along and I got a live donor, which I would encourage for anybody because that's really the way to go. It's the only way to get one quickly.  STEWART: I would say Jamie, you're a live one. Definitely.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. HOWARD: Thank you.  Mr. SUCHER: Yes.  SMITH: So how did the conversation actually start when you were thinking that you might be able to give your kidney?  Mr. HOWARD: Actually, after talking to Andi, like I said, when I got into it a little deeper, she told me that he was O-positive. Believe it or not, O-positive is actually a very common blood type. The problem with O-positive, though, is they're universal donor but they can only receive O-positive, which means any other blood type can get an organ from anybody else. O-positive people can only get an O-positive organ.  When she told me that, I was, like, okay, I'm O-positive. And, I mean, she just asked. I mean, this is her, you know, life partner.  STEWART: Sure.  Mr. HOWARD: This is her husband. I mean, five years, six years, kids. I mean, they share kids together between two families or mixed families. So - I mean, Paul has five kids, two of his own, and, you know, three of hers. And so it came down to - she just asked. Would you consider being tested? And I was, like, well, you know, I'm making small talk at this point, you know. Someone have to think about, you know, but, all right. So you're not buying the vacuum. Okay, I'm going to go outside now, you know? Not my normal job.  When I got outside, I got to thinking about it. I'm 35. Paul's 35. If I was in his position, and I have three kids of my own, a wife, and I was - I didn't have a future. I was - every day was the next day. Okay. Am I going to wake up tomorrow? I thought about it and I'm, like, if I have the opportunity to help somebody, I have to take it. So I called my wife, first and foremost. She's the biggest part of my life, other than my kids. And then I called my father who is a doctor in Idaho Falls and has personally started four nonprofit organizations over the years. So I've been around giving my whole life. Asked their opinion and then, of course, I prayed.  And after praying, I - my older sister is like my guardian angel. She passed away. I had a complete calm feeling. And I just knew that I was what I was supposed to do. So within 15 minutes of meeting Andi, I hadn't met Paul yet, I went in and told her, if there's any way that I can help, I would be glad to. Because you have to understand, even though I went through the massive amount of tests, you still may not match. There could be\u2026  STEWART: Sure.  Mr. HOWARD: \u2026things wrong with you. There could be things wrong with your proteins in your kidney. And it may not have worked. At that point, she called Paul and said, Paul, you might want to come home. There's a gentleman here that is willing to help if he can. So Paul came home. I met Paul. And you just met Paul. So after meeting Paul, you have to understand, Paul has a very large presence. Even though he was, you know, technically, in your death, most people at his stage of kidney failure are already on disability, full disability. Yet Paul would go to dialysis three times a week at four in the morning, then go home, change, shower, and go to work in order to support his family.  And after, you know, meeting Paul, I was, like, there's no way that I could walk away from this and not try. So I met him on a Saturday. That Monday, I was in the hospital, started - we haven't started the test and miraculously, 90 days later, I was almost the perfect match. And we went to Denver, Colorado, the University of Denver, Colorado - which was awesome; they were great to us -transplant center, and we both laid on the table next to each other, and the outcome is perfect because he's healthy.  STEWART: When you walked in, Paul, and you told medical authorities, hey, I have a living donor here, do they meet you with any skepticism, like, are you paying this guy?  Mr. SUCHER: Very much so.  STEWART: Do you have to buy 500 vacuums from him?  Mr. SUCHER: Very much so. We actually had to fight them over that. They were very skeptical. They're not used to goodwill donor stepping forward, or unrelated like that. Most of them are brothers or sisters or parents and they proceed forward. The other problem with it is there, you know, there's 500 people just on that list at Denver. That's just the University of Colorado. So their backlog, their workload is really heavy. So you basically just become part of the system and they kind of push you through.  STEWART: Paul, did you ever buy that vacuum cleaner?  Mr. SUCHER: No, I did not.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. SUCHER: I think I can get a new vacuum cleaner.  Mr. HOWARD: Actually, they have a Kirby. It's an older model. They have a Kirby. So, you know, it was an attempt to upgrade them. But it's not about the vacuum anymore. And that's the ongoing joke now with all, you know, everything that we've talked about.  SMITH: You're a better donor than a salesman.  Mr. HOWARD: Yeah, I got sold.  (Soundbite of laughter)  STEWART: Jamie Howard and Paul Sucher, thanks for joining us and good luck to both of you.  Mr. HOWARD: Thank you.  STEWART: I was so glad when you asked that question about whether he bought the vacuum.  SMITH: That's the news reporter in me.  (Soundbite of laughter)  SMITH: I want to hear the facts. I don't want to just hear the heartwarming story.  Coming up next, new music for the new year, our music guide Andy Langer is here to give us a heads up on good tunes coming our way in 2008.  STEWART: This is THE BRYANT PARK PROJECT from NPR News.  Do you like the heartwarming stuff, too?  SMITH: I do. I do admit it.  STEWART: Don't get all hard on me. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2007 NPR.  All rights reserved.
